563,2018-01-08,Mahindra Mahindra,"Varroc Engineering, an auto components firm backed by Tata Opportunities Fund, is said to have appointed Kotak Mahindra Capital and Credit Suisse to manage the IPO

Mumbai: Tata Opportunities Fund-backed auto components maker Varroc Engineering Ltd plans to go public and has hired investment banks to advise it on the share sale, said two people aware of the development. 
Mumbai: Tata Opportunities Fund-backed auto components maker Varroc Engineering Ltd plans to go public and has hired investment banks to advise it on the share sale, said two people aware of the development.
Founded in 1990, Aurangabad-based Varroc supplies exterior lighting systems, power trains, electrical and electronic parts, and body and chassis parts to passenger car and motorcycle makers in India and abroad.
“Varroc had been in talks for an initial public offering (IPO) for a while and they have appointed investment banks Kotak Mahindra Capital and Credit Suisse to manage their initial share sale. They plan to soon file their draft red herring prospectus with an eye on going public sometime this year,"" said one of the two people cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to the media.
According to the second person, the proposed IPO could be a mix of a primary fund raising and a secondary share sale.
“Tata Opportunities Fund is likely to sell part of its stake through the IPO, while the company will look to raise funds to invest in the business. The exact quantum of these are yet to be finalized,"" he said. He too requested anonymity.
Tata Opportunities Fund invested Rs300 crore in Varroc in 2014. It holds a significant minority stake in the company.
Credit Suisse declined to comment on the development. An email sent to Kotak Mahindra Capital did not elicit any response. “The company is not in a position to comment on the queries,"" said a spokesperson for Varroc Engineering in an email response to queries from Mint.
The Varroc group has 37 manufacturing facilities, 12 engineering centres, 13,500 employees and 760 engineering experts in 10 countries, according to the company’s website. Varroc claims to be the number one two-wheeler automotive component supplier in India.
According to the company’s filings with the registrar of companies (RoC), Varroc had consolidated revenue of Rs8,372.5 crore in the financial year 2015-16, up from Rs7,021.8 crore in the previous year. In 2015-16, Varroc earned a consolidated profit of Rs245.5 crore, down from a profit of Rs303.8 crore in the previous year.
Varroc derives almost 39% of its revenue from the North American market, while India and Europe contribute around 30% and 23% respectively, data from the company’s filings show.
Varroc’s plans to go public follow a record year of fund-raising. In 2017, 36 companies raised Rs67,147 crore through the IPO route, while in 2016, 26 companies raised Rs26,493.8 crore through IPOs. Varroc is not the only auto component maker that is planning to tap the buoyant IPO market.
Last month, auto component manufacturer Sandhar Technologies Ltd filed its draft papers with market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to raise Rs300 crore through an IPO. Apart from a fresh issue of equity shares worth Rs300 crore, the public offering comprises of an offer for sale of 8 million shares by private equity firm GTI Capital."
562,2018-01-11,Mahindra Mahindra,"World Bank arm looks to lend $140 million to Actis, $150 million to Acme Group and $150 million to Mahindra Renewables

The World Bank’s International Finance Corp (IFC) will provide $440 million in debt to Mahindra Renewables Pvt. Ltd, Acme Group and global private equity fund Actis Llp to build the Rewa solar park in Madhya Pradesh. 
The World Bank’s International Finance Corp (IFC) will provide $440 million in debt to Mahindra Renewables Pvt. Ltd, Acme Group and global private equity fund Actis Llp to build the Rewa solar park in Madhya Pradesh.
India’s solar power sector turned a corner after the record low winning bids of Rs2.97 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to build the 750 megawatt (MW) plant at Rewa in Madhya Pradesh in February. With an effective levelized tariff—the average of different annual tariffs over the 25-year period of the power purchase agreement—of around Rs3.30 per unit, power from the sun became a competitive energy source vis-à-vis coal-fuelled conventional electricity.
The Rewa project is to be commissioned in December 2018. 
In the auction in February last year, which discovered the lowest ever tariff until then, three 250MW projects were awarded to Mahindra Renewables Pvt. Ltd, Acme Solar Holdings Pvt. Ltd and Actis LLP’s Solenergi Power Pvt. Ltd. The bids were called by Rewa Ultra Mega Power Ltd, a joint venture of Solar Energy Corp. of India Ltd (SECI) and Madhya Pradesh Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd (MPUVNL). 
Later, India’s solar power tariff hit a new low of Rs2.44 per unit in May at the Bhadla solar park in Rajasthan.
Of the $440 million debt, while IFC has inked the deal with Actis for $140 million, a $150 million loan for Acme Group has been approved by its board. IFC plans to seek board approval for $150 million to Mahindra Renewables.
“It’s all debt. It’s the entire debt requirement for all the three projects, of which the Actis one has been signed. So, we have signed the agreement for Actis. For the other two, they are in the process,"" said Shalabh Tandon, India lead for infrastructure and climate business at IFC.
While spokespersons for Acme Group and Actis declined to comment, a Mahindra Renewables spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to queries emailed on Wednesday evening.
Around 23% of energy from the Rewa solar park will be sold to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (DMRC) and is expected to meet about 80% of its daytime energy requirement when the project starts supplying electricity. 
The Rewa project is also India’s first solar project to conduct inter-state sale of electricity with its power purchase agreement accepted by the Union government as a standard model to help achieve the lowest electricity tariff rates through competitive bidding.
Tandon said Rewa signalled the first such bid on a large scale for India and marked the downward spiral in a game changing trend. 
Post the bids, the conversation also moved from subsidy or the viability gap funding being used to help bring the tariffs down, as pointed out by Manu Shrivastava, managing director, MPUVNL in an interview to Mint. 
“And that made grid parity possible based on this project and paved the way for future bids also around the same ballpark,"" Tandon said.
India plans to generate 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy by 2022. Of this, 100GW is to come from solar projects."

Davos: Pitching for a nuanced message at the World Economic Forum (WEF) to present India as an open economy which cares for interest of domestic as well as global audience, Kotak Mahindra Bank managing director Uday Kotak on Monday said the country needs to position itself as a statesman and not just a salesman.
Kotak, who is at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, said it is a very big opportunity for the country to demonstrate the new India that is being built. “Also, we must understand that following our prime minister, US President Donald Trump is also coming to Davos with his ‘America First’ policy and he is coming after cutting corporate tax rates and after making big corporates bring back jobs and profits to America,"" Kotak told PTI in an interview.
“Therefore, we need to get our messaging right when Trump is likely to talk about how Americans are making America great again. So India needs to say here that we are welcoming the world and we are building a new India,"" he said.
Kotak, who set up one of India’s most successful new age banks and has been expanding it into a major financial sector conglomerate including through acquisitions, said Davos is a big opportunity for India this year and “India needs to position itself in a statesman position and not in a salesman position here"".
Referring to Chinese Premier Xi Jinping’s opening plenary address last year at Davos, he said, China took a position last year that it was an open platform for the world economy. America is now championing America First, so India needs to position itself uniquely, he said.
“We need to tell the world we are an open economy but at the same time India has aspirations to build a new India. We need to articulate that we need the world’s investments but at the terms that make sense to us and to everybody else,"" he said on expectations from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s opening plenary on Tuesday.
“We need to give a message that is nuanced between where Trump is likely to position himself and where China positioned itself last year. India is no longer a salesman to the world and we need to position ourselves as the statesman now,"" he said.
Kotak said the government leaders and chief executives from India need to brand and market the country’s great story at Davos while understanding the subtle difference between sales and marketing. “I’m sure our prime minister is the best person in presenting a great branding of India and in marketing our success story,"" he said.

Mumbai: Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Ltd (Mahindra Finance) on Wednesday posted a consolidated net profit of Rs365 crore during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as against a net profit of Rs12 crore during the corresponding period last year. The sharp growth in profit was led by improvement in rural cash flows and a consequent drop in loan provisions and write-offs. 
Mumbai: Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Ltd (Mahindra Finance) on Wednesday posted a consolidated net profit of Rs365 crore during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as against a net profit of Rs12 crore during the corresponding period last year. The sharp growth in profit was led by improvement in rural cash flows and a consequent drop in loan provisions and write-offs.
The non-banking financial company’s (NBFC) loan provisions and write-offs fell to Rs223 crore during the quarter from Rs442 crore a year ago. Its consolidated total income rose 26% to Rs2,195 crore from Rs1,748 crore.
Commenting on the decline in provisions, Ramesh Iyer, vice-chairman and managing director at Mahindra Finance said, “In the last couple of quarters there has been a flattening of NPA (non-performing assets) growth as farm cash flows have seen an improvement on the back of good monsoons. Both farm and infrastructure-linked cash flows have improved for us in the rural areas. Several accounts designated as NPAs have also started showing improvement as many of them were not intentional defaults. ""
Iyer added that recoveries from past accounts that had been provided for are improving. “On a nine-month basis, the collection efficiency has gone up by around 5% from last year and stands at around 93%. On a quarterly basis, the recoveries are close to 96%,"" he said.
The firm moved to a 90-day NPA recognition norm during the quarter and its gross NPA ratio stood at 11.6% during the quarter. “Fifty-seven percent of the NPA contracts registered movement of instalment during the period although they have not become standard. This is a clear trend showing reversal of past provisions,"" Iyer said."

551,2018-01-30,Mahindra Mahindra,"Tech Mahindra's earnings before interest and tax margins increased 1.8 percentage points sequentially to 12.8%, significantly ahead of Street estimates

Tech Mahindra Ltd’s shares have done rather well in the past year despite an unexpected hit to its profitability in the fourth quarter (Q4) of FY17. As the company embarked on a cost rationalization exercise to salvage the situation, the stock gained 29% over the last one year. The December quarter (Q3) results should help support this optimism. 
Tech Mahindra Ltd’s shares have done rather well in the past year despite an unexpected hit to its profitability in the fourth quarter (Q4) of FY17. As the company embarked on a cost rationalization exercise to salvage the situation, the stock gained 29% over the last one year. The December quarter (Q3) results should help support this optimism.
The company has seen a sharp recovery in profitability. Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin increased 1.8 percentage points sequentially to 12.8%, significantly ahead of Street estimates. Margins are now back to pre-March 2017 levels (see chart).
According to Milind Kulkarni, chief financial officer at Tech Mahindra, three factors helped the company report a better margin. One is the improvement in the utilization level, which rose from 81% in Q2 to a record 83%. Another is the improvement in performance of the firms it acquired some time ago. The third reason is the reduction in low- yield business. What’s more, Kulkarni expects the trajectory in margin improvement to sustain. The company plans to continue discarding low-yield business and to use automation to further optimize employee utilization levels.
Another set of reasons for investor optimism comes from the management commentary. Kulkarni dubs the current demand environment to be materially better than a year ago, in line with the commentary given by the company’s larger peers, although different from their business performance in the just concluded quarter.
The mainstay communications business, which generates about 42% of Tech Mahindra’s revenue, remains sluggish, barely seeing any growth. But thanks to better performance in other business verticals, notably technology, the overall sequential revenue growth in US dollar terms stood at 2.5% in Q3. Kulkarni expects the communications vertical to recover this year, which should push up overall growth rates.
If indeed the improvement in profitability continues, then the stock can rerate, says Sanjeev Hota, analyst at Sharekhan Ltd. While the commentary should please investors, one factor investors need to be wary of is employee reduction.
As an analyst with a domestic broking firm points out, the headcount of software professionals is now down a good 10% from the March quarter. The sharp drop can impact the company in two ways. One is employee morale, the other being cost. If the business environment has to improve as projected, Tech Mahindra may have to pay a premium to scale up its employee base, says the analyst. 
Tech Mahindra’s Kulkarni, on the other hand, says headcount has no direct correlation to the revenue growth trajectory because of automation and other changes. The ramp-up in headcount may lag, but scaling up should not be a problem, he avers.
While one cannot accurately analyse this risk now, Tech Mahindra investors would do well to keep a watch on this trade-off, if any."

Mumbai:Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, the world’s largest tractor maker, on Tuesday said it has acquired a 26% stake in Mitra Agro Equipment Pvt. Ltd, a manufacturer of agricultural sprayers, in an all-cash transaction valued at Rs8 crore. 
Mumbai:Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, the world’s largest tractor maker, on Tuesday said it has acquired a 26% stake in Mitra Agro Equipment Pvt. Ltd, a manufacturer of agricultural sprayers, in an all-cash transaction valued at Rs8 crore.
In a stock exchange filing, Mahindra said the Nashik-based company had posted revenues of Rs14 crore for the fiscal 2017, with a presence in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. 
Incorporated in April 2012 by Devneet Bajaj, Mitra will help Mahindra venture into horticulture applications, a new segment for the Mumbai-based conglomerate. Mitra manufactures sprayers to aid the growth of certain fruits such as grapes, pomegranates and mangoes.
“In combination with Mahindra’s tractors, the partnership with Mitra will enhance Mahindra’s presence in the farm implements space,"" said Rajesh Jejurikar, president of the farm equipment sector at Mahindra. 
At present, the farm equipment sector contributes one out of every three rupees that Mahindra earns. The sector has been buoying growth for the company even as the automotive segment has witnessed a downturn in the past few quarters. 
The investment will enable Mitra to “scale up operations across India and in relevant export markets,"" Bajaj said."
547,2018-01-31,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra plans to start a business that will operate electric cabs and turn Mahindra Electric into a parts supplier for other electric vehicle makers

Mumbai: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd plans to start a business that will operate a fleet of electric cabs and turn its electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing unit into a supplier of parts to EV makers. 
Mumbai: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd plans to start a business that will operate a fleet of electric cabs and turn its electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing unit into a supplier of parts to EV makers.
India’s largest maker of EVs plans to turn its unit Mahindra Electric Mobility Ltd, which makes the e20Plus electric car, into a supplier of batteries, starter motors, power electronics and transmission to its parent and other vehicle makers.
“We have a different model for Mahindra Electric now, which (the company) is now a provider of electric kits and not a maker of Mahindra electric vehicles,"" Pawan Goenka, the 63-year-old managing director of Mumbai-based Mahindra, said in an interview. 
“So, it is like Intel Inside. In a way, Mahindra has two electric vehicle businesses—one is to make electric vehicle kits that is Mahindra Electric, and the other is about selling electric vehicles, which is Mahindra & Mahindra,"" Goenka added.
“And if we get into mobility service, that will be the third business,"" he said, adding the electric cab services business is likely to be named Mahindra Mobility Services. 
As the momentum in favour of vehicles running on green technologies such as electricity gathers pace, the traditional business models of the automotive industry are expected to change. 
Mint on 17 January reported that India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is looking for lithium suppliers for a battery plant in Gujarat, planning to build a brand new electric car for India and working with its dealers to set up vehicle charging networks as part of its initiative to build an electric car business portfolio.
The Indian government has been categorical about promoting fully electric vehicles, and has substantially increased taxes on mild, full and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The government has stated its intent to move to an all-electric fleet by 2030.
“Our main objective is to sell more and more electric vehicles,"" Goenka said.
Mahindra’s mobility service business will not be similar to that of cab-hailing services run by Ola (owned by ANI Technologies) and Uber Inc.
“That is not something Mahindra would get in, as that is the business that requires 8-10 years gestation before you start seeing financial returns,"" Goenka said.
“When you are looking at fleet operations, it is best to continue to work with service providers or we should also become a service provider. Right now, we have not ruled it out. We have not made a decision. But, we obviously are not going to be captive... in a sense that electric vehicles may not just be used by a Mahindra service provider company. We need to be potentially catering to all service providers in this field,"" he explained.
The aim is to demonstrate that it is a good business to get into, something like what Lithium, run by Bangalore-based Urban Technologies, does, Goenka said. 
Lithium procures Mahindra’s electric cars and caters to the mobility needs of corporate customers. 
Goenka’s confidence in the mobility service as a business stems from his company’s pilot projects which have been running in a few cities, including Nagpur.
“We have run 1.8 million km in six months. Feedback from drivers and customers is very positive. But, it has taken a long time to get charging stations put in. I think even now, we have only about eight and we needed about 20 to ramp up further,"" Goenka said, highlighting the need for a rapid build-out of charging infrastructure, the lack of which is hobbling the growth of the EV industry."

Bengaluru: Mahindra Happinest Developers Ltd (MHDL), a joint venture between Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd and HDFC Capital Advisors Ltd, will launch its first affordable housing project at Palghar, near Mumbai in February, with homes priced at Rs8 lakh and above, a top company executive said.  
Bengaluru: Mahindra Happinest Developers Ltd (MHDL), a joint venture between Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd and HDFC Capital Advisors Ltd, will launch its first affordable housing project at Palghar, near Mumbai in February, with homes priced at Rs8 lakh and above, a top company executive said. 
In the first phase of the project, there will be 850 units across nine acres. Entry price for a one-room kitchen home is around Rs8 lakh, which goes up to Rs20 lakh for a two-bedroom home. 
After half of the homes in the first phase are sold, the company will launch a second phase over another 10-11 acres.
Mahindra Lifespace, the real estate arm of Mahindra Group, partnered with HDFC Capital last year to jointly invest Rs500 crore over the next three years to develop affordable housing projects across cities.
The plan is to build a pipeline of projects of around 7-8 million sq. ft in the next couple of years under the HDFC platform.
“We want to focus on Mumbai and Pune for now, and then look at Bangalore and Haryana. We are scouting for land parcels and the biggest priority today is finding the right location, with good connectivity because we are looking at end users for our projects,"" Anita Arjundas, managing director and CEO, Mahindra Lifespace Developers said over the phone.
“We are building homes at sub-Rs3,000 per sq ft, but we may go up to Rs5,000 per sq ft if we find a location that is closer to town,"" she said. 
Mahindra Lifespace ventured into the affordable housing segment in 2014, through the brand, Happinest and has since launched two projects—in Boisar near Mumbai and Avadi, Chennai.
The new Mahindra Happinest entity has also identified a second land parcel and is in talks to buy 10 acres in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) for a second project, with around 7-8 lakh sq ft of saleable area.
Once the due diligence process is over, the transaction should close in the June quarter and the project will be launched in the second half of 2018, Arjundas said. 
In a further boost to affordable housing, in January, the goods and service tax (GST) council recommended rationalization of GST rates on such projects. GST would be charged at 8% on the total value of under-construction properties, which would be 4 percentage points less than the earlier effective rate of 12%."

New Delhi: Vehicle sales rose in January from a year earlier, boosted by a low base in the year-ago period because of the impact of the government’s decision to withdraw high-value banknotes in November 2016. 
New Delhi: Vehicle sales rose in January from a year earlier, boosted by a low base in the year-ago period because of the impact of the government’s decision to withdraw high-value banknotes in November 2016.
A recovery in demand in rural and semi urban markets also aided vehicle sales.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest vehicle maker, reported a 5% increase in dispatches to 140,600 units on the back of high base last year because of demand for its Baleno (premium hatchback) and Vitara Brezza (a compact SUV) models. The company’s dispatches of cars to dealers were, however, affected by a shutdown in some of the company’s plants for yearly maintenance.
Sales of Alto and Wagon R fell 12.2%, while those of its compact cars—Baleno, Dzire Swift and Celerio—increased by 21.6%. The increase in taxes on hybrid vehicles and the introduction of the new Verna (a midsize sedan) by Hyundai Motor India Ltd led to a 22.5% decline in Ciaz (a mid size sedan) sales.
Utility vehicle sales surged 26.8% in January, led by demand for Vitara Brezza.
The country’s second largest carmaker Hyundai Motor India registered a 8.35% increase in sales to 45,508 units. Mumbai-based Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) reported a 17% growth to 23,686 units.
On the back of demand for its hatchback Tiago and compact SUV Nexon, passenger vehicle sales of Tata Motors Ltd increased by 55% to 20,055 units. On the other hand, Japanese carmaker Honda saw its sales volume decline by 4.8% to 148,383 units.
Improving macro-economic environment, easy availability of finance options by financial institutions and lower base in the corresponding period have resulted in continued growth in sales of heavy vehicles.
Tata Motors reported a 13% increase in volume to 12,804 units. Chennai-based Ashok Leyland also saw wholesale volume increase by 13% to 13,643 units during the period.
In two wheelers, Honda Motorcycles and Scooter India Pvt Ltd (HMSI) reported a 33% increase in sales to 517,732 on the back of a huge 40% rise in scooter sales.
TVS Motors saw domestic sales increase by 31.9% in January on the back of 22% growth in scooters and 63.7% increase in motorcycles sales as a result of recovery in executive and economy segment motorcycle sales and healthy response from its new product Apache RR 310 in the premium segment.
“Maruti sales were a little bit subdued due to the plant closure while its encouraging to see other vehicle makers report healthy growth despite the price increases. This shows the strength in the Indian market. The sales numbers are in line with our expectations,"" said Anil Sharma, principal analyst, IHS Markit."

2.5%
What is it? The drop in 30-share Dow Jones, the benchmark share index in the US, on Friday—the largest single-day drop for this index in the Donald Trump presidency, which has just entered its second year.
Why is it important? After a period of sustained, euphoric rise, the Dow exhibited a fragility, which some partly attributed to the result of rising too far, too fast. In a CBS interview recorded on Friday but broadcast on Sunday, Janet Yellen, the outgoing chairman of the US central bank, said this about stocks and real estate: “Well, I don’t want to say too high. But I do want to say high.""
Tell me more: The weakness seen in the Dow was also seen in many markets across the world. At home, a day after a Budget that reintroduced long-term capital gains tax, the benchmark BSE Sensex fell 2.3%.
Rs800 crore
What is it? The quantum of investment in electric vehicles for which Mahindra & Mahindra has sought approval from its board of directors, according to managing director Pawan Goenka. This comes on top of the Rs600 crore that Mahindra has invested in electric vehicles.
Why is it important? Carmakers are putting the pieces for an imminent shift to electric vehicles, with this Central government aiming for all new vehicles being sold in 2030 to be running on electric technology. In India, Mahindra has been the first mover, buying Reva in May 2010 and also being one of the two companies to bag the first sizeable order from the government.
Tell me more: In the same interview, Goenka said the electric milestone will lead to a churn in the Indian industry at the very top, and that leaders won’t remain leaders. In the 10-month period to January, Mahindra sold 200,561 passenger vehicles, of which 94% were utility vehicles. By comparison, in the 9-month period to December, market leader Maruti Suzuki sold 1.06 million passenger vehicles.
$3 billion
What is it? The total net profit reported by Amazon for 2017. This is an increase of 25% over 2016, and comes on the back of revenues surging 31% to $178 billion.
Why is it important? It illustrates just how much financial strength Amazon has in order to absorb losses to win new markets, as it is currently trying to do outside the US, including in India. In 2017, 30% of its revenues came from international markets, where it also lost $3 billion. But with the American market and Amazon Web Services growing fast and making money, it can keep channelling more capital for new market share.
Tell me more: In India, Amazon has been involved in a bruising battle with Flipkart. On Friday, it was reported that Flipkart posted a net loss of Rs8,771 crore in 2016-17, a year-on-year increase of 68%.

What is it? The number of indices launched on Saturday to track sentiment among micro and small enterprises (MSEs). The indices, the first of their kind for the MSE sector in India, have been jointly developed by Crisil and Sidbi. 
Why is it important? The state of MSEs has been a cause of concern, and the new indices will add a data dimension to this set. According to the 2013-14 Economic Census, there were 45 million non-agricultural establishments in India, of which 43 million establishments had one to five employees.
Tell me more: CriSidEx, a composite index, is based on a diffusion index of eight parameters and will measure MSE business sentiment on a scale of 0 (extremely negative) to 200 (extremely positive). It will have two sub-indices, one for the “survey quarter"" and, in time, another for the “next quarter"".

What is it? The economy rate registered by Indian bowlers in the U-19 cricket world cup one-day tournament, which India won for the fourth time on Saturday.
Why is it important? India put in an exceptional bowling performance, which saw them not only choke batsmen from scoring, but also take all 10 opposition wickets in all their six matches, at an average of 39 overs per game. This is only the second instance of a team picking up 60 wickets in the tournament’s history. 
Tell me more: India’s Anukul Roy ended up as the joint highest wicket-taker in the tournament. He was one of the three bowlers to pick up 14 wickets, but at a far superior average, economy rate and strike rate than the other two.

Mumbai: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd on Saturday won an order to supply 1,000 electric vehicles (EVs) to Bengaluru-based fleet operator Baghirathi Travel Solutions Pvt. Ltd through its subsidiary Mahindra Electric Mobility Ltd, Mahesh Babu, CEO of Mahindra Electric said, describing the order as “one of the biggest in Indian corporate mobility"". 
Mumbai: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd on Saturday won an order to supply 1,000 electric vehicles (EVs) to Bengaluru-based fleet operator Baghirathi Travel Solutions Pvt. Ltd through its subsidiary Mahindra Electric Mobility Ltd, Mahesh Babu, CEO of Mahindra Electric said, describing the order as “one of the biggest in Indian corporate mobility"".
The order value exceeds Rs100 crore and is Mahindra’s largest EV order so far, eclipsing the Rs16 crore the company stands to earn revenues from the first phase of the central government tender floated through state-owned Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) in September. The second phase has not been announced yet.
Founded in 2003, Baghirathi owns and operates a fleet of 2,000 vehicles in Bengaluru, primarily catering to companies, in addition to schools and inter-city demand.
As India’s only commercial EV manufacturer, Mahindra has espoused the deployment of EVs with fleet owners, taxi aggregators and car rental companies because their business models necessitate running longer distances per day, which enhances the commercial viability of an EV. So far, the maker of the Scorpio has sold its EVs to Bengaluru-based electric cab company Lithium Urban Technologies Pvt. Ltd, car rental company Zoomcar and cab aggregators Uber Technologies Inc. and Ola (ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd), in addition to starting a pilot project with Baghirathi in June 2017.
The model to be supplied is the electric sedan e-Verito, with its range extended by close to 30% up to 140km, said Mahesh Babu, chief executive at Mahindra Electric. The range is the distance an EV can run on a single charge. Deliveries to Baghirathi will begin in batches of 100 units per month from mid-February.
The range of the e-Verito supplied to EESL was lower at 110km, therefore a premium has been charged on the upgraded model, Babu said on the question of pricing, without disclosing further details.
Mahindra did not make any money at the price point of Rs10.6 lakh quoted in the EESL order, said Mahindra and Mahindra managing director Pawan Goenka in early October. Therefore, a back-of-the-envelope calculation would make the Baghirathi order more profitable for Mahindra.
Analysts expect greater uptake of EVs by fleet owners owing to a relative ease in operation as compared to private owners.
“As commercial players deal with larger EV volume, they can develop their own charging stations. Therefore, easier and more commercially viable operations would increase uptake. At this point, the public sector is also aiding the development of charging infrastructure"", said Abdul Majeed, partner at consulting firm PwC India. 
A case in point, Baghirathi itself desires to replace its entire fleet with EVs in the next three to five years as charging infrastructure allows, beginning with a 20% conversion in fiscal 2019, said Mahesh Hariharan, managing director at Baghirathi.
However, it remains to be seen whether an underdeveloped charging station network will play spoilsport to greater EV adoption. “The biggest operational challenge during the 10 months of the pilot project was the charging infrastructure,"" said Hariharan.
At present, 15 charging points are being placed at “strategic locations"" to cater to the first batch of EVs, said Hariharan, without disclosing the entity setting up the infrastructure, while adding that “the Karnataka government is looking into it and working out the modalities""."

Mumbai: Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Ltd (Mahindra Finance) is in talks to raise as much as $300 million via masala bonds, according to two people directly aware of the company’s discussions with potential lenders.  
Mumbai: Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Ltd (Mahindra Finance) is in talks to raise as much as $300 million via masala bonds, according to two people directly aware of the company’s discussions with potential lenders. 
Masala bonds are rupee-denominated offshore bonds sold to foreign investors and settled in dollars, unlike debt raised in foreign currency which are vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations.
According to the persons cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity the bonds will be placed in two tranches and will mature in five years and seven years, respectively. 
Mahindra Finance, a rural focussed non-banking financial company (NBFC), provides auto loans mainly for buying tractors, utility vehicles and cars. India’s largest tractor and utility vehicle manufacturer, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, holds 51.2% stake in Mahindra Finance.
A spokesperson for Mahindra Finance declined to comment on its fundraising plans.
The plan to raise debt through the masala bonds route follows the company’s equity fundraise last year.
In December, Mahindra Finance raised Rs1,056 crore through qualified institutional placements (QIP). 
QIP is a capital-raising tool through which listed companies can sell equity shares, fully and partly convertible debentures, or any securities other than warrants that are convertible into stocks, to a qualified institutional buyer.
Reasons for the masala bond sale were not immediately known. In an interview in December 2017, Ramesh Iyer, vice-chairman and managing director of Mahindra Finance, had said the company was open to evaluating acquisition opportunities.
The plan to raise debt comes after a strong turnaround in its financial performance. 
For the third quarter this financial year, Mahindra Finance posted a consolidated net profit of  ₹ 65 crore as against a net profit of  ₹ 2 crore during the corresponding period last year. The sharp growth in profit was led by improvement in rural cash flows and a consequent drop in loan provisions and write-offs. Consolidated total income rose 26% to  ₹ ,195 crore from  ₹ 1,748 crore.
Provisions and write-offs fell to Rs223 crore during the quarter from Rs442 crore a year ago. In the past one year, several lenders have raised funds through both equity and debt routes to expand their loan books.
In October, PNB Housing Finance Ltd, a housing finance company sponsored by state-owned lender Punjab National Bank and backed by private equity investor Carlyle Group, raised close to $1 billion by selling masala bonds. In September 2016, Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd raised Rs1,330 crore by issuing its first masala bonds to overseas investors, to fund its housing finance business, particularly loans in the affordable home segment.
Earlier in March 2017, Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd raised about $504 million (about Rs3,300 crore) through masala bonds to fund business expansion.
Other lenders that have raised funds through the masala bond route in the recent times include Shriram Transport Finance Ltd and Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Co. Ltd.
On Wednesday, shares of Mahindra Finance fell 1.62% to close at Rs438.6 on the BSE, while the benchmark Sensex lost 0.88% to close at 34,757.16."

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed Sahara Group to sell its Aamby Valley township, spread over 6,700 acres in Pune district, in parts through a court-appointed liquidator. 
New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed Sahara Group to sell its Aamby Valley township, spread over 6,700 acres in Pune district, in parts through a court-appointed liquidator.
The official liquidator of the Bombay high court along with the court receiver was directed to submit a report assessing the saleable parcels of the project and their approximate value by end of March. Thereafter, the sale process will begin.
The direction came after the court was informed by the official liquidator of the difficulties in selling the township as a whole.
“This is a huge plot and there have been two failed instances at selling it as a whole as there were no bidders. It’s a suggestion that the court may consider allowing us to sell it in the form of parcels as it will make the process much easier,"" said counsel Darius J. Khambata on behalf of the official liquidator.
Khambata told the court that two companies—Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Piramal Group—had expressed interest in buying Aamby Valley, either as a whole or in parcels and are inspecting the assets. 
The apex court on 23 November had appointed a receiver to ensure that the Aamby Valley auction proceeds smoothly over allegations that a previous attempt to sell the property was obstructed.
Chief Justice Dipak Misra also held that the process must be hurdle-free and warned Sahara chief Subrata Roy would be sent back to jail if it was obstructed again.
The country’s capital markets regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), had approached the apex court in October with a contempt plea against the Sahara Group, alleging obstruction in the Aamby Valley auction.
The auction process began on 14 August with the official liquidator inviting bids at a reserve price of Rs37,392 crore. In August, while asking Sahara to deposit Rs1,500 crore in a dedicated Sebi account by 7 September, the apex court had clarified that the auction would be stopped if the company furnished the payment in time.
Sebi moved the apex court in August 2014 to recover Rs36,000 crore to refund investors who purchased securities from two group firms. Sebi had asked the court to appoint a receiver, who would sell Sahara’s assets and raise the money.
On 25 July, the court directed the official liquidator of the Bombay high court to initiate the first two steps of the process to auction Aamby Valley. This would include publication of the sale notice of the property and fulfilment of the KYC (know-your-customer) norms to be submitted by prospective bidders.
The case will be heard next on 12 April.
Sahara has filed a defamation case in a Patna court against Mint’s editor and some reporters over the newspaper’s coverage of the company’s dispute with the Securities and Exchange Board of India. Mint is contesting the case."

Although Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd have managed to increase their workforce, the number of people let go by the largest companies is higher than the decline in workforce suggests as they all continued to hire young engineers.
These seven largest companies employed 1,404,656 people at the end of December. That compares with the 1,408,823 they employed in January, a net decline of 4,167 in 2017, after having added more than 103,000 people in 2016.
Until 2017, not a single large IT outsourcing company has ever seen its headcount decline, and starting 1996, year after year, for more than two decades, all companies managed to keep adding to their workforce until the industry hit a perfect storm last year. 
These companies’ traditional approach of deploying armies of engineers to manage computers or offering customer support to clients and client-run businesses was getting commoditised and increasingly disrupted by the embrace of smart automation tools. Business from areas generally classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud and Internet of Things—all of which is clubbed under the fuzzy word Digital—is on the rise, although it is still less than a fourth of total revenue at home-grown IT firms.
A fallout of this shift is that the world has become digital, and the IT outsourcing companies haven’t (at least, not enough), reflecting their under-preparedness in adapting to newer technologies. US President Donald Trump’s protectionist policies have also forced these companies to hire more Americans.
Since the industry now is the largest job creator, employing 3.9 million people, fewer jobs at the largest companies is worrying news not just for the companies but for the country as a whole.
Many experts feel that the industry will see a further reduction in headcount in the years ahead.
“The global IT and BPO services industry employs 16 million workers today. By 2022, our industry will employ 14.8 million—a likely decrease of 7.5% in total workers,"" Phil Fersht and Jamie Snowdon, analysts at US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing-research firm, wrote in a 3 February note. “This isn’t devastating news—we’ll lose this many people through natural attrition, but what this data signifies is this industry is now delivering more for less because of advantages in automation and artificial intelligence."""
537,2018-02-08,Mahindra Mahindra,"M&M will be taking a final decision two months from now before making a formal announcement, said managing director Pawan Goenka

New Delhi: In two months’ time, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd will decide on whether to roll out a car that could turn out to be the Indian company’s answer to Tesla in the luxury electric car space. 
New Delhi: In two months’ time, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd will decide on whether to roll out a car that could turn out to be the Indian company’s answer to Tesla in the luxury electric car space.
The company will be taking a final decision two months from now before making a formal announcement, its managing director (MD) Pawan Goenka said.
“(We are) working on it… the last time that we talked about it, we had said we will be doing feasibility... a lot of work has happened and I think within… I would like to say two months, we should be able to make a final decision and then announce,"" Goenka said.
In pursuit of a luxury brand, Mahindra decided to develop and sell products from Pininfarina, a Turin-based design and engineering company that it acquired in December 2015 for around $185 million. Pininfarina will develop an electric sports car and sell it under its own badge, Mint reported in March 2017
“...the product is clearly not a mass market product. What we are looking at is a high-end product for personal use and it is not a commercial use product,"" Goenka added.
Pininfarina has a storied past and is known for its classic designs for Ferrari, Fiat and Alfa Romeo in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as more recent work for Bentley, BMW and Maserati. The death of its patriarch Sergio Pininfarina in 2012 and financial trouble dating back to 2008 led to its sale.
Goenka’s intent to have a luxury electric car in the Mahindra stable is vindicated by a clutch of new generation companies introducing products to compete with Tesla globally.
“I think in China, NIO launched one product just last month, which is supposed to be better than Tesla at a lower price. There is Faraday Future that’s working on it. There is Lucid that is working on it. NIO is working on it for the US. There are many... So in 3-4 years from now you will see a lot of products in the $80,000-100,000 range,"" Goenka added.
Tesla’s cars start at $101,000 in the US.
In the past, Mahindra has bid for luxury brands such as Aston Martin, Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover. It now seems to have changed its strategy and decided to grow Pininfarina into a luxury brand by leveraging the Italian firm’s legacy.
Globally, auto firms have followed two strategies to tap luxury car customers: Volkswagen AG, for instance, bought Audi AG and hyper luxury brand Bugatti; others like Honda Motor Co. Ltd, Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. have developed Acura, Lexus, Infiniti and Genesis brands, respectively, to compete with prominent luxury carmakers. Closer home, Tata Motors Ltd bought Jaguar Land Rover from Ford Motor Co. in 2007."

New Delhi: Mahindra & Mahindra on Friday reported 12.49% increase in standalone net profit at Rs1,215.91 crore in the third quarter ended December 2017. 
The company had posted a standalone net profit of Rs1,080.85 crore in the same period of the last fiscal, Mahindra & Mahindra said in a statement. Revenue from operations was at Rs11,577.78 crore. It stood at Rs11,843.74 crore in the year-ago period. 
The two figures are not comparable as revenue from operations under pre-goods and services tax (GST) regime included excise duty, which is now subsumed in GST. During the quarter, the company said, it sold a total of 1,21,786 vehicles, up 8% from the same period last fiscal. 
Passenger vehicles reported a growth of 6.1%, it added. Tractor sales were also up 6% at 76,943 units in the third quarter, it said. “In Q3 F2018, normal north-east monsoons and good reservoir levels helped in boosting the rural sentiment and demand for tractors,"" M&M said. 
The healthy reservoir levels, good progress on rabi sowing and increase in MSP’s of rabi crops should help the growth momentum to continue in the coming months, it added. Commenting on the overall outlook, the company said, “With the effects of some of the recent transient factors fading away and the economy adjusting to GST implementation, growth momentum is likely to stay buoyant."" 
A balanced and pro-agrarian budget should help prop farm incomes and stimulate rural consumption demand and further nurture the green shoots of economic recovery, it added."
534,2018-02-17,Mahindra Mahindra,"Zoomcar will use the funding from Mahindra and others for accelerating marketplace supply growth, improving IoT technology capability and for expansion across India

Bengaluru: Self-drive car rental start-up Zoomcar India Pvt. Ltd has raised $40 million in a Series C funding round led by automobile maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M), the company said in a statement on Friday.  
Bengaluru: Self-drive car rental start-up Zoomcar India Pvt. Ltd has raised $40 million in a Series C funding round led by automobile maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M), the company said in a statement on Friday. 
Existing investors, including Ford Smart Mobility, Sequoia Capital, Empire Angels, Nokia Growth Partners and others also participated in the round.
Zoomcar will use the fresh capital primarily for accelerating its marketplace supply growth, improving its IoT (Internet of Things) technology capability and for expanding across India. The company lets users book vehicles and make payments online. Users have to locate a Zoomcar car lot within their locality to pick up the vehicle. It also offers doorstep delivery of the rented vehicle.
The firm had also launched an associate programme in April 2016, which allowed people to lease their own cars to its platform under a revenue-sharing model. Zoomcar charges a 25% commission on revenue that its associates make. 
Mint reported in November that Zoomcar was in talks to raise money from new and existing investors. It was also running an electric vehicle (EV) pilot in Mysore through a tie-up with M&M. It plans to launch 500 more EVs across 20 cities in the coming months.
The firm raised $24 million in Series B round in August 2016 led by Ford Smart Mobility, and another $21 million in two tranches between October 2014 and July 2015, from Sequoia Capital, Empire Angels and T.V. Mohandas Pai among others. This takes Zoomcar’s funding till date to $85 million.
Zoomcar has a customer base of more than two million. It had started shifting to a marketplace model last year and said that it would sell all vehicles in its fleet over time. The company said that its marketplace model currently accounts for 25% of its total 3,000-vehicle fleet, which is a mix of company-owned vehicles and those leased from third parties.
In October 2017, Zoomcar introduced a new bike-sharing service named PEDL, which currently operates across 10 cities with a fleet of more than 3,000 cycles. The service claims to complete nearly 15,000 rides per day. With the fresh funding, the company also expects to increase its cycle count and plans to expand across more than 75 cities by the year-end. 
“We’re incredibly excited to welcome the Mahindra team on board for this next phase of growth within the Indian self-drive mobility space. Our collaboration with Mahindra dates back to 2013 when we kicked off in Bangalore. Most importantly, Mahindra shares Zoomcar’s vision for multi-modal urban mobility and we look forward to leveraging their diverse platform to help accelerate the transformation to a shared, electric mobility future for India,"" Greg Moran, co-founder and chief executive of Zoomcar, said in a note.
For the year ended March 2017, Zoomcar reported a loss of Rs100.4 crore, which narrowed down from Rs101.4 crore in FY16. Total revenue grew 35% to Rs121.2 crore from Rs89.82 crore in FY16."
533,2018-02-19,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra Group announced fresh Rs900-crore investment in electric vehicles (EVs) over the next four years

Mumbai:The Mahindra Group on Monday announced fresh Rs900-crore investment in electric vehicles (EVs) over the next four years, which should ramp up its first installed capacity to 5,000 units a month.  
Mumbai:The Mahindra Group on Monday announced fresh Rs900-crore investment in electric vehicles (EVs) over the next four years, which should ramp up its first installed capacity to 5,000 units a month. 
“We have already invested Rs600 crore in EVs over the past five-six years and have decided to invest Rs400 crore in Karnataka and Rs500 crore in Maharashtra over the next four-five years. This will be used for capacity, technology and products,"" managing director Pawan Goenka told reporters here. 
“We are not waiting for any policy to move forward. To be a pioneer, you have to create the road and we have to move forward,"" he said on the sidelines of the ongoing Maharashtra investor summit. Goenka, however, said there is a need for the prevailing subsidies on EVs to continue for longer to ensure growth of this industry. 
Once it touches a critical mass of say 2 lakh units a month, which he expects by 2022, it will be on an equal footing with the conventional internal combustion engine-based vehicles, he said. At present, Mahindra has a capacity of 400 units a month, which will go up to 1,500, including three-wheelers by this September, he said, adding by next December they should be capable of rolling out 4,000 units. 
The current investment plan aims to take the capacity to 5,000 units a month and is based on certain assumptions like the subsidies continuing, Goenka said. He said the company will be doing all parts of the EV play, except batteries, which require greater volumes for local manufacturing and so they will have to be imported. Goenka said at the current demand for EVs is so low at under 300 units a month, but said he is confident of better days and that the additional investments as “leap of faith"". 
In what has been termed as a volte-face by government, Union roads minister Nitin Gadkari had last week said there was no need for a separate policy on EVs. The minister had earlier said that such a move was in the works. Following this an industry lobby is reportedly meeting Union heavy industries minister Anant Geete and Niti Aayog chief executive Amitabh Kant. Goenka, however, said there has not been any “u-turn"" by government, as there are already beneficial moves like differentiated GST treatment and EV policies by states like Maharashtra which is “enough to get the industry going"". 
He was, however, not so supportive of government’s earlier plan of turning 100% electric by 2030, terming it is “too ambitious"" and said there is a need to “walk more, before we start running"". The auto industry veteran said we should be satisfied even if we achieve 30% EV share by 2030, and enlisted global adoption experiences to buttress his point. 
EVs contribute for only 0.04% of the domestic car market now compared to 2% in China and 32% in Norway, he said, adding both these countries had invested massively over the past decade to achieve these numbers. Pointing out that lack of charging stations is the biggest impediment for EV-makers and said we should be first focusing on the metros having troubles around pollution before taking it nationally. 
Transport aggregators, including bus transport utilities, radio taxi operators like Uber and Ola, will be the first ones to adopt EVs, Goenka said. He, however, termed the EV space as a big opportunity and asked everybody to focus on it because of the advantages of zero pollution and zero fuel imports. 
He also sought to placate the concerns of auto ancillaries, saying the industry will continue to grow at 4-5% even in the decade to the 2030s which will give such companies sufficient business. Meanwhile, addressing the summit, Tata Power executive director Ashish Khanna said technology has not changed so much on the solar front, which may justify “grid parity"" that is seen in new bidding at rates as low as Rs2.45 per unit."

New Delhi: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd-owned SsangYong Motor Co. slipped back into losses in 2017, as the Korean won strengthened and exports fell. In 2016, the company had reported its first profit since acquisition by Mahindra in 2011. 
New Delhi: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd-owned SsangYong Motor Co. slipped back into losses in 2017, as the Korean won strengthened and exports fell. In 2016, the company had reported its first profit since acquisition by Mahindra in 2011.
The Pyeongtaek, South Korea-based automaker reported a loss of 65.8 billion Korean won (KRW) against a profit of 58.1 billion KRW in the year before. Revenues during the period fell 3.7% to 3494.6 billion KRW. At the operating level, the company reported a loss of 65.3 billion KRW compared to an operating profit of 28 billion KRW in 2016.
According to data made available by the company, total vehicle sales in 2017 decreased by 8% to 143685 units. In the South Korean market, volumes increased by just 3% while exports fell by a whopping 29% to 37,008 units.
SsangYong recently signed a licence contract with its parent company Mahindra for assembling its sports utility vehicle Rexton in India in the second half of 2018.
“In 2017, SsangYong achieved continuous growth for eight straight years in domestic sales thanks to strong sales of the Tivoli brand and successful launch of the Rexton. In 2018, we will not only expand our global sales but also maintain domestic sales growth with the upcoming all-new pickup model."","" said Choi Johng-sik, CEO, SsangYong Motor Co. in a statement issued on 3 January 2018.
After acquiring a majority stake in the company in 2010, Mahindra decided to invest $900 million in developing new products for SsangYong in 2013. The South Korean company launched its first compact SUV, Tivoli, at the Shanghai Auto Show in 2015 which was an instant hit. 
Due the increasing popularity of the vehicle, volumes of the company in 2016 increased by 7.7% to 155844 units, the highest reported by the company since 2002.
Recently, Mahindra opened its first automobile plant in the north of Detroit as the company plans to sell its off-loader vehicles in US. Group chairman Anand Mahindra also indicated that SsangYong could enter the US as the third South Korean automobile manufacturer after Hyundai Motor Company and its subsidiary Kia Motors Corporation.
“In automotive, as you know, we own SsangYong motors and the advantage of possibly exploring an American entry through them is that the American consumer by now has developed great respect for the Korean automotive brands thanks to Hyundai and Kia,"" Mahindra was quoted in a report by the Press Trust of India (PTI).
According to news agency Reuters, the parent company is working with its subsidiaries Italian firm Pininfarina and SsangYong Motors to develop electric vehicles for the markets like US and China.
“The primary reason for the lower sales is the decline in export sales, due to strengthening of Korean won against dollar and euro, and competitive conditions in key markets. This is also one of the main reasons the reason for SsangYong posting an operating loss compared to profit. In addition, the operating loss was enhanced due to increase in depreciation cost due to launch of new model during the year,"" said a spokesperson of the Mahindra in response to an email query from Mint. 
Mahindra and SsangYong are expected to launch their first jointly developed utility vehicle based on SsangYong’s Tivoli platform in 2019. The Mumbai-based automaker may also take the help of Ford India Pvt. Ltd in developing some of the future products of SsangYong, especially in the domain of electric and connected cars.
According analysts, though, the turnaround of SsangYong is still some time away and last year also, the company showed profit after tax due to a royalty paid by Mahindra for using the Tivoli platform. 
“SsangYong is focusing on the eastern European market like Russia since other markets like China has reached a saturation point which is a concern for them. Now that Mahindra has a tie-up with Ford, it may help them launch SsangYong in US especially in the electric and hybrid segment,"" said Puneet Gupta, associate director, IHS Markit."

Declining to reveal specific recruitment plans, the TechM CEO said the IT industry may witness 4% growth in hiring if the industry expands at 8% per annum for the next two years. “I am giving a back of the envelop calculation.

Not sure why Indian markets seem so perturbed by the threat of global tariff wars.Small, export focused countries stand to lose. Countries with large domestic economies can easily withstand tariff threats. The world needs access to the fastest-growing large economy—India.(1/3)
As President Donald Trump’s steel tariff prompts concern about retaliation and a trade war, the head of the $19 billion Mahindra Group was quick to highlight India’s fortunate position as the world’s fastest-growing major economy. And one heavily focused on domestic consumption. India is the third-biggest producer of steel, yet only 0.2% of the material its mills made found its way to the US in January, according to data from the US government and the World Steel Association.
Instead, India’s steel factories are boosting production to keep up with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s infrastructure plans as he aims to transform aging infrastructure across the nation and create Smart Cities, replete with affordable housing, improved sanitation and better transportation. The government wants to boost per capita steel consumption to between 130kg and 140kg from 65kg.
India is also less likely to attract attention for its trade surplus with the US, which at $22.9 billion in 2017 was less than what China prints in a single month.
Despite this, concerns around a trade war helped push the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex down 2.2% this week. A metals index of 10 companies including Tata Steel Ltd and JSW Steel Ltd sank 6.9%, the most since 2016 on concern the local market will be flooded with supplies from surplus nations.
“India can stand tall in a trade war,"" Mahindra tweeted, given its access to global technology and capital to fuel innovative startups along with its ability to import the commodities the nation lacks. “The world needs access to the fastest-growing large economy—India,"" he said. Bloomberg

New Delhi: Mahindra & Mahindra’s utility vehicle Bolero has made it to the top ten best-selling passenger vehicles (PV) list, which continues to be dominated by Maruti Suzuki India that bagged six out of the ten slots in February. 
This is the first time in two years that Bolero has made it to the top ten list. The model sold 8,001 units last month to occupy the tenth position. In February last year, Bolero clocked 6,442 units, according to the data by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). 
During the same month in 2016, Bolero was the ninth best selling PV model. As per SIAM figures, Maruti Suzuki India’s (MSI) entry level model Alto held on to its number one position selling 19,760 units in February this year as against 19,524 units in the same month last year.
The company’s compact sedan Dzire occupied the second position with 17,784 units as against 16,613 units last year. The new Swift was in number three position with sales of 17,291 units. The model was in fifth position in February last year with sales of 12,862 units. 
MSI’s premium hatchback Baleno moved up to the fourth position with 15,807 units in February from ninth last year selling 7,658 units. Wagon R stood at fifth position with sale of 14,029 units in February. It occupied third position last year in February with sale of 13,555 units. 
Hyundai’s Elite i20 occupied sixth position last month with 13,378 units. On the other hand Maruti’s compact SUV Vitara Brezza was at seventh position with sale of 11,620 units. Hyundai’s compact hatchback Grand i10 stood at eighth position with 10,198 units while the company’s SUV Creta occupied the ninth position with sale of 9,278 units. 
Maruti Celerio and Renault Kwid failed to make it to the top ten list last month. They were present in top ten PV list of February 2017."
525,2018-03-21,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra and Mahindra plans to expand dealer touchpoint network for its passenger and light commercial vehicle divisions by over 35% in a year, primarily in rural areas

New Delhi: Homegrown automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd is planning to expand the dealer touchpoint network for its passenger and light commercial vehicle (PV and LCV) divisions by over 35% in a year’s time, primarily in rural areas. 
New Delhi: Homegrown automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd is planning to expand the dealer touchpoint network for its passenger and light commercial vehicle (PV and LCV) divisions by over 35% in a year’s time, primarily in rural areas.
The maker of the Scorpio SUV (sport utility vehicle), an immensely popular model in semi-urban and rural areas, aims to have 2,300 such touchpoints by the end of the 2019 fiscal, up from approximately 1,700 at present. 
Of the 2,300 touchpoints, about 1,400 will be operational in upcountry and rural locations, according to Rajan Wadhera, president at the automotive division of the Mumbai-based firm. At present, the maker of the Bolero SUV, another best-selling model in the hinterland, has about 900 inland touchpoints.
This network primarily consists of outlets offering servicing facilities in addition to being points of sale. With the ramp up in fiscal year 2019, the number of sales and service outlets are set to rise.
The company also plans to increase, by more than half, the number of local servicemen called Mahindra Mitratechnicians, who are part of an alternate channel that primarily services commercial vehicles, to 4,700 during the same time frame from over 3,000 at present.
“We revisited our network strategy about three years back and realized that the classical approach of appointing 15-20 large format dealers each year would be insufficient to keep up with increasing buying potential,"" said Wadhera in an email response.
Mahindra, the UV segment market leader, ceded ground during this fiscal to rivals such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd in urban geographies as the firm could not capitalise on the burgeoning demand for compact SUVs. 
Not surprisingly, Mahindra attributes a larger share of its PV volumes to semi-urban and rural areas than rivals. Up to January of this fiscal, these geographies contributed to almost 43% of Mahindra’s PV sales, managing director Pawan Goenka told reporters in early February.
According to data provided by the company, the rural share in auto volumes for fiscal 2017 stood at 40.5%, up 100 basis points from 39.5% in fiscal 2016.
This figure rises by 100 to 150 basis points every fiscal, Goenka added. 
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
“Mahindra’s auto division has a very huge thrust in rural India. An increase in disposable income doesn’t immediately translate to a car purchase but it means there is more margin money available (to spend). Therefore, individuals will trade up from a hatchback to an SUV (sports utility vehicle), for example. That’s where the Mahindra is present,"" Goenka said in February, without quantifying the increase in expectations.
The most important factor to note is that rural sentiment will become positive, he added.
Analysts said such an expansion will boost sales, in addition to the fillip provided by the budget. 
Mahindra’s rural PV play relies primarily on two SUVs—Bolero and Scorpio. Over the years, they have remained fairly profitable for the company despite little investment and change.
“Contributing over half of Mahindra’s UV volumes in passenger cars, the Bolero and Scorpio face little competition in rural markets, so a definite jump is expected. Since the election year is underway, individuals in these markets will advance purchases with the expectation of more cash transfers,"" said Priya Ranjan, vice-president at Systematix Institutional Equities, a Mumbai-based brokerage house.
Mahindra’s UV volumes are estimated to grow close to 7% this fiscal, he said, adding that the rural markets will contribute two-thirds of the growth. A larger local presence will increase throughput by 10-15%, Ranjan added.
For the fiscal up to February, Mahindra’s UV volumes grew 5.34% to 209,322 units, according to data provided by industry lobby Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), while sales of small commercial vehicles (SCVs) grew by 39.9% to 12, 434 units.
“The primary motive behind increasing the footprint was to grow sales of SCVs and pick-ups, this segment will see the maximum benefit since the broader segment was not doing well since the past six to seven years,"" said Ranjan.
Analysts, who did not wish to be quoted, expect Mahindra’s PV division to clock over 20% growth in sales for the next fiscal year, primarily driven by new launches such as the U321 and S201, in addition to higher rural sales."
522,2018-03-23,Mahindra Mahindra,"Maruti Suzuki has captured a 28.6% share of the utility vehicles market even as Mahindra's share fell to 25% from an invincible 56% in 2011-12

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s full throttle drive to capture the No. 1 position in utility vehicles (UVs) bore fruit after seven years as it raced past market leader Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd to capture a 28.6% share. As for Mahindra, its share of the UV market toppled from what was almost an invincible 56% in fiscal year 2012 (FY12) to 25% in the nine months ended December 2017. 
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s full throttle drive to capture the No. 1 position in utility vehicles (UVs) bore fruit after seven years as it raced past market leader Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd to capture a 28.6% share. As for Mahindra, its share of the UV market toppled from what was almost an invincible 56% in fiscal year 2012 (FY12) to 25% in the nine months ended December 2017.
Of course, it is certain that Mahindra has not given up the battle. In a recent Investor Day presentation at Mahindra Research Valley, the senior management focused on the auto business. The host of launches lined up in the UV segment in the coming months indicates that the company hopes to stage a comeback and regain its lost market share. But this is easier said than done.
Note that when Maruti Suzuki was steadily conquering the UV market by tweaking its range and launching relatively cheaper compact UVs, such as the Vitara Brezza and Ignis, Mahindra was caught napping. Lack of products in the compact segment was its biggest failure. And now, the road ahead is arduous and rife with competition. South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co. is a strong competitor with deep pockets. It has garnered nearly a fifth of the UV market in just two years. There is also Toyota Motor Corp. that is keen on expanding its presence in the Indian market from the present 12%.
Therefore, Mahindra’s struggle would be far greater than what it was seven years ago, when it was the market supremo. According to Bharat Gianani, an analyst at Sharekhan Ltd, “If Mahindra is targeting a market share of 30% in UVs, it appears achievable."" That said, it is highly unlikely that the company will regain its stronghold with a 50%-plus market share in UVs.
Add to this, the costs of advertising and marketing to keep abreast of competition especially from Maruti Suzuki—whose reach is relatively greater—might dent profitability unless the new launches rake in strong sales volume. As such, the share of its auto division in the overall Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) has declined from two-thirds to one-third, ever since it lost ground in UVs. Profit margins have ebbed too.
Thankfully, Mahindra’s farm equipment division’s stellar growth rate over the last two years on the back of a favourable monsoon and a growing rural economy, has partially offset the pain in the auto division.
From an investor standpoint therefore, FY19 would be the make or break year for the auto segment. With Maruti Suzuki being a strong force to contend with and in the lead position, it is a tough road ahead for Mahindra. 
This explains why Mahindra’s one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio has been sticky at around 17, in spite of two strong growth years for the farm equipment division."
524,2018-03-23,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra and Ford have signed five non-binding memoranda of understanding (MoU) to cover each of the above segment

Mumbai: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Ford India Pvt. Ltd on Thursday said they have agreed to jointly develop connected vehicles, electric cars, drivetrains, compact SUVs and mid-sized SUVs. 
Mumbai: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Ford India Pvt. Ltd on Thursday said they have agreed to jointly develop connected vehicles, electric cars, drivetrains, compact SUVs and mid-sized SUVs.
The two companies have signed five non-binding memoranda of understanding (MoU) to cover each of the above segment, Mahindra said in a BSE filing, formalizing an alliance announced in September to co-develop a range of vehicles for India and other emerging markets.
The maker of the Scorpio SUV cited the “potential for shared investment, economies of scale, technology sharing and higher efficiencies in areas like product development and sourcing as also in new emerging growth areas of electrification and connected vehicles.""
The announcement is the next step in the collaboration between Mahindra and Ford, Mahindra managing director Pawan Goenka said in the filing.
“Both teams are working together on joint development areas in keeping with industry requirements and leveraging (our) mutual strengths. We are excited about the synergies unveiled through this collaboration and the potential opportunities it will bring"", he added.
Specifically, the two automakers will co-develop a small electric car. On 9 October, Mint reported that Mahindra would share its affordable EV technologies with Ford, which the American company plans to use in its small entry-level cars such as Figo and Aspire.
The report also said Mahindra was in early talks with Ford to procure a vehicle platform Ka on which the Mumbai-based company aims to build an all-new electric sedan.
Meanwhile, a mid-sized SUV—built on the Mahindra platform—will be sold independently by both companies with their individual badging. Mahindra and Ford also agreed to assess the co-development of a compact SUV, in addition to sharing their powertrain portfolios whereby Mahindra will supply powertrains to Ford to extend the latter’s limited product range in India and its neighbouring countries.
Aiming to leverage the benefits of Ford’s global reach and Mahindra’s scale in India, teams from both companies will work together for up to three years, to assess the possibility of increasing support for Mahindra in global emerging markets via Ford’s manufacturing and distribution network, in addition to evaluating future mobility needs.
“Listening to our customers and incorporating their future needs is the core premise of this collaboration"", said Jim Farley, executive vice-president and president of global markets at Ford Motor Co.
“With utility vehicles and electrification as key focus areas, we are glad to see the progress our two companies have made"", he added.
Mahindra’s proclivity for collaboration is apparent in its past joint ventures with other global automakers such as Renault SA and Navistar International Corp. However, these alliances either fell through, as did the JV with Ford in 1998, or did not result in significant benefits for the company.
Analysts don’t expect an outcome much different this time around.
“No material outcome is expected from these MoUs for markets to take note of, since Mahindra has worked with a lot of JV partners in the past but has not been able to gain a differentiated foothold either in the PV or UV (passenger vehicle or utility vehicle) space. Competition has especially gone far ahead lately. The company has also been struggling in India with electric cars since they bought Reva (in 2010). This will be exacerbated by the fact that India doesn’t have a concrete EV policy at the moment"", said Mahantesh Sabarad, head-retail research at SBI Cap Securities.
A strong manufacturing foothold outside India will help facilitate the company’s cause; this can be done by leveraging Ford’s numerous facilities across Latin America, Europe and Asia through Mahindra’s Korean subsidiary Ssangyong (Motor Co.), Sabarad added.
On Thursday, Mahindra and Mahindra shares fell 2.14%, or Rs15.95, to Rs729.80 on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex lost 0.39%, or 129.91 points, to end the day at 33,006.27."

Mumbai: Personalities such as Anand Mahindra, R. Seshasayee, Sajjan Jindal, and former Reserver Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan came together on Friday to announce the launch of Krea University, which will focus on liberal arts and science courses.
These leaders will be associated with the university either as members of the governing or academic councils.
Around Rs750 crore will be spent in the first phase of setting up Krea University. Corporate houses and other donors have pledged their support and 70-80% of the amount is already in sight, said Seshasayee, former chairman of Infosys Ltd. He will be chairman of Krea University’s supervisory board.
Set up as a private university, it will offer four-year residential honours degrees in arts and science. The first batch will commence in July 2019. 
Defending corporates who are accused of not speaking freely on issues, the Mahindra and Mahindra chairman said, “I am paid by my shareholders. They do not pay me to court controversy. They certainly want me to make money. If I give up my business and retire, I’m going to say what the hell I like."" 
“That’s why universities are important...because they are safe houses, because nobody can attack them, because by the act of helping them or sponsoring them, you do create conversations in society. No one can attack a university for doing that,"" he added.
Rajan stressed on the need to nurture the idea of debate and discussion. “We need to learn to respect universities as places where ideas are debated,"" he said."
520,2018-03-31,Mahindra Mahindra,"Tata Motors and Mahindra are speeding up their work on developing electric powertrains for their small commercial vehicles in the sub 2-tonne category

New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) Ltd are facing off once again, this time in electric engines. 
New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) Ltd are facing off once again, this time in electric engines.
Both are speeding up their work on developing electric powertrains for their small commercial vehicles in the sub 2-tonne category.
Tata Motors, India’s largest commercial vehicles maker, is developing an electric variant of its popular light commercial vehicle (LCV) Tata Ace that can carry up to 1 tonne.
“The new powertrain is already in the development stage and may hit the Indian market by late 2019 or early 2020,"" a person close to the development said, requesting anonymity.
M&M, which beat Tata Motors in LCV sales in the past two fiscal years, is also developing its own electric powertrain for its offerings in the sub 2-tonne segment, said another person aware of the issue, who also did not want to be named.
The rationale behind electric powertrains is that these vehicles would not require extensive charging stations like buses and will be used for transporting goods within a city or a town. Hence, a single charge would be enough to operate them throughout a day.
In the second avatar, or the FAME scheme, which is still being drafted by the Department of Heavy Industries, it is widely expected that the Union government will subsidize the purchase of electric vehicles for commercial purposes and both the companies think introducing an electric powertrain in its offerings in LCV segment will get a lot of traction in the market.
Both Tata Motors and M&M have already launched electric variants of their respective products—Tigor of Tata Motors and E-Verito of M&M—in the passenger vehicle segment and have been supplying these vehicles to Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) – a company floated by the ministry of power.
Vehicles like Tata Motors’ Ace and M&M’s Jeeto are used to move freight within cities. Hence, these vehicles with electric powertrains can be used by fleet owners as operational cost will be much lower and acquisition cost would also come down once subsidies are in place.
“Tata Motors is developing an electric variant of the small commercial vehicle Ace and is at the development stage now. It should be in the market by late 2019 or 2020. Given the way the Union government wants to encourage the use of EVs in commercial purposes, this is perfectly suitable for ferrying goods and passengers within city limits,"" said a person directly aware of the development. 
Tata Motors though showcased an electric variant of its small commercial vehicle Magic—used for ferrying passengers—at the Auto Expo 2018. “As you are aware, we had showcased Magic EV at the Auto Expo 2018. However, as a policy, we do not comment on future product innovations and launches,"" the firm said in response to an email query.
M&M did not respond to a query sent by Mint on Friday.
“Tata Motors is trying to consolidate its position in the electric commercial vehicle front. It has already launched electric buses and has been testing some of them in different states. With the introduction of the electric variant of Ace, the firm will further try to cement its position. Also, in the long run, this may help them get some lost market share back from M&M in the LCV space,"" said the person mentioned above, requesting anonymity.
According to the second person mentioned above, pricing will be key to its success since one section of the users are first-time customers and getting the vehicle financed is a problem initially.
“The LCV segment will get a lot of traction if an electric powertrain is introduced as these run within towns and cities and if the government decides to subsidize, fleet owners will buy electric variants,"" said Puneet Gupta, associate director, vehicle forecast, IHS Markit."

Mumbai: India’s top car makers reported an 11.72% growth in sales in March, boosted by strong semi-urban and rural demand. The top five passenger car makers—Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, and Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd—sold 240,850 units during the month, up from 215,576 units a year ago. 
Mumbai: India’s top car makers reported an 11.72% growth in sales in March, boosted by strong semi-urban and rural demand. The top five passenger car makers—Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, and Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd—sold 240,850 units during the month, up from 215,576 units a year ago.
Auto makers in India count dispatches to dealerships as car sales. It is typically observed in March that auto firms dispatch more to their dealerships in a bid to liquidate unsold stock before closing accounts for the fiscal year.
Volume growth marginally surpassed analysts’ expectations as demand from non-metro geographies rebounded strongly post the low of demonetization, an analyst said.
“Since the past two to three quarters, we have seen significant traction coming back from the rural markets. They will continue to drive volumes ahead,"" said Subrata Ray, senior vice-president and group head (corporate sector ratings) at Icra Ltd.
However, if one looks at company-wise data, car sales growth has been markedly stark this month.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest passenger car maker, reported a 15.01% jump in sales from a year earlier to 133,481 units, led by growth across segments. 
The utility vehicle (UV) segment led the way with a 24.3% jump to 22,764; driven by sales of Vitara Brezza and S-Cross models.
Sales of old workhorses Alto and WagonR rose 21.1% to 37,511 units while the compact car segment comprising the Baleno, Swift and Ignis hatchbacks also boosted sales with a 13.5% rise over the year ago to 68,885 units. 
Maruti has sustained a positive growth trend during the month, as it has during the fiscal, on the back of well-planned model launches that helped take its market share over 50% this fiscal, said an analyst on condition of anonymity.
“No other OEM (original equipment manufacturer) has been able to time and understand the Indian car buyer like Maruti has,"" this analyst added.
Hyundai clocked 48,009 units in sales, a 7.27% rise over the year ago, on the back of strong models such as the Verna sedan and Creta. The local subsidiary of the South Korean automaker posted its highest-ever domestic volumes at 5,36,241 units, a growth of 5.2% during this fiscal.
Sales at Mahindra came in at 26,555 units, a 4.04% rise over the year ago. Rajan Wadhera, president of the automotive division at M&M, is confident of increasing market share in the UV segment on the back of three “critical"" launches lined up during fiscal year 2019.
During fiscal year 2018, the Mumbai-based auto conglomerate sold 549,154 cars, an 8.2% rise over the year ago, selling over 500,000 units after a gap of five years, the company said in a press release on Monday.
Tata Motors posted a 31.3% rise in sales to 20,266 units during the month on the back of increasing demand for SUVs Nexon and Hexa as the utility vehicle segment grew by 223%, showing a trend of growing customer base for the segment, the company said in a press release on Sunday. 
Demand was also driven by the Tiago hatchback and Tigor compact sedan, but the overall passenger car segment declined by 4%, the company added.
Fiscal year 2018 was a roller-coaster ride for the automobile industry. Even as the lows of demonetisation were beginning to wear off at the beginning of the fiscal, the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) put the brakes on sales mid-year. Nevertheless, sales of passenger cars and utility vehicles grew at a healthy pace, clocking low double-digit growth.
Going forward, Icra has forecast a 9-10% growth in passenger vehicle sales for fiscal year 2019, Ray said. New model launches, in addition to sustained demand from non-metro areas, are expected to drive volumes for auto OEMs, he added."

Mahindra Electric, the electric mobility portfolio of Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), said the tie up is aimed at promoting shared and cleaner mobility. The vehicles under the deal are financed as part of an agreement between Zoomcar and Mahindra Finance, which will see Zoomcar obtain customised EV financing.
 “Mahindra’s commitment towards electric mobility continues. Our aim is to make EVs more mass adaptable in India in public transport, shared mobility and personal vehicles,"" Mahindra Electric CEO Mahesh Babu said. 
Mahindra group has e2o plus, e-Verito and e-Supro vehicles in its electric vehicle portfolio. Speaking on the occasion, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said the future of world belongs to shared, connected and zero waste mobility and we are driving this with the government with all our energy, but this massive revolution and cleaning up of Delhi in terms of air quality is not possible without private sector collaboration. 
“In Niti Aayog, we have provided charging stations as the need for the government is to ensure that there are vast number of charging stations all over and we are infact moving towards having all electric vehicles,"" he added.

Mumbai: Shares of Axis Bank Ltd on Tuesday gained 5.4%, the most in more than five months, on speculation that India’s third largest private lender could be a potential acquisition target after its board accepted managing director Shikha Sharma’s plea to cut her fourth three-year term to seven months. 
Mumbai: Shares of Axis Bank Ltd on Tuesday gained 5.4%, the most in more than five months, on speculation that India’s third largest private lender could be a potential acquisition target after its board accepted managing director Shikha Sharma’s plea to cut her fourth three-year term to seven months.
Sharma, who joined Axis Bank in 2009, will now step down on 31 December. Her fourth term as managing director and chief executive was originally set to end in June 2021.
“Our assessment suggests that Axis Bank will have to look for an external CEO. We believe this presents a great opportunity for Kotak Bank to acquire one of the largest liability/retail asset franchises,"" Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
Shares of Axis Bank touched a 16-month high of Rs627.50 on 23 January, but have eroded 13% since then.
In an interview to Bloomberg in November, Kotak Mahindra Bank managing director Uday Kotak had said the bank was open to acquisitions.
“We are pretty open to acquisitions as long as they make strategic sense, are value-accretive and are a good cultural fit,"" Kotak said.
According to Nomura, at current prices, the deal would be more than 40% accretive to the EPS/BPS (earnings per share/book value per share) of Kotak Bank.
“This should make it possible for Kotak Bank to offer some premium to Axis Bank shareholders to make the deal attractive to Axis Bank minority shareholders,"" Nomura analysts said, adding that the deal would be more than 25% accretive for Kotak Bank even after paying a 10-30% premium for Axis Bank.
A Kotak Mahindra Bank spokesperson said the bank does not comment on rumours and speculation. An Axis Bank spokesperson did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said it continues to prefer Axis Bank to ICICI Bank Ltd.
“We recommend a positive outlook for the stock. The stock has corrected 11% in the last three months vs ~3% correction for the broader market index,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note on Monday.
“We believe this captures a fair amount of bad news in the Mar ’18 quarter. If indeed the bank undertakes a clean-up exercise, we believe the H2FY19 outlook and beyond should improve dramatically,"" Jefferies added.
Larger rival ICICI Bank also saw its shares rise 3% on Tuesday, taking respite from rating agency Fitch Ratings’ comments on Monday that the bank’s rating is underpinned by relatively strong capitalization and profitability, and its core capitalisation would remain strong even if the Videocon loan in question were completely written off. 
The ratings agency, however, said the allegations did pose “reputational risks"" to the bank. 
The allegation relates to a loan to Videocon Group, whose controlling shareholder co-founded a separate company with the husband of ICICI Bank’s CEO Chanda Kochhar. A significant portion of the loan has since become non-performing."

Mumbai: Shares of private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd on Monday beat India’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) for the first time to become the second most valued bank in the country.
Data from BSE showed that Kotak Mahindra Bank has a market capitalization of  ₹ ,22970.40 crore, after its shares closed 1.88% on Monday to record high of  ₹ 1170.05. Earlier in the day, Kotak Mahindra Bank shares climbed 2.22% to an all-time high of  ₹ ,174 apiece. So far this year it gained 16%.
SBI market capitalization stood at Rs2,22,043.74 crore. Its shares were trading at Rs248.80 on BSE, down 1% from its previous close.
HDFC Bank Ltd remained country’s most valuable bank with a market capitalization of Rs5.04 trillion.
Investors buying shares of Uday Kotak-promoted lender Kotak Mahindra Bank due to a continued improvement in business growth, stable asset quality with net non preforming assets of 1% ratio and negligible restructured assets. Investors also expects that going ahead its non banking operations will continue to give robust growth in future.
“Kotak Bank has undoubtedly proven its competitive edge over its private sector peers with higher fee income, superior asset quality management and effective management of financial business arms. It continues to witness moderation in SMA-2 balance, which clearly suggests a stable trend on asset quality front. Looking ahead, we expect strong traction in earnings to continue owing to robust growth in loan book, moderate credit cost and healthy margins,"" said HDFC Securities in a 19 January note.
Of the 37 brokers tracking the Kotak Mahindra Bank stock on Bloomberg, as many as 26 recommended a “buy"" rating, four asked its investors to “sell"" the stock and 7 have a “hold"" rating.
Shares of SBI along with other public sector banks fell after Punjab National Bank on 14 February reported that it detected fraudulent banking transaction at one of its branches in Mumbai.
After the PNB fraud came to light, SBI shares declined nearly 10%, while Nifty PSU Bank index slumped 18.4%. Since then many banks reported exposure to this fraud and police arrested various public sector bank employees and top management of private sector.
SBI stock had already been under pressure after the bank reported a surprise loss of Rs2,416 crore for December quarter as its bad loans and provisions spiked.
“SBI earning for December quarter underscores the challenges in asset quality albeit moderation in the pace of NPL accrual. The group would benefit from the NPL resolution underway through insolvency proceedings. However, the overhang from stressed assets not recognised as impaired, headwinds to margin outlook in the near term, and moderation in growth imply protracted time for the group to deliver normalised level of earnings and profitability,"" said brokerage firm IIFL Institutional Equities in a 12 February note.

Mumbai: Tractor maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) on Tuesday joined the elite club of companies that have seen their market capitalization soar past Rs1 trillion after its shares closed at a record high.
Mahindra shares gained as much as 2.23% to hit an intraday high of Rs819.10 a share on BSE. At closing, its market cap stood at Rs1.01 trillion. The script closed at Rs809.60 apiece on the BSE, up 1.05% from its previous close, while India’s benchmark Sensex index rose 0.26% to 34,395.06 points.
The company also became the second most valued automaker in India. Its market cap is now higher than Tata Motors Ltd, Eicher Motors Ltd and Bajaj Auto Ltd. India’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd remained nation’s most valuable automaker with market cap of Rs2.77 trillion.
Analysts expect M&M shares to have robust buying interest as sales of tractors are likely to continue growing at a healthy pace in the current fiscal year owing to higher government spending on rural economy and infrastructure ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha elections. A good monsoon is also likely to buttress tractor sales.
Moreover, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday that India will have a normal monsoon which is likely to boost crop prices (as determined by the minimum support price offered by the government) and rural income. IMD also said that there is very less probability of experiencing a deficit monsoon. Rainfall will be 97% of the 50-year average with a 54% probability that rains will be normal to above normal.
“In 2Ws/tractors, rural demand momentum remains strong. News flow on good monsoons and double-digit minimum-support prices’ (MSP) hike in summer crops can be additional catalyst to watch out for,"" said Nomura Research in a 12 April note.
M&M has reported a 46.23% jump in total tractor sales at 28,277 units in March from 19,337 units a year ago. For the fiscal 2018, it sold over 3 lakh tractors in the domestic market, its best ever performance in a financial year with growth of 22% from a year ago.
The company holds 42.9% market share in the domestic tractor market and accounts for 30% of revenue and 50% of profit.
According to brokerage firm Jefferies India, M&M is trading at 12 times of its one year forward estimates, which is at a significant discount to its peers.
Of the 42 brokers tracking the Mahindra stock on Bloomberg, as many as 40 recommended a “buy"" rating and 2 have a “hold"" rating.
The company has not announced yet its earnings date for March quarter. However, brokerage firm Nomura Research expects revenues to increase by 27% year-on-year led by strong 25% YoY growth in overall volumes.

New Delhi:Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd is boosting production capacity to manufacture locally-developed light combat aircraft, even as it strikes a strategic tie-up with American major Boeing Co. to bid to make F/A-18 fighter jets in India.
Although the public sector aircraft maker has fallen behind on deliveries of the first group of 40 ‘Tejas’ planes ordered in 2013, it’s awaiting a fresh order from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to manufacture 83 extra aircraft.
“The government believes the Tejas is required for the air force,"" Hindustan Aeronautics chairman and managing director T. Suvarna Raju said in an interview in Chennai on 13 April.
Since January 2015, HAL has delivered just eight Tejas aircraft to the Air Force. Still, Raju said the jets have passed all tests to prepare them for a two-front threat from China and Pakistan. “All the eight aircraft were flown three sorties each during the ongoing nationwide air warfare exercises,"" Raju said.
The Modi government approved an 13.81 billion rupee ($210 million) plan on 15 March, 2017 to ramp up production of the Tejas jets at HAL from the existing capacity for eight aircraft a year to 16 aircraft. At present, it’s able to produce just six Tejas aircraft a year.
On 12 April, HAL signed up with Boeing and Indian major Mahindra Defence Systems Ltd to jointly offer the F/A-18 to both the Indian Air Force and the Navy. American Lockheed Martin Corp. and Swedish Saab AB are also competing for the $15-billion Air Force tender for 110 jets. The Indian Navy initiated its own 57-jet procurement process in January 2017.
The additional 83 Tejas aircraft would fetch an order worth 500 billion rupees to add the company’s 690 billion rupee order book. HAL is also awaiting orders from the Indian armed forces for 73 of its Dhruv helicopters, and 200 Kamov OAO helicopters, to be produced jointly with Russia. Bloomberg."

Mumbai: In a bid to regain lost ground in the utility vehicle (UV) segment, home-grown auto conglomerate Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd has adopted an aggressive pricing strategy for the third-generation model of its XUV500 SUV (sport utility vehicle), launched Wednesday. 
Mumbai: In a bid to regain lost ground in the utility vehicle (UV) segment, home-grown auto conglomerate Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd has adopted an aggressive pricing strategy for the third-generation model of its XUV500 SUV (sport utility vehicle), launched Wednesday.
Introduced with a base price of Rs12.32 lakh (ex-showroom, Mumbai), the facelift costs almost Rs50,000 less than the on-road price of the outgoing second-generation variant.
However, the company did not cite market share losses as the primary reason behind the competitive pricing.
“Pricing is not a decision taken only for (gains in) market share; Mahindra is known for providing the best value to customers. There is a combination of things that will lead to a rise in market share, not just pricing,"" said Veejay Nakra, senior vice-president, sales and marketing, at the firm.
Nevertheless, Nakra conceded that the sales figures would “go up substantially based on the price and value built in"".
The maker of the popular Scorpio and Bolero SUVs has steadily lost market share in the UV segment, from 55.59% in fiscal 2012 to 25.38% in the 2018 fiscal, according to data provided by industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam).
Competitors such as Hyundai Motor India Ltd and Maruti Suzuki India Ltd capitalised on an increasing consumer preference for petrol SUVs over their diesel counterparts, which is Mahindra’s mainstay, thus resulting in significant market share losses for Mahindra.
During the 2018 fiscal, the company’s UV segment sales grew at 5.1% year-on-year, lagging behind the broader UV segment’s 20.97%. The growth can largely be attributed to buoyant sales of the Scorpio and Bolero on the back of a broad-based rural recovery in the past four to six months.
While Mahindra has been working towards on the development of three new petrol engines by 2020 to increase the mix of petrol models in its overall portfolio, the Mumbai-based automaker will continue to hold diesel as the fuel of choice, according to Rajan Wadhera, president of the automotive division at the firm.
“The development of petrol engines is on track; we will be fully prepared to give all our products with petrol and diesel engines as required (by customers),"" Wadhera said, adding that “there is no reason why diesel shouldn’t continue as it is. Many customers still want the torque of a diesel engine"".
Wadhera is confident of meeting the Bharat Stage VI (BS6) emission norms by 1 April 2020 for both petrol and diesel engines, while insisting that diesel would be the cleaner fuel post BS6.
Close to Rs150 crore was spent on the third generation XUV500, which comes with new engine settings to enhance torque and power, in addition to features such as a quieter cabin, cruise control, and a tyre pressure and temperature monitoring system.
On the question of maintaining margins on the new model, Wadhera said it was not a cause of worry as the company’s “value engineering efforts helped reduce the price, consequently packing in more technology and features, while remaining competitive"".
Analysts say the refreshed XUV500 may not drive volumes because of its relatively high-end positioning within the SUV segment. 
“Only a facelift cannot drive volumes like a new product, especially within the SUV segment. Beaides, the XUV500 is not a volume product, like the Bolero or Scorpio,"" said an analyst on condition of anonymity.
Mahindra needs a broad-based improvement, including a revamp of the Scorpio and Bolero, this analyst said, while conceding that this particular model can help gain share within its sub-segment as it caters to tier-1 and 2 cities where customers are increasingly upgrading to larger cars.
To be sure, Mahindra has three entirely new product launches lined up during the fiscal, which could potentially drive volumes, in addition to sharing vehicular architecture platforms with Ford Motor Co. and its Korean subsidiary Ssangyong Motor Co. Sharing platforms brings costs down to a third of the original and reduces lead times of model development to two years from four, according to Wadhera."

Mumbai: Private equity fund Kedaara Capital Investment Managers Ltd is in final stages of discussions to acquire Rajasthan-based auto component maker Sunbeam Auto Ltd for $100 million (Rs650 crore), two people aware of the development said.
The Munjal family-owned Sunbeam designs, manufactures and sells automotive aluminium die casting components. A leading supplier to the automobile industry in India and globally, its customers include Hero MotoCorp Ltd, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Sona Koyo Steering Sytems Ltd, Daimler Chrysler AG of Germany, Robert Bosch Corp. and Continental Automotive Systems.
In 2010, the Munjals of the Hero group divided their business empire among the families of the four patriarchs—Brijmohan Lall Munjal, Om Prakash Munjal, Satyanand Munjal and the late Dayanand Munjal. Ashok Munjal, son of Dayanand Munjal, the eldest in the first generation, got Sunbeam Auto and currently serves as the managing director.
EY India is advising Sunbeam Auto’s management on the sale.
Emails sent to spokespersons at Sunbeam Auto, EY and Kedaara Capital were not answered.
Set up in 1986 to make aluminium die cast components for the two-wheeler industry, Sunbeam diversified into the four-wheeler segment in association with Maruti Udyog Ltd (now Maruti Suzuki India Ltd) in 1994.
If the deal materializes, this would be Kedaara’s second investment in an auto parts maker. Kedaara used to own Bill Forge, and sold it to Mahindra CIE Automotive for Rs1,330 crore in a cash and stock deal in 2016.
The domestic auto component industry is expected to post a growth of 9%-11% for FY18, led by demand from passenger vehicle and two wheeler makers, said a December 2017 note by Icra Ltd.
“Auto component as a sector is witnessing a lot of activity in the past couple of years after a slump witnessed in years before that,"" said Nitish Poddar, partner and national leader of private equity at KPMG India.
There is more and more financial sponsor interest in auto components now and is largely driven by more attractive valuations, export potential, global reach of Indian auto comp manufacturers and strong demographics in the domestic market, he added.
Anticipating the higher growth in automobile industry, private equity firms are actively pursuing investment opportunities. US fund Blackstone has acquired Chennai-based Comstar Automotive Technologies for Rs1,000 crore.
Kedaara was founded in 2011 by former Temasek Holdings Pte India head Manish Kejriwal, along with Sunish Sharma and Nishant Sharma, who were managing director and principal respectively of global private equity firm General Atlantic in India.
The firm raised its debut fund of $540 million in 2013 and has made major investments in Spandana Sphoorty Financial Ltd, Vedant Fashions (Manyavar), Vijaya Diagnostics, Bill Forge, AU Small Finance Bank and Mahindra Logistics. Last year, Kedaara Capital raised $750 million for its second fund."

When urban heritage locations have to be preserved there are usually three possible paths forward. The first simply requires the local government to take charge of the site and maintain it through public funds. In this case, the site could be preserved as a museum which allows the public to view it in its pristine form and function. 
When urban heritage locations have to be preserved there are usually three possible paths forward. The first simply requires the local government to take charge of the site and maintain it through public funds. In this case, the site could be preserved as a museum which allows the public to view it in its pristine form and function.
The second path involves a wealthy philanthropist adopting and subsidizing the site and preserving it as a museum or weaving in a vibrant and relevant activity that has a commercial logic. The Frick Collection museum in New York City is a great example of this option.
The third and final path, and a relatively unexplored one, is when citizens come together and ‘crowdsource’ funds and competencies to maintain the location.
The third path, which has recently been facilitated through digital and social media is, in my opinion, the most exciting. This is because it empowers local citizens and gives them a sense of control over the destiny of their city and the preservation of its history. That sense of empowerment also makes it more feasible to build in a contemporary, commercial activity because the interest and attendance of the public is more likely in this situation. 
However, the new commercial activity cannot simply mimic the past. After all, the past activity’s irrelevance is what probably led to the decline of the venue. Hence one has to search for the core of what the venue stood for, and attempt to resurrect it in a contemporary avatar.
In the case of Rhythm House, its core purpose was to disseminate the joy of music. That purpose does not require that the new avatar should simply sell CDs instead of records. It means that the experience of music is what people should still enjoy in the venue. 
If we get the opportunity to preserve the location, we will attempt to curate the right experiences that will draw people to it and through doing so, also preserve the music-loving community that Rhythm House had built.
As told to Sanjukta Sharma."
508,2018-04-19,Mahindra Mahindra,"Within the light commercial vehicles (LCV) segment, Ashok Leyland currently lags Mahindra and Mahindra and Tata Motors by over 100,000 units in sales

Mumbai: The Hinduja Group flagship, Chennai-based Ashok Leyland, plans to redesign its light commercial vehicles (LCVs) to serve the fast-growing Indian e-commerce industry’s last-mile delivery needs, according to a senior company executive. 
Mumbai: The Hinduja Group flagship, Chennai-based Ashok Leyland, plans to redesign its light commercial vehicles (LCVs) to serve the fast-growing Indian e-commerce industry’s last-mile delivery needs, according to a senior company executive.
LCVs are defined by industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) as vehicles having a maximum mass under 7.5 tonnes. The move puts India’s second-largest truck maker, with a no-discount policy for this segment, in direct competition with Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles Ltd (VECV), among others.
Online retailers, who outsource transportation to third-party logistics providers, require LCVs to have a wider and taller loading area (at the rear of the vehicle) to accommodate larger, but not necessarily heavier, cartons.
“One of the areas we are working on is to make our rear body area wider and taller to accommodate larger volumes of goods which are primarily sold by e-commerce companies, meaning white goods which are larger in size but not proportionately heavy,"" Nitin Seth, president of the LCV division at Ashok Leyland, said in an interview last week.
The effective working of the hub-and-spoke model (a pared-down network in which smaller centres are connected to large distribution stations) post the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) prompted the move as well.
“LCVs are the biggest beneficiary of GST. We saw much higher growth in the second half of the fiscal, a good part of which came from GST,"" Seth said.
“The hub-and-spoke model, which was the intention of the GST, is coming into play very, very effectively in the market as the truck can carry loads from the hub more effectively and the LCV serves the spokes (in last-mile deliveries),"" Seth added.
For the 2018 fiscal, Ashok Leyland’s LCV sales (of goods carriers) grew 34.07% to 41,156 units, according to Siam data. Within this segment, the company falls behind Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd by over a lakh units in sales.
Seth did not spell out the quantum of this growth that could be attributed to the e-commerce industry because the vehicles are not directly bought from original equipment makers, though he added that the market was seeing good traction in “purchases of hub-and spoke-models with higher capacity"".
To be sure, the company already caters to the e-commerce industry with the Dost+, launched in September last year with a higher tonnage and a larger and wider loading area.
Analysts say there is scope for growth within the LCV segment, especially when catering to the e-commerce industry.
“E-commerce, education, hospitals and hospitality are driving LCV sales. Ashok Leyland should bank on these and keep growing its LCV division at 25-30% for the next two to three years to achieve significant volumes,"" said Shaukat Ali, an analyst with Quantum Securities Ltd.
Though the LCV segment is getting crowded, there is scope for growth with product differentiation because it is not mature yet, Ali added.
Competition to cater to e-tailers is set to heat up. VECV is set to increase its thrust on the e-commerce industry. 
“This is a segment which no company worth its salt can afford to overlook. We are absolutely focused and clearly want to have a customer preference being given,"" said Shyam Maller, senior vice-president of sales and marketing at VECV. 
Late last year, VECV created close to 10 variants to cater to e-commerce transportation based on a combination of three cargo body lengths and as many payload-carrying capacities.
Ashok Leyland also aims to grow its LCV numbers by exporting to “very developed markets such as the Gulf and Russia"" during the next two fiscal years with the development of left-hand drive vehicles.
“The broader strategy is to introduce more products across categories and expand the distribution network as we address only 38% of the LCV market,"" Seth said.
The target is not to remain a small player, he added.
More variants in the Dost range are to be expected every quarter with Rs400 crore allocated to the LCV division late last year.
Analysts say the emphasis on diversification between divisions and markets will help Ashok Leyland beat the cyclicality and stiff competition in the domestic medium and heavy commercial vehicles market."

Mumbai: India might need 167 fighter jets worth more than Rs1 trillion, the order process for which could be completed in the next 12-18 months, a top executive at Mahindra Group said, as it prepares to bid for some of the military orders on the cards.
The Anand Mahindra-led Mahindra group recently tied up with The Boeing Co. and state-controlled Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd to build a new assembly line for manufacturing F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets.
“The government has already come out with tender process for 110 fighter jets, and navy also has requirement for another 57 jets. So total requirement appears to be 167 jets at this stage,"" said S.P. Shukla, group president, aerospace, defence and steel, at Mahindra Group, and member group executive board.
“The government’s plans to place orders are likely to be valued over Rs100,000 crore (Rs1 trillion),"" Shukla said, adding the supply of these fighter jets may be spread over three-seven years after the placement of orders, depending upon requirements and scheduling.
The F/A-18 Super Hornet’s ‘Make in India’ proposal is to build an entirely new state-of-the-art production facility and develop an ecosystem around it that can be utilized for other programmes like India’s Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) program, Boeing had said in a statement earlier this month.
The government has come out with Request for Information (RFI) for the fighter jets, which will be followed by Request for Proposal (RFP), product evaluation process, and opening of commercial bidding, Shukla said.
“The whole process is expected to take about 12-18 months before the order is awarded."" 
Shukla said government tenders and requirements don’t always lead to the exact same number of purchases.
“Hence, what we are talking about is estimated requirements and not the exact order sizes,"" he said.
The joint venture to produce F/1-18 Super Hornet fighter jets will keep its costs competitive in order to win the bid, Shukla added.
News agency Bloomberg had in February reported that India is planning to revise the specifications for one of the world’s biggest fighter jet orders, a move that would allow manufacturers such as Boeing and United Aircraft Corp. to pitch their twin-engine combat aircraft.
The report, quoting unnamed officials, added that the government has asked the Indian Air Force if the search for fighterjets could be expanded to include twin-engine aircraft after Lockheed Martin Corp. and Saab AB were the only ones left in the fray with single-engine products that met the earlier norms.
The Bloomberg new report stated the country’s armed forces would require as many as 400 single- and double engine combat aircraft.
During August 2007, the then Indian government under the erstwhile Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) signed an agreement with France’s Dassault Aviation SA to buy 126 Rafale jets for $11 billion. However, with talks stalling over price and quality guarantees, the current government subsequently scrapped the purchase and bought 36 jets separately.
Mahindra Group, which has a joint venture with French aviation major Airbus to produce military helicopters in India, is also waiting for the Indian Navy to finalize its decision on military helicopter procurement.
“The company’s joint venture with Airbus for production of military helicopters could see its first customers in Indian navy, which is expected to make a final decision on procurement of military helicopters in the next 12-18 months,"" Shukla said.
“We estimate that the government is looking at procurement numbers which will be in three digits,"" Shukla said adding the future orders for combat helicopters could come from any wing of the armed forces—the navy, the army and the air force."

Mumbai: Automobile companies are set to report strong revenue and operating profit growth in the March quarter because of a revival in rural demand and a low-base effect following the negative impact of demonetisation that lasted well into the fourth quarter of the previous financial year.  
Mumbai: Automobile companies are set to report strong revenue and operating profit growth in the March quarter because of a revival in rural demand and a low-base effect following the negative impact of demonetisation that lasted well into the fourth quarter of the previous financial year. 
Most auto makers are also expected to report expansion in margins from a year earlier as they raised prices, according to estimates of four brokerages—HDFC Securities, Emkay Securities, Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities, IIFL institutional equities.
Sales of two-wheelers have increased 25% in the quarter ended 31 March, driven by higher demand for commuter motorcycles. Sales of commercial vehicles rose 29% because of increased spending on infrastructure development by the government and easier availability of finance options for small and light commercial vehicles. 
Input prices continued to rise during the quarter—prices of steel sheets, used to make vehicles, increased by 12.5%.
Operating margins of vehicle makers, except Tata Motors Ltd, are expected to widen for the third straight quarter, according to analyst estimates. Among two-wheeler makers, Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp may report operating margin expanded in the fourth quarter.
The revival in sales of commercial vehicle, motorcycle and tractor sales during the quarter will boost earnings of companies including Mahindra and Mahindra, Ashok Leyland, Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto. 
With strong volume growth and operating leverage benefits coming in the fourth quarter, companies are expected to report improvement in margins correspondingly, according to Gaurant Dadwal and Vivek Sarin, analysts at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities.
“Ashok Leyland’s topline is expected to increase by 33% driven by 23% jump in volumes and 10% increase in average selling price. Ebitda (operating) margin to expand by 120 bps sequentially led by operating leverage benefit and favourable mix,"" HDFC Securities analysts said in a research note. Most brokerages expect substantial improvement in the standalone earnings of Tata Motors, driven by the recovery in commercial and passenger vehicle sales during the quarter."

Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd has asked the dedicated bankruptcy court conducting insolvency proceedings against Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd to include it in the list of “assenting"" lenders in favour of the resolution plan submitted offered jointly by JSW Steel Ltd and AION Capital Partners Ltd. 
Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd has asked the dedicated bankruptcy court conducting insolvency proceedings against Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd to include it in the list of “assenting"" lenders in favour of the resolution plan submitted offered jointly by JSW Steel Ltd and AION Capital Partners Ltd.
On Tuesday, senior counsel Darius Khambata, representing Kotak Mahindra Bank, said the bank, an unsecured financial lender to Monnet Ispat and Energy, was among the dissenting unsecured financial creditors until now but would now want to be an “assenter"", or part of the lenders who have approved the resolution plan.
“We are an unsecured financial creditor with a claim of around Rs73 crore. However, if we become an ‘assenter’, we may get to recover around Rs3-3.5 crore,"" said Khambata. “This will not change anything in the resolution plan that has been submitted since the resolution plan has been passed by about 98% majority approval from the committee of creditors,"" he added.
After hearing arguments, the division bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) comprising B.S.V. Prakash Kumar and Ravi Kumar Duraisamy directed the bank to file an affidavit in this regard and posted the hearing for 25 April.
The bench observed that any decision on a change in Kotak Mahindra Bank’s status after the 270-day deadline and submission of the plan to NCLT could set a precedent.
“The admitted claims towards Monnet Ispat & Energy are about Rs11,400 crore, while the liquidated value of the company stands at around Rs2,365 crore,"" argued Ravi Kadam, senior counsel representing the resolution professional in the matter.
“The lenders stand to take around 75% haircut in the matter,"" he added.
At the beginning of the month, the tribunal had directed the resolution professional of Monnet Ispat and Energy to include the claims of ICICI Bank (Rs486 crore), IFCI Ltd (Rs158 crore) and Standard Chartered Bank (Rs147 crore) in the steelmaker’s bankruptcy proceedings.
Monnet Ispat is part of the first lot of 12 large non-performing loans referred by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for early resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) last year.
A consortium of AION Capital Partners and JSW Steel Ltd has made a binding offer for Monnet Ispat which was approved by the committee of creditors. AION Capital holds a 70% stake in the consortium while JSW Steel holds the rest.
If the plan gets approved by the Mumbai bench of NCLT, this will be the second resolution plan from the so-called first list of RBI. On 17 April, NCLT Kolkata had approved the resolution plan submitted by Vedanta Ltd for Electrosteel Steels."
503,2018-04-25,Mahindra Mahindra,"The telecom sector fetched about 56% of the company's revenues in 2017-18, up from 48% in 2016-17, says Hemant Sikka, president, Powerol and spares business, Mahindra

Mumbai: Diesel generator maker Mahindra Powerol Ltd, which depends significantly on the telecom sector, is expanding into the infrastructure sector in an attempt to de-risk its business. 
Mumbai: Diesel generator maker Mahindra Powerol Ltd, which depends significantly on the telecom sector, is expanding into the infrastructure sector in an attempt to de-risk its business.
The company on Monday launched three high-capacity diesel generator sets (400, 500 and 625 kVA) aimed at commercial establishments such as data centres, shopping malls, hospitals and hotels, besides mining and road-building. The diesel engines are being sourced from UK-based Perkins Engines Co. Ltd.
The telecom sector fetched about 56% of the company’s revenues in 2017-18, up from 48% in 2016-17, said Hemant Sikka, president, Powerol and spares business, Mahindra.
The company clocked Rs1,400 crore revenue in 2017-18, up 10% from a year ago, Sikka added.
The company, which claims to have command 75% share of the sub-75 kVA generator market, first entered the infrastructure sector with two medium-capacity generators (250 and 325 kVA) in November 2017. The two gensets were developed at a cost of Rs170 crore. Sikka said the two gensets were “extremely well-accepted"" but declined to share their contribution to revenue growth because production is still being ramped up. The company plans to secure a double-digit market share in the mid and high capacity ranges within the next two years, he added.
With this, Mahindra Powerol now covers close to 98% of the broader genset market in terms of volumes, up from 70% before, Sikka claimed. 
The market opportunity for gensets above 250kVA is worth  ₹ 700 crore, Sikka said, while adding this segment is yet to mature and will witness “galloping"" growth in the immediate future.
“Higher kVA gensets were the white space for us. With these launches, there are absolutely no gaps in the product portfolio,"" Sikka said, while adding that he expects Powerol to outpace the broader genset industry, led by higher offtake in medium and high-capacity generators.
The sub-82.5 kVA segment, described as mature by Sikka, grew under 5% in the 2017 fiscal, according to a company presentation, while the market for higher-capacity gensets (above 82.5 kVA) grew over 16% during the same period.
“The 500 kVA node is very critical because we can even satisfy demand by customers who want 1 or 2 mVA of secondary power. This is a node which will help us scale up our business very fast"".
Sikka estimates the broader genset industry to grow at an annual average rate of about 10% this fiscal. 
Some factors behind the optimism are a weak power distribution grid, which necessitates a secondary source of power especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), in addition to increased government investment in infrastructure and the Smart Cities mission and higher GDP growth spurring manufacturing and private investment.
Mahindra Powerol, a unit of Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd, claims to be the overall market leader in terms of volumes with a 20% share, and a 16% share in terms of value. 
The expansion into high-capacity gensets puts Powerol in direct competition with established players such as Cummins Group and Kirloskar Oil Engines Ltd, in a segment that Sikka calls “heavily contested"".
Going forward, the company will not launch gensets with higher capacities but will work on developing more gas-based gensets within the next three to four months. Mahindra Powerol claims to have launched India’s first gas-based genset in March, with a capacity of 125kVA. The launch will help the company better address the New Delhi and NCR markets where the Supreme Court had banned diesel generators this winter, owing to poor air quality."

Market sentiment would also be driven by Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data for the manufacturing and services sectors due this week. 
“Going ahead, the focus would be on corporate earnings, bond yields (US as well as in India) and crude price.

Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd Monday reported an over 15% jump in March quarter net profit, boosted by higher net interest income and other income.  
Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd Monday reported an over 15% jump in March quarter net profit, boosted by higher net interest income and other income. 
Net profit for the quarter stood at Rs1,124.05 crore against Rs976.48 crore a year ago, the bank said. A Bloomberg poll of 11 analysts had expected the bank to post a net profit of Rs1,170.20 crore. 
Net interest income (NII), or the core income a bank earns by giving loans, increased 19.4% to Rs2,579.75 crore, versus Rs2,161.37 crore last year. Other income stood at Rs1,151.63 crore, up 14.86% from Rs1,002.65 crore a year ago. 
Uday Kotak, who has been re-designated as managing director and chief executive officer, said the profit growth would have been even higher, had it not been for the one-time hit of Rs82 crore related to employee costs from change in gratuity limits. 
Provisions and contingencies rose 14.8% to Rs306.91 crore from Rs267.37 crore a year ago. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, they rose 44.24% from Rs212.77 crore. 
Kotak said overall provisioning costs, which fell to 56 basis points in the previous fiscal from 61 basis points a year before, is expected to fall further. However, this will also depend on the movement in the bond market. 
Gross non-performing assets rose to Rs3,825.38 crore at 31 March from Rs3,578.61 crore in the same quarter last year. 
The bank reported an improvement in asset quality. 
As a percentage of total loans, gross NPAs stood at 2.22% compared with 2.31% in the previous quarter and 2.59% in the year-ago quarter. Net NPAs were at 0.98% in the March quarter compared to 1.09% in the previous quarter and 1.26% in the same quarter last year. 
On the overall stressed assets situation, Kotak said his group is keen on participating in the auctions of companies under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, but the focus will be on ensuring that such participation will yield a fair risk-return ratio. 
Kotak Realty Fund, along with Cube Highways, has submitted a bid for Jaypee Infratech, one of the 12 cases referred for insolvency proceedings following the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) directive last year. 
Kotak said in cases where banks have received a single bid, the value of that bid is close to liquidation value. However, one must not rule out the resolution of assets via liquidation."

Kolkata: Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Ltd is looking to raise Rs10,000-15,000 crore this fiscal year through various routes including a bond sale, its vice-chairman and managing director Ramesh G. Iyer said on Monday.
The company needs to inject fresh capital to shore up lending to Rs35,000-37,000 crore this year, the same as in the previous year, he added.
Mahindra Financial expects around Rs24,000 crore to come in from repayment of loans. The balance will be raised from banks, sale of bonds and financial institutions, according to Iyer.
The company’s shareholders have already cleared an enabling resolution to raise up to Rs40,000 crore. Mahindra Financial has plans to raise up to $300 million from so-called masala bonds, or rupee-denominated offshore debt instruments, Iyer said.
“In the next couple of weeks, we will know how we are proceeding on that,"" Iyer said, referring to the masala bonds. The company is ready, and it will decide on the overseas bond sale based on interest rate, he added.
Mahindra Financial, which is owned 51.19% by Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, is a rural-focused non-banking financial company that lends for buying tractors, commercial vehicles and pre-owned vehicles.
The company’s subsidiary Mahindra Rural Housing Finance Ltd makes small loans for home improvement. 
This unit, which has a loan of portfolio of around Rs6,700 crore, typically makes loans of Rs1-1.25 lakh repayable over 3-5 years.
It also makes loans for purchase of rural homes but the segment currently accounts for 2-3% of the housing loan portfolio. Going forward, the subsidiary will focus on making bigger loans of Rs6-8 lakh for purchase of affordable homes in rural areas.
This segment by 2020 is expected to account for 15-20% of the housing finance subsidiary’s loan portfolio, according to Iyer."

As if Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd’s shares hadn’t outpaced peers by a big-enough margin already, the stock added another 4% to the tally on Wednesday. Investors just can’t have enough of it, and analysts have had no option but to play catch-up. For instance, Nomura had a “neutral"" rating with a target price of Rs1,150 until 1 May. It has now upgraded to a “buy"" rating with a 12-month target of Rs1,400.

It has now upgraded to a “buy"" rating with a 12-month target of Rs1,400.
This week, sentiment for the lender’s shares got a further boost after the company reported better-than-expected results for its consolidated operations. The March quarter results showed the group’s subsidiaries shouldered the growth in profits while the core banking operations continued to thrust forward, more or less insulated from the bad loan mess some other private sector banks are grappling with. Kotak Mahindra Bank is now the second-most valuable lender in the country, in terms of its market capitalization. 
Consolidated profit rose 27.4% for the fourth quarter, driven by asset management, capital markets and insurance business of the group. 
The share of Kotak Mahindra Bank in total consolidated profit fell to 65% for fiscal year 2018 (FY18) from 69% in the previous year. 
Indeed, what made the market relook at valuations at the group level was the bumper performance by its insurance business. The insurance operations reported a profit growth of 36% for FY18 and the embedded value was pegged at Rs5,824 crore. The group’s other big subsidiaries that include the asset management business and investment banking business also performed well.
On a stand-alone basis, the bank missed Street estimates on net profit growth, which came in at 15% for the quarter as one-time employee expenses ate into profits. Core operating metrics remained robust with net interest income and other income growing 19.4% and 15%, respectively. Asset quality that has set Kotak Mahindra Bank apart from others continues to do so.
Analysts believe that given the strong consolidated performance, the valuation multiples do not look expensive. Besides, with rumours of an acquisition of Axis Bank Ltd refusing to die, the possibility of inorganic growth is another reason investors are excited. What can go wrong?
For Kotak Mahindra Bank, loan growth came from commercial vehicles and unsecured lending, which grew more than 40%. The growth in consolidated profits was led by the capital markets and securities business, which can be cyclical. This leaves the door open for volatility in earnings in FY19 and investors would do well to keep a check on their appetite."

Cape Town: Indian automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd has opened its first assembly plant in South Africa, which it sees as a launchpad to export vehicles to the rest of the continent, the chief executive of its local business said.
The new modular assembly plant, which imports car parts and builds the final product, is located in the east coast city of Durban. It will have an annual capacity of 2,500 pick-up trucks which could be increased to assemble up to 4,000 Mahindra vehicles each year.
India’s top-selling utility vehicle maker will compete against rivals with existing plants in South Africa, whose export-focused auto manufacturing sector has attracted billions of dollars of investment from the likes of BMW AG, Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp. to expand and upgrade factories.
“The last five years was a wonderful time for us,"" said Rajesh Gupta, chief executive of Mahindra SA. “We could demonstrate growth which pushed us into the category of the top five fastest-growing OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) in South Africa,"" he said.
Gupta said the company would push to meet government targets of sourcing 40% of its components, measured in value, from local suppliers and thereby benefit from tax incentives.
The factory started trial production this month, with full production seen in July.
Gupta said other models, such as the Bolero SUV, could eventually be assembled in Durban and exported to sub-Saharan Africa.
Mahindra, which is the world’s largest tractor maker by volume, was also considering introducing its tractors into the South African market.
“Anything that we try to do we will try to localise and assemble them,"" he said, adding that this could include construction equipment and heavy-duty power generator systems."

Tracking the recovery in profitability, shares of Tech Mahindra Ltd have gained a handsome 64% over the last year. The company continued the trend in the March quarter as well with earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) margins expanding both sequentially and compared to a year ago. (See chart). 
Tracking the recovery in profitability, shares of Tech Mahindra Ltd have gained a handsome 64% over the last year. The company continued the trend in the March quarter as well with earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) margins expanding both sequentially and compared to a year ago. (See chart).
Profitability was aided by a better business mix, improvement in utilization, seasonality in certain business segments and a favourable currency. But the key question to ask is: will the existing triggers be sufficient to drive stock performance?
The management still believes it has sufficient margin levers at work such as automation, improvement in performance of the subsidiary companies and optimization of the onshore-offshore workforce mix.
However, improvement in profitability from here on is expected to be rather gradual. 
Margins in the current quarter will be weighed down by wage hikes and seasonal weakness at one of its subsidiary companies. 
In the event of the near term headwinds and only gradual margin improvement, profitability alone cannot be the earnings driver for long. Revenue growth should accelerate. Unfortunately, the outlook on this front remains hazy.
The 1.7% sequential constant currency revenue growth in the March quarter was slightly ahead of Street estimates. 
However segmental performances do not provide any signs of revenue acceleration in the near term. According to analysts, deal sizes remain small and growth in total contract value remains subdued.
The enterprise business continues to do well. 
But the largest business vertical—communications—which generates 43% of Tech Mahindra’s revenues is either flat or seeing a revenue fall (on a year-on-year basis). According to the management, the company has given up some low yield business which impacted revenues.
Even so, the communications division still lacks structural growth drivers. 
Transition to the fifth generation (5G) mobile technologies is expected to open new opportunities. But there is no clarity when the spending will kick in.
The management expects clarity on this to emerge in another year which means near term growth expectations remain more or less unchanged. “Given the fact that revenue growth was in line this quarter, and that expectation of trends in communication and enterprise remains unchanged, our revenue estimates remain where they were,"" Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd said in a note.
True, estimates for margin have seen a slight upgrade. 
But lack of revenue upgrades is a handicap for the stock that has rallied over the last year. 
“We keep our revenue growth estimates intact but increase margin estimates slightly on good execution in FY18. However, the valuation is already capturing the growth prospects,"" Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd said in a note."

Johannesburg: Mahindra’s new semi-knockdown assembly plant in the South African city of Durban is expected to give a boost of more than Rs95 million ($7.7 million) to the economy of the KwaZulu-Natal province. 
The plant in the Dube TradePort Special Economic Zone (SEZ), next to the airport, which was officially opened on Friday by provincial Economic Development MEC Sihle Zikalala and Indian High Commissioner Ruchira Kamboj, has a capacity to produce 4,000 of Mahindra’s two models of its Pik-Up range, known as ‘bakkies’ locally.
Besides sales in South Africa, where the Mahindra pick-up trucks have been gaining ground, the assembly line will also turn out vehicles for export into the rest of Africa.
Speaking at the launch, provincial Economic Development head Zikalala said Mahindra’s decision to establish the assembly plant in KwaZulu-Natal was an indicator of the province’s “rising star in terms of investor confidence."" He added that the issue of unemployment in the region would also be addressed by Mahindra. “Of the 24 staffers to be hired in the new assembly plant‚ we have been assured 80% would be locals that had not been employed before and hopefully this would fit the youth profile‚"" Zikalala said.
He also commended Mahindra for its skills development initiatives, which have already seen scores of South Africans being skilled in India in various fields before returning to jobs at home. “We also acknowledged that the company would be extensively investing in skills development, including sending staff to India to gain more capacities, which would contribute in the expansion of skills base in the province,"" Zikalala said.
Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) would also receive a boost as Mahindra plans to source 40% of components locally. Confirming this, Mahindra South Africa CEO Rajesh Gupta said it was part of Mahindra’s long-term plan to increase employment and help develop local companies through local sourcing. 
Gupta explained how Mahindra’s market share in South Africa had grown exponentially since it first entered the country over a decade ago. “In the last five years alone‚ it has grown its market share by a compound annual growth rate of over 4.6% a year‚ which puts us in the league of the five fastest growing company in the same period. “Much of this growth was achieved in a declining market (for motor vehicles) ‚ which indicates our increased acceptance and popularity in the South Africa market,"" he added."

Goenka is “cautiously optimistic"" about the automobile industry’s performance in 2018-19 on the back of a positive economic environment, stable inflation and interest rates, and expectations of a normal monsoon, though rising crude oil and commodity prices may play spoilsport.
He expects “the momentum of FY18 to continue into this fiscal"" with tractors, passenger and commercial vehicles posting growth upwards of 10%.
While Mahindra’s usual practice was to set aside about Rs10,000 crore every three years, the increment this time around accounts for various developments like the “sustainable luxury car brand"" Automobili Pininfarina, the off-roader Roxor being developed for the US market, new products being planned for the global tractor segment, and compliance with Bharat Stage VI emission norms, Goenka said.
The company is covered in terms of capacity as per its internal planning but expects demand to outstrip its expectations across segments this fiscal, according to Hemant Sikka, chief purchase officer, automotive and farm equipment, at Mahindra.
In response to rising demand in FY18, Sikka undertook a debottlenecking exercise at Mahindra’s plants about six months ago and has resolved “most"" issues. At present, most capacity constraints are being faced by Mahindra’s suppliers, especially for higher tonnage trucks, Sikka said.
“Issues regarding vendor capacities will be resolved within three to four months with the current visibility that businesses are giving us,"" he added."
493,2018-05-29,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra's revenue during Q4 FY18 increased 10.47% to Rs13,307. 88 crore from Rs12,047.58 crore in the year-ago quarter

Mumbai: Utility vehicle and farm equipment maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) on Tuesday reported a 70.33% jump in standalone net profit for the quarter ended March, benefiting from a broader rural recovery which resulted in higher tractor and auto sales. 
Mumbai: Utility vehicle and farm equipment maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) on Tuesday reported a 70.33% jump in standalone net profit for the quarter ended March, benefiting from a broader rural recovery which resulted in higher tractor and auto sales.
Profit rose to Rs1,059.09 crore from Rs621.78 crore a year earlier, while net sales at maker of the Scorpio and XUV5OO, increased 10.47% to Rs13,307.88 crore from Rs12,047.58 crore in the year-ago quarter.
The revenue figures are not comparable to the year-ago owing to the accounting treatment of excise duty under the goods and service tax regime, which was implemented from 1 July, the company said.
M&M had been expected to post a standalone net profit of Rs1,049.1 crore on net sales of Rs13,112.06 crore, according to a Bloomberg poll of 16 analysts.
Managing director Pawan Goenka claimed the company’s automotive sector posted the fastest growth in 21 quarters, while tractors posted the highest growth in 31 quarters, at a press conference on Tuesday.
Revenues from the automotive sector, which accounts for every two out of three rupees M&M earns, rose a marginal 2.6% to Rs9,135.89 crore. The farm equipment segment, which nearly makes up the balance, led revenue growth with a 33.01% jump to Rs3,716.07 crore. Revenues from other segments, such as hospitality and financial services, rose 30.6% to Rs554.26crore, thus making up about 6% of total revenue.
The Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin, a key measure of operating profitability, at the consolidated level rose 3.p percentage points to 15.1% from 11.2% a year ago. 
The margins were aided by a richer product mix, cost optimization and price hikes, said senior executives at the firm.
The margins were about 200 points ahead of estimates, according to Priya Ranjan, vice-president at Systematix Institutional Equities, a Mumbai-based brokerage house. 
Domestic sales were led by tractors, with a 43.6% jump during the quarter to 66,885 units from 46,583 units a year ago, as overall rural and sentiment improved, in addition to two years of consecutively normal monsoons, said managing director Pawan Goenka. 
Total domestic sales in the automotive sector rose 6.4% to 89,568 units from a year ago, on the back of a broader rural recovery, in addition to easy availability of affordable finance.
Within the automotive segment, the company posted an 8.4% increase in UV sales to 67,805 units although its market share has been on a steady decline since fiscal 2013. During the fiscal gone by, the maker of the Bolero lost its pole position in the segment to Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the first time it has closed a financial year in the second position.
Going forward, the Mumbai-based auto conglomerate plans to cement its position in the industry this fiscal with the launch of three new UVs, an intermediate commercial vehicle range, more electric vehicles, and an expansion in dealerships and capacity, said Rajan Wadhera, president of the automotive division at the firm.
Goenka is “cautiously optimistic"" about the industry’s performance this fiscal on the back of a relatively positive economic environment, continuing government support to infrastructure and the rural economy, and expectations of a normal monsoon, though rising crude oil and commodity prices may play spoilsport.
He expects “the momentum of FY18 to continue into this fiscal"" with tractors, passenger and commercial vehicles posting growth upwards of 10%.
Mahindra’s farm equipment division, headed by Rajesh Jejurikar, is looking to focus on the farm machinery and implements business, which Jejurikar sees as “a very big opportunity over the next three years as mechanization levels in farms rise"".
Analysts have a positive outlook on the company given its heavy rural reliance buoyed by expectations of a normal monsoon, in addition to three new UV launches during the fiscal. 
“All the key segments for Mahindra are doing well, including the auto division, but there is still room for improvement there"", said Priya Ranjan of Systematix Institutional Equities.
The segment will be helped by new launches, but the compact SUV (codenamed S201) may not be a game changer because it is already a crowded segment, he added. 
Mahindra and Mahindra shares closed at Rs868.8 apiece on the BSE, up 2.26%, while the benchmark Sensex closed at 34,949.24 points, posting a loss of 0.61%. The results were announced during market hours."
491,2018-05-30,Mahindra Mahindra,"Another key question to be answered in the forthcoming quarters is whether Mahindra can regain market share that has almost halved from over 50%

Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd’s Q4 results coincided with the early onset of the monsoon. It is on the back of good monsoon rainfall in previous years that the company’s coffers have swelled. Its shares rose on Tuesday by 2.3% on a stellar March quarter (Q4) performance. A third year of normal monsoon is good news for Mahindra, whose farm equipment and automotive businesses hinge on rural incomes. 
Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd’s Q4 results coincided with the early onset of the monsoon. It is on the back of good monsoon rainfall in previous years that the company’s coffers have swelled. Its shares rose on Tuesday by 2.3% on a stellar March quarter (Q4) performance. A third year of normal monsoon is good news for Mahindra, whose farm equipment and automotive businesses hinge on rural incomes.
The company’s Q4 results were slightly different this time round. The automotive division that had been struggling with weak profitability due to poor product-mix and stiff competition sprang a positive surprise. That sales grew by 20% year-on-year was known but the 10.7% Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin was 350 basis points higher than a year ago and well beyond what analysts had forecasted.
Improvement in margin in the auto division is an important milestone in Mahindra’s journey. It lends comfort to investors that the division has finally got its act right, after having suffered due to a lack of products in the last few years. This also explains the euphoria in the stock in the last few months.
Still the key question to be answered in the forthcoming quarters is whether the firm can regain its market share that has almost halved from its earlier level of over 50%.
The farm equipment division’s 41% acceleration in sales volume churned out a robust 42% year-on-year jump in revenue along with a 170 basis points expansion in margin. The next couple of months are crucial for this division, as the monsoon will determine growth prospects for the tractor industry, with expectations of growth in high double-digits through fiscal year 2019 (FY19) too.
Together, the two divisions lifted the consolidated profitability of Mahindra along with Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Ltd. The Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin vaulted by 390 basis points year-on-year and was 100 basis points higher than the 10-brokerage firm average estimate by Bloomberg.
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
According to Bharat Shah, an analyst with Sharekhan Ltd, Mahindra reined in cost pressures effectively during the quarter partly by way of operating leverage and perhaps lower discounts offered on vehicles. In spite of the sharp rise in input prices over the last 12-18 months, operating leverage helped contain raw material cost as a percentage of sales.
Finally, the meteoric 64% jump in net profit was the icing on the cake. Such an earnings leap would trigger an upward revision in forecasts for the next year surely. That’s good news for investors as earnings growth is catching up with valuations. At Rs868, the Mahindra stock trades at 15 times its estimated earnings for FY19, leaving room for appreciation if the tide is favourable. The probable dampeners in sight are if rainfall plays truant as the season progresses or if Mahindra is unable to regain lost market share in utility vehicles."
490,2018-06-01,Mahindra Mahindra,"India's top five carmakers, Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Mahindra, Tata Motors and Honda, collectively sold 243,856 units in May, up 20.6% from 202,187 units a year ago

Mumbai: It was smooth sailing for automakers during the month of May as new launches buoyed sales, spurred by robust retail demand on the back of continued economic recovery. 
Mumbai: It was smooth sailing for automakers during the month of May as new launches buoyed sales, spurred by robust retail demand on the back of continued economic recovery.
India’s top five carmakers, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd and Honda Cars India Ltd, collectively sold 243,856 units during the month, up 20.6% from 202,187 units a year ago.
Automakers in India consider dispatches to dealerships as sales. New model launches by five of the seven carmakers reporting sales led to a jump in numbers because they filled inventory channels.
Moreover, a broader economic recovery, led by non-metro geographies, also spurred demand. This uptick in demand was reflected in the 7.7% GDP growth during the three months ended March, up from 7.2% in the December quarter. Growth had been lagging below 7% since demonetization in November 2016.
To be sure, the broader manufacturing industry cooled off in May. The Nikkei manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 51.2 in the month from 51.6 in April, led by weaker domestic demand and output expansion, said Sonal Varma, managing director and chief India economist, Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd, in a 1 June note.
The index remained above 50, which indicates growth, for the tenth month in a row.
Passenger car market leader Maruti Suzuki’s domestic sales (excluding vans and commercial vehicles) jumped 23% to 144,780 units in May over the year-ago period, as the compact car segment led growth with a 50.8% jump to 77,263 units. The local arm of Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor Corp. is facing robust demand for the next-generation Swift, premium hatchback Baleno and compact sedan Dzire in this segment.
The utility vehicles segment, including the best-selling Vitara Brezza and S-Cross models, also contributed with a 13.4% rise in sales to 25,629 units over May last year. An automatic transmission variant of the Brezza was launched during the month.
However, old workhorses Alto and WagonR and the mid-sized sedan Ciaz continued to be in the red, declining 3.1% and 14.8%, respectively.
With new variants of the three models, in addition to the next-gen Ertiga MUV (multi-utility vehicle), to be launched later this fiscal, Maruti is expected to maintain its leadership position in the short term, analysts said.
The local arm of South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co. reported a 7.14% rise in sales to 45,008 units in May, on the back of next-generation models such as compact SUV Creta and Elite i20 hatchback launched during the month. The Grand i10 hatchback and Verna mid-sized sedan also continued to drive growth, according to Rakesh Srivastava, director of sales and marketing at the firm.
Sales at homegrown automaker Mahindra were almost flat at 20,715 units during “the relatively subdued month"", according to Rajan Wadhera, president of the automotive division at the firm.
“With the forecast of an upcoming normal monsoon, we are confident of good growth in the coming months,"" he added.
It was a “challenging"" month for Tata Motors as well, with “retail slowing down"", according to Mayank Pareek, president of the passenger vehicles business at the firm. However, the Tata group flagship posted a 61.11% jump in sales to 17,489 units during the month on the back of continued demand for the new crop of models, namely the Nexon compact SUV and Hexa SUV, followed by the Tiago hatchback and Tigor sedan.
Pareek said the automatic transmission variant of the Nexon, launched during May, has received “an overwhelming response"", adding that Tata “will continue to strive towards driving volumes and increasing market share as part of the ongoing turnaround journey"".
The maker of the City sedan, Honda Cars India, reported a 40.66% rise in sales to 15,864 units, on the back of the next-generation Amaze sedan launched in May, according to Rajesh Goel, senior vice-president and director of sales and marketing at the firm.
Going forward, the prediction of a normal monsoon across the country by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) will buttress demand, in addition to the government’s continued focus on developing infrastructure and the rural sector.
However, higher prices of raw materials such as oil and steel may weigh on profit margins and build inflationary pressures, said Varma of Nomura.
The Reserve Bank of India expects India’s economic growth to strengthen to 7.4% in the current fiscal, from 6.7% in 2017-18."
489,2018-06-04,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra Lifespace MD Anita Arjundas says the new residential projects, with around 2 million sq. ft of space, will come up in Mumbai, Pune and Chennai

Mumbai: After a dull year, real estate firm Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd plans to ramp up its portfolio through joint ventures and partnerships and has lined up five new housing projects by March 2019, said a top company executive. 
Mumbai: After a dull year, real estate firm Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd plans to ramp up its portfolio through joint ventures and partnerships and has lined up five new housing projects by March 2019, said a top company executive.
The company plans to launch five new residential projects with around 2 million sq. ft of development in Mumbai, Pune and Chennai this financial year, said Anita Arjundas, managing director of Mahindra Lifespace. 
Regulatory changes and delays in approvals had significantly slowed down new launches for several developers in India. 
Mumbai-based builders faced an additional hurdle after the Bombay high court baned new construction activities in February 2016.
 The court order came as dumping grounds at Deonar and Mulund in Mumbai had exceeded the permissible limits.
Subsequently, in March 2018, the Supreme Court had lifted the ban. 
“Launches should pick up on an industry level. There was a continuing negative trend in the last few years. RERA (Real Estate Regulatory and Development Act) was one issue as many people were focused on executing and completing ongoing projects,"" said Arjundas. 
The three projects that were supposed to be launched in Mumbai were impacted because of the court ban on new construction, she said adding that “as those (dumping ground and regulatory) issues get resolved, those projects would soon get launched."" 
Unlike in the past, the increasing trend of consolidation within the real estate market post the implementation of RERA has offered the company opportunities to form partnerships and expand its business in its four priority markets, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru and the National Capital Region (NCR), said Arjundas.
“RERA created an opportunity to expand because it limited supply in the market. Several developers and land owners are selling their land parcels or looking for a partner to create a new revenue stream for them. So it does open larger opportunities to access more land parcels and grow,"" she added.
Mahindra Lifespace has signed memorandums of understanding (MoUs) for about 2.75 million square feet of development that are in very early stages of diligence, Arjundas had said in an investor call on 27 April. 
Three of the transactions are in advanced stages of discussions. 
“We aim to close at least two of them this quarter and the rest in the next quarter. If you look at these five (new launches), about three are from landowners who were earlier into development themselves."" 
Earlier this year, Mahindra Lifespace had launched an affordable housing project in partnership with HDFC Capital Advisors Ltd, under the brand ‘Happinest’ at Palghar on the outskirts of Mumbai. This is the first time that the company entered into low-cost housing where the units were priced between Rs8 lakh and Rs20 lakh. 
“We would like to see greater number of projects in each of our priority markets. We want to expand significantly deeper into these markets,"" she said."

Mumbai: Of the 10 top-performing BSE 200 companies, five are from the information technology (IT) sector, signalling a revival in the Indian software services industry on the back of an improving US economy and a depreciating rupee, besides relatively attractive valuations.
“It was an underperforming sector. Now, given the market dynamics, it has become a sought-after defensive bet,"" said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer-equity, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co.
Leading the pack were mid-cap IT stocks such as Mindtree Ltd, Larsen and Toubro Infotech Ltd, Mphasis Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd, besides sector leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). The company stocks posted between 34.2% and 61.6% returns.
“Over the past six months, mid-cap IT companies have handsomely outperformed the benchmark index. The demand environment is improving in their biggest market, the US, with the world’s largest economy firing on all cylinders,"" said Ajay Bodke, chief executive and chief portfolio manager at brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd.
“Mid-cap IT companies have grown in double digits off late, and guidance for FY19 is also in early-teens,"" said Bodke. He added that the good show was triggered by a shift in focus towards new-age, high-margin services such as digital, analytics, intelligence and internet of things (IoT). “A weakening rupee has also been a big positive for them."" 
The rupee has depreciated 5.84% year-to-date and currently trades at 67.83 against the dollar. A depreciating rupee translates into higher revenues in rupee terms for the export-focused software companies. 
Others seem to agree. “The US economy is showing steady improvement and this eventually means there is going to be better demand for our IT companies from their top verticals such as BFSI (banking , financial services and insurance), retail and manufacturing, as these sector are likely to spend more,"" said Gaurav Dua, head of research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. “Weakening rupee and attractive valuations are added pluses."" 
The BSE IT index had gained 10.8% in 2017, compared to the Sensex’s 27.9%. Year-to-date, it has gained 20.8% compared to the Sensex’s 4.8%. The BSE IT index trades at 18.46 times its one-year forward earnings, and even as its valuation has risen since December 2017, it looks more attractive as the visibility of earnings is much better than it was last year.
Domestic mutual funds snapped up shares of technology companies among other top large-cap stocks in May, supporting the market in a month that saw continued exit of foreign investors.
If we look at the top 20 in the pack, consumer-focused stocks and financials form a major chunk, reiterating the faith in India’s consumption and economic growth story.
“After the two exogenous shocks to aggregate demand – demonetisation and the GST (goods and services tax), the aggregate demand has bounced back, which is reflected in consumer retail names,"" said Bodke. “Especially, rural demand has picked up strongly."" 
Upadhyaya of Kotak Mahindra AMC, agrees: “The consumption story continues to be very strong, and that has driven pure consumption stocks, as well as enablers of those consumptions such as retail-focused financials."" 
“What underpins is consistency in performance and pristine asset quality,"" said Bodke, referring to companies such as Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, Bajaj Finance Ltd and Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Co. Ltd. 
The top-performing stock for the year, however, was Indiabulls Ventures Ltd, with the stock gaining 85.3% to  ₹  491.75. The performance comes on the back of a stellar 1,192.46% rise in 2017."

Mumbai: Utility vehicles maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd is currently the most-preferred Sensex stock for analysts as they place their bets on improving demand in the rural sector on the back of a good monsoon.
Of the top five most preferred stocks, three are financials, with ICICI Bank being the second-most preferred stock, and most preferred financial stock despite being in the news for all the wrong reasons, as brokerages welcomed cheaper valuations coupled with steps to investigate alleged wrongdoing.
The analysis includes stocks which have the highest percentage of buys/outperform/add ratings from the Sensex pack of the total ratings for the respective stocks.
According to data from Bloomberg, Mahindra is the most preferred stock with 42, or 97.67% of analysts tracking the stock rating it a buy or outperform, and only one analyst or 2.33% of the total analysts rating the stock a hold or a neutral. There were no sell ratings on the stock.
Mahindra shares that started rallying on 21 February have gained 26.8% since then. Year to date, they are up 19.6% at  ₹  898.30, outperforming BSE’s benchmark 30-share Sensex which rose 4.21% during the period.

Nomura analysts pointed that Mahindra maintained its 8-10% tractor growth forecast for fiscal year 2019, with scope for upside risk, and the brokerage estimates 10% growth in fiscal year 2019 and 8% in fiscal year 2020.
“Revival of rural growth and volume recovery in UVs (utility vehicles) should help the stock re-rate, in our view,"" Nomura analysts added.
In the case of ICICI Bank, 48 analysts or 92.3% analysts rated the stock a buy or outperform, while three or 5.77% analysts had a hold, or one or 1.92% of total analysts rated it a sell. 
“Beyond the remedial measures around the current negative news flow, we maintain our Buy on ICICI Bank given gradual improvement in the operating environment coupled with the arrest of fresh NPL (non-performing loans) formation, and cheaper valuations,"" Jefferies India Pvt Ltd said in a note on 18 June. Year to date, ICICI Bank shares have shed 8.28%.

New Delhi: Senior government officials have refused to use electric cars made by Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd citing poor performance and low mileage, said three people aware of the development. 
New Delhi: Senior government officials have refused to use electric cars made by Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd citing poor performance and low mileage, said three people aware of the development.
The vehicles are procured and deployed by Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL), a public sector unit under the ministry of power. Initially, due to lack of charging infrastructure, the supply of electric variants of Mahindra’s Verito and Tata Motors’ Tigor was delayed.
Tata Motors and Mahindra were to supply 350 units and 150 units, respectively, to the Union government in the first phase. Subsequently, the auto makers were to give another 9,500 units of electric vehicles to EESL, with M&M accounting for 40% of the total.
Taking into consideration the shortcomings of E-Verito, Mahindra is developing a new electric vehicle that gives more mileage, said the second of the three people mentioned above, requesting anonymity.
According to a senior official from one of the ministries involved in formulating rules and regulations for electric mobility, both models failed to run even 80-82km on a single charge within city limits. Battery capacity was not up to the mark, compared to global standards, the official added, requesting anonymity.
In reply to an emailed query, EESL said there are more than 150 electric vehicles on the roads in Delhi and Andhra Pradesh. The company did not specify the reason for the delay in procuring vehicles for government use nor deny that officials had refused to use the vehicles.
“Since it is a new technology, we wanted to gain confidence on our products before delivering it to our clients,"" an EESL spokesperson said. “We will be deploying about 200-250 electric vehicles by mid-July. The conditions of the second tender are being re-evaluated and will be released soon. EESL will continue to enable more energy and fuel savings by creating a robust market for e-mobility in India."" 
On 1 January, Mint had reported that the entire fleet of electric vehicles was supposed to be delivered by 30 November 2017. Subsequently, the deadline was pushed to 30 December 2017 due to lack of charging infrastructure. So far, only around 150 vehicles have been supplied, according to EESL.
According to a senior industry executive, these two models have limited range. Their battery packs are of 17 kilowatt (kW), while the global standard is 27-35kW. Hence, the apprehensions of officials are genuine and the refusals to use the vehicles acceptable, said the executive. “On top of that, government officials get huge sums as car fuel allowance. If they take these vehicles, they cannot claim fuel expenses,"" said the executive, requesting anonymity.
“As part of our tender with Energy Efficiency Services, we have already completed the production of 250 cars and initiated the execution of phase II orders,"" a Tata Motors spokesperson said in response to an emailed query. 
“We are committed to the government’s e-mobility mission by 2030, and continue to work in a collaborative manner to facilitate faster adoption of electric vehicles and to build a sustainable future for India,"" the spokesperson added.
The Mumbai-based company did not mention the number of cars supplied to EESL, nor did it answer questions on the quality of vehicles.
A spokesperson for Mahindra and Mahindra declined to comment. 
Recently, Bloomberg reported the second tender of 10,000 units had been postponed to 2019 due to lack of charging infrastructure. 
“The real reason behind the postponement of the third tender is the unavailability of quality products in the electric vehicles market at this point in time,"" said the third of the three people mentioned in the beginning. EESL did not reply to the question about the reasons that led to the postponement of the tender for the third phase to 2019."

New Delhi: Kotak Mahindra Bank, which hinges its communication on diversity and progress, is back with a new campaign featuring Bollywood actor Ranveer Singh talking about social inclusivity. The ad, which promotes digital bank service 811 launched in March last year, talks about how our society often discriminates people on the basis of religion, caste, creed, sexual orientation and abilities. 
New Delhi: Kotak Mahindra Bank, which hinges its communication on diversity and progress, is back with a new campaign featuring Bollywood actor Ranveer Singh talking about social inclusivity. The ad, which promotes digital bank service 811 launched in March last year, talks about how our society often discriminates people on the basis of religion, caste, creed, sexual orientation and abilities.
Made by advertising agency Cartwheel Creative, the 30-second long spot shot at the iconic Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in Mumbai, captures real life nuances. The protagonist of the story is ‘the bench at the railway station’ and Singh dons the role of the bard (sutradhar). The story voices similarities between Kotak’s 811 service and a bench at a railway station which provides services to everyone irrespective of where they come from. 
811 allows people to open a zero-balance digital bank account which gives up to 6% per annum interest to every citizen of the country. The account can be opened through an app without physically visiting the bank branch. 
“We saw a unique opportunity to reinforce our pride in India’s diversity, as well as our unstinting support for people from all walks of life with this outing, and we grabbed it with both hands. We believe that a digital India is a truly democratic India, and 811 can and must play a vital role in the financial ecosystem, enabling every single Indian to access and use cutting edge banking products and services,"" said Karthi Marshan, chief marketing officer, Kotak Mahindra Group.
811 targets first time banking customers who find it difficult to deal with a conventional bank set-up (mostly teenagers and first jobbers), differently-abled or people left out by society for a wide variety of reasons.
Kotak has always hinged it’s communication on diversity and progress with a belief that big brands have the ability and opportunity, and therefore the responsibility to help mould attitudes. 
“For instance, when the bank was launched, we challenged conventional notions by talking about creating wealth for the daughter’s education and the son’s wedding instead of the opposite. More recently, to announce the merger with ING Vysya Bank, we launched a campaign titled Kona Kona Kotak, that celebrated the varied and diverse stories of progress from across the country,"" added Marshan.
The current campaign which is currently being promoted across television, cinema, outdoor, print as well as other leading digital video platforms.
“The theme of inclusivity came naturally since the product in itself is pre-inclusive. Also, the divisive climate we are living in it was only relevant and appropriate to highlight inclusivity. To amplify this message further we decided to involve Ranveer Singh who, in a way, is an outlier,"" D Ramki, co-founder, Cartwheel Creative. 
According to Robby Mathew, chief creative officer at advertising agency FCB Interface the Kotak ad is different ad which will add immense value to the brand. 
“I loved the way it is shot and the choice of Ranveer Singh as the face of this service is perfect as he’s a bit of an odd ball himself and stands out in any situation,"" he said. 
However, Mathew feels that the television commercial is slightly exaggerated in terms of narrative.
“I don’t think banks are non-inclusive unlike certain restaurants and pubs where you have to dress a certain way to gain access. Kotak might be trying to break the clutter in banking sector advertising, which is mostly about interest rates, minimal balance and convenience, by taking a high round,"" he added."

New Delhi: Carmaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd’s next car could have a Hindi name as Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra’s library of possible car names is now full of desi words.
Mahindra’s interest in Indic language names was sparked off after a Twitter user asked him whether there is any chance of a car being named in an Indian language. He then started scouting for suggestions from everyone on Twitter leading to a bombardment of desi names—ranging from common words like Dhaakad, which loosely translates to “tough and strong"", to Sanskrit ones such as Daruga (Lord Krishna’s chariot).
Another suggestion was ‘Mahindra Baahubali’.
Give me some suggestions...I enjoy collecting a library of possible car names... https://t.co/PO6nTgPIOI
Krishna’s chariot name :-DarugaKrishna had 4 horses.1. Balahak(whitish)2.Meghapuspa/Meghan(color of clouds)3. Shaibya(green like a parrot)4. sugreeva(yellow-gold)
The kind of vehicles Mahindra produces, it should be named ""धाकड"".
""Mahindra Bahubali"" , there is a background score and anthem already available, tried and tested.
It is well-known that names of all Mahindra vehicles, including Scorpio, Bolero, Xylo and Verito, end with an ‘O’ and therefore a Twitter user was quick enough to suggest ‘Mahindra Shastro’, a take on Shastra, which means weapon.
Sir..hope u will use it for your new UV..it comes with a signature letter ""O""
Similarly another user suggested Jugnoo (firefly).
Expressing gratitude to everyone on Twitter for giving their inputs, Anand Mahindra said his library of names is going to grow exponentially. “Now I’m worried that competitors will be also be able to access this useful advice on my timeline!,"" he quipped.
What an amazing response..My sincere gratitude to everyone for these incredibly useful inputs. My library of names is going to grow exponentially. Now I’m worried that competitors will be also be able to access this useful advice on my timeline! 😕 https://t.co/LSvDUNcYMV"

New Delhi: The insurance sector wants to be part of India’s road growth story. In a meeting held by Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari with bankers in Mumbai on Friday, Kotak Mahindra Bank chief executive officer Uday Kotak signalled the sector’s eagerness. 
A senior government official on condition of anonymity said: “Uday Kotak, along with LIC (Life Insurance Corporation of India) chairman said they were keen on exploring opportunities in post-construction lending for highway projects. Both insurance and highway projects have the basic characteristic of being long-term projects with investment returns by 15-25 years and can be gelled easily."" 
Gadkari liked the proposal and further possibilities are likely to be explored to bring in insurance sector investments, said the official on condition of anonymity.
Another proposal that caught the attention during the discussion was the “One Bank, One Project"" mooted by State Bank India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar. 
“At present, a consortium of 10 or more banks finance projects and in case one raises objection, the project is scrapped. Under the proposed arrangement, either one bank will be financing the project or a maximum consortium of two banks will finance the project, with the lead bank being given powers to take all financial decisions,"" said the official quoted before.
The move comes at a time when banks have become cautious about investing in infrastructure projects because of growing bad debts and their past experience with BOT (built-operate-transfer) projects in the roads sector. 
The meeting was attended by managing directors of several banks including Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank, SBI, Punjab National Bank, ICICI Bank, RBL Bank and the chairman of LIC. 
Gadkari said the country’s roads sector has shown a great growth in the last four years. The first three months of the current fiscal year contributed 12% to gross domestic product, showing its immense potential. 
“I have told bankers that I can give them a secured business of  ₹ 5-7 lakh crore,"" Gadkari added. 
The minister told banks that if they don’t come forward with investments he will consider approaching foreign investors."

Mumbai: Automobile sales that grew in May picked up further speed in June, aided by new model launches and the low base of the previous year. India’s top five carmakers, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd collectively sold 216,660 units during the month, up 43.7% from 150,772 units a year ago. 
Mumbai: Automobile sales that grew in May picked up further speed in June, aided by new model launches and the low base of the previous year. India’s top five carmakers, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd collectively sold 216,660 units during the month, up 43.7% from 150,772 units a year ago.
Automakers in India consider dispatches to dealerships as sales. The low base of the previous year was due to the goods and service tax (GST) regime, which was implemented on 1 July last year, as firms slowed dispatches starting May.
New model launches by four of the five carmakers reporting sales, also led to a jump in numbers because they filled inventory channels. Passenger car market leader Maruti Suzuki’s domestic sales (excluding vans and commercial vehicles) jumped 45.32% to 121,851 units in June over a year ago, as the compact car segment led growth with a 76.7% jump to 71,570 units.
The local arm of Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor Corp. continues to face robust demand for the next-generation Swift, premium hatchback Baleno and compact sedan Dzire in this segment.
The utility vehicles segment, including the best-selling Vitara Brezza and S-Cross models, also contributed with a 39.2% rise in sales to 19,321 units over June last year. An automatic transmission variant of the Brezza was launched in May.
Old workhorses Alto and WagonR also contributed with a 15.1% rise in sales, a change from the declines in April and May. Sales of mid-sized sedan Ciaz continued to slow, declining 60% during the month.
Hyundai Motor India clocked 45,371 units in sales during June, a 20.8% growth over the year-ago period, on the back of a new variant of the compact SUV Creta launched in May, and continued demand for other models such as the Grand i10 and Elite i20 hatchbacks and Verna sedan, according to Rakesh Srivastava, director of sales and marketing at the firm.
Tata Motors reported a 62.9% rise in sales to 18,213 units in June, on the back of continued demand for its four new vehicles—the Tiago hatchback, Tigor sedan, compact SUV Nexon and full-bodied SUV Hexa, said Mayank Pareek, president of the passenger vehicles division at the firm.
Tata Motors saw the combined production of Tiago and Tigor cross 200,000 units in June at its Sanand facility, added Pareek.
The maker of the rugged Bolero SUV, Mahindra and Mahindra, posted an 11.9% rise in sales to 18,137 units during the month. Rajan Wadhera, president of the automotive sector at the firm “hopes that macro (economic) conditions such as fuel prices, interest rates and raw material prices remain at satisfactory levels"" in the coming months in order to propel growth.
However, analysts say retail sales, especially in non-urban geographies, have slowed down in June, breaking a trend prevalent since the quarter ended December."

Mumbai: International Finance Corp. (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, on Tuesday said it has invested  ₹ 640 crore ($100 million) in Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Ltd (Mahindra Finance).
The investment will enable Mahindra Finance to boost growth, by extending loans to individuals, including farmers, to buy tractors, vehicles and other equipment, along with financing small and medium enterprises.
“The investment in Mahindra Finance, the country’s leading rural finance company and India’s largest tractor financier that reaches more than half of India’s 600,000 inhabited villages, will be through secured non-convertible debentures,"" the statement said. 
Mahindra Finance is a non-banking financial company, focused on the rural and semi-urban sector. The company has over 5.3 million customers and has assets under management of over $8.49 billion. The company’s business lines include vehicle and tractor financing and offering fixed deposits and loans to SMEs. It has 1,284 offices across the country.
In May 2017, IFC had said that it was evaluating an investment of $100 million in Mahindra Finance. 
“Mechanized farming can cut costs by 25% and raise productivity by 20%. That will help meet the government’s target of doubling farmers’ incomes by 2022. At present, less than 30% of India’s farmers use modern equipment. To compound matters, 80% of farms in India are classified as “small and marginal"", and require financing for smaller mechanization solutions,"" IFC said in the statement.
The new loan will help the company expand further and cater to the needs of small landholders, it added. 
“Since its inception in 1991, Mahindra Finance has been working in the rural and semi-urban areas of India, catalyzing financial inclusion of the unbanked and under-served communities and also partnering with them in their difficult times. Our focus has been on enabling these customers with innovative financial solutions, tailor made to their evolving needs, fueling entrepreneurial aspirations, promoting self-reliance and transforming lives,"" said Ramesh Iyer, vice-chairman and managing director of Mahindra Finance.
Parent Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd has been IFC’s partner for several decades.

IFC invests across the agribusiness supply chain, from farm to retail, to help boost production, increase liquidity, improve logistics, and expand access to credit for small farmers. IFC also runs large advisory programmes aimed at developing farmers’ knowledge and adoption of modern agricultural practices to help them raise productivity, improve incomes, and learn new skills.

Bengaluru: Tech Mahindra’s chief executive officer C.P. Gurnani earned  ₹  146.19 crore in remuneration in 2017-18, bringing his total earnings over the last five years to  ₹ 510 crore. The numbers have rekindled debate among analysts and observers on compensation for the CEO of India’s fifth largest software services company and how it compares with the median salary of its other employees. 
Bengaluru: Tech Mahindra’s chief executive officer C.P. Gurnani earned  ₹  146.19 crore in remuneration in 2017-18, bringing his total earnings over the last five years to  ₹ 510 crore. The numbers have rekindled debate among analysts and observers on compensation for the CEO of India’s fifth largest software services company and how it compares with the median salary of its other employees.
Significantly, Gurnani’s  ₹ 510 crore in earnings is about 24% more than the combined earnings of  ₹ 387.92 crore of nine CEOs at the four largest IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, over the last five years, according to a Mint analysis.
Tech Mahindra’s vice-chairman Vineet Nayyar who retires this year, earned  ₹ 363.13 crore during this period, making the total payout by the company to two of its senior-most executives to  ₹ 873.16 crore over the last five years.
Gurnani and Nayyar’s annual salary has a large component of stock options exercised during the last four years and for this reason, their compensation is higher than their peers.
Tech Mahindra defended the high compensation to its two executives, saying the grant of shares to Gurnani and Nayyar is tied to the company’s performance, with the company having clocked the fastest compound annual growth since 2013.
“The grant of shares for the executives including MD (managing director) & CEO is based on performance parameters and is decided by the Nomination and Remuneration committee, consisting of non-executive and independent directors,""said a spokeswoman for Tech Mahindra. 
“If one looks at the last five years of growth, Tech Mahindra has been the fastest-growing company amongst the top five and the stock has been one of the best performers amongst peer group,"" said the spokeswoman.
Although this is correct, Tech Mahindra’s performance—both revenue and profitability—is not significantly better than its four larger rivals. 
Again, as Tech Mahindra is much smaller than TCS or Infosys, it is only expected of the firm to grow faster. 
Sample this: Tech Mahindra reported a 9.6% dollar revenue growth to end with $4.77 billion in revenue in 2017-18 as against TCS’s 8.6% growth to end with $19.1 billion in revenue last year. 
TCS’s $4.97 billion revenue in the January-March period is more than Tech Mahindra’s $4.77 billion sales for the entire year. 
Still, TCS chief executive Rajesh Gopinathan earned  ₹ 12.49 crore, as against Gurnani’s  ₹ 146.19 crore last year. 
Vishal Sikka, Infosys’s former US-based CEO, who faced criticism over higher salary from some of the software services company’s founders, earned  ₹ 111.32 crore over three years.
“Capitalism is still trying to find a comfortable home in India and it is such instances of high, excessive compensation which in a democracy likes ours gives capitalism a bad name,"" said Gurcharan Das, author and former chief executive officer of Procter & Gamble India. 
“The fact is that flaunting wealth is distasteful and imprudent in our country. The last thing you want is the government to get involved in fixing salaries, but one should not forget that it is these examples of inequality that has partially contributed to leaders like Donald Trump getting elected in the US because it bothers a lot of people. The board of Tech Mahindra and Anand Mahindra (chairman of Tech Mahindra) should use self-restraint and make sure that there is no resentment among employees in Tech Mahindra,"" Das said.
Gurnani, 59, joined Tech Mahindra in 2004, and took over as chief executive officer in August 2012. 
Tech Mahindra, which was founded in 1986 and went public in 2006, allotted shares to Gurnani in 2006-07 and again in 2010-11."
473,2018-07-10,Mahindra Mahindra,"If Accenture grows at the upper end of guidance, its new revenue growth will be just a few hundred million dollars lower than the annual sales of Tech Mahindra at $4.77 billion

Bengaluru: Accenture Plc will add more than $4.37 billion in incremental revenue in the fiscal year ending August 2018, the highest new revenue done by an information technology (IT) outsourcing company in over two decades. 
Bengaluru: Accenture Plc will add more than $4.37 billion in incremental revenue in the fiscal year ending August 2018, the highest new revenue done by an information technology (IT) outsourcing company in over two decades.
Accenture expects to clock revenue of $9.8-10.05 billion in the June-August quarter. The company, which has added $29.42 billion in the nine months to May 2018, expects its full-year revenue at $39.22-39.47 billion. This translates into a dollar revenue growth of 12.5-13.26%. The IT firm follows a September-August financial year.
Put simply, Accenture’s projected incremental revenue of $4.37-4.62 billion for the financial year will be just a shade lower than the combined $4.78 billion new revenue of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp, Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd.
If Accenture grows at the upper end of guidance, then the company’s new revenue growth will be just a few hundred million dollars lower than the annual sales of Tech Mahindra Ltd at $4.77 billion.
Only twice earlier have two companies added more than $2 billion in new business in a year, according to a Mint analysis. In 2015, Nasdaq-listed Cognizant had added $2.15 billion in incremental revenue in 2015, while Mumbai-based TCS added $2 billion in new business in the year ended March 2015.
Last December, Mint had first reported that Accenture was on its way to script history by growing faster than TCS, Cognizant, Infosys and Wipro. The company’s impressive performance is significant for two reasons. One, its ability to clock double-digit growth on an already large base (it had ended last year with $34.85 billion in revenue) should make shareholders question the managements of the other five home-grown IT firms. Save for Noida-based HCL Technologies, all IT companies reported single-digit growth in the year ended March 2018.
TCS will kick off the earnings season when it reports its first-quarter results on Tuesday, while Infosys will put its numbers out in the public domain on Friday. TCS does not give annual or quarterly guidance, but the manage
ment expects to report double-digit growth in the current financial year. Infosys expects 9% dollar revenue growth. 
If TCS manages 11% dollar revenue growth and Infosys grows at 9%, this would translate into the two firms adding $2.1 billion and $985 million, respectively, in incremental revenue.
If Cognizant adds $1.49 billion at 10%, the three companies’ incremental revenue would add up to $4.57 billion. 
At the heart of Accenture’s performance is its strong consulting practice and aggressive investments in new technology areas such as cloud computing, data analytics and design capabilities, which are clubbed as digital technologies. 
Over the past three years, Accenture has spent $3.4 billion to buy 70 companies, considerably more than the $1.58 billion spent by TCS, Infosys and Wipro put together, since 1 April 2014.
Accenture said 60% of its business, or $6.18 billion, in the March-May quarter was from the new technology solutions, which was far higher than the $4.1 billion in digital revenue from TCS, Cognizant, Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies.
“Revenues for ACN’s (Accenture’s) “New"" strategic initiatives, which includes digital, cloud and security, grew strong double digits for the May Q... [We] believe ACN is the best run player in our IT services coverage,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 28 June."

The Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd stock was punished after its June quarter results were announced. The stock plummeted nearly 4% intraday on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and ended Thursday’s session down 3.8% in a flat market. 
The Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd stock was punished after its June quarter results were announced. The stock plummeted nearly 4% intraday on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and ended Thursday’s session down 3.8% in a flat market.
The reason: the private sector lender’s provisions for bad loans more than doubled in the June quarter compared to the year-ago period. This was apart from mark-to-market provisions of around  ₹ 210 crore. The bank registered a 130.5% year-on-year spike in provisions, while sequentially they went up 53%.
Consequently, it missed Street expectations on the net profit front. Stand-alone net profit during the quarter increased 12% year-on-year to  ₹ 1,024.94 crore, but was well below Bloomberg analysts’ estimates of  ₹ 1,208.50 crore.
On the positive side, Kotak Mahindra Bank’s loan book saw a healthy year-on-year growth of 24%. This was led by the high-yielding corporate banking and commercial vehicles segment. However, loan growth in its small and medium enterprises segment was subdued. Net interest margin fell a bit to 4.3% from 4.35% in the previous quarter.
Asset quality was stable. Both gross and net non-performing assets declined both sequentially and from a year ago.
On a consolidated basis, the private sector lender’s net profit increased 17% year-on-year to  ₹ 1,347 crore. However, some analysts expressed concerns over the performance of the bank’s NBFC (non-banking financial company) subsidiary, which continues to be subdued.
Despite the earnings miss, investors have little reason to feel dissatisfied. Earlier this week, the bank’s stock hit a 52-week high of  ₹ 1,417 on NSE. On a year-to-date basis, the stock has outperformed the Nifty Bank Index by giving 33.5% returns. During the same span, the sector index was up 4.9%. Also, the lender has posted better returns than peers (see chart). No wonder then that out of the 38 broking houses tracking this stock, 30 have a “buy"" and four have a “hold"" rating.
The problem lies in Kotak Mahindra Bank’s valuation, which, at a one-year forward price-to-book multiple of 5.23 times (stand-alone), makes it one of the most expensive banking stocks. Valuations like that come with sky-high expectations, leaving the door wide open for disappointment."

Pune: Mahindra & Mahindra on Tuesday forayed into the intermediate commercial vehicles (ICV) segment with the unveiling of Furio range of trucks in Pune, and said it has invested Rs600 crore in developing the platform. 
With the unveiling of new vehicles from Mahindra’s Truck and Bus (MTB) Division, the group has established its presence across all the segments of commercial vehicles, said Pawan Goenka, managing director, Mahindra & Mahindra. 
“The unveiling of the new Furio is a defining moment for our truck and bus business as we are set to become a full-range commercial vehicles player. We have invested Rs600 crore in creating the ICV platform,"" he said. 
Mahindra & Mahindra’s automotive sector president Rajan Wadhera said with the addition of the new range of ICVs, MTB will emerge as a complete trucking solutions provider to the country’s commercial vehicle market. 
The company unveiled four new trucks on Tuesday, of the 21 it plans to roll out in the new ICV range.
 “We plan to launch six trucks in the current fiscal year,"" said Vinod Sahay, chief executive officer, Mahindra Truck and Bus and Construction Equipment Divisions, Mahindra & Mahindra."

Sticking with financial stocks and not chasing returns has helped Axis Asset Management Co. to ride the wave of volatility in Indian markets that has hammered many of its competitors. 
Sticking with financial stocks and not chasing returns has helped Axis Asset Management Co. to ride the wave of volatility in Indian markets that has hammered many of its competitors.
The Axis Bluechip Fund is up 25% over the past year, beating nine index funds and 35 other actively managed portfolios to the mantle of India’s top performing large-cap fund, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its biggest holdings - HDFC Bank Ltd., Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. Housing Development Finance Corp. and Tata Consultancy Services - have contributed more than three quarters of gains on the S&P BSE Sensex Index this year.
“Our portfolio tilt toward very high-quality stocks has helped us ride out the market volatility,"" Shreyash Devalkar, senior fund manager at Axis, which has $12 billion in assets, said in an interview. The fund exited some smaller companies in December after a gush of inflows lifted valuations, he said.
Gains in Indian equities this year have been lopsided as investors sought safety in the biggest stocks amid headwinds from a brewing trade conflict and elevated prices of oil, India’s top import. A selloff in stocks of medium and smaller-sized companies was made worse by stringent margins requirements imposed in June. That’s left those smaller firms trading near the biggest discount to the Sensex in two years, according to Bloomberg data.
Axis expects a boost in government spending in India’s countryside ahead of next year’s general elections to benefit companies able to capture improved consumer demand. The government this month raised minimum assured prices for crops like cotton and rice to boost rural incomes and spending. “We are tracking earnings closely to see how consumer demand is panning out,"" he said, without naming the stocks he’s watching.
New Record
The Sensex is up more than 8% this year, surpassing a previous all-time high reached in January, after turmoil in the first quarter dragged equities into a correction. Despite the rebound, volatility may remain elevated amid uncertainty over international politics and in the run up to next year’s national ballot, Devalkar said.
Rising crude prices and its impact on public finances remains a cause for concern, he said. Brent oil held above $72 per barrel, up about 45% from a year ago, fueling concern inflation will quicken. India is the world’s third-biggest oil user and relies on imports to meet about two-thirds of its fuel requirements.
Prior to his fund’s outperformance over the past 12 months, Devalkar’s fund lost about 3.6% in 2016 compared with a 3% gain in the NSE Nifty 50 Index that year."

Bengaluru: The Kerala government has allocated land for Tech Mahindra to set up an IT centre, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Wednesday. The move is the latest in a series of IT investments coming to the state. 
Bengaluru: The Kerala government has allocated land for Tech Mahindra to set up an IT centre, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Wednesday. The move is the latest in a series of IT investments coming to the state.
Tech Mahindra has been allocated about 12,000 sq ft in state-run Technopark third phase, India’s biggest IT park, in Thiruvananthapuram, Vijayan said in a Facebook post. Their office will start functioning within three months, generating 200 immediate jobs and about 2000 others by the time the office opens, he said.
Kerala got a major boost when global car-maker Nissan Motor Co. Ltd., decided to set up its first research hub on automated, driverless cars in Technopark on 29 June. The deal is expected to generate 500 direct jobs by the fiscal end. 
Tech Mahindra, which has a large number of global companies on its clients list, is also catering to Nissan and had immediately contacted the state government after the Nissan deal, said a government official who did not want to identified. 
Four other major IT companies -- Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp, Wipro Ltd -- have their offices in Kerala. 
In March, the government resisted tough local opposition to change land laws and have Taurus Downtown, a joint venture between US-based Taurus Investment Holdings and Embassy Property Development Holdings, develop a  ₹ 2000 crore technology center in Technopark. The project was proposed in 2012 but went into limbo because of land issues.
In the same month, Kerala also held a first-of-its-kind global IT summit titled ‘#Future’ in Kochi, under the aegis of an IT advisory committee chaired by S D Shibulal, former Infosys CEO. The event was attended by top IT executives such as Nandan Nilekani, Infosys non-executive chairman, and Vijay Shekar Sharma, founder of Paytm.
In April, global IT networking major Cisco announced it will launch an incubator for startups in Kerala, on the sidelines of a government-sponsored networking workshop for startups called Huddle Kerala, billed as Asia’s largest startup ecosystem congregation.
The chief minister also made an effort to publicize his pro-business agenda by personally congratulating the founders of Kerala-based startup Chillr when it was acquired by Stockholm-based Truecaller in June. He did it again when UST Global, a pioneer in Kerala-based IT startups, raised $250 Mn from Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund Temasek and turned into a unicorn in June. 
In response, UST said it will actively work with Kerala-based startups with the money. Seperately, UST Global, along with Intel, has also agreed to set up a laptop manufacturing unit in Thiruvananthapuram, giving a boost to the chief minister’s previously stated wish to make Kerala an electronic hardware manufacturing hub."

Mumbai: Blackstone Group LP, the world’s largest alternative asset manager, has picked banks for India’s first real estate investment trust listing, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The US company and local partner Embassy Group selected firms including Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., said the people. The REIT listing would raise about $1 billion, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
Axis Bank Ltd., Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc and JM Financial Ltd. have also been picked for the transaction, the people said. A representative for Blackstone declined to comment.
A successful deal could encourage new offerings from India’s cash-starved property firms, which are still recovering from sweeping policy changes and struggling to access liquidity. The Blackstone REIT, which comprises properties that count Microsoft Corp. and Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc as tenants, would also be a crucial test after much-hyped infrastructure trusts failed to gain traction in the Indian market.
“A good debut for the Blackstone-Embassy issue could quicken potential offerings by the likes of Xander group, Brookfield, CPPIB and IIFL Holdings who are holding high-quality realty assets,"" said Amit Goenka, Mumbai-based managing director of Nisus Finance Services Ltd. “Even if only one-fourth of the high-grade, yield-generating commercial properties are moved into trusts, we will have a $50 billion REITs market in India in a few years.""
Goenka was referring to the Xander Group Inc., Brookfield Asset Management Inc., Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and IIFL Holdings Ltd.
Blackstone, the largest owner of office space in the county, will look to file the prospectus with the capital market regulator in August, one of the people said.
All the arrangers declined to comment.
The REIT will include properties from the Embassy Group joint venture as well as from Blackstone’s own portfolio, the people said. Blackstone’s real-estate unit has committed about $5.2 billion across 30 investments in India, they said."

Utility vehicle maker Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) will enter the multi-utility vehicle (MUV) segment in the first week of September, with the launch of the Marazzo, senior executives at the automaker, said at a press conference on Tuesday. 
Utility vehicle maker Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) will enter the multi-utility vehicle (MUV) segment in the first week of September, with the launch of the Marazzo, senior executives at the automaker, said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The 7-seater Marazzo, which is based on an all-new platform, will be Mahindra’s longest and widest car to date. Banking on this launch during India’s festive season (a period considered auspicious to purchase consumer durables) in a segment that clocks about 12,000 units per month, the maker of the Scorpio aims to arrest the fall in market share it has witnessed in the domestic market over the past few years.
The Marazzo, along with two other Mahindra cars to be launched this year, will give the automaker enough volume to augment market share going forward, said managing director Pawan Goenka. It would be exported to right-hand drive markets such as Sri Lanka and South Africa as they present an opportunity to introduce new products with higher volumes, he added.
Though India has one of the highest shares of SUVs to passenger cars in the world at about 29%, Mahindra is riding the larger SUV wave because the segment has taken the fancy of the people, Goenka said.
Earlier codenamed S321, the Marazzo has combined designed cues from Italian design firm Pininfarina SpA, which Mahindra bought in 2015, and Mahindra’s Mumbai-based design studio. Going forward, Pininfarina will continue to contribute to Mahindra’s product design by creating “one full concept"" for each product, said Rajan Wadhera, president of the automotive division at the firm.
Based on a newly developed platform, which entailed an investment of  ₹ 800 to 2000 crore, the Marazzo is claimed to be lighter than most other vehicles Mahindra has made owing to the high use of aluminum. Other vehicles to be built on this platform, which could have different powertrains and body styles, will also be lighter as part of a strategy to meet future regulatory requirements such as the Bharat Stage VI emission norms and the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) norms.
“A platform is typically designed for a decade, spawning multiple body styles and powertrains. We will use this platform to produce either premium luxury cars or small commercial vehicles,"" Goenka said, citing the advantages of modular platforms as product life cycles in the Indian car market grow shorter and investments rise to comply with regulatory norms.
“It is becoming more and more challenging for Indian automakers to launch products profitably,"" he said."

Mumbai: Passenger car sales, which had a stellar run since January 2018 on the back of new launches and a recovery in rural demand, saw a slowdown in July because of a high base in the same month last year and a planned inventory reduction by auto makers ahead of the launch of new models and refreshes during the festive season beginning later this month. 
Mumbai: Passenger car sales, which had a stellar run since January 2018 on the back of new launches and a recovery in rural demand, saw a slowdown in July because of a high base in the same month last year and a planned inventory reduction by auto makers ahead of the launch of new models and refreshes during the festive season beginning later this month.
A nationwide transporters’ strike in mid-July also impacted production and distribution of vehicles. Auto makers in India consider dispatches to dealerships as sales. 
India’s top five carmakers, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Honda Cars India Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd, collectively sold 236,947 units during the month, up 1.14% from 233,643 units a year ago.
During July last year, inventory stocking was unusually high as consumers deferred purchases in the preceding months expecting a lower tax outgo post the implementation of the goods and service tax on 1 July. 
The slowdown in sales this month is an aberration as underlying retail demand, primarily from semi-urban and rural areas, has remained stable as expected, analysts said. 
“As auto makers look to fill inventory channels with new products for the festive season in August and September, they did not push inventory aggressively in July,"" said Darshini Kansara, deputy manager, industry research at CARE Ratings Ltd.
“The rural recovery is still positive, as is the broader economy. The recent MSP (minimum support price) hike, near-normal monsoon, and revision in the central government employees’ dearness allowance are positive factors,"" Kansara said.
Passenger car market leader Maruti Suzuki reported a marginal fall in domestic car sales (excluding vans and commercial vehicles) to 136,636 units in July from 137,584 units a year ago, the first decline since December 2016. 
Sales of the premium sedan of the local subsidiary of Suzuki Motor Corp. stood at 48 units in July as compared to 6,377 units a year ago. The company plans to introduce the next-gen Ciaz on 20 August.
Other segments also reported lower-than-expected sales. The compact car segment, which makes up the bulk of Maruti Suzuki sales, grew 17.8% to 74,373 units because of the demand for the 2018 Swift hatchback and continued interest in premium hatchback Baleno and compact sedan Dzire. In the past few months, this segment had been reporting growth upwards of 20%.
The sport utility vehicles (SUV) segment, including the best-selling Vitara Brezza and S-Cross models, posted a 4.9% decline to 24,5050 units over July last year.
Sales of entry-level cars Alto and WagonR declined even further by 10.9% to 37,710 units.
Hyundai Motor India clocked 43,481 units in sales during July, an 1.1% growth over the year-ago period, on the back of refreshed models such as the Creta compact SUV, Verna sedan and Elite i20 hatchback, according to Y.K. Koo, managing director and chief executive at the local subsidiary of the South Korean carmaker.
“A positive growth trend is visible with the stabilisation of macroeconomic factors and a good monsoon, along with increase in customer confidence and sentiment towards new vehicle purchases,"" he said.
Honda Cars India clocked a 16.9% rise in sales to 19,970 units during July on the back of greater production of the Amaze compact sedan and sustained momentum for the City sedan and WR-V SUV, said Rajesh Goel, senior vice-president and director of sales and marketing at the firm.
The maker of the rugged Bolero SUV, Mahindra, posted an 5.96% decline in sales to 19,781 units during the month. Rajan Wadhera, president of the automotive sector at the firm cited “certain uncertainties with the truckers’ strike and sluggishness on the retail front"" as challenges during the month. The firm is “confident of seeing a turnaround in the overall buying sentiment"" as the festive season approaches, he said.
Analysts expect the quarters ending September and December to contribute handsomely to sales on the back of the festive season, a positive economic environment, stable inflation and interest rates, and expectations of a normal monsoon, though rising crude oil and commodity prices may play spoilsport.
Kansara of CARE Ratings expects passenger vehicle sales to clock 8-10% growth for the fiscal."

Tech Mahindra Ltd’s shares had underperformed peers in the past one month on concerns about growth in the near-term. Analysts, in fact, had estimated revenues to drop 1% sequentially in constant currency largely because of pressure in the telecom vertical. But as it turned out, things weren’t as bad as expected. Revenues rose 0.3% sequentially in the June quarter. While revenues from the telecom segment declined as expected, the enterprise business grew by a strong 3.8% sequentially.

Revenues rose 0.3% sequentially in the June quarter. While revenues from the telecom segment declined as expected, the enterprise business grew by a strong 3.8% sequentially.
While this segment is expected to continue driving overall growth for the company, investors were also enthused by the company’s comments that some large deal wins can potentially drive growth in the telecom segment as well going forward.
“Tech Mahindra is optimistic about a revival in revenue growth in telecom after staying weak for the last five quarters. The confidence is coming from a) ramp-up in deals won in 4QFY18 ($300 million worth deal wins had a higher share of telecom deals) and b) strong deal wins in 2QFY19; Tech Mahindra indicated a $200 million of net new deal wins so far in the quarter. This bodes well for FY20 dollar revenue growth outlook,"" analysts at JM Financial Institutional Equities said in a note to clients.
In addition, there are expectations that increased spending by global telecoms service providers on 5G deployment will result in increased demand for Tech Mahindra.
Needless to say, the company’s optimism needs to translate into actual results for investors to gain more confidence about the recovery in the telecom vertical. Nonetheless, the company’s shares rose nearly 4% on Tuesday, since the June quarter results weren’t as bad as what was initially feared.
Tech Mahindra shares have now outperformed peers year-till-date. However, its valuations look inexpensive vis-a-vis peers at 15 times estimated one-year forward earnings. Investors evidently believe it’s premature to assume a sharp recovery in the telecom vertical is a given."

New Delhi: Kotak Mahindra Bank will raise up to  ₹ 500 crore by issuing preference shares on a private placement basis. 
The non-convertible preference shares (NCPS) issuance committee of the board of directors of the bank on Wednesday resolved to approved the issue of perpetual non-cumulative preference shares on a private placement basis aggregating to an issue size of up to  ₹ 500 crore, Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a regulatory filing. 
The NCPS will offer the allottees a fixed dividend of 8.10%. 
The funds are to be utilised to boost the capital under Basel-III norms which are to be adopted fully by Indian banks by March 2019. 
As per the norms, banks are required to shore up their capital adequacy ratios and maintain equity capital at 7% of risk-weighted assets.

The Fiat Chrysler group filed the complaint on 1 August at the US International Trade Commission, claiming that the Mahindra Roxor infringes key characteristics of Jeep’s signature trade dress—namely the “boxy body shape with flat-appearing vertical sides and rear body ending at about the same height as the hood.""
“They are a nearly identical copy of the iconic Jeep design,"" Fiat Chrysler said in its complaint, which included photos comparing the Roxor to the Jeep. “In fact, the accused product was ‘modeled after the original Willys Jeep.’""
In 2017, Mumbai-based Mahindra, which claims to be India’s largest sport utility vehicle manufacturer, opened headquarters in Southeast Michigan for its newly developed North American branch.
Fiat Chrysler has also said that Roxor imports threaten it with substantial injury as they are underselling Jeeps. Mahindra capitalizes on the cost advantages of manufacturing their products in India and then importing knocked-down kits to the US, where they’re assembled in the Detroit area.
Fiat Chrysler has become increasingly reliant on its Jeep product line. On Wednesday, the company reported its highest ever July sales for Jeep brand vehicles, up 16%, to power the company’s overall 5.9% jump from a year ago.
Mahindra announced plans in November to invest $600 million in its Roxor manufacturing facility. The Michigan unit tripled its workforce and by 2020, the group plans to employ as many as 670 workers there. Fiat Chrysler’s complaint pointed to Mahindra’s “substantial foreign manufacturing capacity combined with its demonstrated intention to penetrate the United States market and harm FCA’s goodwill and business.""

Mumbai: International Finance Corp. (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, will invest $25 million in Mahindra Rural Housing Finance Ltd.  
Mumbai: International Finance Corp. (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, will invest $25 million in Mahindra Rural Housing Finance Ltd. 
IFC said on Monday that the housing finance subsidiary of Mahindra Finance will utilize the funds to offer small home loans.
“There is high demand for affordable housing, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas. The supply is beginning to increase. IFC’s investment will send a positive signal to investors, increasing confidence and encouraging potential creditors to provide long-term debt to this sector,"" said Arun Kumar Sharma, chief investment officer, IFC. 
Sharma added that the investment will not only help in improving the living standards of the rural population, but will also help generate jobs in the housing construction industry.
As on 30 June, Mahindra Rural Housing’s loan book was at  ₹ 7,083 crore. About 85% of its portfolio is in the rural areas. For the April-June quarter, the company’s net profit stood at  ₹ 31 crore. 
It has extended loans to over 700,000 households across India.
“Most housing finance in rural areas is for incremental construction or completion of homes, and the lack of appropriately designed product options is a key challenge. We identified this need and built an innovative business model around it. There is great potential for growth in this segment. This association with IFC will help us capitalize on these opportunities, while making a huge social impact,"" said Ramesh Iyer, vice-chairman and managing director, Mahindra Finance. 
The average loan ticket-size for Mahindra Rural Housing is around $1,200. According to the 2011 Census, India has a housing shortage of 62.5 million units, with over 90% of the shortage in low-income categories."
453,2018-08-08,Mahindra Mahindra,"Investors need to ask post the run-up in Mahindra share price is whether this strong show will continue

Shares of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd have gained around 32% over the past year, as the company reported strong sales volume and earnings. The performance remained robust in the June quarter (Q1) with revenue and net profit growing 23% and 67%, respectively. The company benefited from healthy volumes and low raw material costs. Operating margin at the tractor division reached record levels. 
Shares of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd have gained around 32% over the past year, as the company reported strong sales volume and earnings. The performance remained robust in the June quarter (Q1) with revenue and net profit growing 23% and 67%, respectively. The company benefited from healthy volumes and low raw material costs. Operating margin at the tractor division reached record levels.
Even so, the question investors need to ask post the run-up in the share price is whether this strong show will continue. The company faces both challenges and opportunities.
For perspective, the strong first quarter comes on a favourable base. Performance in the year-ago quarter was weighed down by the implementation of the goods and services tax. As the industry adapted to the new tax system and volumes recovered, aided and abetted by a recovery in demand, Mahindra reported strong performance in subsequent quarters. So it has to be seen how volumes will fare from here.
The challenges also lie in the recent rise in raw material prices and interest rates. Mahindra is yet to fully pass on the rise in input costs. Finance costs for buyers are rising. If the current trend of uneven spread of monsoon rains continues, with deficiency in some regions, then demand may slow down. In that case Mahindra will have to absorb some part of the input cost rise to maintain its volume momentum. This can either cap or weigh on the profitability of the tractor business.
Thankfully, the tractor volume off-take is strong. Tractor volume in July rose 20%. Another farm equipment seller Escorts Ltd has raised its domestic tractor industry volume growth outlook for the current fiscal year, points out Kotak institutional equities.
Even so, as Mitul Shah, vice president (research) at Reliance Securities Ltd, says, the upsides from the traction in the farm equipment business are broadly captured in the stock right now, trading at a 17.6 times one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple.
For the stock to continue to outperform, the utility vehicles business, another key business segment of Mahindra, has to revive. XUV5OO is the last most successful utility vehicle from the company, points out Shah. As subsequent launches and relaunches failed to keep up the momentum, Mahindra lost share in the utility vehicle segment.

The company has new vehicle launches lined up this festive season. Expectations are the new products will add to the current momentum in the tractors business. But much depends on the success of these products, leave alone the competition and pricing challenges. “Given the competition in the segment, expect the new vehicles to be priced competitively,"" adds Shah of Reliance Securities. 
What Mahindra needs now is a new success in the utility vehicles segment. That will help the company regain market share and volume momentum, crucial for its long-term earnings trajectory."

New Delhi: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd topped street expectations with an increase of 63% in standalone quarterly net profit supported by a low base effect. It also recorded higher tractor sales following a revival in rural demand during the quarter.
The company’s net profit in the three months ended 30 June was at  ₹  1,220.96 crore, from  ₹  749.46 crore in the corresponding quarter of last year, and surpassing the  ₹  1,176.70 crore forecast in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.
Demand in India’s hinterlands have started to revive following bountiful monsoon rains, boosting sales of tractors and sport-utility vehicles made by Mahindra. Volumes in the automotive segment climbed 20% last quarter to 139,844 units, while in the farm equipment segment, it grew 18% to 99,897 units.
Consequently, Mahindra’s standalone revenue increased 16% from the year earlier to  ₹  13,519.91 crore during the April to June period. Revenue from the automotive sector increased 5.8% to  ₹  8,188.13 crore, while it grew 16% in the farm equipment sector to  ₹  5,006.88 crore.
Standalone revenue was marginally lower than Bloomberg’s forecast of  ₹  13,542.30 crore.
“The demand for both automobiles and tractors was driven by positive sentiment in the economy (both urban and rural) due to a third consecutive year of a normal monsoon, sustained investment in road & infra projects and availability of affordable finance. However, for the automotive industry, the exceptionally high growth numbers are due to the low base effect,"" the company said in a statement.
Mahindra’s standalone earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation or EBITDA surged 52% to  ₹  1,892.51 crore in the previous year. This despite the auto maker experiencing overall increase in expenses mainly due to higher raw material costs.
“The monsoon this year has been very good and as of now it has been 97% normal. So that’s great news for the industry. Also, oil prices has been over $70 per barrel and the industry has managed it well and overall that has not made an impact on the industry in the first quarter earnings. The tractor industry grew at a rapid pace of 43% in the quarter which is much more that what we have expected,"" said Pawan Goenka, managing director of Mahindra and Mahindra.
On a consolidated basis (M&M and MVNL), the company posted 23% on-year increase in net sales to  ₹ 13,358 crore, while EBITDA jumped 47% to  ₹ 2,110 crore and margins expanded 260 basis points to 15.8%. Consolidated net profit grew 67% to  ₹ 1,257 crore."

Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd on Tuesday said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has rejected its proposal to issue non-convertible preference shares to reduce promoter holding. In a notice to the exchanges, the bank, however, said it had met the central bank guidelines and will continue to engage with RBI. 
Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd on Tuesday said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has rejected its proposal to issue non-convertible preference shares to reduce promoter holding. In a notice to the exchanges, the bank, however, said it had met the central bank guidelines and will continue to engage with RBI.
“RBI has communicated to us that our PNCPS (perpetual non-cumulative preference shares) issuance doesn’t meet its promoter holding dilution requirement. We continue to believe that we have met the requirement and will engage with the RBI,"" said the notice. 
Kotak had earlier said it was looking to raise as much as  ₹ 500 crore by issuing non-convertible PNCPS to dilute promoter shareholding. RBI had mandated the bank to reduce promoter shareholding to 20% of paid up capital by 31 December 2018, and 15% by 31 March 2020. 
“I do not think RBI will yield, no matter how much the bank tries to convince the regulator. RBi has taken a stance since Kotak’s move to issue PNCPS sets a bad precedent for others to follow, something that RBI will not want to allow,"" said Suresh Ganapathy, head of financial services research, Macquarie Capital Securities India Pvt. Ltd.
“It is along expected lines and I was not expecting the RBI to allow this. You cannot circumvent RBI regulations. What we have to look at is the intent of the central bank’s guidelines and it holds true for others like Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank as well. I believe (Uday) Kotak would not do something wrong on corporate governance, having himself been on the committee as it is incumbent on him to follow the highest standards,"" said Anil Singhvi, chairman, Ican Investment Advisors. The issuance of these shares, the bank’s paid-up capital would have increased to  ₹ 1,453 crore from  ₹ 953 crore, thereby bringing down promoter’s interest in paid-up capital to 19.7% from 30.3%.
Preference shares are considered part of paid-up capital, and RBI’s norms refer to ownership caps as a percentage of paid-up capital. Brokerages and investor advisory firms had questioned whether Kotak’s decision meets RBI’s guidelines. The management said the Banking Regulation Act, however, curtails voting rights of promoters to 15%. Typically, stake dilution happens through sale or issue of fresh equity shares. According to a Mint analysis, Kotak Bank would have needed to issue  ₹ 1.25 trillion equity to meet norms of promoter stake dilution. If promoters had to sell shares outright, it would have required a block deal of about  ₹ 25,000 crore.

This is Indian business tycoon Anand Mahindra’s message to Tesla’s founder and CEO, who in a recent emotional interview with New York Times admitted that stress and heavy work were taking a heavy toll on him. Musk noted that he nearly missed his brother’s wedding this summer and spent his birthday in Tesla’s offices as the company raced to meet elusive production targets on a crucial new model.
“This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career. It was excruciating,"" Musk said in the hour-long interview, in which he reportedly choked up more than once.
Musk’s revelation has led to some experts saying that Tesla’s board should decide the direction of its leadership. Among their suggestions: remove Musk as CEO, permanently or via a temporary leave of absence, or appoint a deputy who could act as a steadying hand. “It’s kind of bizarre,"" said Charles Elson, director of the corporate governance center at the University of Delaware. “It’s a drama we shouldn’t be watching.""

If the bank issues about  ₹ 1.2 trillion ($17 billion) of new stock to back an acquisition, that would effectively dilute the billionaire’s holding below the 20 percent target.
“Uday Kotak may favor a big acquisition that will take care of his dilution woes in one go,"" said Rakesh Kumar, an analyst with Elara Securities India Pvt., who remains negative about Kotak Mahindra stock until the issue is resolved. Acquisition targets could include Axis Bank Ltd., India’s third-largest private lender, or a financial firm such as PNB Housing Finance Ltd., according to Devansh Lakhani, an analyst at Lakhani Financial Services Ltd.
Last year, the RBI ordered Kotak to cut his ownership of the bank in phases, to below 20 percent by 2018 and to 15 percent by March 31, 2020, as part of a plan to reduce the influence of founding shareholders. Kotak currently owns about 567 million of the bank’s 1.9 billion shares, or just under 30 percent.
Preference Shares
The bank has said it still hopes to persuade the RBI to approve its original plan to reduce Kotak’s stake. That involves a proposed sale of  ₹ 500 crore of so-called non-convertible perpetual non-cumulative preference shares to domestic institutional investors.
But if the bank fails to sway the regulator and opts solely for an acquisition to reduce its founder’s stake, it would require the issuance of about 970 million new Kotak Mahindra ordinary shares to get the holding below 20 percent, worth about  ₹ 1.2 trillion at current market prices. Kotak Mahindra rose 0.5% to  ₹ 1,281 in early Mumbai trade on Tuesday. 
Another option is for Uday Kotak to reduce his stake either wholly or in part via a share sale to institutional investors. The billionaire founder took this route when he sold 1.5 percent of his shares to Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in March 2017. To get down to the 20 percent solely via a share sale would require Kotak to dispose of about $3.4 billion of the bank’s ordinary shares.
An acquisition is also part of the Kotak playbook. In 2014, the bank purchased ING Vysya Bank Ltd. in a deal valued at $2.4 billion via a share swap.
Rumors that Kotak Mahindra is about to buy another financial firm have boosted the shares of Axis Bank, PNB Housing Finance, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd. and Shriram Transport Finance Co., among others, in recent months.
‘Best Target’
Axis Bank, with a market capitalization of $23 billion, looks like the “best target"" in that it would help Kotak Mahindra increase its presence in corporate banking, according to Purvesh Shelatkar, senior vice president at Centrum Broking Ltd.
Another option, which also has a precedent, is that Uday Kotak dilutes his stake with a new $17 billion share offering unrelated to an acquisition. But this is considered unlikely because Kotak Mahindra’s capital adequacy ratio is a more than comfortable 17.7 percent, so any further buffering via a share issue would lead to an unnecessary dilution of earnings, according to Lakhani.
The bank last issued fresh shares in May 2017 when it raised $901 million to boost lending and raise money for acquisitions."

And here it is.. the #Marazzo reveal...Bravo to the team for conceptualising such a power packed entry.. pic.twitter.com/cDmV1O9g6u
Technical specifications
The Mahindra Marazzo has a 1.5 litre four-cylinder diesel engine at its heart that churns out 121bhp of power and produces a peak torque of 300Nm between 1750 and 2500rpm. The engine is mated with a 6-speed manual gearbox and there’s no automatic transmission on offer for now. However, Mahindra has stated that the automatic transmission will roll out with the petrol offering in 2020, after the BSVI norms are applicable. Mahindra claims the Marazzo will guzzle a litre of diesel every 17.6km.
Design
The Marazzo’s design has been developed from scratch by Mahindra in collaboration with Pininfarina in Italy; the company has spent almost $200 million for the same. The design influences of the Marazzo can be attributed to the Shark – the grille, taillight and the shark fin antenna all resemble the sea creature. It is also important to note that this the largest footprint on any Mahindra model to date.
The Marazzo comes with double barrel projector headlamps with cornering, LED fog lamps, LED daytime running lights and diamond cut 17-inch alloy wheels.

Nashik: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd is exploring the feasibility of entering emerging markets such as Indonesia and Russia in partnership with Ford Motor Co. “We are exploring various aspects with Ford; manufacturing, sourcing, engineering or even on the retail front. But things are at a very initial stage (in these markets) to conclude what aspect we will be partnering on,"" said Mahindra managing director Pawan Goenka. 
Nashik: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd is exploring the feasibility of entering emerging markets such as Indonesia and Russia in partnership with Ford Motor Co. “We are exploring various aspects with Ford; manufacturing, sourcing, engineering or even on the retail front. But things are at a very initial stage (in these markets) to conclude what aspect we will be partnering on,"" said Mahindra managing director Pawan Goenka.
In September 2017, Ford and Mahindra said that they are exploring a strategic alliance to “leverage Ford’s global reach and expertise and Mahindra’s scale in India"". The agreement, the firms said, would allow them to combine their strengths during a period of unprecedented upheaval in the automotive industry.
If Goenka’s plans go through, Mahindra will be the first Indian automaker to strike such a global alliance. Analysts say such an arrangement will benefit both auto makers.
“India is emerging as a regional manufacturing hub with scale economies to serve other smaller regional markets. In this situation, Ford can bring the experience in distribution to these markets, combined with the scale economies of manufacturing in India, which would optimize the combined capacity of both partners,"" said Rakesh Batra, partner and national auto leader at consulting firm EY.
A similar pact between Tata Motors Ltd and Volkswagen AG failed to make progress after an initial agreement. A wave of consolidation is sweeping through the sector. Toyota Motor Co. has bought Daihatsu, while Nissan has acquired Mitsubishi. General Motors Co. has pulled out of some key markets, including India, and is doubling down on North America and China.
Amid all this, Mahindra has decided to develop products on a global scale, in collaboration with unit Mahindra Automotive North America (MANA) and iconic design firm Pininfarina SpA, Anand Mahindra, executive chairman of Mahindra, said at the launch of the Marazzo multi-purpose vehicle on Monday.
The Marazzo was the first product to be jointly engineered by MANA in Detroit and the Mahindra group’s research and development centre, Mahindra Research Valley (MRV) in Chennai. Pininfarina, which Mahindra bought in December 2015, worked on the design in collaboration with Mahindra’s local design studio in Mumbai.
The 1.5-litre, four-cylinder diesel engine on the Marazzo was jointly developed by MRV and Austria-based engineering and power train firm AVL List GmbH. “It (the Marazzo) is a proof of concept of Mahindra’s global network of R&D working together to deliver world-class products,"" Mahindra said. “We have the confidence that we can once again use this neural network (of development centres) to deliver.""
Accordingly, Mahindra has already started development of another vehicle at MANA, which would see support from MRV, Pininfarina and Mahindra’s local design centre, Goenka said, without disclosing further details.
The development of Marazzo started four years ago, coinciding with the setting up of MANA. With a new platform, drivetrain, engine and transmission, product development costs for the multi-purpose vehicle are about $200 million, Goenka said. To compare, the Scorpio, launched in 2002 at Mahindra’s Nashik plant, was developed for $120 million.
Product development is increasingly becoming expensive because of regulatory compliances, testing and validation, said Rajan Wadhera, president of the automotive division at Mahindra.
More models on this new platform were under consideration, Wadhera said, adding that the compact sports utility vehicle code-named S201 to be launched this fiscal would be built on the platform with minimal changes.
With large families and businessmen as the target audience, Mahindra had set aside a fungible capacity of 8,000-9,000 units per month between the Marazzo and the S201, said Veejay Ram Nakra, senior vice-president, sales and marketing.
Mahindra hopes to add 9,000-10,000 units to its monthly sales, with three launches planned this fiscal and sees “a substantial"" increase in market share, Nakra said."

441,2018-09-10,Mahindra Mahindra,"While Mahindra and Escorts have showcased their concept driverless tractors, India is also home to the first driverless electric tractor developed by AutoNXT Automation

New Delhi: A tractor still needs a human driver. So you think. But if you can have driverless cars and trucks, then why not have tractors without farmers? US-based Autonomous Tractor Corp. began developing automation technology for tractors way back in 2011. Two-and-a-half years back, the Harper Adams University in England unveiled an autonomous tractor. 
New Delhi: A tractor still needs a human driver. So you think. But if you can have driverless cars and trucks, then why not have tractors without farmers? US-based Autonomous Tractor Corp. began developing automation technology for tractors way back in 2011. Two-and-a-half years back, the Harper Adams University in England unveiled an autonomous tractor.
Christened Pomona, the driverless tractor was developed as part of the project, entitled USability of Environmentally sound and Reliable techniques in Precision Agriculture (USER-PA)—a programme which was launched in 2013.
Speaking about the tractor, Sam Wane, senior lecturer in engineering at Harper Adams University, had said, “The robotic tractor was created from modifying an existing tractor to enable it to be controlled purely by a computer. We even removed the seat and steering wheel as they weren’t needed anymore."" 
Farmers in India, too, may soon taste the benefit of having home-grown driverless tractors. Escorts Ltd, an engineering conglomerate, announced one of the country’s first autonomous tractors on 6 September. 
The tractor is still in the concept stage but will have help from partners like Microsoft that will help align these smart devices using the internet of things (IOT) concept and artificial intelligence (AI) tools. BOSCH, on its part, will help in future emission readiness while Reliance Jio will assist in enhancing the farm machinery life cycle.
Last September, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, India’s largest manufacturer of tractors, showcased its first driverless tractor. Mahindra’s tractor can steer automatically using GPS-based technology, lift tools from the ground, recognize the boundaries of a farm, and can be operated remotely using a tablet.
While M&M and Escorts are large companies, India is also home to the world’s first driverless electric tractor. This was developed by AutoNXT Automation, a completely bootstrapped Mumbai-based start-up, run by Kaustubh Dhonde, an electronics engineer.
According to Dhonde, only 18% of farmers in India own more than 5 acres of land. For those who don’t own land area larger than five acres, it makes more sense to rent a tractor, rather than buying one.
Dhonde says his tractor, called The Hulk, is meant to be shared by communities of farmers who own smaller pieces of land. “The average cost of renting a regular diesel tractor is about  ₹  1500 per acre per hour. However, The Hulk brings this cost down to about  ₹  350 per hour,"" claims Dhonde. The Hulk is a 30hp tractor that can run for 150 km on each charge.
There are also differences in the technology being used in India as opposed to those used in developed nations. M&M’s tractor uses GPS-based technology, whereas US-based Bear Flag Robotics, is trying to develop tractors that don’t depend on GPS.
Dhonde says his tractor doesn’t use traditional self-driving technology like Light Detection and Ranging and depends on cameras and software to navigate around a farm and perform various activities. AI is another technology being tested on such tractors, especially by some firms in Japan."

Washington: A US regulator said on Tuesday it would launch an investigation into an off-road utility vehicle produced by Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd following a complaint by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV that it infringed upon the intellectual property rights of its Jeep design.
The US International Trade Commission (ITC) said in a statement that it was launching a patent-related investigation into the India automaker’s ROXOR vehicle.
The ITC said the complaint was related to the import and sale in the United States of certain motorized vehicles and components that Fiat Chrysler had alleged infringed on its trademarks. The agency said it would aim to complete its probe within 45 days.
Representatives of Mahindra and Fiat Chrysler could not immediately be reached for comment.
Last month, Mahindra said that Fiat Chrysler had filed a patent violation complaint with the ITC against the company and called the complaint without merit.
Mahindra said that it and its North American unit had filed a public interest statement with the ITC and had begun proceedings in a Michigan court to enforce a design agreement that it had executed with Fiat Chrysler in 2009.
Mahindra was seeking an injunction against Fiat Chrysler from proceeding with the complaint, it added.
Fiat Chrysler had not made a monetary claim in the complaint but was seeking to block Mahindra Automotive from importing any parts or components into the United States that infringe upon Fiat Chrysler’s intellectual property rights, it said."

He assured that the group celebrates diversity at workplace and “fairness and dignity"" of an individual are enshrined in core value of the company. “Our code of conduct is explicit on this subject ... Tech M is investigating these allegations, and appropriate action will follow,"" Mahindra tweeted. Tech Mahindra, which faced online criticism after the former employee went public with the charges against his former team leader, said in a separate tweet that it will undertake a “thorough investigation and take steps as necessary"".
Terming the issue as “disturbing"", the company said that it was “completely against the ethos of our group that believes in uniqueness of every individual."" 
In a recent mail written to his previous manager after the SC’s landmark order, Gaurav Probir Pramanik cited a 2015 incident where the manager concerned, during an address in a training room, had allegedly made “sweeping generalisation and stereotyping of someone’s sexuality"". 
Pramanik accused the manager of making “mocking judgements"" on how his purported “effeminate"" nature had affected his work. 
He further alleged that the manager made “a mockery out of a religious minority and a sexual minority"" despite being a leader at a company that prides itself for inclusion and diversity. CP Gurnani, managing director and CEO of Tech Mahindra tweeted: “Gaurav, you have my personal assurance that this will be thoroughly investigated. We remain committed to supporting and promoting a diverse workforce at TechM"". 
On 6 September, the apex court in a historic ruling had said that consensual gay sex is not a crime, while striking down a British era law that it said violates the right to equality.

Technology stocks have raced ahead of benchmark indices in 2018 after lagging them last year, as the Indian rupee weakens and the economic engines in the West roar back to life. An economic boom in developed nations implies greater outsourcing business for India’s information technology (IT) companies. Also, since these companies earn mostly in dollars, a weak rupee means greater revenues. The US economy grew 4.2% in the second quarter, while jobless claims hit a 49-year-low last week. Meanwhile, the rupee has slipped 11.51% against the dollar in 2018, touching a record low of 72.92 on Wednesday.

Also, since these companies earn mostly in dollars, a weak rupee means greater revenues. The US economy grew 4.2% in the second quarter, while jobless claims hit a 49-year-low last week. Meanwhile, the rupee has slipped 11.51% against the dollar in 2018, touching a record low of 72.92 on Wednesday.
In the year so far, the BSE IT index has gained nearly 40%, outpacing gains in the benchmark Sensex index which has gained around 10%. In 2017, even as the Sensex rose 27.91%, the BSE IT index gained only 10.83%, as revenues grew slower at large IT services companies. This is the best performance of the BSE IT index in the last five years. In 2016, it had slipped 8%, gained 4.26% in 2015, was up 17.6% in 2014 and jumped 55.24% in 2013.
According to Arun Thukral, MD & CEO of Axis Securities, the improving US economy has changed sentiments toward IT sector, which draws a large chunk of its business from the US. “Better profitability of US companies (a part of which could come from tax cuts) would mean better business prospects for Indian IT services. Similarly, Europe is also limping back to stability following the economic revival of the financial crisis-hit peripheral economies. This improvement in the business prospects of Indian IT companies has led to the re-rating of the IT sector in general,"" he added.
Among IT stocks, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd are up 20-53% while Wipro Ltd is up 3%. 
Thukral believes Indian IT firms have witnessed a revival of growth on the back of increased technology investments from clients in the US and Europe. “But these investments are in newer areas such as digital and cloud at the cost of traditional outsourcing, where budgets are shrinking. Hence, we like Indian IT companies who are increasing their revenue share from digital and cloud business,"" he added.
According to a Kotak Institutional Equities note dated 10 September, a 1% rupee depreciation aids earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin of IT firms by 20-30 basis points (bps) and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) by 2-3%. It has upgraded FY2019-21 earnings per share (EPS) by 0-7% but slashed its US dollar revenue growth assumptions due to cross-currency headwinds, stating FY2019 EPS will be influenced by hedges, and all companies will receive an earnings boost in the subsequent year. 
According to Kotak, even though the rupee has weakened, its impact on immediate earnings will be decided by hedging. Kotak said Infosys has minuscule cash flow hedges of $300 million; TCS hedges but through options, meaning it will realize the benefit of rupee depreciation unless the company has entered into range barrier options with the rupee depreciating beyond the range; Mindtree hedges only the monetary assets and does not have any cash flow hedges; and Tech Mahindra has hedged 70-90% of net cash inflow over the next 12-months. Wipro, HCL Technologies, Mphasis and Hexaware, it said, have hedged aggressively. “Infosys, TCS and Mindtree do not have meaningful cash flow hedges and will benefit immediately from Indian rupee depreciation,"" the Kotak note said. 
According to a Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd report, a weak rupee boosts net profits and operating margins of the entire IT sector; however, the impact on individual company earnings will be determined by three aspects -- the share of dollar revenue among all currencies; the extent of onsite-offshore revenue mix that will determine the net exposure after natural hedge; and the hedging policy in terms of duration and proportion of the net exposures hedged.
However, it added that had the rupee weakened similarly against all currencies, the impact would have been felt on the majority of the revenues. In the calendar year so far, the rupee has fallen 11.51% against the dollar, 8.03% against the pound and only 8.27% against the euro. 
“Bottoming cyclical pressures and improved capital allocation are factors that will feed into the valuation multiples favourably. Currency keeps earnings growth ticking further,"" Motilal said in its note on 10 September. 
However, Nomura said Indian Tier 1 IT valuations are at a 20% premium to that of multinational corporations (MNCs) and 15-25% discount to Tier 2 IT and challengers. “Indian Tier-1 IT, after progressively showing lower market share gains over the past three years, has lost market share to MNCs. Also, FY19 guidance suggests a weaker year, with Cognizant and HCL Tech guiding for slower organic growth in FY19 versus FY18, Infosys likely to grow near the lower end of guidance (similar to FY18) and Wipro expected to grow low-single digits for FY19, on our estimates. The only exception is TCS, where we expect growth to accelerate in FY19,"" it said in a note on 6 September."

New Delhi/Mumbai: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) has escalated its effort to bar Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd from selling its off-road utility vehicle, Roxor, in the US, claiming that the Indian auto maker is seeking refuge in a legal interpretation of a contract signed between the two companies in 2009. FCA, in its petition, asked a court in Michigan to reject an injunction sought by Mahindra in the case where the former has alleged that the Mumbai-based company infringed on the intellectual property rights of the Jeep design. A copy of the petition was reviewed by Mint. 
New Delhi/Mumbai: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) has escalated its effort to bar Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd from selling its off-road utility vehicle, Roxor, in the US, claiming that the Indian auto maker is seeking refuge in a legal interpretation of a contract signed between the two companies in 2009. FCA, in its petition, asked a court in Michigan to reject an injunction sought by Mahindra in the case where the former has alleged that the Mumbai-based company infringed on the intellectual property rights of the Jeep design. A copy of the petition was reviewed by Mint.
Selling the Roxor is key for Mahindra as it would mark the culmination of its 14-year-old endeavour to crack the lucrative US market. The latest dispute with FCA threatens to put a spanner in the works for Mahindra as the Italian-American auto maker is disputing the design of the Roxor’s grille, which Mahindra said had been designed and developed in the US, with the grille itself sourced from third-party manufacturers in Michigan.
Mahindra has argued that the grille used in the Roxor is made in the US, and not imported by the company as knocked-down kits, as stated by Fiat, and that Fiat’s complaint before the International Trade Commission (ITC) is a breach of contract between the two companies signed in 2009 of not asserting “infringement claims against a Mahindra vehicle using the Approved Grille Design"".
“But that is not what the language (of the agreement) says,"" FCA said in its petition.
“Instead, the 2009 agreement says that Chrysler will not bring ‘any claim for infringement... based on: (1) a grille having the Approved Grille Design; or (2) a vehicle containing or using the Approved Grille Design’,"" Fiat said. It said the company never agreed to forego any and all claims “against"" a vehicle using the Approved Grille Design that are based on other components of that vehicle that infringe FCA’s intellectual property.
“Neither Mahindra nor this Court may re-write clear terms of the 2009 Agreement—changing ‘based on’ to ‘against’—under the guise of interpretation,"" FCA added.
FCA claims that Mahindra broke the 2009 pact, which let the latter use “the Approved Grille Design"", whereas the Roxor grille is not the approved design.
A Mahindra spokeswoman said FCA’s claims were without merit. “They are incorrect on the facts and on the law. The dispute continues to be addressed,"" she said by email.
Mahindra had to abandon plans to introduce the Scorpio pickup truck in the US, after Chrysler Group LLC—later acquired by Fiat--objected in 2008 to the design of the vehicle because Chrysler claimed a trademark in grilles with seven parallel vertical slots. After a long negotiation, Mahindra agreed to incur the costs of a redesign and change to the distinctive approved grille design.
Fiat meanwhile wants the ITC to hear the case whereas Mahindra wants its defence to be heard at the eastern court of Michigan district, where the grille is manufactured by the Indian car maker, through third-party manufacturers.
ITC deals with unfair trade and intellectual property practices of foreign companies.
Mahindra said FCA aims to derail “the first new vehicle from a start-up American automobile company"". It said that FCA does not explain why it failed to contact Mahindra to relay any legitimate concerns.
FCA however claimed that Mahindra has been designing the Roxor since 2015, made an “enormous investment"" in the Roxor, and spent “millions to advertise and market"" the Roxor. “Yet never once before launch, during its three years of development and purported investment, did Mahindra consult FCA on whether the Roxor would fall within the 2009 Agreement,"" FCA said.
Mahindra in its reply said that Fiat does not dispute that its actions place the employment of US workers at risk—and that is clearly is against the public interest.
“First impressions are lasting impressions, and Fiat is eroding the confidence of dealers and customers just as Mahindra is launching its business,"" it said.
The US International Trade Commission (ITC) has said it was initiating a patent-related investigation and has not decided on the merits of the case. Within 45 days from Tuesday, a target date would be set to complete the investigation, it said.
FCA said that if Mahindra’s interpretation were permitted to stand, as argued, the short 2009 Agreement would prohibit Chrysler (or now FCA) from asserting any claim “against"" any vehicle using the Approved Grille Design—including, for example, a claim for infringement of a utility patent for engine technology, even though that claim would be totally unrelated to the grille.
“No language in the 2009 Agreement supports this contention,"" it said."

New Delhi: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd is renewing its focus on introducing bigger sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) and multi-purpose vehicles as it seeks to avoid a deeper foothold in the increasingly crowded market for compact SUVs, said four people aware of the plans. Three of four new products of Mahindra would be bigger SUVs or MPVs, the people said on condition of anonymity. The shift in strategy follows subdued demand for compact SUVs introduced by Mahindra in the past few years, the people said.

Three of four new products of Mahindra would be bigger SUVs or MPVs, the people said on condition of anonymity. The shift in strategy follows subdued demand for compact SUVs introduced by Mahindra in the past few years, the people said.
Mahindra lost the crown of India’s top SUV maker last year to Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, whose compact SUV model Vitara Brezza has been a runaway success.
Mahindra, in comparison, has largely struggled to find enough buyers for the four compact SUV models it has introduced since 2014—TUV 300, KUV 100, Quanto and Nuvo Sport. Such SUVs measure up to four metres in length and have petrol and diesel engine capacities of up to 1200cc and 1500cc respectively.
The first person cited above said Mahindra has realized that bigger SUVs are still very much relevant in India since vehicles such as Toyota Innova Crysta and Fortuner, and the Jeep Compass have been doing well.
“If you look at the products Mahindra will launch in the next two years, including the recently-launched Marazzo, most of the offerings except one will be above four metres. This strategy makes sense since Mahindra still leads the space when it comes to bigger SUVs,"" said the person mentioned above requesting anonymity.
Earlier in September, Mahindra began selling the Marazzo multi-purpose vehicle. It is expected to shortly introduce a full-size SUV code-named Y400, which is based on the Rexton model of its South Korean unit, SsangYong Motor Co. Mahindra is also developing another SUV that will compete with Hyundai Creta , said the second person cited above.
The person said Mahindra is also developing a seven-seater version of the TUV 300 for a potential launch in 2019.
“It has always been our endeavour to be present in all segments of the UV category,"" said a spokesperson for Mahindra in response to an emailed query.
“We will launch products that meet regulatory standards and match customer requirements, at regular intervals"", the spokesperson said, adding that the SUV segment is “evolving and growing"".
Faced with an onslaught of compact SUVs from Maruti Suzuki, Ford Motor Co., and Tata Motors Ltd., among others, Mahindra’s market share in the utility vehicle segment more than halved to 25.38% in FY18 from a peak of 55.59% in FY12.
Hyundai Motor India Ltd. and Kia Motors India are also expected to enter this segment in the next few years.
Sales of the TUV 300 grew 10.5% in FY18 to 29,018 units, while the KUV 100 recorded a 28% drop to 25,542 units. It sold only 254 units of Quanto last year.
To be sure, Mahindra won’t completely shun the compact SUV segment and is developing a model code-named S201, based on SsangYong’s compact SUV Tivoli, said the third person cited above.
“The thinking within the company is that we should stick to our strengths and rely on the partnership with Ford to experiment in the weaker segments,"" the person said, referring to the September 2017 initial agreement between the two companies to develop a compact SUV, among other initiatives. 
Another factor which led to the realignment of the compact SUV strategy is an impending price hike post 2020. “Post the implementation of the safety and emission norms in 2020, prices are sure to rise. We think we will be able to hedge ourselves against this risk by playing in a segment where buyers are less price sensitive,"" said the fourth person cited above.
Sales of large and mid-sized SUVs in India is forecast to grow at a compounded annual rate of 14.37% from 2018 to 2021, according to research firm IHS Markit. It forecast compact SUV sales to grow at a slower 11.17%.
“The compact SUV segment is where the action is in today’s market. No OEM, including Mahindra, should take their eyes off it. Being strongly present in a fast-growing segment will immensely help them and even arrest market share decline,"" said Deepesh Rathore, co-founder and director at London-based Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors."

Mumbai: Passenger car sales fell for the third straight month in September, hit by a slew of factors led by erratic monsoon rainfall and a devastating flood in Kerala. Car makers on Monday said unfavourable macroeconomic conditions and the high base of last year also contributed to the decline. 
Mumbai: Passenger car sales fell for the third straight month in September, hit by a slew of factors led by erratic monsoon rainfall and a devastating flood in Kerala. Car makers on Monday said unfavourable macroeconomic conditions and the high base of last year also contributed to the decline.
India’s top five carmakers—Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd and Honda Cars India Ltd—together sold 237,009 units last month, a 2% drop from the figure a year ago. Auto makers in the country consider factory dispatches to dealerships as sales.
While car sales had been growing at a healthy pace since November 2017, boosted by new launches and a recovery in rural demand, they have shown a downtrend for the third consecutive month in September—they fell in July due to a high base effect of the year-earlier month and generally tepid demand during the monsoon season, and as customers waited to order new models in the festive season. In the next month, sales dropped because of reasons similar to the ones cited for September.
Before July, car sales declined in June last year, when buyers held back purchases to benefit from lower rates under the goods and services tax (GST) regime, rolled out on 1 July 2017.
Auto makers begin to build up inventory in anticipation of higher demand in the forthcoming festival season. However, the first 10 days of October are likely to see muted sales in some regions, especially North India, as it marks the Shraadh period, considered inauspicious for big purchases such as cars, gold and real estate.
An early festival season, beginning in September last year, as opposed to October this year, caused a high base, while a change in the GST cess for multi-utility vehicles led to some pre-buying in September, said Subrata Ray, senior group vice president (corporate sector ratings) at ratings agency Icra Ltd.
“If you combine September and October this year and compare year-on-year, growth should be normal,"" he said, adding that there was “some"" impact due to flooding in Kerala, while urban demand took a hit due to rising interest rates, inflation and fuel prices.
India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, on Monday posted a marginal rise in local car sales in September to 136,876 units from 136,786 units a year ago, stemming two consecutive months of decline. The figures exclude sales of Maruti Suzuki’s Omni and Eeco vans and light commercial vehicle Super Carry.
The local unit of Suzuki Motor Corp. reported a decline in sales in July and August after several months of robust demand for its wide range of cars, on the back of uneven monsoon rains and devastating floods in Kerala.
Maruti Suzuki this year has introduced facelifts of models such as the Swift hatchback, the DZire compact sedan and the Ciaz mid-sized sedan, expecting robust sales to end the year with double-digit growth.
The compact car segment, which makes up the bulk of Maruti Suzuki’s sales, rose 1.7% to 74,011 units in September. With the exception of July and August, this segment had been reporting growth upwards of 20% in the past few months mainly on account of demand for the 2018 Swift hatchback and Dzire compact sedan, and continued popularity of premium hatchback Baleno.
While sales of entry-level cars Alto and WagonR fell 9.1% to 34,971 units last month, the sports utility vehicle segment comprising Vitara Brezza and S-Cross models, posted a rise of 8.7% to 21,639 units over that of 2017. Sales of the Ciaz grew 11.5% to 6,246 units.
The unfavourable demand environment affected Hyundai India, as the local unit of the South Korean firm posted a 4.5% drop in domestic sales to 47,781 units last month.
“Despite some ongoing market challenges, we expect this festival season will induce positive sentiments among customers and the industry would witness a strong positive growth,"" said Vikas Jain, national sales head at Hyundai India.
The maker of the rugged Bolero and Scorpio SUVs, Mahindra, posted a sharp decline of 16% in sales to 21,411 units in September despite the launch of the Marazzo multi-purpose vehicle. Rajan Wadhera, president of Mahindra’s automotive sector, said September was “muted"" due to factors such as “low consumer buying sentiment, high fuel prices and the effects of monsoon in many parts of the country"".
“We remain hopeful that the upcoming festive season will augur well for us as well as the automotive industry,"" he added.
Ray of Icra expects local passenger vehicle sales to rise 9% this fiscal, a forecast that has remained unchanged since the start of the year.
“The rural market would remain the key driver for overall growth as we expect the steady, strong, positive traction to continue. Overall rural sentiment will remain positive,"" he said."
431,2018-10-06,Mahindra Mahindra,"The court denied the M&M motion on grounds that it cannot show that they are likely to succeed on merits of their claim

Mumbai: In a major setback for utility vehicle (UV) maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M), a US district court in Michigan denied the company’s motion for a preliminary injunction that would have prevented Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) US LLC from bringing a complaint against it in the US’s International Trade Commission (USITC). 
Mumbai: In a major setback for utility vehicle (UV) maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M), a US district court in Michigan denied the company’s motion for a preliminary injunction that would have prevented Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) US LLC from bringing a complaint against it in the US’s International Trade Commission (USITC).
The court, in a 2 October order, denied the motion filed by M&M and its North American unit, Mahindra Automotive North America (MANA), on 23 August on the grounds that they “cannot show that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim"". 
The claim was that FCA cannot bring a suit against M&M for using an approved grille design owing to a contract signed in 2009, which was the result of negotiations between the two automakers after FCA asserted the Scorpio UV’s grille infringed on its trademark with seven parallel vertical slots.
In early September, FCA petitioned the court to reject M&M’s motion for injunction, claiming that the Indian automaker is seeking refuge in a legal interpretation of the 2009 contract.
On 1 August, FCA filed a complaint with the US ITC, a federal agency that deals with unfair trade and intellectual property practices of foreign companies, alleging that M&M’s Roxor off-road utility vehicle infringed the intellectual property rights (trade marks and trade dress) of its Jeep design, potentially putting at risk the Indian auto maker’s renewed attempt to enter the US market.
Fiat Chrysler called for an immediate halt in all sales and marketing activities of the Roxor in the US, terming the off-roader unlawful and unauthorized.
On 13 September, Mint reported that the ITC would probe the matter. If the investigation established that Mahindra had violated patents, it would derail the Indian company’s 14-year-old plan to sell utility and commercial vehicles in the US that first started in 2004.
In the 2 October order, the court said that FCA’s ITC complaint is outside the scope of the 2009 agreement because it “asserts claims that are not based on the Approved Grille Design"" as FCA believes the grille on the Roxor is “taller and more square"" than the approved design and also includes circular headlights, which are similar to the Jeep’s, and are not part of the agreed-upon design.
M&M responded by saying it is “nonsensical"" that the Roxor’s grille does not comply with the approved design because the agreement doesn’t indicate specific dimensions, which indicates that the matter would proceed in the Michigan court as well as the ITC.
However, the court said that M&M did not “present evidence sufficient to show that they can succeed on"" FCA’s claim of trade dress infringement as well.
The court added that the issuance of a preliminary injunction would cause harm to Fiat since the ITC complaint had not been resolved and therefore, it is possible that Mahindra is infringing Fiat’s intellectual property rights.
A Mahindra spokesperson said that in anticipation of the possibility that the Michigan court would be “unwilling"" to grant the injunction, Mahindra filed a motion for summary judgement on 26 September with the ITC, challenging the patent infringement claims made by Fiat with respect to the Roxor grille.
“In that motion, we requested that the ITC dismiss those claims since the ITC only has jurisdiction over trade disputes. A summary judgement in favour of Mahindra would be appropriate since the grilles were designed, manufactured, and assembled all within the United States (and not imported). That would leave the ITC to resolve the remaining merits of Fiat’s trade dress claims which we have always held were without merit"", the spokesperson said in an email.
Mahindra entered the US market in 1994 to make small tractors. With plans to make new off-highway vehicles at a facility inaugurated last November, it announced the infusion of $600 million (about  ₹ 4,330 crore) through 2020. This facility is the first new manufacturing unit in the world’s auto capital, Detroit, Michigan, in nearly 25 years, Mahindra has claimed."

New Delhi: The strategic partnership between Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Ford India Pvt. Ltd reached the next level with the signing of two definitive agreements. The companies have decided to share Bharat Stage VI-compliant engines, besides jointly developing connected vehicle solutions for the Indian market, according to a joint statement issued on Wednesday.
Mahindra will develop and supply BS VI-compliant petrol engines to the American auto maker’s Indian subsidiary, while the companies will jointly invest in developing Telematics Control Unit for connected car solutions, which will be used by both companies. It was, however, not clear whether Ford will invest in developing the BS VI engines. The new arrangement will not only help Ford reduce its cost of developing vehicles in India, but it can also use the BS VI engines in vehicles for other markets.
Mahindra Group will, under the definitive agreement on powertrain sharing, develop and supply a low-displacement petrol engine to Ford India for use in its present and future vehicles, starting 2020, according to the joint statement. The BS VI-compliant powertrain will help Ford extend and strengthen its existing offering of petrol engines.
“This collaboration with Mahindra is also a smart way for Ford to reduce its cost of developing vehicles in India. The company will use the petrol engines in India and outside along with Mahindra, which will help recover the cost in a smaller time period,"" said a senior industry executive, requesting anonymity.
The companies will also develop Telematics Systems Unit to foray into the connected vehicle space. As of now, Mahindra sources the software for some of its electric vehicles.
“Today’s announcement further builds on commitments made so far, leading to a fruition of exciting new opportunities. We are confident to meet customer expectations by working together on a number of joint development areas. Going forward, we will continue to identify the synergies that exist between the two companies,"" said Pawan Goenka, managing director, Mahindra and Mahindra.
“Today we go further in delivering even greater value. With our collaboration in powertrain and connected car solutions, we will deliver an affordable portfolio and enable our Indian consumers to get behind the wheel, feeling more confident and connected,"" said Jim Farley, executive vice-president and president of global markets, Ford Motor Co. 
Earlier this year, Ford and Mahindra had decided to collaborate on new products, including electric vehicles, specifically for the Indian market."

Expectations of sustained and strong growth rates in tractor sales following three years of normal rainfall are slowly being deflated. Since June, domestic tractor sales growth has slowed down.  
Expectations of sustained and strong growth rates in tractor sales following three years of normal rainfall are slowly being deflated. Since June, domestic tractor sales growth has slowed down. 
Data from Icra Ltd (see chart above) shows a worrisome 12% year-on-year contraction in September sales to 88,820 units. Still, manufacturers and dealers are hopeful that the fall is due to the delayed onset of the festive season in 2018 (most festivals are in the December quarter this year, whereas they normally fall in the September quarter). 
At the same time, the worry of a falling trend in sales persists. After peaking at 35% in June, growth rates tapered off to 20% and 9% in the months of July and August respectively. Although October data have not yet been collated, channel checks suggest that the sluggish trend of earlier months has continued.
Has the tractor sales cycle turned? Although it may be too early to forecast, there have been stumbling blocks in the rural agri-sector that could have spoilt the party. For instance, in spite of normal monsoons, there was uneven spatial distribution of rainfall. 
The Icra report explained that regions such as Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh that witnessed patchy or below-normal rainfall also saw weaker tractor sales. 
Further, in spite of better crop output, farm incomes have not seen a material rise. Some say that even the increase in minimum support prices has not improved farmers’ surplus after the harvest. While there may not be rural distress, the low net surplus at the farmers’ end has led to poor interest in capital expenditure. Obviously, tractor sales are the first to come off, indicating a slowdown after 18 months of buoyancy. 
Firms such as Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd the market leader which has over 40% market share, Escorts Ltd and Tractors & Farm Equipments Ltd are holding out, with innovative marketing strategies and new launches. If the trend of subdued tractor sales continues, the concerns may translate into pain for the companies."

422,2018-11-01,Mahindra Mahindra,"TCS, Infosys, HCL, Wipro and Tech Mahindra stand to make over $1 billion in 2019-2021, says report

New Delhi: The planned rollout of 5G or fifth-generation wireless technology by telecom companies globally offers at least $10 billion business over the next six years for India’s information technology (IT) services companies, according to a Mumbai-based brokerage firm. This new technology spend by telecom firms on software and services could bring over $1.1 billion in incremental revenue over the next three years for country’s five largest companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd. 
New Delhi: The planned rollout of 5G or fifth-generation wireless technology by telecom companies globally offers at least $10 billion business over the next six years for India’s information technology (IT) services companies, according to a Mumbai-based brokerage firm. This new technology spend by telecom firms on software and services could bring over $1.1 billion in incremental revenue over the next three years for country’s five largest companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd.
This development is significant as telecom firms over the last two years had held back their spend on technology, leading to tepid growth at telecom verticals for all IT firms. A new gusher of money should further boost growth for the five largest IT firms, which share among themselves about 30% of homegrown IT companies’ business from telecom companies. 
“The impending rollout of 5G networks by telecom service providers (TSPs) globally could translate to a USD 10bn incremental market opportunity – implying a 1 ppt addition to the overall industry CAGR – over 2019-25 for the Indian IT companies, on our conservative estimates,"" Pankaj Kapoor, director of India IT services and software equity research at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, wrote in a note dated 29 October.
Homegrown IT firms got $5.4 in business during 2014-16 when telecom companies set up the 4G infrastructure and Kapoor of JM Financial estimates a higher spend of over $10 billion, although over a much longer period of six years.
The world’s largest telecom firms are looking to give a face-lift to the current 4G infrastructure as newer technologies allow them to send billions of bits of data a second, higher than the current hundreds of millions of bits of data. This, in addition to letting a consumer download a movie in seconds, also allows autonomous cars and industrial equipment to work better as they need this network of ultra-fast speeds for relaying data sets.
For now, executives at some of the largest IT firms remain optimistic on the new technology spend and maintain that much of the incremental revenue will come in from the second half of the next financial year. 
A big reason behind the optimism of Indian IT companies from this rollout of 5G infrastructure by telecom firms are some of the recent mega-IT contracts awarded to set up hardware. In July, US-based T-Mobile awarded a $3.5 billion contract to Nokia to supply 5G network gear. This was followed by T-Mobile awarding another $3.5 billion contract to Ericsson in September, under which Ericsson will offer both hardware and software to the US telecom major.
“All telecom firms first set up the hardware and software and then work for the services needed to run them. Now the contracts may not be this large but then with newer technologies needed for 5G, many of us (Indian IT firms) have the chance to offer IoT (Internet of Things) platforms, data analytics solutions and other work as part of managing the network,"" said an executive at Mumbai-based TCS. The executive did not want to be named as he is not authorized to talk to the media. 
“Recent commentaries by major operators indicate selective commercial launches could start as early as 2019, though a wider global coverage is likely to be spread over 2020-22… The biggest commercial use-case of 5G is likely to be around narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) that could open an additional market for Indian ER&D/IT services players. While the timing of project flows is difficult to predict, conservatively, we see a meaningful financial impact of 5G on Indian IT companies only from 2HFY20,"" wrote Kapoor in the note."

“It is further requested that Dena Bank shall be treated at par with the assenting financial creditor for payment of the money under the resolution plan dated 12 April, 2018, in view of the order passed by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) dated 12 September,"" said an order by the Ahmedabad NCLT on 22 October.
Dissenting financial creditors are those lenders who have either abstained from voting or voted against the resolution plan approved by the committee of creditors (CoC). 
The appellate tribunal—NCLAT—had clarified in its order in a different case on 12 September, 2018 that “no discrimination can be made between the financial creditors in the resolution plan on the ground that one has dissented and voted against the resolution plan or the other has supported and voted in favour of the resolution plan"".
Both banks had earlier objected to Reliance Industries (RIL)-JM Financial ARC resolution plan for Alok Industries which envisaged buying the company, which owes lenders  ₹ 29,600 crore, for just  ₹ 5,050 crore. The liquidation value of Alok Industries is  ₹ 4,200 crore, while the resolution plan from Reliance offered  ₹ 5,050 crore upfront.
A lawyer aware of the development said, both the lenders have been assured by the committee of creditors (CoC) that they will be at par with other creditors in terms of loan recovery. “Kotak Mahindra Bank was the first one to approach the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and Dena Bank followed,"" he said.
Emails send to Dena Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, resolution professional Ajay Joshi and Reliance Industries did not elicit any response.
The textile company is among the 12 large stressed assets identified in June 2017 by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), where lenders were directed to initiate proceedings under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
The company’s resolution plan was initially rejected by lenders in April 2018 after only 70% voted in its favour. However, lenders re-voted on the proposal in June 2018 after the government lowered the CoC approval threshold from 75% to 66%. This time, 72% lenders approved RIL’s resolution plan.
The Financial Express reported on 26 April that steps taken by the resolution professional (RP) for Alok Industries to recover trade outstanding to the tune of  ₹ 11,622 crore from 5,293 debtors of the textile company remained unsuccessful as 2,467 of them could not be traced.
“Debtors were not locatable at the addresses that were provided by Alok Industries,"" the Financial Express said, citing documents, understood to have been made available to the CoC ahead of a meeting scheduled for 13 April under the IBC process. It said Damania & Varaiya, a chartered accountancy firm, appointed after the fourth CoC meeting to conduct an independent verification of the transactions (trading transactions) and a forensic audit conducted by Grant Thornton — for the period 1 April 2012, to 31 March 2015 — found “no malfeasance on the part of promoters of the Alok Industries or any transfer involving siphoning of funds was observed"".

419,2018-11-15,Mahindra Mahindra,"Increased cost pressures and expenses towards launching the Marazzo MPV in September led to the fall in margins, says Mahindra

 Mumbai: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd beat market expectations with a 24% rise in standalone quarterly net profit mainly because of a sharp rise in other income and higher sales. Competitive pressures and higher marketing expenses, especially for its latest Marazzo multi-purpose vehicle, however, hit profit margins in the quarter ended 30 September while the company trimmed its volume growth guidance for this financial year. 
 Mumbai: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd beat market expectations with a 24% rise in standalone quarterly net profit mainly because of a sharp rise in other income and higher sales. Competitive pressures and higher marketing expenses, especially for its latest Marazzo multi-purpose vehicle, however, hit profit margins in the quarter ended 30 September while the company trimmed its volume growth guidance for this financial year.
Profit rose to  ₹ 1,649.46 crore last quarter from  ₹ 1,331.57 crore a year earlier, Mahindra said on Wednesday. The figure surpassed the  ₹ 1,293.5 crore profit forecast in a Bloomberg poll of 14 analysts.
Net sales grew at a modest 6.6% to  ₹ 12,988.57 crore from  ₹ 12,183.65 crore.
Other income surged 53% to  ₹ 847.75 because of higher dividend income from subsidiaries.
Mahindra’s managing director Pawan Goenka said unfavourable macroeconomic factors had a “moderating effect"" on the automobile industry in the September quarter as opposed to the June quarter.
A high base in the same quarter last year, a shift in the festive season this year to November, compared with October last year, and weak consumer sentiment because high fuel prices and certain regulatory changes hit overall demand, Goenka said.
Revenue from the auto sector, which comprises  ₹ 2 out of every  ₹ 3 earned by Mahindra, rose 8.75% to  ₹ 8,638.69 crore. In the farm equipment segment, revenue rose a marginal 1.77% to  ₹ 4,028.07 crore. Revenues from other segments, such as hospitality and financial services, jumped 13% to  ₹ 405.2 crore.
Mahindra’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin, at the consolidated level fell 1.5 percentage points to 14.5% from 16% a year ago.
Increased cost pressures and expenses towards launching the Marazzo in September led to the fall in margins, said V.S. Parthasarathy, Mahindra’s group chief financial officer.
Margins were marginally lower than estimates also because of pressures in the auto segment, said Bharat Gianani, an analyst at Sharekhan Ltd in a note.
Higher discounting also impacted margins in the auto business, he said. Farm equipment margins matched estimates, he said. Goenka lowered Mahindra’s sales growth forecast for tractors and automobiles this fiscal year. He expects tractors to clock a growth between 12-14% “with a bias towards 12%"" instead of the stated 14% at the beginning of the fiscal. For the passenger vehicle industry, he pegged growth at 7-8% instead of above 10% previously.
While commodity prices rose about 2.5 percentage points for both auto and farm equipment divisions last quarter, Mahindra has passed only half of the increase to customers so far, Goenka said. A decision has yet to be taken on raising prices in the future, he said. Mahindra’s domestic automobile sales rose 8.8% in the quarter to 60,867 units, off a low base.
However, utility vehicle sales fell 9.5% to 55,656 units because of a broader slowdown in passenger vehicle demand. Tractor sales fell 5.2% from a year earlier to 73,012 units last quarter.
There is increased uncertainty in the mind of buyers because of a rise in car prices caused by higher commodity prices and regulatory changes such as in insurance norms and a possible ban on diesel vehicles in New Delhi to address air pollution woes, Goenka said.
He expects headwinds in the auto business to continue for at least another quarter.
For the first time, rural areas had a greater share in total auto sales than urban areas at 51% last quarter. This may offer some respite to Mahindra to offset competitive intensity in the urban areas with improvement in rural sentiments due to progress on rabi crop sowing and increase in kharif output.
Shares of Mahindra closed at  ₹ 770.4 apiece on the BSE, down 2.62%, while the benchmark Sensex closed almost flat at 35,141.99 points. The results were announced during market hours."
418,2018-11-15,Mahindra Mahindra,"Going ahead, new car launches and a steady tractor business will aid Mahindra, but much depends on the sales momentum and recovery in profitability

Shares of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd lost 2.3% on the National Stock Exchange after it reported weaker-than-expected numbers for the September quarter (Q2) on Wednesday. Revenue growth was a tepid 6.6%, reflecting muted volumes. But what caught the Street off guard is a sizeable reduction in profitability of the automobile segment. 
Shares of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd lost 2.3% on the National Stock Exchange after it reported weaker-than-expected numbers for the September quarter (Q2) on Wednesday. Revenue growth was a tepid 6.6%, reflecting muted volumes. But what caught the Street off guard is a sizeable reduction in profitability of the automobile segment.
Margins from automobiles dropped 2.7 percentage points from a year ago. The rise in raw material costs, introductory pricing for the new vehicle and higher promotional expenses were the reasons. This had a bearing on the consolidated entity as well, with margins falling by a higher-than-expected 1.5 percentage points to 14.5%.
Thanks to a non-recurring income and lower tax expense, net profit jumped 26%. But with core earnings trailing estimates, this brought no cheer. With Wednesday’s fall, the stock has lost almost 17% from its June quarter results. During the same period, the Nifty lost 7.6% and indications are the underperformance may not reverse in a hurry.
Weighing on the outlook are muted demand conditions. Tractor sales during the recent festive season were subdued. As a consequence, growth outlook for the segment is now tilted towards the lower end of the 12-14% guidance (versus the higher end earlier).
That said, the recently launched utility vehicle Marazzo is seeing a good response. If not for this new vehicle, Mahindra’s utility vehicle sales would be falling (utility vehicles were up just 1% in October). 
But as Bharat Gianani, analyst at Sharekhan Ltd, says, muted demand conditions mean that volume expectations for the industry have come down.
Even so, with Mahindra preparing to launch two new cars (Inferno S201 and Alturas), one in the popular compact SUV segment, volumes should rise, adds Gianani. But the big question is how much of this translates to revenue and profit growth.

The company is yet to fully pass on the recent rise in raw material costs. New product launches mean promotional costs are expected to remain high in the current as well as the next quarter. Unless demand sees noticeable recovery and helps Mahindra spread costs, chances are profitability will remain subdued in the near term, weighing on earnings expectations."

Mahindra, which mainly produces sport-utility vehicles and tractors, will implement the project through its subsidiary, Mahindra Electric. The firm will also build components for EVs at the so-called electric technology manufacturing hub in Bengaluru.
The facility is expected to have an annual capacity of 70,000 vehicles by 2020. Mahindra also plans to supply electric vehicle parts from the facility to other companies wanting to build their own electric vehicles. On Wednesday, it also showcased its Treo range of electric autos.
The facility is part of Mahindra’s strategy to keep its leadership of India’s electric vehicle industry at a time when the union government is urging auto makers to locally produce electric vehicles. The government is also working on a policy to promote eco-friendly vehicles in a bid to cut rampant pollution in major cities.
Mahindra will make battery packs, power electronics and motor assembly which are key to an electric power train.
Pawan Goenka, Mahindra’s managing director, said the firm is looking at developing electric cars costing €300,000 with its Italian subsidiary Pininfarina.

Mumbai: More than two decades after they disappeared from Indian roads, the iconic Jawa Motorcycles are back. Classic Legends Pvt. Ltd, a subsidiary of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, on Thursday launched two bikes—Jawa and Jawa 42—while a third—the bobber-style Jawa Perak—will be launched next year. The Indian operations of Jawa, a brand born in erstwhile Czechoslovakia, were wound up in 1996. 
Mumbai: More than two decades after they disappeared from Indian roads, the iconic Jawa Motorcycles are back. Classic Legends Pvt. Ltd, a subsidiary of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, on Thursday launched two bikes—Jawa and Jawa 42—while a third—the bobber-style Jawa Perak—will be launched next year. The Indian operations of Jawa, a brand born in erstwhile Czechoslovakia, were wound up in 1996.
Jawa and Jawa 42, the two models launched on Thursday, are powered by a 293cc, liquid-cooled, single-cylinder engine in a double-cradle chassis, generating 27bhp of power. The firm claims the all-new engine uses a double overhead camshaft (DOHC) configuration, which increases the efficiency of the engine at higher speeds.
Priced at  ₹ 1.64 lakh and  ₹ 1.55 lakh, respectively (ex-showroom, Delhi), the Jawa and Jawa 42 are seen as the first real challengers to Royal Enfield in the retro cruiser segment of motorcycles. However, both cost more than Royal Enfield Classic 350, which retails at  ₹ 1.47 lakh (ex-showroom, Mumbai).
Having first entered the Indian market in the early 1960s, Jawa was founded in Czechoslovakia more than 90 years ago. In its heyday, Jawa bikes were exported to more than 120 countries.
The new engines are developed on a platform that already complies with the Bharat Stage VI emission norms, the company said in a statement, adding that the motorcycles will be manufactured at M&M’s Pithampur, Madhya Pradesh, facility.
Anand Mahindra-led Mahindra Group, Anupam Thareja and Boman Irani are the shareholders of Classic Legends, with Mahindra holding a majority stake of 60%.
“It’s rare to get an opportunity to resurrect a legend. Jawa is an authentic and iconic brand that represents the desire and yearning in all of us for freedom and adventure,"" said Mahindra.
The company said it has appointed 105 dealers across the country, with the first dealership likely to open next month. While bookings have commenced, deliveries will begin in early 2019. 
Classic Legends, incorporated in 2015, also unveiled the Jawa Perak, which will be powered by a 334cc engine that develops 30bhp and 31Nm of torque, and is priced at  ₹ 1.89 lakh. This model will be launched in 2019 .
Since Indian consumers have looked to upgrade to pricier and more powerful motorcycles since the past few years owing to rising disposable incomes, which have in turn led to an increase in demand for leisure, analysts are positive on the brand’s success in India, at least in the short term.
“The (premium) segment is hot right now because of Royal Enfield’s success; they have made retro leisure biking a trend because of their heritage, history and motorcycles that people like to ride. Jawa has a similar story; they are likely to obtain initial traction based on the prices. In the long run, only the on-road performance of the bikes will tell,"" said Deepesh Rathore, co-founder and director at London-based Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors.
“This seems like the right timing to have come up with this range of motorcycles, as the Indian premium motorcycle market is not only growing but also evolving in consumer tastes and preferences,"" said Ashish Joshi, chief executive officer of Classic Legends."

New Delhi: With major cities in India facing pollution issues, specially in the National Capital, Mahindra group is exploring the possibility of introducing electric kick scooters as clean last mile mobility solution, according to its chairman Anand Mahindra.
The group is looking at leveraging the strength and experience of San Francisco-based shared electric mobility firm Scoot Networks, in which it is a major investor, for a multi-modal approach of shared mobility to tackle pollution and congestion problems here.
Mahindra along with other executives of the group and Scoot Networks CEO Michael Keating met ministers in the Centre and Delhi government to explore the possibility of bringing shared electric kick scooters here.
“We believe that this vehicle is frankly the best last mile solution, the most clean solution the world will see,"" Mahindra told PTI here in an interview.
Stating that adopting the electric kick scooter would be like “leapfrogging"" to mobile telephony from landline, he said, “This we believe is the democratisation of last mile in clean manner, which is good for the planet."" An electric kick scooter is powered by a battery-driven electric motor and can reach maximum speed of 25 kmph. It has a foldable chassis with a large deck in the centre on which the rider stands and its two wheels are much smaller than conventional scooter wheels. Pitching electric kick scooter for the National Capital, Keating said, “In a city like Delhi, where there is actually more urgency than other cities due to the air pollution and the growing population, this is an interesting option as a way to make things better."" When asked how soon the group could introduce it in India, Mahindra said, “As soon as (it is) feasible, we are looking at all the ways of doing it. We met with an incredibly warm response (from government officials), no cynicism whatsoever and willingness to work together to find the way."" He said the popularity of electric kick scooter has spread like “wildfire"" around the globe, largely in Europe and the US.
“I actually think this is going to work better in decongesting our cities with lanes and small lanes and alleys whether it’s Varanasi as a city or Chandni Chowk here,"" he said.
Mahindra, however, said it has to be gradually and carefully introduced besides training people in order to avoid accidents. With Delhi making global news by becoming a ‘death trap’ due to pollution, he said it was necessary for a shared last-mile mobility solution such as electric kick scooter to be a part of the conversation to address the problem.
Keating said the ease of use for short distances and affordability along with the flexibility to use anywhere without having to plug anything in has made the electric kick scooter popular in Europe and the US and the same could be replicated in India, specially in congested cities.

Maruti Suzuki Ertiga 2018: Features and Specifications
The new Ertiga has received a significant facelift—and is visibly at par with the looks of its main contenders, the Mahindra Marazzo and Honda BR-V. It is more squared-off on the front, with a more aggressive grille and headlamps. The rear-end has been remastered as well, with tail lamps that extend all the way to the spoiler.
The dimensions of the Ertiga have also grown: it’s longer by 99mm, wider by 40mm and taller by 5mm. The wheelbase, however, has remained the same at 2,740mm.
Despite the bump in external dimensions, boot space has shrunk. It now stands at 32 litres.
At the heart of this MPV are two engines: one new and one old.
The petrol motor is the all-new 1.5-litre, inline-four K15B producing 103bhp of power and 138Nm of torque. This is mated with either five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmissions.
The diesel engine remains the same: 1.3-litre DDiS which produces 90bhp of power and 200Nm of torque and is mated to a five-speed manual transmission. There are no automatic diesel options available.
Maruti Suzuki claims it offers best-in-class fuel efficiency that is 10% higher than the outgoing model. The manual petrol variant makes 19.34kmpl while the automatic makes 18.69kmpl. The diesel Ertiga has a fuel efficiency of 25.47 kmpl.
The insides of the Ertiga are now more contemporary. It is now at par with its Maruti siblings, in terms of cabin niceties. The MPV gets a new dashboard, infotainment system (Apple CarPlay and Android Auto ready), instrument cluster, flat-bottom steering wheel, Cruise Control and faux wood inserts.
The new Ertiga comes in five paints jobs—Pearl Metallic Auburn Red, Metallic Magma Grey, Real Metallic Oxford Blue, Pearl Arctic White and Metallic Silky Silver.

The company, which already sells models like XUV500 and Scorpio in this segment, is aiming to sell around 450-500 units per month of the new model per month. “The launch of the Alturas G4 is a significant moment in the automotive journey of Mahindra which will take the brand to the next level,"" M&M Managing Director Pawan Goenka told reporters.

The company has put a price tag of  ₹ 26.95 lakh for two-wheel drive version of this premium SUV, while its four-wheel drive variant will cost for  ₹ 29.95 lakh.
“The product is the epitome of luxury in every sense. Therefore we believe the Alturas G4 aptly redefines royalty which is also its positioning,"" Goenka said.
When asked about the sales target for the new model, Goenka said the company is eyeing 10-15 per cent market share of the premium SUV segment which is pegged at around 4,500 units per month.
The vehicle would compete with the likes of Toyota Fortuner and Ford Endeavour.
The Alturas G4, which is sold as SsangYong Rexton G4 in South Korea, is powered by a 2.2 litre diesel engine mated to 7-speed automatic transmission.
Goenka said the model would come as a complete knocked down unit (CKD) and would be assembled here.
“With passage of time, we will look at enhancing local content in the vehicle,"" he added.
The Alturas G4 would be exclusively available through separate high-end showrooms within the existing Mahindra dealerships.
These outlets will be equipped with ultra-modern digital technology to provide an enhanced and immersive high-end experience for customers, Goenka said."

407,2018-11-28,Mahindra Mahindra,"While Kotak Mahindra Bank has its conversations with the regulator, investors are left wondering which way the outcome will swing

The Reserve Bank of India’s insistence on promoter stake dilution continues to be an albatross around the neck of Kotak Mahindra Bank. This is reflected in the 9.7% fall in the share price ever since RBI refused to bless an innovative way of bringing down the stake of promoter Uday Kotak in August. 
The Reserve Bank of India’s insistence on promoter stake dilution continues to be an albatross around the neck of Kotak Mahindra Bank. This is reflected in the 9.7% fall in the share price ever since RBI refused to bless an innovative way of bringing down the stake of promoter Uday Kotak in August.
The bank had issued perpetual non-cumulative preference shares to eligible shareholders that increased its capital base by  ₹ 500 crore. The private sector lender had argued that following this issue, the stake of the promoter group stood diluted to below 20%. This, it said, fulfilled the central bank’s norms on the same ahead of the deadline of December. However a week after the share issue, RBI refused to give its blessings and this makes the December deadline very real for the bank.
There are no easy options available to Kotak Mahindra Bank’s promoters, who need to bring down ownership from 30.02% to just under 20% by December. It can acquire another lender or finance company, and try and bring the promoter stake down through a share swap. Needless to say, this is easier said than done—the merger with ING Vysya Bank, for instance, has taken more than a year.
Another option is to have a fresh issue of shares. Considering this would mean selling shares worth over  ₹ 1.1 trillion at current prices, it is a tall task. Yet another option is for Uday Kotak to sell his excess 10% stake in the secondary market through a block deal. Such a sale would be roughly worth  ₹ 22,400 crore ($3.16 billion). This looks tough but is not impossible as investors in other companies have done this before. For instance, in February 2012, Citibank sold a near 10% stake in Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) in a block deal worth $1.9 billion.
But from the looks of it, Kotak Mahindra Bank seems to be betting that RBI will relent. When it informed investors that the central bank hadn’t approved of its preference shares route for dilution, it added, “We continue to believe that we have met the requirement and will engage with the RBI in this behalf.""
In the past, Kotak Mahindra Bank has received extensions, although this time seems different, especially since RBI recently pulled up Bandhan Bank Ltd for failing to meet its deadline on the stake dilution norms. Bandhan Bank’s shares are still about 18% down since the central bank’s decree, which says that it cannot open new branches without its approval.
Analysts say that missing the deadline on promoter shareholding norms would be disastrous for the Kotak Mahindra Bank share prices as well.
Operationally, taking approvals for new branches may be cumbersome, but may not have much of an impact. Kotak Mahindra Bank has anyway been slow in adding branches, especially after ING Vysya’s acquisition, and is instead pushing its digital channels more. Nevertheless, investor sentiment will be hit and its valuations may begin to reflect the cost of running afoul of the regulator.
While Kotak Mahindra Bank has its conversations with the regulator, investors are left wondering which way the outcome will swing. Until this is sorted out, the stock is unlikely to break free of the current downward trend. Its valuations offer no help too, as at a multiple of five times estimated book value for FY21, they are viewed as rich. Firms like Elara Capital Plc have a sell rating on the stock due to high valuations and the unresolved promoter holding issue."

400,2018-12-11,Mahindra Mahindra,"Kotak Mahindra Bank's move to take RBI to court over the promoter shareholding issue is likely to buy the bank time, if it's successful in getting a stay

Is Uday Kotak’s move to take RBI to the courts a case of righteous defiance or foolish bravado? Investors are still making up their mind and the uncertainty is affecting the Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd stock. The scrip fell 6% after the bank said in an exchange filing that it has filed a writ petition against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the Bombay high court to protect its interests. Kotak and the central bank haven’t been seeing eye to eye on the methods available for a private sector bank to reduce promoter shareholding. 
Is Uday Kotak’s move to take RBI to the courts a case of righteous defiance or foolish bravado? Investors are still making up their mind and the uncertainty is affecting the Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd stock. The scrip fell 6% after the bank said in an exchange filing that it has filed a writ petition against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the Bombay high court to protect its interests. Kotak and the central bank haven’t been seeing eye to eye on the methods available for a private sector bank to reduce promoter shareholding.
Even though the deadline for meeting RBI’s norms was around the corner, investors didn’t seem too perturbed. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s shares have outperformed the markets this fiscal year. Investors seem to have assumed that Kotak would manage a workaround or a compromise. After all, there have been multiple similar deadlines in the past, and they were successfully navigated. But this time is evidently different.
For backdrop, RBI rules state that promoter shareholding in Kotak Mahindra Bank has to be brought down to 20% by the end of December this year and 15% by March 2020. It currently stands at a little over 30%.
In August, Kotak Mahindra Bank hit upon the route of issuing perpetual non-convertible preference shares to increase the paid-up capital, thereby diluting Kotak’s stake in the bank. RBI shot down this idea and refused to consider this route as a valid one. This implied that only traditional methods such as a direct sale of shares by the promoters or a fresh equity issue to outside investors would be considered kosher by the central bank.
But Kotak has persisted, and has been trying to convince the regulator to give in. The filing of the writ petition shows that neither side is blinking.
RBI’s stance is not surprising. Just a few months ago, it pulled up Bandhan Bank Ltd for violating the deadline of diluting promoter ownership. Other banks have behaved like obedient children and strictly followed timelines. Considering the law is equal to all and regulation cannot be partisan, RBI seems to have stuck to its guns.
The contents of Kotak Mahindra Bank’s petition are not known publicly yet, but analysts reckon it is mainly to challenge the exclusion of the preference share route for stake dilution. After all, Kotak’s argument is that this route is allowed under The Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
The window for suing the regulator is thanks to some poor drafting by RBI’s legal department. Under the rules, the promoter has to bring down stake with respect to paid-up capital, and not specifically equity capital. Kotak is just following the law to the letter, and has received a fair share of criticism for disregarding the spirit of the law.
Evidently, this isn’t something Kotak seems to be too worried about, having taken the letter of the law argument all the way to the courts. Having said that, the move is likely to buy the bank time, if it’s successful in getting a stay granted by the courts. In a best-case scenario, the courts may agree with Kotak Mahindra Bank’s argument.
For now, though, investors are left ruing the fact that uncertainty on the issue will linger, besides worrying about any likely fallout of taking on the regulator."
402,2018-12-11,Mahindra Mahindra,"Kotak Mahindra Bank promoter Uday Kotak was barred from reducing stake via preference share issue

Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd has moved the Bombay high court against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) after its promoter Uday Kotak was barred from reducing his stake in the bank through a preference share issue, in the first instance of a bank dragging the regulator to court. 
Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd has moved the Bombay high court against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) after its promoter Uday Kotak was barred from reducing his stake in the bank through a preference share issue, in the first instance of a bank dragging the regulator to court.
Documents on the Bombay high court website show the writ petition was filed by Kotak Mahindra Bank and its director Chengalath Jayaram against RBI and the finance ministry. Law firm Manilal Kher Ambalal & Co. (MKA & Co.) is representing Kotak Mahindra. The first hearing on the case will take place on 17 December.
Vikram Trivedi, managing partner of MKA & Co. declined to comment, citing client confidentiality.
The RBI had mandated the private sector lender to trim promoter shareholding to 20% of its paid-up capital by 31 December 2018, and to 15% before 31 March 2020. On 2 August, Kotak Mahindra completed an issue of perpetual non-convertible preference shares (PNCPS), increasing the bank’s paid-up capital from  ₹ 953 crore to  ₹ 1,453 crore, thereby bringing down the promoter’s holding from 30.3% to 19.7%. However, the bank informed the stock exchanges on 14 August that the method did not meet the RBI’s requirements.
In a regulatory filing on Monday, Kotak Mahindra said ever since, it has clarified and conveyed its position to the central bank “in relation to PNCPS being a part of paid-up capital, and the legal basis on the matter of dilution of shareholding under the Banking Regulation Act"".
“We have also shared with the RBI the opinions of eminent jurists and senior-most legal counsels of the country, which confirm our understanding."" It added that it has not heard from the RBI and given the deadline of 31 December, the “bank has been left with no option, but to protect its interests"".
Also Read | Lessons from Kotak Bank’s preference shares issue
A banking analyst, who did not wish to be identified, said in challenging RBI’s decision, Kotak Mahindra has essentially challenged RBI’s powers to regulate private sector banks. 
There are two possible outcomes from this, the analyst said. The first is, if Kotak wins the case and is allowed to use PNCPS to reduce promoter shareholding, the central bank will definitely challenge it in the Supreme Court. The second scenarios is, if Kotak loses the case, then he will not only have to use another way to pare his stake, but will also face far more stringent regulatory supervision following the debacle. In either scenario, the 31 December deadline is unlikely to be met. 
“The bank has filed a case against the regulator. The case will surely set a precedent for any such future disputes. The matter pertains to the interpretation of the law and should be dealt with by the court only,"" said Ashish K. Singh, founder and managing partner of law firm Capstone Legal. 
“The deadline for the diluting the shareholding is 31 December 2018; so if the writ petition is admitted, the time period is required to be extended by the direction of the court."" 
In August, when RBI rejected the bank’s proposal, experts said it was along expected lines as one cannot circumvent RBI regulations. 
Typically, stake dilution happens through sale or issue of fresh equity shares. Mint reported on 14 August that Kotak Mahindra would have needed to issue  ₹ 1.25 trillion equity to meet the norms of promoter stake dilution. If promoters had to sell shares outright, it would have required a block deal of about  ₹ 25,000 crore.
Shares of Kotak Mahindra closed 6.6% lower at  ₹ 1,198.15 on the BSE, unperforming a 2% decline in the main index."

New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd, which is on a comeback trail, is betting big on its upcoming SUV Tata Harrier to place itself among the top three passenger vehicle manufacturers on a sustainable basis, a top company executive said.The company, which has been working on a strategy to revive its fortunes in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment for the last couple of years, now believes it has the products and scale to be among the leaders in the segment.
In an interview with the Press Trust of India, Tata Motors chief executive officer and managing director, Guenter Butschek, said the company had decided in 2016 to aim for the No.3 spot in the PV segment by the end of 2018-19 financial year. “We were number seven at that point in time. When we became number three for the first time in October last year on a monthly basis, we surprised ourselves. At no given point of time the organization really had a belief that this is going to be possible,"" Butschek said.
In the past one year, the company has broken into top three positions thrice on monthly sales basis behind leaders Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor India Pvt. Ltd.
“At least in three of the (last) 12 months we made it even with limited scope of new products,"" Butschek said.
In the April-October period this fiscal, Tata Motors was at No.4 position with sales of 1,38,732 units, a growth of 25.65% over the same period of 2017-18.
Maruti Suzuki is at the top with sales of 10,44,749 units followed by Hyundai at second position with 3,26,178 units. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd is at the third position with 1,45,462 units, marginal growth over same period of last fiscal.
Having made its presence felt with products like Nexon, Tiago and Hexa, Tata Motors now expects its new offering—the Tata Harrier—to further cement its position in the domestic market.
“We feel very comfortable as far as onward journey is concerned. Tata Harrier plays a fundamental role as it is expected to get us one step forward to a sustainable number three position,"" Butschek said. “The kind of response we have seen so far for the vehicle, we are pretty positive that this car is really going to turn the needle of our destiny in multiple respects."" 
The Tata Harrier, which is based on Land Rover’s D8 Architecture, is scheduled for launch next month. It will take on popular products like Jeep Compass and Mahindra XUV500.
Butschek said the new product would help the company move from “value offerings to a premium offering"". “It improves attractiveness of the brand. It brings us a wider set of customers if we get the sales and after sales experience right,"" he said.
Tata Motors president (passenger vehicles business) Mayank Pareek said the company’s vision is to be the mobility provider for all sections of the society.
“We don’t want to restrict ourselves to few segments. Our new portfolio strategy started from 2016. With each launch since then we have tried to push the envelope a little further and increase our market coverage. Today we cover 60-odd percent of the market,"" he said.
Emphasising on how the company’s approach has changed in the past couple of years, Pareek said earlier Tata Motors used to be the last one to launch a car in any segment. However, with Tata Harrier, Tata Motors has changed that, targeting “those customers who want a pure SUV experience""."

Mumbai: The Bombay high court has declined to stay a directive of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the promoters of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, including its billionaire owner Uday Kotak, to lower their stake in the bank by 31 December.  
Mumbai: The Bombay high court has declined to stay a directive of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the promoters of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, including its billionaire owner Uday Kotak, to lower their stake in the bank by 31 December. 
The private sector lender had moved the high court after RBI rejected the bank’s proposal to issue perpetual non-convertible preference shares in August to comply with promoter stake rules. Uday Kotak, who owns about 30% in the bank, has been asked by the central bank to cut his holding to 20% by the end of this year, and to 15% by March 2020.
While the next hearing on the case has been scheduled for 17 January, Monday’s decision by the Bombay high court is likely to force Kotak’s hand on the promoter’s stake issue. Kotak has two weeks to comply with the RBI directive or face penal action.
In a similar case, the banking regulator had earlier frozen the salary of Bandhan Bank chief executive and founder Chandra Shekhar Ghosh and also denied the private lender permission to open new branches. 
“The promoter of Kotak Bank would prefer to face some penal action similar to what RBI had done with Bandhan Bank. However, we expect the promoter to comply with the RBI guidelines on shareholder norms over a period of time,"" said Ashutosh Mishra, head of institutional research at Ashika Stock Broking.
Senior counsel Venkatesh Dhond, who appeared for RBI, said promoter stake dilution is aimed at ensuring that voting power is not concentrated in the hands of a single group and that all banks have complied with the rule. 
“We have issued a letter to the bank in August, but now when the deadline is approaching, the bank has come to the high court seeking a stay,"" he argued.
Darius Khambata, the lawyer representing Kotak Mahindra, said: “In the past, the RBI asked the bank to only dilute promoter shareholding of its paid-up capital. However, the impugned letter sought dilution of paid-up voting equity capital. 
“After receiving the letter, the bank wrote two letters—one to then RBI governor and the other to the RBI board seeking clarification. But, we haven’t got any response.""
Khambata pleaded before the court that “RBI must not take any coercive step post December 31, the deadline by when the promoters have to reduce their stake to 20%"". 
“We are the only private sector bank owned by an Indian,"" Khambata said on behalf of Kotak Mahindra. “If we go by the RBI mandate, then it will be difficult to find any domestic investor and hence the only option would be to bring in foreign investors.""
After hearing arguments from both sides, the division bench of the Bombay high court comprising Justice B.P. Dharmadhikari and Justice S.V. Kotwal said the central bank is a responsible regulator and the court would not direct it to do anything at this stage.
The bank, in its petition, has argued that “the impugned reduction communications and the 2018 RBI letter have been issued by the RBI without authority of law, contrary to the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, Article 14 and Article 19 (1)(G) of the Constitution of India."""

Mumbai: The outcome of the controversial demonetisation drive would have been “significantly better"" if “simple things"" like introducing Rs2,000 currency notes were avoided, banker Uday Kotak has said. 
Mumbai: The outcome of the controversial demonetisation drive would have been “significantly better"" if “simple things"" like introducing Rs2,000 currency notes were avoided, banker Uday Kotak has said.
The executive vice chairman and managing director of the fourth largest private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank has also said small businesses are in a difficult situation at present and has welcomed the government focus to revive the sector.
On demonetisation, he said the outcomes would have been different if it was planned well.
“I think we would have had significantly better outcomes, if we had just thought about simple things. If you are taking out Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes, why would you introduce Rs2,000 notes? “ Kotak asked while speaking at former chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian’s book launch here over the weekend.
Kotak said as part of the “execution"" strategy, it was essential to ensure larger quantum of notes of the right denomination were made available.
If such things were undertaken, “we would have been talking very differently today than now,"" he said.
But Kotak claimed that for the financial sector, demonetisation has been a “huge boon"".
He said the growth in financial savings have been “unbelievable"", which has also led to a challenge of risk management.
On 8 November, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi surprised all by announcing a withdrawal of the  ₹ 500 and  ₹ ,000 notes, claiming to curb black money and fake notes. But the final numbers have disproved all the calculations wrong as 99.3% of the cancelled notes worth close to  ₹ 5.8 trillion has come back to the system.
This was immediately followed with the introduction of Rs2,000 note by RBI the same evening. Later, the Central bank has also introduced a Rs200 denomination notes.
On the small businesses sector, he pitched for more focus saying the sector is impacted.
“I believe that the SME sector has taken a significant amount of pain. Getting credit for them is tough even now"", he said.
He also welcomed latest government moves for the sector.

Prabhu said he has taken up the issue with the finance ministry. Several startups have raised concerns on taxation of angel funds under Section 56 of the Income Tax Act, which provides for taxation of funds received by an entity.
A PTI report quoted an income tax official as saying that notices issued on angel tax to startups may be for those that are not recognised by the department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP). The government had earlier given relief to startups by allowing them to avail tax concession if total investment including funding from angel investors does not exceed  ₹ 10 crore.
As per a notification by the commerce and industry ministry, an angel investor picking up stakes in a startup should have a minimum net worth of  ₹ 2 crore or should have an average returned income of over  ₹ 25 lakh in the preceding three financial years."

Hyderabad: The Hyderabad high court Monday set aside an Enforcement Directorate order provisionally attaching fixed deposits worth  ₹ 822 crore belonging to Tech Mahindra.
The Enforcement Directorate or ED in 2012 provisionally attached the fixed deposits under Section 5 (1) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) 2002, before Tech Mahindra formally took over scam-hit Satyam Computers.
The ED attached the amount alleging that it was ill-gotten proceeds of Satyam Computers.
A bench comprising Justices V Ramasubramanian and J Uma Devi set aside the ED’s order.
Counsel for Tech Mahindra Vivek Reddy told PTI 
that they argued that there was no money with the fraud-hit Satyam Computer Services Ltd in 2009, when it was taken over and the Mahindra group company infused the amount to revive the Ramalinga Raju-founded company.
On January 7, 2009, Raju in his capacity as chairman had sent an email to Sebi, wherein he admitted and confessed to inflating the books of Satyam besides understating liabilities and other financial misstatements.
After the fraud came to light, the government ordered auction of the company to protect investors and employees of the then fourth-largest IT firm.
Satyam was acquired by Tech Mahindra, and then was renamed Mahindra Satyam and was eventually merged with Tech Mahindra.

393,2019-01-02,Mahindra Mahindra,"With the company of state-of-the-art high-end SUVs, such as the new Alturas G4 by Mahindra, you can be an adventurer who travels with elegance and style.
If you have trouble sticking to New Year resolutions, here’s an easy one for you. In the coming year, keep a bag with spare clothes handy, a favorite travel-mate nearby, and make a pact with the road. Over long and short weekends, travel to far-off places, let your wheels roll over unexplored terrain, and belong to the road. Don’t be a dusty and sweaty backpacker, if that’s not your thing. With the company of state-of-the-art high-end SUVs, such as the new Alturas G4, you can be an adventurer who travels with elegance and style. 
Whether you’re a seasoned traveler or just planning your first big road trip, here’s a list of destinations spanning the length and breadth of India, with notes and recommendations specially curated for a luxury traveler.
1.Delhi to Leh
As one of the most popular road trips in India, the mecca for travelers, a trip to Leh may have either been on your ‘to-do’ list or ‘done-that’ list. Either way, the best way to travel to Leh from Delhi (if you don’t want to break your back on a motorbike) is with a rugged and sturdy SUV. This trip provides you plenty of road-time, as the journey stretches a solid 1,000 km at least. There are two ways to do this road trip: Delhi-Manali-Leh, or take the road less traveled from Delhi-Srinagar-Kargil-Leh. If you are a frequent road traveler, you can make multiple stops along the way and explore places around Leh, such as Tso Moriri, Pangong, and Sarchu. Be sure to pick an SUV with a smooth cruise control, which will have you gliding across the panoramic landscapes of Leh in style. 
2.Bangalore to Ooty/Coorg
If you’re not looking for a 10-day road trip as the one above, but instead are interested in a weekend getaway in the south, drive down from Bangalore to Ooty and be welcomed by the chilly weather at the hill station. Around 340 km south, the trip will take you about 7-8 hours and through places such as the historical Mysore, the green fields of Gundlupet, and the jungle safaris at Bandipur and Mudummalai. While the altitudes to climb won’t be too high, it’s probably best to check for a vehicle that has advanced features like Hill Descent Control (HDC) and Hill Start Assist (HSA). Another destination could be the gorgeous Coorg, where you could stay amidst the most aromatic coffee plantations in the country. Let your SUV sweep you away from the noise and into the quiet of the lush green hills, valleys, and canopied highways of the south. 
3.Kolkata to Lake Tsomgo 
For travelers who wish to venture into the north east, here’s the perfect trip for you. Although the road from Kolkata to Lake Tsomgo (in East Sikkim) is long (about 730 km), the drive will be worth it! If you don’t mind the cold, travel to Lake Tsomgo in the winter, and catch the mesmerizing beauty of the frozen lake. Note to drivers: venturing into the corners of the east, you’ll realize the need to have a dependable and powerful engine drive you around the narrow and winding roads. There are lots of local taxis that drive you around the north East, but to experience the driving yourself, ensure that your vehicle supports top of the line braking and robust safety systems, so that you can sit back and watch the miles roll by. 
4.Jaipur to Jaisalmer
If sandy deserts and old palaces are more your thing, don’t wait to take a trip towards the north western India. A comfortable 600 km ride, this road trip will take you through the old towns of Rajasthan and also the sprawling deserts of the west. If you wish, stretch your trip into four or five days, so you can add a few stops on the way. Rajasthan’s majestic beauty of the sand dunes, mighty palaces, and rich culture needs to felt in a drive-through, making your experience with the state more intimate. Although the roads are considerably well-maintained, the rough terrain might need to be matched with a rough machine. 
5. Mumbai to Tarkarli
If you don’t have time to travel to the four corners of the country, here’s another quiet road trip destination for you: drive down from the noisy city life into the quiet and pristine beaches of Tarkarli in Maharashtra. A good 600 km, this road trip will take you through the food towns of Maharashtra, including Kolhapur. Make a couple of swift stops through these towns to reach the clean and beautiful Tarkarli. 
With these destinations in mind, take a trip once every few weeks, and you’ll see the difference travel-rejuvenation makes. Although traveling is fun, do not underestimate the amount of planning, coordination, and attention to safety that comes, especially with road trips. Hence, to make your journeys smooth, comfortable, and luxurious, pick an SUV that affords you the joy of all the wanderlusting without any of the stressing. 
 The new Alturas G4 is designed exactly for this purpose. A high-end, full-sized SUV, the Alturas G4 will ensure safety, stability, comfort, and style for each of these trips. The vehicle’s powerful engine can handle any kind of road demand, and its advanced safety and comfort features will make sure you return home refreshed, relaxed, and rested.

386,2019-01-11,Mahindra Mahindra,"While Bandhan Bank's Chandra Shekhar Ghosh is surrendering to RBI on promoter shareholding norms, Kotak Mahindra Bank's Uday Kotak is  suing the central bank

Chandra Shekhar Ghosh is a new arrival on India’s banking scene. Billionaire Uday Kotak is a seasoned campaigner and Asia’s richest banker. No wonder then that Ghosh is falling in line with a central bank command, while Kotak is suing. 
Chandra Shekhar Ghosh is a new arrival on India’s banking scene. Billionaire Uday Kotak is a seasoned campaigner and Asia’s richest banker. No wonder then that Ghosh is falling in line with a central bank command, while Kotak is suing.
The disputes concern the founders’ maximum permissible ownership. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is pushing the largest shareholders of Ghosh’s Bandhan Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd to dilute their stakes because it doesn’t want a single powerful entity to control any deposit-taking institution.
Ghosh tried to avoid dilution, but is now surrendering.
Kotak has been stalling for a long time, but has now turned mutinous.
Take Bandhan Bank first. Ghosh founded it as a non-bank finance company, focusing on small-ticket advances to tiny businesses and other borrowers typically ignored by the formal banking system.
RBI selected the shadow lender as one of two successful applicants (out of 25) to be a deposit-taking commercial lender. The condition was that in three years, the holding company—Bandhan Financial Holdings Ltd—had to pare its stake in the bank to 40%.
After Bandhan Bank’s initial public offering (IPO) last March, the holding company was still left with 82.28%, locked in for a year under Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) rules. When RBI’s August deadline came, the holding company owned 42% more than the central bank would allow, but the stock-market regulator wouldn’t let it sell before March 2019.
As a punishment, RBI suspended Bandhan Bank’s ability to open new branches without approval, and froze Ghosh’s pay. The bank’s shares, on a tear until early August, lost two-fifths of their value in less than three months. Left with no choice, Bandhan Bank this week announced a merger with Gruh Finance Ltd, a home loan company. Bandhan’s holding company will get diluted to 61% (still 21% above the stipulated maximum), and 15% of the combined entity will be owned by Gruh’s parent Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC), which will seek RBI’s permission to retain its stake. If the request is denied, it will have to drop below 10%.
Bandhan Bank shareholders are naturally disappointed by both the dilution, and the threat of more selling pressure. Even then, Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Gaurav Jangale are calling it a “blessing in disguise"". The addition of Gruh’s secured mortgages will make the microfinance lender’s book of unsecured loans less risky.
Kotak’s case is more complicated. He got a licence in 2003, under a policy that mandated a controlling shareholder—known as “promoter"" in India—can never go below 40%. New guidelines in 2005 capped promoter ownership at 10%, though. In 2008, Kotak Mahindra Bank was given six months to come up with an action plan.
Then began long years of futile letter-writing, punctuated by another regulatory change in 2013 requiring promoter shareholding to drop to 15% within 12 years of operations. Other lenders, such as IndusInd Bank Ltd complied, though Uday Kotak kept resisting, kept winning new deadlines, and kept getting wealthier.
The last straw was in August when Kotak Mahindra sold  ₹ 500 crore ($72 million) of perpetual non-cumulative preference shares so that Uday Kotak could retain his 30% equity. When RBI said preference shares won’t count toward dilution, the lender dragged the regulator to court.
A victory for either party would be pyrrhic. If RBI wins, one of India’s few well-run banks will see a period of avoidable uncertainty, especially if desperation pushes Kotak Mahindra Bank into a merger with other lenders. A loss for RBI would dim its prestige as the banking regulator just as it faces pressure to toe the government’s line.
Shaktikanta Das, the new RBI governor, should take a practical view. The Indian banking industry is a mess with more than $200 billion in non-performing loans.
But the stress, or how it’s handled, isn’t correlated with ownership. State-run banks are in trouble partly because of “phone banking""—a pejorative reference to politicians calling bank chairmen to request loans for cronies. Private-sector banks have fewer bad debts, even if two of their chief executive officers (CEOs) have been shown the door by RBI for trying to hide them.
A third left after being accused of a conflict of interest. Two of these were professional managers; the third is a co-founder.
Internationally, research shows that concentrated ownership “significantly reduces"" banks’ non-performing loan ratios.
Still, it’s hard to conclude that managers with skin in the game will always play responsibly. Take Bandhan Bank again. What business did Ghosh, a microfinance specialist, have lending money to the failed infrastructure lender IL&FS Group?
Rather than impose one-size-fits-all numbers on ownership concentration, RBI should invest in more alert supervision of banks’ risk management, culture and conduct."

385,2019-01-14,Mahindra Mahindra,"The race to showcase the future of electric cars is actually being run on the Formula E racing circuit with a dazzling dose of technology power

Mumbai:  If Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc. is considered to be the poster boy of electric cars, carmakers such as Audi, Porsche, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar Land Rover and BMW are also pulling out all stops to make their presence felt in the electric vehicle (EV) market. 
Mumbai:  If Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc. is considered to be the poster boy of electric cars, carmakers such as Audi, Porsche, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar Land Rover and BMW are also pulling out all stops to make their presence felt in the electric vehicle (EV) market.
That said, though, the race to showcase the future of electric cars is actually being run on the ABB FIA Formula E racing circuit with a dazzling dose of technology power—composites, longer-lasting batteries, enhanced powertrains, numerous sensors and a lot of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that can analyse the humongous amounts of data that is generated daily.
A case in point is the Mahindra group-owned Mahindra Racing’s M5Electro race car that was unveiled on 10 December 2018, which has a steering wheel that is fully configurable by the team. “Software plays a huge role in an electric car,"" says Dilbagh Gill, chief executive officer and team principal of Mahindra Racing—the only Indian motor sport team to compete in the Formula E Championship.
Formula E cars, Gill points out, are getting more complex and already have hundreds of sensors and many different complex electronics and software systems. A Formula E car, for instance, can have 200 data channels, providing information that must be collected and logged, generating gigabytes of data. Mahindra Racing collects data from every race. “Here’s where we are trying to use AI. In fact, last year we spent a lot of time in IBM’s Watson Lab to try and see what we can do with automation. Our big investment is on software and simulation,"" says Gill whose team spends close to 100 hours of simulation for every one hour on the track.
Other than data analytics, the electric racing cars’ powertrains are also becoming more efficient, according to Lewis Butler, technical director at Mahindra Racing. A powertrain (dubbed “powerbrain"" by Mahindra Racing) includes the engine, transmission, driveshaft and axles—basically anything from the engine through to the rotating wheels that converts the engine’s power into movement.
“In Formula E, we have reached 93% efficiency. The reason (it’s only 93) is because we have used the mechanical gear box as per regulations. The moment we remove the mechanical part of it and focus on a motor inverter, we will have more than 96% efficiency,"" says Butler.
Moreover, every time the driver hits the brakes, the car’s kinetic energy is recaptured and converted into electricity. Moreover, since a reverse sensor feeds energy back into the battery, it almost doubles its efficiency. “We do not use rear brakes in the car anymore, making the car more efficient and recouping 15-20% of the energy used,"" explains Butler.
Meanwhile, the energy density of a battery has gone up too, which according to Gill, means that the batteries can be charged faster and “the anxiety of charging a car"" will reduce.
India is targeting 40% electricity generation from non-fossil fuel-based resources by 2030. With the cost of lithium ion batteries consistently falling, and governments the world over discouraging the use of fossil fuels while encouraging the use of EVs, Gill believes the Mahindra Group would “have done 15 cycles of powertrain development, and be far ahead of its competition by that time (2030)"".
The Mahindra group’s electric car journey began when it acquired a controlling stake in Reva Electric Car Co. in May 2010. Six years later, the company was rebranded as Mahindra Electric Mobility Ltd, following which Mahindra Racing “started working with them on its so-called ‘Race to Road’ concept"", according to Gill.
As part of its ‘Race to Road’ strategy, the Mahindra group acquired automotive design company Pininfarina in December 2015. Three years later, Automobili Pininfarina christened its first car, code-named PF0, as Pininfarina Battista. This estimated €2 million luxury electric hypercar will be unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in mid-March. “This is where we are going to see lot more of technology going forward,"" says Gill.
Further, Gill believes that the Mahindra Group can “literally take out the engine of a Formula E car and put in a road car—and it will run"". Gill hopes to have this so-called “race-to-road"" car ready in “18-24 months"" as opposed to the “almost 4-5 years to do a similar exercise with a Formula 1 car""."
383,2019-01-16,Mahindra Mahindra,"There is also a growing clamour, among those associated with the ruling dispensation, for ensuring that the certain amount of indigenous control is maintained in the banking sector

New Delhi: Kotak Mahindra Bank’s case against an RBI decision on promoter stake dilution is likely to come up for hearing before the Bombay High Court on Thursday amid a growing clamour for a review of the central bank’s ownership guidelines for home-grown private sector lenders. 
New Delhi: Kotak Mahindra Bank’s case against an RBI decision on promoter stake dilution is likely to come up for hearing before the Bombay High Court on Thursday amid a growing clamour for a review of the central bank’s ownership guidelines for home-grown private sector lenders.
There is also a growing clamour, among those associated with the ruling dispensation, for ensuring that the certain amount of indigenous control is maintained in the banking sector even while welcoming the foreign capital and any stake dilution should be left to market evolution rather than forcing it.
As the debate continues on the RBI rules, which require private lenders to reduce their promoter holding eventually to 15% over a period of time, one of the newest banks in the country, Bandhan Bank, recently announced a merger with HDFC Group’s Gruh Finance Ltd in a share-swap deal.
Some experts have said that one of the key reasons for Bandhan Bank opting for this deal was to meet the RBI rules, especially after it had to face some curbs by the central bank last year for failing to reduce the promoter stake to 40 per cent within three years of operation.
The rules require a bank to cut the promoter stake to 40 per cent within 3 years, 20 per cent within 10 years and then to 15 per cent within 15 years.
In case of Kotak Mahindra Bank, it was asked to cut the promoter stake to 20 per cent by December 31, 2018, from 30 per cent earlier, and eventually to 15 per cent by March 2020.
In August, the bank announced an issue of PNCP (Perpetual Non Convertible Preference) shares to bring down the promoters’ holding to 19.7 per cent.
However, the regulator did not approve of this method of stake dilution, after which the bank filed an appeal with the Bombay High Court challenging the RBI decision. Earlier in December, the court had refused to grant any interim relief to the bank. Experts supporting the RBI stand opine that the promoter stake dilution is aimed at ensuring that voting power is not concentrated in the hands of a single group and that all banks have complied with the rule.
They also assert that the RBI communicated its stand to Kotak Mahindra Bank through a letter in August itself, but the lender went to court when the deadline was approaching.
During an earlier hearing in the case, the counsel for the bank had argued that the RBI in the past asked it to only dilute promoter shareholding of its paid-up capital, but the impugned letter sought dilution of paid-up voting equity capital.
As the case continues in the court, some experts have been seeking a review of the central bank’s ownership guidelines for the country’s private sector lenders.
The Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), a right-leaning think tank, said in a recent report that it is high time for a review of regulations and legislations and for re-working the model of governance and ownership norms for Indian private sector banks.
The Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM) also said recently there was an urgent need for a rethink on the regulatory framework for private bank ownership so that it remains in Indian hands.
“None of us want Indian homegrown banks to go into hands of foreign players,"" the SJM said.
The CEPR said the objective should be to form regulations that leads to creation of global giants like JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Santander within India.
It said these global giants were set up by families or individuals who diluted promoter stakes as a natural corollary to their success, growth and eventual scale over a period.
Only such an enabling environment will help well-run banks such as HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank reach a global scale that serves India’s interests as the world’s fastest growing large economy, the think-tank added.
Leading corporate legal firm Corporate Professionals’ founder Pavan Kumar Vijay said there is a need to increase competition in the banking space and that calls for a review of the ownership guidelines, which have been a cause for non-participation to obtain license.
He said the review is required more specifically around the maximum permissible stake promoters can have and it needs to be raised from 15 per cent to at least 26 per cent, which would be at par with the voting right cap.
The CEPR said it is time for India to commit to building robust Indian banking and financial institutions by training the spotlight significantly and perhaps solely on applying the ‘fit and proper’ criteria of bank ownership, which is typically the case in mature banking markets.

382,2019-01-18,Mahindra Mahindra,"Reserve Bank of India has sought more time from Bombay high court to file its reply to the writ petition filed by the Uday Kotak-controlled Kotak Mahindra Bank.

The Bombay high court will hear on 12 March Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd’s petition challenging the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) rejection of its proposal to reduce promoter shareholding. The central bank had asked all banks to reduce promoter stake to 20% of paid-up capital by 31 December 2018, and 15% by 31 March 2020. According to BSE data, promoters held 30.02% in Kotak Mahindra Bank as on 30 September.

According to BSE data, promoters held 30.02% in Kotak Mahindra Bank as on 30 September. 
After the central bank rejected Kotak’s proposal to reduce stake through an issue of perpetual non-convertible preference shares (PNCPS), the bank challenged the move in Bombay high court on 10 December.
Earlier on 17 December, the high court had refused to pass any order, but granted Kotak interim relief by extending the RBI deadline of 31 December, 2018. It had also directed the RBI to file an affidavit in response to the petition by 17 January. 
When the case came up for hearing on Thursday before a division bench of Justices B.P. Dharmadhikari and Revati Mohite Dere, the central bank lawyer requested more time to reply to the Kotak petition, which was granted.
Mumbai-based Law firm Manilal Kher Ambalal & Co. along with senior counsel Harish Salve appeared for Kotak Mahindra Bank, while the central bank is advised by Udeshi & Co. along with senior counsel Venkatesh Dhond. 
The bank in its petition has argued that “The impugned reduction communications and the 2018 RBI letter have been issued by the RBI without authority of law, contrary to the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, Article 14 and Article 19 (1) (G) of the Constitution of India."" 
However, at the last hearing, the central bank lawyer had argued that every bank has complied with the promoter shareholding dilution requirement.
Kotak Bank had earlier said it was looking to raise as much as  ₹ 500 crore by issuing PNCPS to dilute the promoter shareholding. The RBI had mandated the bank to reduce its promoter shareholding to 20% of paid-up capital by 31 December 2018, and 15% by 31 March 2020. According to the BSE website, the promoter group’s stake in the bank stood at 30.02% as on 30 September."

New Delhi: Private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank Monday reported a 23 per cent growth in net profit to  ₹1,291 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, on higher net interest income.
The bank had posted a standalone net profit of  ₹1,053 crore in the October-December quarter of the last fiscal.
Total income rose to  ₹7,214.21 crore during the December quarter from  ₹6,049.02 crore in the year-ago period, Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a statement.
""Net interest income (NII) for the third quarter increased to  ₹2,939 crore from  ₹2,394 crore in the same period a year ago. Net interest margin (NIM) for the quarter was at 4.33 per cent,"" it said.
On a consolidated basis, the profit of the bank increased by 13.5 per cent to  ₹1,844 crore as compared to  ₹1,624 crore in the same period a year-ago.
At the same time, total income on consolidated basis rose to  ₹11,347 crore from  ₹10,104 crore in third quarter of the previous fiscal.
During the quarter, gross non-performing assets (NPAs) declined to 2.07 per cent of the total advances as compared with 2.31 per cent at the end of the third quarter of 2017-18.
Net NPAs of the bank declined to 0.71 per cent of the assets in October-December 2018, against 1.09 per cent a year ago.
Capital adequacy ratio of the bank, including unaudited profits, as per Basel III, as on December 31, 2018, is 18.1 per cent and Tier I ratio is 17.6 per cent at the end of December 31."
380,2019-01-22,Mahindra Mahindra,"Kotak Mahindra Bank reported an year-on-year increase of 23% in net profit growth because it wrote back provisions worth  ₹287 croreThe private sector lender ’s gross bad loan ratio fell to 2.07% and its net bad loan ratio slipped to 0.71%.

The sharp fall in bond yields during the December quarter has reaped profits for Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd literally. The private sector lender reported an year-on-year increase of 23% in net profit growth because it wrote back provisions worth  ₹287 crore it had made previously towards mark-to-market losses.
Had this write-back opportunity not been available, Kotak Mahindra Bank’s profit would have shown a 1.4% year-on-year decline instead of the impressive 23% rise. Its operating profit grew by a modest 6.5%, and has sequentially dropped.
But the lender is not alone in write-backs. HDFC Bank Ltd too did write-backs and other lenders would also do because bond yields had eased 60 basis points during the third quarter. Fall in yields generates mark-to-market gains for banks. Investors rewarded Kotak Mahindra Bank for its net profit growth by driving up the shares 2.7% on Monday.
That said, its profit growth is not hollow because the bank’s core income grew 23% and its net interest margin improved to 4.33%. The lender’s loan book grew 23% and it was not driven mainly by retail as is the case with most banks. While the corporate loan book grew by a strong 26%, commercial vehicle loans grew 36% and even retail personal loans and credit cards grew at that same pace
A strong loan growth contributes in a big way to low bad loan ratios. This has been true for private sector lenders such as HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and even IndusInd Bank Ltd. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s gross bad loan ratio fell to 2.07% and its net bad loan ratio slipped to 0.71%. These are enviable ratios that show pristine asset quality, although there are some scratches visible.
One, provisions towards loan assets have risen by 50% from a year ago and the lender has beefed up the coverage ratio by a massive 12.7 percentage points to 66.2%. This shows that the bank is anticipating stress and has prudently provided for it.
Another concern for investors is that SMA-2 (special mention accounts) outstanding has more than doubled from the previous quarter to  ₹344 crore for the lender. These are accounts where borrowers have not paid back for two months in a row. They are the most susceptible to turn bad and attract provisioning.
Having said that, investors seem to think the low bad loan ratios and a strong growth trajectory along with a comfortable liability profile are reason enough to back the premium that the Kotak Mahindra Bank stock commands. The stock trades at a multiple of nearly five times its estimated book value for FY20. That makes it the most expensive banking stock. Valuations may well have been higher but for the drag on earnings from subsidiaries such as Kotak Mahindra Prime, Kotak Capital and Kotak Securities. The group’s insurance arm has more than made up for this by generating  ₹125 crore net profit in the quarter.
As far as the lender goes, an overhang on the stock is the ongoing shareholding issue wherein promoter Uday Kotak has missed the deadline to bring his stake down. The bank has dragged the regulator to court and investors are awaiting more clarity. This explains the 10% correction in the stock from its highs in July last year."

New Delhi: The government will soon approach the RBI seeking a special dispensation for deferment of provisioning requirements for bank loans extended to some IL&FS group firms amid ongoing efforts to monetise assets of the crisis-hit group, official sources said Tuesday.
Some companies of the diversified IL&FS group, which has debt burden of over  ₹91,000 crore, have failed to repay loans. Following the crisis at IL&FS late last year that raised concerns over liquidity in the system, the corporate affairs ministry had superseded its board.
The sources said efforts to monetise certain assets of IL&FS are progressing and the group is expected to come out of the woods in the next four to five months.
Against this backdrop, the sources said the ministry would soon approach the RBI seeking dispensation for deferment of provisioning of loans with respect to some IL&FS group firms.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has strict norms in place regarding non-performing assets for banks and a relaxation is expected to help the government in getting more time to resolve problems at IL&FS.
The sources said the government has identified a few IL&FS subsidiaries having ample funds in their escrow accounts but are unable to service their debt obligations.
The government is likely to cite the current situation, including availability of funds in escrow accounts of certain IL&FS companies, for seeking the special dispensation, they added.
On Tuesday, the ministry reviewed the progress made in dealing with the problems at the group.
Following the series of defaults by some group companies, the government superseded the board and appointed seasoned banker and Kotak Mahindra Bank MD Uday Kotak as chairman in October 2018.
The IL&FS group companies are estimated to have outstanding loans of about  ₹60,000 crore to banks and financial institutions, while the total debt is over  ₹91,000 crore.
State-owned LIC is the single largest shareholder in IL&FS group with 25.34% while Japan's Orix Corporation owns 23.50% shareholding.
Among others, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has 12.5% stake, IL&FS Employees Welfare Trust (12%), HDFC Ltd (9.02%), Central Bank of India (7.67%) and State Bank of India (6.42%), at the end of March 2018.
In August 2018, the debt crisis at the IL&FS group came to the fore when one of its companies defaulted on repayment of  ₹1,000 crore debt to Sidbi.

377,2019-01-25,Mahindra Mahindra,"Finding a successor to CEO Francisco D’Souza, improving growth figures are the two key challenges ahead for firmCognizant has had only four CEOs so far, while Infosys and Wipro have had at least four bosses in the last decade alone

NEW DELHI :
For a quarter of a century since it was set up in 1994, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. has followed a simple mantra: capitalize on the opportunity emerging out of every crisis.
“Frank (CEO Francisco D’Souza) often says never miss a crisis, it’s an opportunity,"" said Ramakrishnan Chandrasekaran, executive vice-chairman, Cognizant India.
This approach is best exemplified by the company’s performance during the financial meltdown of 2008. Cognizant’s revenue grew 16% in 2009 and 40% in 2010; Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd could only manage single-digit growth.
“Unlike some Indian firms, Cognizant increased its investments in business. From hiring more sales executives to even doing some work pro bono for clients, Cognizant realized that all this will help the company in future,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a foreign brokerage, requesting anonymity.
Cognizant, which started as a software services arm of Dun & Bradstreet Corp. with 175 employees in 1994, will end 2018 with over $16 billion in revenues. The Nasdaq-listed firm completes 25 years on 26 January. TCS completed 50 years last year.
Cognizant is envied by its Indian rivals for its scorching pace of growth. Beginning 2010, it has been adding over $1 billion in incremental revenue every year. In other words, in the 12 years ended December 2018, Cognizant has added $14.66 billion in revenue, or the combined numbers of what Wipro and Tech Mahindra Ltd could achieve.
“Cognizant had a challenger strategy,"" said Ray Wang, founder, Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm. “The key was that they had less rules, less bureaucracy to do the right thing, and that led to explosive growth.""
Four things underline Cognizant’s steroid-charged growth.
First, the company’s super-aggressive sales culture as the firm always had more people managing its large accounts. Second, Cognizant’s senior management comprises more people from outside the firm, unlike the insular approach followed by homegrown companies. “We are truly an MNC,"" said R. Ramkumar, executive director, Cognizant India. “We had a CEO who operated out of the US, the next one operated out of India, and the one after him out of the US. If you were to look at the next 25 years, this one aspect of being a global organization with a global mindset and a global leadership positions us well to thrive in the digital era,"" said Ramkumar, who joined Cognizant from TCS in 1998. Third, stability at the top. Since inception, Cognizant has had only four CEOs. Srini Raju and Lakshmi Narayanan were based out of India, while Kumar Mahadeva and current boss D’Souza are based out of US. Both Infosys and Wipro have had at least four bosses in the last decade alone.
Finally, the company has gained from its focus on fewer countries and industry segments. In 2017, the US accounted for three-fourths of its total revenue, while business from banking, financial services and insurance and healthcare accounted for 38.1% and 28.8%, respectively.
Still, 25 years later, Cognizant again finds itself at a crossroads.
The IT major’s growth fell to single digit for the first time in 2016, when activist investor Elliott Management Corp. pushed the management to focus on improving profitability rather than its growth-at-all costs approach. 2018 will be the third straight year of Cognizant reporting single-digit growth.
Understandably, a few analysts such as HSBC analyst Yogesh Aggarwal, have said in the past that Elliott’s decision was nothing short of “destructive activism"".
A bigger challenge ahead for the company is to find the successor to CEO D’Souza, and the board is evaluating both internal and external candidates. D’Souza is expected to step down sometime this year.
“Cognizant has been a good story,"" said former Infosys CFO V. Balakrishnan. “Their USP has, however, been to grow higher than Indian firms. The Elliott chapter was a distraction for the company, and it needs to be seen if the company can get back its old DNA.""
Amazon, which was also founded in 1994, set up its cloud services business, Amazon Web Services, in 2006. AWS’s revenue now stands at $21 billion (on trailing 12 months basis), more than TCS.
For now, Chandrasekaran won’t admit if Cognizant, like its Indian peers, lacked the foresight to invest in cloud computing business. “The good thing is that we were able to scale our business. The bad thing was we didn’t focus on path-breaking innovations, but in the future you will see a lot more path-breaking innovations,"" said Chandrasekaran.

Mahindra & Mahindra subsidiary Classic Legends last November re-launched Jawa bikes with a 293-cc single-cylinder engine based on the one Mahindra Mojo platform.
The Mahindras own 60% in Classic Legends, the Rustomjee Group and Phi Capital Management also hold rest in the joint venture.
Other Jawa dealerships are spread across Delhi-NCR, Pune, Bengaluru, Nashik and Dehradun, and the company has plans to launch 100 dealerships by mid-February. 
Priced at  ₹1.64 lakh and  ₹1.55 lakh, respectively (ex-showroom, Delhi), the Jawa and Jawa 42 are seen as the first real challengers to Royal Enfield in the retro cruiser segment of motorcycles. However, both cost more than Royal Enfield Classic 350, which retails at  ₹1.47 lakh (ex-showroom, Mumbai).
Jawa had also unveiled the Perak which will go on sale this year. The Perak is a bobber-style motorcycle priced at  ₹1.89 lakh.
The Jawa 42 is powered by a 293cc, liquid-cooled, single-cylinder engine in a double-cradle chassis, generating 27bhp of power and 28Nm of torque. The compression ratio stands at 11:1 with bore and stroke of 70mm x 90mm. This is mated to a constant mesh six-speed transmission.

374,2019-02-01,Mahindra Mahindra,"Maruti, Hyundai, Mahindra and Tata Motors report flat growth or decline in wholesalesMost of the passenger vehicle manufacturers still have substantial inventory with dealers

Passenger vehicle manufacturers took to a cautious approach while dispatching vehicles to the respective dealerships in January, as retail sales continue to decline due to subdued customer sentiment across the country. The top four passenger vehicles manufacturers – Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd , Mahindra and Mahindra ltd and Tata Motors Ltd – reported flat growth or decline in wholesales in order to balance the inventory at dealerships.
The wholesales of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd--country’s largest vehicle manufacture – increased by 1% year-on-year to 140,600 units, indicating that all is not well for the automotive industry. Hyundai also reported a marginal increase of 0.6% y-o-y to 45,803 units in its wholesale dispatches.
Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd also saw its sales increase by just 1% y-o-y to 23,872 units while Tata Motors saw volumes decline sharply by 11% y-o-y to 17,826 units.
Honda Cars India Ltd has been the only exception since its sales increased by a whopping 23% y-o-y to 18,261 units.
“The first month of the new calendar year continues to be on an overall growth path. There is buoyancy in rural growth, commodity costs are levelling, fuel prices are coming down and we see improvement in forex movement, which in turn will drive positive customer sentiment,"" said Rajan Wadhera, president, automotive sector, Mahindra and Mahindra.
Wholesales over the last two months have been under pressure since the automobile companies have been correcting the inventory piled up at dealerships since decline in customer sentiment resulted in worst retail sales in six year during the festival period of Navaratri and Diwali.
Most of the passenger vehicle manufacturers still have substantial inventory with dealers which will prevent them from pushing more wholesales on the dealers.
On the other hand, wholesales of commercial vehicles continue to decline as result of the liquidity crisis in non-banking financial corporations and introduction of the new truck axle norms which has increased the load carrying capacity of the vehicles.
Tata Motors Ltd--country’s largest commercial vehicle manufacturer--reported a staggering 9% y-o-y decline in sales to 11,694 units. Overall, sales of commercial vehicles also declined by 6% y-o-y to 37,089 units.
Ashok Leyland Ltd--country’s second largest commercial vehicle manufacturer--though reported a 13% increase in medium and heavy vehicle sales after double digit decline in the last two months.
“Domestic sales of commercial vehicles have dipped by 6% this month as compared to January 2018. The muted growth of the CV Industry is due to the low customer sentiments with the base effect also playing a role in the in H2 FY19 . Factors like higher interest rates and lagged effect of axle load norms continues to affect our MHCV segment with a drop of 9% in January 2019,"" said Girish Wagh, president, commercial vehicles, business unit, Tata Motors."

NEW DELHI :
India Inc Friday termed the Modi government's last Budget as a balancing act of populism with a pragmatic approach in an election year, taking into consideration both ""hosh and josh"". Industry leaders including Gautam Adani, Anand Mahindra, Anil Agarwal, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw and Sanjiv Puri felt issues relating to farmers, unorganised sector workers and middle class were addressed without 'risking bankruptcy of the economy'.
It is ""an 'election year' Budget that expectedly has something for everyone, from farmers to traders, workers in unorganised sector to the salaried middle class"", Biocon CMD Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said. She said the government did well to balance the populist tone by signalling its commitment to stick to the road of fiscal discipline.
""India's middle class, small traders and farmers are the lifelines of its economic growth. By catering to these ambitions #Budget2019 infuses hopes for millions of dreams,"" Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani tweeted.
Expressing similar views, Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra said in a tweet, ""I was bracing for a populist, profligate budget driven by 'election panic.' I'm just grateful that the reliefs to the key middle class & farmer segments were delivered in a measured way without risking bankruptcy of the economy. This was a controlled, pump-priming exercise..."" RPG Enterprises Chairman Harsh Goenka termed the announcements in the Budget as ""a volley of sixes, a victory for farmers and middle-class, two major pillars of our economy"".
He further said, ""Balancing both hosh and josh, the Budget will stimulate consumption demand and alleviate lives in rural areas..."" ""The Narendra Modi government must be applauded for a pro-growth and fiscally prudent budget for the financial year 2019-20 without putting the exchequer's finances under too much pressure,"" Vedanta Resources Executive Chairman Anil Agarwal said. Dalmia Cement (Bharat) MD and CEO Mahendra Singhi said the key highlight of the Budget was benefits to empower the rural and agro economy. ""The measures announced in the Budget are likely to provide a significant impetus to consumption spending in the economy, which will boost growth in the near to medium term,"" CII President Rakesh Bharti Mittal said. Another industry body Assocham said the interim Budget appears to be a good one with a mix of populist and pragmatic statements.
""The announced tax breaks, together with low average inflation, are likely to spur domestic demand and spending, and inject liquidity in the market. This is great news for sectors such as hospitality and travel,"" OYO Hotels and Homes Founder & Group CEO Ritesh Agarwal said. Apollo Hospitals Group Chairman Prathap C Reddy termed it a forward-thinking budget with a definitive vision to accelerate much greater progress and enhance wellbeing of Indians.
""It is a progressive budget that addresses both the current challenges being faced by the economy as well as presents an outline of the vision the government has for the future of India ten years ahead,"" Ficci President Sandeep Somany said.
PHDCCI President Rajeev Talwar said the budget deserves 9.5 points out of 10 on creating a dynamic, promising and confidence-building environment. ""India would continue to need more structural, policy and economic reforms to become a $5 trillion economy in the next five years. There is a considerable ground to be covered and this Budget has set the tone for future discourse,"" Shyamal Mukherjee, Chairman, PwC India. ""An interim budget with clear focus on long-term fundamentals along with targeted proposals crucial to address the current economic, political and social situation. Right from the farmer, to unorganised sector workers to middle class tax payer, everyone would have something to cheer upon,"" BDO India Partner M&A Tax Suraj Malik said. Magma Fincorp Ltd Vice Chairman and Managing Director Sanjay Chamria said, ""A middle class budget with a rural focus is what the government has delivered in an election year."" ICICI Lombard General Insurance MD & CEO Bhargav Dasgupta termed it a progressive budget that aims at uplifting India's populace.
Essar Capital Director Prashant Ruia said it was a good budget in that it is aimed at spurring consumption and creating demand that is sustainable. SAIL Chairman A K Chaudhary said, ""The budget announcement for industry as a whole looks positive. The development of infrastructure in the country has been given further emphasis in this interim budget as well. Sectors like railways, roadways and waterways remain the focus areas of growth."" Budget allocation for expanding the railway infrastructure, improving connectivity through Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana and scaling up the Sagar Mala project are all indications for more steel consumption in the country, he said. Sameer Kochhar, Chairman, SKOCH Group, said, ""The announcement of schemes such as Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojna , Shramyogi Maan-dhan Yojna and hike in MNREGA from  ₹5,000 crore to  ₹60,000 crore will definitely be a step forward in ensuring the upliftment of the weaker sections of the society."""
372,2019-02-04,Mahindra Mahindra,"The Mahindra Electric CEO says a kilometre of running on electric—well-to-wheel—emits less carbon dioxide than conventional vehicles by 20% Servicing an electric car is much cheaper—there is no oil change, filter change, etc, says Babu

Mahindra Electric Mobility Ltd vehicles completed 100 million e-kilometres in mid-January. Mahesh Babu, CEO, Mahindra Electric, speaks about the present and future of electric cars in India. Edited excerpts from an interview:
What are the main challenges in encouraging people to go electric?
First is the charging infrastructure. Even though we don’t drive more than 50-100km a day, even if I give a range of 140km (on a fully-charged battery), it’s still a challenge. Second is the ecosystem and awareness. It has been proved that 80% of the charging happens at home and the rest depends on public infrastructure. Yet, people don’t move quickly unless public facilities come. Third, even if our cars are high on initial cost but low on operative cost, decisions (to buy) are made on the initial cost. 
Is the environmental benefit of using an electric car significantly greater than that of a conventional fuel-driven one?
Today in India, a kilometre of running on electric—well-to-wheel—emits less carbon dioxide than conventional vehicles by 20% because electric vehicles are four times more efficient. If India’s target of being 30% more sustainable by 2030 is on track, the above percentage will come close to 30-40% by 2030. Cleaner air will reduce healthcare costs. 
What are the joys and pain points of driving an electric car in India?
When you drive, you realize it’s got no gears, so it’s comparable to an automatic car. For many fleet cars, the biggest benefit is that the noise due to being electric is so low that their fatigue from driving has come down. People give you respect because you have gone sustainable. You don’t depend on fuel price fluctuation. Servicing an electric car is much cheaper—there is no oil change, filter change, etc."
369,2019-02-05,Mahindra Mahindra,"Tech Mahindra’s constant currency revenue grew 4.3% on a sequential basisThe digital business, which drove business growth, has better realizations and margins

After languishing for years, shares of Tech Mahindra Ltd have nearly doubled from their lows touched in mid-2017. The rebound is largely to do with a recovery in the company’s margins. Operating profit margin has widened from merely 9% in the June 2017 quarter to 16% currently.
In the December 2018 quarter, operating margin improved 80 basis points sequentially, and 340 basis points from a year ago. Analysts were expecting an improvement, albeit at a much slower pace, as they assumed recent large deal wins involved lower margins.
What’s more, Tech Mahindra’s constant currency revenue grew 4.3% on a sequential basis, against estimates of about 2.7% increase. Deal wins remained strong, although they fell marginally compared with the second quarter.
The digital business, which drove business growth, has better realizations and margins. Further, cost-rationalization measures such as automation helped improve profitability.
On the negative side, attrition continues to increase. From 17% in the year-ago quarter, attrition rose to 21% in December 2018. The worry about high attrition levels is that it comes in the backdrop of high utilization levels, which reached 83% last quarter. Both factors together may drive up employee costs, said some analysts.
Heading into FY20, investors will be keen to know if the much-awaited spending in next-generation telecom technology (5G) materializes. That will not only result in sustained growth momentum but also help the Tech Mahindra stock reduce the valuation gap with its larger peers."
371,2019-02-05,Mahindra Mahindra,"In the face of climate change, three users share their experience of driving an electric car

There are two factors that users of electric cars—or new converts—need to get used to: how quick the car is and the attention it gets on the road.
“There is no lag in power delivery,"" says actor, entrepreneur and motor enthusiast Gul Panag, 40, who owns a Mahindra e2o Plus. “Unless you are going for the million-dollar or high-end sports cars, there is a lag. At a traffic signal, my acceleration is fast and I am not even trying. In an automatic car, by the time the engine delivers power, it’s 2 seconds. In my electric car, I have given moderate acceleration at a traffic light and yet I have been ahead of other cars.""
“Driving is surprisingly good in this, it’s a zippy thing. For Bengaluru, it’s extremely easy to drive,"" says Shyam Sunder, 51, managing director of PeakAlpha Investment Services Pvt. Ltd, over the phone. He has been driving the e2o for four years.
The other advantage—or disadvantage—is the observations that follow. All users say they have been questioned often, at traffic signals, mall parking lots or by colleagues on how the car works, how fast it runs, etc.
“I do a demo a day,"" says Panag, who switched from an e2o to an e2o Plus in 2017, after two years. “If I am at a signal, I pull over and give a quick brief.""
For Bengaluru-based Joseph N., popularly known as Subin, a consultant in solar power solutions, an electric car lent credibility to his work also because he uses solar power to charge his car.
“I found it interesting to engage with people. They would ask about range, what happens when it stops, etc. I had a solar signage (on the car) as well. That would be a conversation starter. It gave credibility to my solar pitch.
“Otherwise, supporters of petrol-driven cars would say, ‘you are just using a different fuel’. That was difficult to defend unless I used solar power, and not polluting thermal power,"" says Joseph over the phone.
They all agree on a few other advantages, including lower maintenance costs, easier parking and driving comfort.
“For us, this car was practical for a big city, a compact solution, and allowed for self-driving,"" says Panag, who shuttles between Delhi and Mumbai on work and uses an Audi for long-distance drives. “What pushes you to the back seat of a car (with a driver) is the pain of parking. About 80% of the time, I drive this—unless I need to get dressed, do make-up or have calls.""
While the focus on electric cars over the last few years has been on the relatively higher cost and lack of public- charging infrastructure, users have a ready answer for both.
All three say charging the car is not an issue. Since they are all aware of the car’s range, usually 110-140km on a fully-charged battery, they could calibrate their travel accordingly. What’s more, all three use their cars within the city, where the average daily drive is under 50km a day.
“I don’t agree that there is not enough charging infrastructure,"" says Panag, whose car takes 3 hours to charge fully, which she needs to do twice a week on a 15-amp plug point at her parking spot. “Charging a cellphone is your responsibility, not because the government is providing charging facilities. On a long drive, I carry fuel; I don’t blame the government. So that’s a flawed argument. I can do this on 15-amp charging point, which every paanwala has.""
Sunder says he has never charged his car anywhere except at home. “Most often, people fear, what happens if I run out of fuel midway through a journey? It has never happened,"" says the financial planner, who uses a Honda City for longer distances and to fit in his family of four. He charges the car at home overnight for about 8 hours and this is enough for 100-odd km or three days. He does not remember ever using any public charging facility.

Joseph began to doubt his vehicle when it suddenly stopped one day a couple of kilometres from his home due to battery issues. He realized that his car was not as reliable as he had assumed. A post on his e-mobility WhatsApp group about someone saying a tyre had come off mid-drive, added to Joseph’s concerns. That’s when he sold his five-year-old, two-door e2o and switched to a leased four-door, e2o Plus, from hiring service Zoom Zap.
“There is a predictability in range, so I didn’t have that anxiety. There is a reliability issue in terms of parts of the car, not critical parts, but gear lever or power windows, etc.—the build quality was not (as good) as other cars. Reliability is a part of the validation process of new technology,"" says Joseph.
As climate change increasingly becomes a reality, the government needs to do more if others have to switch to electric—with incentives and subsidies. Panag says all government and public transport vehicles need to be electric to set an example. She believes clean air is a fundamental right and the ecosystem needs to adapt.
Joseph says the next evolution should enable technology to inform users when the battery deteriorates.
Irrespective of the changes technology or policies bring, nobody seems inclined to change or forgo e-mobility.
“We got everything we were looking for with this car. None of the disadvantages really hit us,"" says Sunder.
“Being unique gives a sense of pride and recognition,"" says Joseph. “It could be an egoistic aspect but it’s contributing to a larger story of climate change."""

Tech Mahindra was in the limelight today with shares rallying 7% to a new high of  ₹800 on the BSE after the IT major posted a strong third-quarter performance. The IT company, which announced its December quarter earnings after market hours on Tuesday, reported a better-than-expected net profit of  ₹1,203 crore, up 27.5% year-on-year and 13% quarter-on-quarter. Revenue grew 15% year-on-year, or 3.6% quarter on quarter, to  ₹8,944 crore.

366,2019-02-10,Mahindra Mahindra,"PVR appoints Kotak Mahindra Capital and CLSA to manage the fundraising processPVR claims to have 32% market share of Hollywood box office and 22% of Bollywood box office 

MUMBAI :
PVR Ltd has held conversations with various investors in recent weeks as India’s largest multiplex operator looks to raise around $100 million through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) offering, said two people aware of the development.
“PVR has appointed investment banks Kotak Mahindra Capital and CLSA to manage the fundraising process. They have held domestic road shows to meet investors and they are likely to launch the offering soon, if market conditions are supportive for a trade. The company plans to use the funds for various purposes, including pursuit of inorganic growth,"" said the first person cited above, requesting anonymity.
On 21 December, PVR’s board had approved raising up to  ₹750 crore through an issuance of equity shares via multiple routes, including a QIP.
QIP is a capital-raising tool through which listed companies can sell shares, fully and partly convertible debentures, or any securities other than warrants that are convertible into stocks, to a qualified institutional buyer.
The resolution has received approval from its shareholders, the company informed stock exchanges on 30 January. Stock exchange filings by PVR show that it held meeting with various institutional investors on 5 and 6 February, while towards the end of January, it met investors in Singapore and Hong Kong.
PVR and CLSA declined to comment on the development. An email sent to Kotak Mahindra Capital did not elicit any response till press time.
PVR operates 748 screens across 161 locations in 64 cities as on 23 January, according to its latest investor presentation. It claims to have a 32% market share of Hollywood box office and 22% share of Bollywood box office in the year ended 31 March.
For the nine months ended 31 December, PVR reported revenue of  ₹2,272.5 crore, a jump of 28% over the revenue recorded in the same period last year. Between April and December 2018, it reported profit of  ₹141.62 crore, up 44% from the corresponding period of the last financial year.
PVR has focused on inorganic growth and has grown to its current leadership position on the back of several strategic acquisitions.
Last year, it had acquired a majority stake in South India-based multiplex chain SPI Cinemas, which operated 76 screens across 17 properties in 10 cities under brands such as Sathyam, Escape, The Cinema and S2 Cinema, for  ₹633 crore in an all-cash deal.
Last August, The Economic Times reported that the company is also in talks to acquire North India’s Wave Cinemas, which could fetch a price tag of  ₹450 crore.
In 2016, it acquired 32 screens from real estate developer DLF, which operated under the DT Cinemas, for around  ₹433 crore. In 2012, it acquired Mumbai-based Cinemax Ltd for  ₹395 crore."
365,2019-02-10,Mahindra Mahindra,"Investor expectations on sales growth are likely to contract further in FY20 due to uncertainty on BS-VI normsThe Street is concerned about weakening profitability amid slowing growth

Investors ignored Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd’s (M&M’s) double-digit revenue growth in the December quarter, and focused instead on the disappointment on the margin front. The stock closed 2.6% lower at  ₹683 on Friday. Coming on the heels of a sharp 31% decline from the high scaled in August, M&M’s current stock price discounts its one-year forward earnings estimates 12 times. This is lower than the 17-18 times valuation seen last April.
Why has the stock got such a drubbing? After all, 11.2% revenue growth of M&M along with subsidiary Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Ltd, is commendable given the challenging domestic scenario. Both its segments, automotive and farm equipment, clocked 11-12% sales growth each.
The Street is concerned about weakening profitability amid slowing growth. At the analysts’ call, management lowered FY19 growth estimates for the farm equipment segment to about 10% from the earlier 12-14%, and for auto segment to 4-6% from 7-8%.
The company will bet on its new launches such as the XUV300 in the auto segment, where its utility vehicle sales have been slipping. Investor expectations on sales growth are likely to contract further in FY20 due to uncertainty on BS-VI emission norms. Further, the peaking tractor cycle that has been robust the past 12 months could hurt volumes.
Another issue is the pressure on margins. The December quarter Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin at 13.2% was below expectation and 150 basis points lower from a year ago. Both segments failed the Street’s forecast on this count. Profitability of the farm equipment segment contracted 130 basis points to 19.2%, while that of the auto segment fell by 260 basis points to 5.8%, the lowest seen in five years.
Management indicated a softer trend in raw material costs. This has been a sore point in the last two quarters. Most auto firms were unable to pass on the impact of high input costs and adverse forex movements in a falling sales environment. In fact, discounts to keep up market share and clear the inventory also dented profits too.
The moot question is whether softer material costs will shore up M&M’s falling profitability in the coming quarters. There is a tone of caution for the auto segment due to rising competition and cost of compliance with technological changes. The monsoon, which influences farm equipment sales, is uncertain. Also, operating leverage in the auto segment coming from new models may be partially offset by flat tractor volume. This comprises nearly two-thirds of consolidated profit.
December quarter’s Ebitda of  ₹1,703 crore was nearly 15% lower than what analysts had pencilled in and flat compared to a year back. However, higher other income was a shot in the arm. Along with the write-back of tax provisions, net profit jumped 60% year-on-year.
But investors are cautious. According to Mitul Shah, vice president (research) at Reliance Securities Ltd, “We expect Mahindra to face margin pressure on account of turbulence in the rural economy, intensifying competition in utility vehicles and a slow-down in tractors."" That said, valuations of the M&M stock have come down."

The Indian Navy on Tuesday invited expressions of interest for strategic alliances between Indian and foreign companies to manufacture naval utility helicopters (NUH) in India, the defence ministry said. Separately, the Indian Army signed a contract with US’ Sig Sauer for 72,400 assault rifles.
The ministry said that 95 of the 111 helicopters should be manufactured in India by the Indian strategic partner. “The project is likely to provide a major boost to the government of India’s ‘Make in India’ initiative and give a fillip to manufacturing capability for helicopters in India,"" it added.
Lockheed Martin, Airbus Helicopters and Bell Helicopters are among those expected to participate in the bidding, the ministry said. Indian companies likely to participate in the bidding are Tata Advanced Systems, Mahindra Defence, Adani Defence, L&T, Bharat Forge and Reliance Infrastructure.
Foreign original equipment manufacturers “have been mandated to set up dedicated manufacturing lines, including design, integration and manufacturing processes for NUH in India and make the Indian manufacturing line a global exclusive facility for the NUH platform being offered,"" the ministry said.
The defence acquisition council had given its approval for the 111 naval aircraft on 25 August 2018. The helicopters are meant for search and rescue operations, casualty evacuation and light transport. They will replace the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd-built Chetak helicopters. Though the Indian Navy did not give an estimate, the deal could be worth $3 billion.
This is the first time that the defence ministry aims to award a contract under the strategic partnership model, a joint venture between an Indian partner and a foreign manufacturer, according to the statement.
“A contract for procurement of 72,400 assault rifles through fast-track procurement (FTP) was signed with Sig Sauer of US on 12 February,"" the defence ministry said in a separate statement. While 66,400 assault rifles were for the Army, 2,000 will be procured for the Navy and 4,000 for the Air Force.
The assault rifle should have an effective range of 500 metres and weigh less than 3kg. The entire quantity will be delivered within 12 months from the date of signing the contract, the ministry added.
India aims to modernize its military to narrow the gap with a rapidly growing China, but the pace of Indian defence procurement has been slow, hampered by paucity of funds and tedious procurement processes."
363,2019-02-14,Mahindra Mahindra,"The XUV300 comes in four variants, with the top-of-the-line W8 Diesel variant priced at  ₹10.8 lakhTwo airbags, ABS, disc brakes on all wheels, LED tail-lights and all four power windows are standard on all models

Indian automaker Mahindra launched the XUV300 at a starting price of  ₹7.9 lakh (ex-showroom). It comes in four variants, with two engine options—the diesel offering starts at  ₹8.4 lakh. It is set to take on the likes of the Maruti Brezza, which has established itself as a category favourite. 
The Mahindra XUV300 is based on the SsangYong Tivoli’s X100 platform, which has been modified and altered to fit within the sub-four-metre length. This platform makes the XUV300 the widest compact SUV in India with the longest wheelbase.
Here are the prices of all of XUV300 variants:
W4	         7.90 lakh (petrol)	8.49 lakh (diesel)
W6	         8.75 lakh (petrol)	9.30 lakh (diesel)
W8	        10.25 lakh (petrol) 10.80 lakh (diesel)
W8 (O)	11.44 lakh	(petrol) 11.99 lakh (diesel)
The XUV300 is powered by a 1.5-litre diesel engine that debuted in the Marazzo. It makes 117HP of power and 300Nm of torque. The 1.2-litre turbo-petrol engine is good for 110HP and 200Nm of torque. The Mahindra XUV300 has a fuel efficiency of 17kpl for the petrol variant and 20kpl for the diesel variant. The two engines are mated to the same 6-speed manual gearbox. An automatic transmission will be introduced in the soon.
Two airbags, ABS, disc brakes on all wheels, LED tail-lights and all four power windows are standard on all models. 
The W8 variant gets a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system, dual-zone automatic climate control, a reverse camera and cruise control. 
The top-spec W8 (O) packs front parking sensors, 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels, a sunroof and class-leading seven airbags."
362,2019-02-15,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra MD and 'Father of Scorpio' Pawan Goenka is bullish on XUV300 to rake in the missing volumesBolero and Scorpio that continue to do good numbers will be updated to meet BS VI emission norms, he says

Mumbai: As India’s SUV market exploded in the five years beginning 2013, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd that unleashed the first wave of SUVs in the early 2000s with its Scorpios and Boleros was caught napping. While the SUV market boomed to account for nearly 30% of overall passenger vehicles market, Mahindra barely managed to hold on to its volumes, resulting in a loss of market share.
Pawan Goenka, managing director of the firm, acknowledges as much, saying the company never anticipated the SUV boom to have come so fast. Now Goenka, also known as the ""Father of Scorpio"", is planning to turn the clock back. In an interview, he also talks about the challenges Mahindra faced in its bread-and-butter segment and how it plans to claw back market share. Edited excerpts:
You have launched a series of new models; portfolio is fairly well spread now; how do you rate your journey in the last two to three years?
Clearly, there is a transition that has happened in the SUV segment. One that worked very well in our favour and one that did not. If I go back to 2013, the contribution of SUV in the passenger vehicle segment was 17-18% and that has now become 29%. So, the growth of SUV has been significantly faster than that of passenger cars. Therefore, the whole segment has become much larger which was in 2013-14. So, that has worked in our favour. What has not worked in our favour is the transition from frame-based vehicle to monocoque—a vehicle structure in which the chassis is integral with the body—was somewhat faster than what we had anticipated. Therefore, we lost out on that opportunity of SUV growth and did not participate in it as much as we could have, if we could have been faster in bringing in monocoques.
Did you fail to read the transition?
Two things happened. The speed at which it changed was a little faster that we had thought. We had planned a gradual shift. We were focusing on our frame-based vehicle while developing the monocoque vehicle.
We did not have the internal expertise in doing small monocoque vehicles because our smallest vehicle was Bolero, which was 4.1 metre. Therefore, it took us a little time to come out with the KUV100. If we would have come out with that two years sooner, that would have been perfect.
By the time the XUV500 came out as first monocoque, and it did very well for us. On the smaller side, which was not our strength, we were behind many other players. First one that came out was in 2016, which was KUV100 and now we are coming out with XUV300. So, with this, our journey is now complete. Now, we have no disadvantage in terms of product offering.
So, how are you planning to claw back market share?
Between these three products, we will get 9,000 volume. I am reasonably sure that 9,000 will happen. Out of the 9,000, I am assuming that 2,000 will be cannibalization. So, it should give a fairly significant growth in market share. Between these three products, XUV 300 has the larger potential.
Now, after this launch of XUV300, we have something in every segment from 3.6 metre KUV to Alturas. Therefore, now we have nothing to say that we don’t have a product and that we are not participating in the growth. From here on, we have to look at reversal of market share in order to compensate for the growth that had happened in the last four to five years and last quarter, for the first time, after about 11 quarters, our market share went up.
Now after we launch the XUV300 and get volumes, which are significant in numbers, assuming it does not cannibalize too much with our current products. That will certainly help us to increase our market share.
How do you see the competition in the segment that is XUV300 and below?
Quite intense. I will take names here. Clearly the market leader is (Maruti Suzuki's) Vitara Brezza, followed by (Hyundai) Creta, followed by (Tata) Nexon, closely behind is (Ford) EcoSport and then the rest. So, it is a fairly intense competition. What we have tried to do here is that we have taken a view that if we were to launch a me-too product and try and compete on pricing, it is going to be an uphill battle. For any challenger to come into a sub-segment, you have to offer something that is wow! You cannot be doing that by doing something which is incrementally better than what the leaders are doing.
Do you think you can still leverage Scorpio and Bolero in this fight to claw back market share?
Scorpio and Bolero continue to give us the volume that they have been giving. So, we are not looking to grow volume there. We continue to grow volume from these three models—the third being XUV500—without eating into our existing volumes.
But increasingly, there would be more advanced models coming into the market due to regulatory changes. In such a scenario, do you think Scorpio and Bolero will hold ground?
When a product reaches an iconic stage, then logic does not work. If you were to look at Bolero, which we launched in 2000 and we have done cosmetic changes. It is with the same dyes and we are selling 7,000 a month—our highest selling product. So, that product has a certain identity that is evergreen. Same thing with Scorpio, which is doing about 4,000-4,500 a month. Styling and design, which was a breakthrough when we launched but now it is dated, but the product continues to do very well. So, Bolero, Scorpio and XUV 500 are timeless and these are our top volume earners.
So, will these models comply with the new regulations such as BS VI emission norms, safety norms, etc.?
Of course. Undoubtedly. Bolero was the last one to pass the internal test. All other products, including the new products, will meet the safety as well as the new emission norms. We would probably start production of the first BS VI vehicle around January 2020."
361,2019-02-15,Mahindra Mahindra,"The proposed university will promote innovation, entrepreneurship and quality researchThe group, which has already raised  ₹400 crore, includes Info Edge Ltd and Naukri.com MD Hitesh Oberoi, Tech Mahindra CEO C.P. Gurnani, Hellion Ventures’ co-founder Ashish Gupta

NEW DELHI :
Forty entrepreneurs and chief executives have come together to raise  ₹2,000 crore, at least four times the amount that the government spends to set up an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), to build a science and technology university.
The proposed university will promote innovation, entrepreneurship and quality research, said Neeraj Aggarwal, chairman (Asia Pacific) at Boston Consulting Group (BCG), one of the 40 people who have contributed to set up the venture.
The group, which has already raised around  ₹400 crore for the project, includes Info Edge Ltd and Naukri.com managing director Hitesh Oberoi, Tech Mahindra chief executive C.P. Gurnani, Hellion Ventures’ co-founder Ashish Gupta, chairman of Genpact and Clix Capital Pramod Bhasin, Dilip Pathak, partner at Warburg Pincus in UK, education entrepreneur Vineet Gupta, and Ajay Arora, managing director of D’ Décor.
“Education is a big multiplier…most of us got good education at IITs almost for free and what we are today is because of that quality education. Over the last three decades, the world has changed and it is time for us to come together and create a new model that can be best in the world in terms of teaching, learning, and market worthiness,"" said Oberoi in an interview.
The entire team of 40 has brainstormed for three years and wish to put in place a vision that advocates the best model in pedagogy, curriculum, culture, faculty, and processes, said Aggarwal.
“It (the project) will address India’s largest challenge through applied research and foster an ecosystem of innovation and entrepreneurship,"" he said. The university will catalyse 1,000 startups over a period of time, he said.
The university, which is set to come up over 50 acres in Mohali, will focus on core engineering, deep technology such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and mathematics and promote interdisciplinary learning by bringing both science and liberal arts subjects together to the classroom.
Well-known academics such as Ashish Nanda of Harvard University, Anant Agarwal of MIT, S. Shankar Sastry of University of California-Berkeley, and Arvind Raman of Purdue University are among those who have joined the academic advisory board of the new university named Plaksha, which means tree of knowledge. Plaksha has also tied up with Stanford Research Institute and Purdue University.
“Plaksha is a much-needed effort. Its approach of cross-functional hands-on education...is a great way to prepare students for entrepreneurship and leadership in technology companies,"" said Vineet Gupta, adding that he become a part of the venture as he has “seen the impact of similar approaches in universities like Stanford and its resulting impact in the Silicon Valley"".
“This approach has several benefits: business leaders become part of a venture, thus bringing in multiple skill-sets; it builds credibility that a single owner private institute will not have; and, of course, it helps bring in money,"" he added.
Nanda said he is enthused by the outreach of the founders to top institutions across the world and some of the dimensions of Plaksha. “This institution will focus on innovation, it will be real-world oriented and emphasize experiential learning...I think these are very important for a high quality technology institution for tomorrow,"" he said.
“We don’t want human robots…we shall try to create science and technology leaders with a heart who can contribute to the entrepreneurship ecosystem and promote innovation,"" said Oberoi asserting that funds won’t be a problem. “Whether it’s  ₹350 crore,  ₹2,000 crore or more …good ideas will have always money to back it up,"" Nanda said."
360,2019-02-15,Mahindra Mahindra,"Maruti’s talks with Suzuki include whether it should completely stop producing diesel cars in IndiaMahindra wants to offer petrol variants across models, barring the Bolero, says managing director Pawan Goenka

New Delhi/Mumbai: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd are working on plans to gradually reduce dependence on diesel cars as regulations and market sentiment builds up against the use of the fossil fuel in India—home to some of the world’s most polluted cities.
Maruti Suzuki, India’s largest passenger vehicle maker, is in discussions with parent Suzuki Motor Corp. on the future of diesel cars in the country which include whether the company should completely cease producing diesel vehicles, said three people aware of the development. Instead, the company wants to expand its offerings of cars that run on compressed natural gas (CNG), the people said.
Meanwhile, Mahindra, which is heavily dependent on diesel vehicles, plans to start offering petrol engine options across its entire range, except the Bolero model, said Mahindra’s managing director Pawan Goenka. 
It is also contemplating whether to stop making light commercial vehicles, comprising products which run on small, one-cylinder diesel engines, said Goenka.
But unlike Maruti Suzuki, India’s second largest SUV maker will continue to offer diesel engines primarily because it feels consumer demand sustaining, especially for the large SUV models.
The moves by the automakers underscore a shift in demand towards petrol and other ecofriendly vehicles in India due to factors such as the narrowing price differential between petrol and diesel. Petrol was 17.2% costlier than diesel on 1 January 2018. The differential narrowed to just 7.1% on 13 February 2019.
Stringent government rules, especially the move towards stricter Bharat Stage-VI emission norms from 1 April 2020, are also making auto makers rethink their strategies. In addition, the corporate average fuel efficiency (CAFE) norms require vehicles to cut their emissions significantly and yet offer higher mileage. Diesel vehicles are at odds on these parameters.
The three people cited above said Suzuki is inclined towards completely stopping production of diesel cars in India and wants to invest significantly in CNG as an alternative fuel. Maruti is resisting the move since it will adversely hit sales. The two parties are yet to arrive at a consensus, the people said.
Mint had on 6 February reported that Maruti Suzuki has asked dealerships to bid for licences to set up their own CNG dispensing stations to keep pace with the company’s plan of selling about 200,000 CNG passenger vehicles annually by 2022 by introducing more models that run on the eco-friendly fuel.
A fourth person, and a parts supplier to Maruti, said Fiat India has informed Maruti that it will not be able to produce and supply 1.3 litre diesel engines after 31 March 2020 when the BS-VI norms are enforced. The 1.3 litre engine, which only meets the existing BS-IV norms, is used in Maruti models such as Swift, Ertiga, Baleno, S-Cross and Ciaz.
Maruti is, meanwhile, readying its own 1.5-litre BS-VI diesel engine that is expected to be launched this financial year. However, it may be a daunting task for the company to offer the engine across all its existing diesel vehicle models by the end of March 2020. Its development has been hit by several technical problems.
Maruti did not respond to emailed queries.
Goenka said having a petrol engine in the light commercial vehicle segment is not viable for operators owing to lower fuel efficiency compared with diesel, and if one adds the cost of developing a BS-VI engine.
“What happens post BS-VI is a question that everybody asks. I have said that for small SUVs, and small cars, probably there will be a significant switch towards petrol, but for large SUVs, I think it will be diesel. Where the line is drawn between mid and large, we do not know. A 1.2-litre engine will certainly become more petrol. A 2-litre engine will certainly be diesel. The 1.5-1.6 litre is on the edge and where it goes we don’t know,"" Goenka said.
As much as 20-30% of sales in the passenger car segment come from diesel engines, while the share is as high as 82% in SUVs. “Therefore, we started working long ago to ensure that after 2020 April, it does not matter to us whether the demand is for petrol or diesel. We will have good engines in both. In fact, we will probably have the freshest portfolio of engines in India with 1.2-litre, 1.5-litre and 2.2-litre engines. All three will come in diesel and petrol,"" Goenka said.
The factors which are forcing these changes go beyond the narrowing price differential between diesel and petrol, and extend to the rise of environment, social and governance (ESG) funds, wherein fund managers globally are reluctant to invest in companies that have exposure to any environmental risks. With the European Union making ESG funds mandatory in public markets, India, too, is catching up fast.
ESG investing constitutes investments that, while seeking positive returns, consider and evaluate the long-term impact that business practices have on society, the environment and the performance of the business itself.
Abhay Laijawala, managing director and fund manager at Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies, which launched a $1 billion ESG fund last week, said an auto company, especially with exposure to diesel, runs high risk of regulatory action on air quality issues.
“So despite company meeting ESG criteria, we won’t have it in portfolio because it is a risk although it is a very good stock,"" Laijawala said."
359,2019-02-15,Mahindra Mahindra,"Infrastructure logjam needs to be removedGovernment needs to create bigger local private equity pool

Mumbai: India should kick-start private investment via policy measures or tax breaks if it does not want to stay stuck at a 7% growth rate, Uday Kotak, managing director and chief executive of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, told CNBCTV18 in an interview.
""India has the fundamental capacity and we need to create a situation where the ground capacity will be growing at somewhere between 8 and 9%,"" he said on the sidelines of an event organised by Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.
The Reserve Bank of India earlier in the month moderated its growth forecast to 7.2-7.4% for the April-September period, after economic growth in the country fell to a worse-than-expected 7.1% in the July-September quarter.
""We have got to really fix that piece because the key is private investment,"" Kotak said, late on Thursday in the interview.
The government's decision in November 2016 to suddenly ban large banknotes, so-called demonetisation, and the abrupt implementation of goods and services tax (GST) six months later, hit businesses hard.
The infrastructure logjam that has occurred due to a lack of liquidity in the system, also needs to be removed, said Kotak, whom the government hand-picked to lead major infrastructure financing and construction firm IL&FS after a string of defaults from the firm triggered fears of a liquidity crisis in the non-banking financial company (NBFC) sector.
The IL&FS imbroglio dried up lending from NBFCs at a time when private companies were already dealing with reluctant banks wary of lending due to their massive bad debt woes.
Kotak said that due to the IL&FS debacle, the current situation was fragile, but he added that it was more due to investor fears than a systemic problem.
Still, analysts at brokerage firm Ambit said in a report on Friday that India was headed for a consumption-led slowdown as seen from multiple sector indicators.

357,2019-02-20,Mahindra Mahindra,"Banking is a business with a high degree of leverage involving public trust and continues to be synonymous with safetyThe comments come amid an aggressive play by giants like Google with its payment platform Google Pay in the financial sector

MUMBAI :
Banker Uday Kotak opined that technology majors like Google and Facebook should not be allowed to become banks as they don't like to be regulated.
He said banking is a business with a high degree of leverage involving public trust and continues to be synonymous with safety.
""If a Google or a Facebook ever decided to be a bank, we have a problem...They don't want to be as regulated as we are,"" Kotak, who heads Kotak Mahindra Bank said while speaking at the annual Nasscom leadership summit here Wednesday.
The comments come amid an aggressive play and keen interest by the global tech giants like Google with its payment platform Google Pay in the domestic financial sector, especially through payment services offerings.
Kotak said banks work at a leverage of 10:1 wherein they lend out  ₹10 for every rupee of capital which they have. It is a high risk business, but perceived to be safe, Kotak said, stressing banks have ""no choice"" but to manage the risks well.
He also hinted that young people are a bit adventurous with their investments and often put money into risky bets. But fortunately, a large pot of money is with the old people who allocate the resources very judiciously.
Kotak advised young fintech players and startups to enter the fray assuming that they will fail, as 99% of new entities fail.
Stating that banks and other entrenched financial services players should not be complacent in facing competition by young companies out to disrupt the game, he said within a week of demonetisation, a ""relatively unknown"" company became a common place across the masses, hinting at Paytm.
""It shook us out of our slumber,"" he said, adding this had the his bank soon launching the 8/11 account opening drive which gave it good business as it helped address the opportunities in the mass segment from the earlier mass premium segment.
Kotak also sounded peeved at the high cost of accessing IT services, exhorting software players to offer services at lower cost and said they need to offer services at 1-2% of the cost they are charging now.
He also rued that while the country has made a name for itself rendering software services to the world, there have not been enough product companies, resulting in multinationals to make a lot money.

355,2019-02-21,Mahindra Mahindra,"Boeing also highlighted its growing services, sustainment and training footprint in IndiaThe partners are developing comprehensive plans to set-up a new 'factory of the future' to manufacture Super Hornet locally

BENGALURU :
Aerospace company Boeing on Thursday held discussions with its partners, Mahindra Defence Systems (MDS) and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), on the proposed F/A-18 Super Hornet 'Make in India' plan. 
The partners are developing comprehensive plans to set-up a new 'factory of the future' to manufacture Super Hornet locally, Boeing said after the discussions at the Aero India air show at the Yelahanka air base here. The program is expected to work with several Indian suppliers to grow a thriving defense aerospace base which could accelerate other programs, a company statement said. 
The facility will create a world-class, highly trained aerospace workforce, it said. The public-private partnership is intended to bring Boeing, HAL and MDS' global scale and supply chain, its best-in-industry precision manufacturing processes, as well as experience in designing and optimising aerospace production facilities to expand India's aerospace ecosystem and help realise the 'Make in India' vision. 
Boeing's Super Hornet is a proven platform that offers the fighter of the future for India networked, survivable and reliable, the statement said. Introduced in 2007, the F/A-18 Super Hornet is the world's preeminent carrier capable aircraft and best suited for India's naval fighter requirements designed from day one for carrier operations, according to Boeing. 
The Super Hornet is highly capable across the full mission spectrum for the Indian Air Force and is a true multi-role aircraft, able to perform virtually every mission in the tactical spectrum, it said. 
In addition, Boeing also laid out at Aero India its future defence plans proposing the KC-46A aerial refueler, AH-64E Apache attack helicopter, additional P-8 long-range maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine aircraft, and the twin-engine Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) aircraft.

353,2019-02-22,Mahindra Mahindra,"IDBI Bank sees wilful defaults more than double—from  ₹3,600 to  ₹7,381 crore—between Decembers of 2017 and 2018Govt has asked all banks to set up a separate fraud prevention wing to detect potential wilful defaults at an early stage

Mumbai: Despite lenders using the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and other means to recover loans and check defaults, most of them have seen a substantial jump in wilful defaults in 2018, shows data from Cibil.
Lenders were told by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2017 to refer more than three dozen defaulting companies to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). According to data from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), 1,484 cases have been admitted to the bankruptcy court between January 2017 and December 2018. These include referrals by financial creditors and operational creditors, besides the defaulting companies themselves.
The sharpest increase in wilful defaults among public sector banks was at loss-making IDBI Bank, which saw wilful defaults more than double—from  ₹3,660 crore to  ₹7,381 crore—between December 2017 and December 2018. This is more than 13% of the bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs).
Other public sector banks, such as Bank of India (BOI) and Bank of Maharashtra (BOM), are not too far behind. While BOI has seen 60% year-on-year (y-o-y) jump in wilful defaults to  ₹9,785 crore, BOM witnessed a 41% increase to  ₹1,385 crore. While data for State Bank of India (SBI) and its associates was not available as on 31 December 2018, they had the largest chunk of wilful defaults till September at  ₹37,250 crore.
A senior banker at one of India’s largest public sector banks, requesting anonymity, said lenders have been recognizing several large defaults over the last year and the process could have led to figuring out which ones have wilfully defaulted. “Moreover, after the finance ministry asked us to probe all bad loans above  ₹50 crore for fraud, we did forensic audits for all. The ones showing traces of fraudulent activity have been classified as wilful defaulters.""
Among private sector banks whose December 2018 data is available, Kotak Mahindra Bank stands out with wilful defaults of  ₹8,757 crore, 22% higher on a y-o-y basis. HDFC Bank has seen little change in the past one year with wilful defaults at  ₹465 crore in December 2018.
Another banker who did not want to be named said the government has asked all banks to set up a separate fraud prevention wing to detect these cases at an early stage. “We are in discussions with the Indian Banks’ Association to form common guidelines with regard to fraud and wilful defaults so that banks do not follow different procedures.""
A borrower is tagged a wilful defaulter if he/she fails to meet repayment obligations despite having the capacity to repay. Other instances include not utilizing the loan for the specific purpose for which it was taken, and instead, diverting it for other purposes.
The RBI has also mandated banks to submit a list of suit-filed accounts and non-suit filed accounts of wilful defaulters of  ₹25 lakh or more at least every month to credit information firms like Cibil.
The evidence of wilful default is examined by a committee of high ranking bank executives. If the committee concludes that wilful default has happened, it issues a show cause notice to the borrower, and after considering their submissions, issues an order, which is reviewed by another committee comprising the managing director or the chief executive officer, and two independent directors. The order becomes final only after it is confirmed by this review committee."

350,2019-03-01,Mahindra Mahindra,"Ola Electric Mobility will be led by Anand Shah and Ankit JainOla Electric is currently running several pilots to deploy electric vehicles and charging solutions

Bengaluru: Ola Electric Mobility raised  ₹400 crore from Ola’s early backers Tiger Global and Matrix India, among others, the company said on Friday. This marks the first external investment into Ola’s fledgling electric vehicle company, which has been struggling to take off in India.
Ola Electric Mobility will be led by Anand Shah, who had previously worked with the likes of Audi and BMW, and Ankit Jain, who headed Ola’s connected vehicle platform.
The new infusion is expected to help the company in its goal of bringing one million electric vehicles on Indian roads by 2022. The company had previously claimed to achieve this target by 2021.
Ola Electric is currently running several pilots to deploy electric vehicles and charging solutions. In April, the company claimed that it would introduce a fleet of 10,000 electric vehicles (EVs) over the next 12 months.
“The first problem to solve in electric mobility is charging: users need a dependable, convenient, and affordable replacement for the petrol pump,"" said Shah, head of Ola Electric Mobility.
This infusion comes at a time when Mahindra & Mahindra, the biggest electric car maker in the country, announced a foray into the shared mobility space. The company recently launched an app called Glyd to deliver personalised transportation needs through electric vehicles.
Previously, Ola had tied up with Mahindra to launch a pilot for electric vehicles in Nagpur in 2018. However, the project failed to take off as the drivers were unhappy with the electric vehicles and some of them even returned the vehicles, according to several news reports.
Despite this, Ola’s chief executive Bhavish Aggarwal remains optimistic.
“At Ola Electric, our mission is to enable sustainable mobility for everyone,"" said Aggarwal. “India can leapfrog problems of pollution and energy security by moving to electric mobility, create millions of new jobs and economic opportunity, and lead the world.""
The cab-hailing platform has raised money in tranches over the last few months, with the latest one being $92 million from Flipkart’s co-founder Sachin Bansal. Ola is currently valued at around $5.7 billion, making it the second most valued start-up in the country."

New Delhi: The announcement of the second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME-2) scheme on Thursday, with an outlay of  ₹10,000 crore for a period of three years, has been welcomed by automakers that were waiting for a signal before committing huge investments in electric mobility.
Government support for FAME-2 is holistic and includes a focus on the charging infrastructure and Make in India, said Pawan Goenka, managing director at Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. “The new outlay of  ₹10,000 crore over a period of three years provides a stable policy to promote green mobility in India,"" said Goenka.
“It addresses key issues, including national energy security, mitigation of the adverse impact of vehicles on the environment and growth of domestic technology and manufacturing capabilities. The revised Fame 2 removes all the uncertainty and will put electric vehicles in the fast lane,"" he said.
Mahindra is the largest manufacturer of electric vehicles in India and has already set up a base on the outskirts of Bengaluru to manufacture electric powertrains. The company will also set up a lithium ion battery manufacturing plant in Maharashtra with South Korean company LG Chem.
The union government is expected to support more than 150,000 units of electric vehicles cutting across segments in the next three years. As many as one million electric two-wheelers, 500,000 three-wheelers, 55,000 two-wheelers and 7,000 buses will be included in the new phase of the scheme.

“The proposal to use battery capacity as a proxy for performance and linking it to the subsidy is a decisive step to incentivize EVs that are near-equal or better in performance to their petrol counterparts,"" said Phokela.
“Offering incentives to all OEMs to invest in setting up a charging network and also simplifying the requirements of a station and the process of installation and operation will be an added push in the right directions,"" he said.

New Delhi: Wholesale despatches of automobiles across segments remained subdued in February as vehicle manufacturers cut production amid a slump in overall economic activity. Auto sales of major manufacturers were almost flat or declined in February while those of commercial vehicles fell because of a lack of credit and new axle norms.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest passenger vehicle manufacturer, reported a 0.9% year-on-year growth in sales to 136,912 units. This is the third straight month in which the Maruti Suzuki’s vehicle production growth has stayed flat.
Mumbai-based Tata Motors Ltd also reported a meagre 2% year-on-year increase in sales to 18,110 units, while Honda Cars India Ltd reported a 16% y-o-y growth in dispatches to 13,527 units, but from a very low base. Toyota Kirloskar Motor India Ltd also reported a 0.87% decline in sales to 11,760 units during the month.
Among the top four passenger vehicle manufacturers, only Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd managed to grow vehicle dispatches by double digits as sales grew by 17% to 26,109 units because of the launch of its new compact utility vehicle XUV300.
“The month of February has augured well for Mahindra as we have witnessed a strong double digit growth of 16% in our utility vehicle portfolio, on the back of our newly launched XUV300 model. Further, the overall growth for the month has been around 10%. On a year-to-date basis too, we have shown a strong growth of 12% at an overall level,"" said Rajan Wadhera, president (automotive business) at Mahindra.
“Passenger vehicle sales remained muted in February 2019. Given high discounts and several new launches in the recent months, there are some signs of recovery at the dealership level. However, full recovery is still some time away. With the country entering an election phase, consumer sentiment will continue to remain cautious in the near term, which will weigh on the passenger vehicle demand,"" said Ashish Modani, assistant vice president, corporate sector ratings, Icra Ltd.
In the commercial vehicle segment, sales continue to remain muted as financing options remain limited for fleet owners, after the liquidity crisis in non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and the introduction of new axle norms for heavy and medium trucks.
The biggest commercial vehicle manufacturer in the country, Tata Motors, reported a 5% drop in sales to 39,111 units, while Ashok Leyland Ltd , the second largest manufacturer, saw volumes increase by just 1% to 17,352 units.
The medium and heavy truck sales of Tata Motors decreased significantly by 18% year-on-year to 12,437 units, while for Ashok Leyland it fell by 2% year-on-year to 12,874 units during the month.
“The market continues to exhibit subdued demand on the back of high interest rates, lagged effect of the implementation of revised axle load norms, and slowing economic activity, resulting in a decline of 5% in commercial vehicle sales volume,"" said Girish Wagh, president, commercial vehicle business unit, Tata Motors Ltd.
“The MHCV (medium and heavy commercial vehicles) segment has declined by 18%. However, our new product introductions with increased axle load norms is gaining traction as customers are seeing the clear advantages of the superior operating economics,"" he added.

HONG KONG :
HNA Group Co.’s sale of its technology outsourcing arm has attracted interest from suitors including Digital China Group Co. and Tech Mahindra Ltd., people familiar with the matter said.
Buyout firm Advent International and some Chinese investment funds have also been weighing offers for HNA’s Pactera Technology International Ltd. unit, according to the people. The embattled Chinese conglomerate has asked for second-round bids within the next few weeks, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
Some investment funds could decide to join forces with a strategic bidder to make a joint offer, the people said. No final decisions have been made, and there’s no certainty the parties will decide to submit formal bids, the people said.
Representatives for Advent, Digital China, HNA and Tech Mahindra declined to comment. A representative for Pactera didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
HNA, which has been offloading assets to pay down debt, is working with Credit Suisse Group AG as it seeks to revive a sale of Pactera, Bloomberg News reported in December. Options under consideration include a full sale to one or multiple buyers, people with knowledge of the matter said at the time.
Valuation could be one of the main hurdles to a deal, according to the people. The Chinese conglomerate’s ownership of Pactera dates back to 2016, when it agreed to buy the company from Blackstone Group LP for about $700 million.
Pactera’s holding company, HNA EcoTech Panorama Cayman Co., said last month it would be further delaying a planned early redemption of its U.S. dollar bonds. HNA EcoTech’s notes due 2021 were indicated Friday at around 89 cents on the dollar, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.

345,2019-03-04,Mahindra Mahindra,"The firm is also building an industrial park under Origins brand each in Chennai and AhmedabadThe Mumbai-based developer operates a large integrated business park each in Chennai and Jaipur

Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd, the real estate unit of Mahindra Group, will focus on adding more strategic financial partners, besides monetizing industrial parks to fuel growth, said a top company executive.
Sangeeta Prasad, chief executive officer and managing director, Mahindra Lifespace, said the company is evaluating opportunities to bring on board investment partners at the project level or form investment platforms with institutional investors.
“We already have financial and strategic partners, but we are looking for more now. Secondly, we are looking at joint developments and creating joint venture platforms proactively. It is good to have partners who can share risks and rewards,"" Prasad said in an interview.
Mahindra Lifespace’s existing investors include UK’s private equity firm Actis, World Bank’s investment arm International Financial Corp. (IFC), Japan’s Sumitomo Corp. and HDFC Capital Advisors.
In 2017, IFC invested around $50 million in Mahindra Lifespace’s existing and under-construction industrial parks in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra.
The Mumbai-based developer operates a large integrated business park each in Chennai and Jaipur under the Mahindra World City brand.
It is also building an industrial park under the Origins brand each in Chennai and Ahmedabad.
Last year, the company formed a joint venture with HDFC Capital Advisors for affordable housing projects.
Prasad said quicker turnaround of residential projects and monetizing industrial parks to generate faster cash flow are of prime importance to the company, as the real estate sector has started following the new accounting norms since last year.
Under the new Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 115, revenues can be booked only after a project is completed and customers take possession of their dwellings.
Prasad said the company’s recent quarterly results have been “choppy"" mainly due to the new accounting norms.
In the third quarter of the current fiscal year, Mahindra Lifespace posted a 21% drop in net profit to  ₹20.58 crore.
“Ind AS 115 has impacted the business model. If you can complete the project faster then I can revenue recognise faster...One of the important things we are doing is to look at the construction strategy and how to hasten completion of our future projects,"" she said.
Instead of expanding to Tier II markets, Mahindra Lifespace plans to focus on having a deeper presence in Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru and National Capital Region. In the last three-four months, it has signed agreements to purchase land parcels to construct one million square feet of residential space in Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru.“We want to consolidate and not spread ourselves too thin. For instance, we may not get into Nagpur again...Besides, there are many long pending legal cases, which we have been trying to negotiate. We are trying to come out of it. It takes a lot of management time,"" Prasad added.
Besides adding financial partners, the company is focused on monetizing industrial parks particularly its two World City projects in Jaipur and Chennai by leasing them and growing overall sales. “What we are focused is getting more customers in our World Cities and monetizing it. We want to improve the sales traction from our industrial parks,"" she said."

MUMBAI :
Promoters of Indian companies are increasingly transferring their personal and family stakes to trusts, a move that has as much to do with succession planning as with avoiding estate tax, if it ever comes back, and fending off hostile takeovers.
The trend is helped along by the markets regulator, which has granted open offer exemptions to as many as 47 promoters, who have sought its permission since 2013. Of these, 31 exemptions were granted since the start of 2017, a period that has seen rising concerns over a possible return of estate duty, levied on the value of assets passed on to legal heirs.
With the exemption, promoters do not have to make an open offer to buy out shares from the public, a requirement that typically comes with ownership changes.
According to a Mint analysis of data available with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and BSE, Anand Mahindra of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M); Analjit Singh of Max Group; Anil Rai Gupta of Havells India Ltd; G. Mallikarjuna Rao of GMR Infrastructure Ltd; Vinod and Kavita Saraf of Vinati Organics Ltd; Anil Mittal, Arun Kumar Gupta and Anoop Kumar Gupta of KRBL Ltd; the Amin family of Alembic Pharmaceuticals Ltd; Irfan Razack, Rezwan Razack and Noaman Razack of Prestige Estates Projects Ltd are some of the promoters who have moved their shareholding to family trusts.
“The transfer of my direct and indirect holdings of Mahindra shares were done to the trusts for meeting the estate planning needs of my family. We had sought and obtained the necessary regulatory permissions in this regard,"" Anand Mahindra, chairman of M&M, said in a reply to a query.
For Adi Godrej, chairman of Godrej Group, it was all about safety and precaution.
“(This is being done) because of taxation benefits. Suppose, if an estate duty comes, the trust doesn’t have to pay. Many countries have it. A lot of people are talking about inequality of wealth, etc. In the US, they still have an estate duty. If the government wants to do it, they are in majority, they will do it. There is so much talk about it all over,"" said Godrej.
Till the 1980s, India levied a 90% marginal income tax and an 8% wealth tax on the income of promoters, Godrej said.
In an emailed statement, Havells India said the promoter families had created a trust to simplify their direct and indirect shareholdings in Havells following a private family arrangement.
One of the key drivers of the new trend is asset protection. Families are increasingly aware of the risks posed by the new insolvency law and their exposure via personal guarantees for the company’s debt.
“Hence, to protect against this, settlement into trusts is advisable, but the timing needs to be carefully seen to avoid doing so on the eve of potential creditor claims coming,"" said Rishabh Shroff, a partner at law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas who also jointly heads the firm’s family business and estate planning team.
Another reason is to protect against the possibility of an estate duty. At present, no such tax exists, and it seems unlikely for the foreseeable future, but promoters are leaving nothing to chance.
“The hope here is that such trusts will fall outside the scope of such tax, as no inheritance or transmission takes place under a trust, but as the contours of such law are completely unknown, no one really knows for sure, but one can still prepare,"" Shroff added.
Families form trusts also to separate ownership from management. A family can consolidate ownership into one strong central block under a trust and senior members can become trustees with planned succession. This helps avoid fragmentation of estates over generations.
A person close to the Analjit Singh family said a trust structure was first considered in 2010 to initiate a more structured way of succession planning. The Max Group had sought exemptions for three of its firms, but the request was rejected as the group went through a demerger and Sebi does not allow exemption of all companies within the first year of demerger.
The Singh family’s approach to a trust structure was driven more by a need for succession planning, the person said, asking not to be named.
“When you write a will, any of the successors can challenge it after your demise. In a trust structure, there are trustees. They are supposed to see the execution of trust,"" the person said.
“A will can be contested, but in a trust it doesn’t happen that easy,"" the person added."
343,2019-03-05,Mahindra Mahindra,"During the last few days, Bank of Baroda, PNB, Allahabad Bank, Kotak Mahindra and Union Bank of India have cut their MCLRRBI's repo rate cut has paved the way for cheaper loans

NEW DELHI :
After a nudge from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to lower their marginal cost of funds-based lending rates (MCLR) following a cut in the repo rate, at least five banks have already reduced interest rates by 5-10 basis points while other banks are likely to follow suit soon.
India’s largest bank, the State Bank of India (SBI), which has shied away from revising its MCLR, reduced interest rates for home loans of up to  ₹30 lakh by 5 basis points (bps) last month.
During the day, state-owned Bank of Baroda (BoB) announced that it will cut its benchmark lending rate by 0.1 percentage points with effect from March 7. BoB's MCLR for overnight and one-month tenors would be 8.25% and 8.30%, respectively.
During the last few days, Punjab National Bank (PNB), Allahabad Bank, Kotak Mahindra and Union Bank of India have also cut their MCLR.
With effect from March 1, state-owned PNB has reduced the MCLR by 0.10 percentage point for loans of various tenors. The interest rate on one-year tenor loans, against which most of the bank's consumer loans are benchmarked, has been cut to 8.45% from 8.55%, while the three-year MCLR has been cut to 8.65%.
Union Bank of India (UBI) has similarly reduced its lending rate by 10 bps. The state-run bank’s one-year MCLR or the minimum lending rate, against which most consumer loans are benchmarked, has been decreased to 8.60% from 8.70%.
Unlike PNB, UBI has also lowered its base rate by 10 bps to 9%.
Allahabad Bank has also cut its MCLR by 10 basis points for all loan tenures up to three years.
Among private sector banks, Kotak Mahindra Bank has lowered its lending rate by 5 basis points, taking its new one-year MCLR to 9%.
IANS reported today that four other PSU banks and a private bank are in the process of announcing rate cuts.
In its bi-monthly policy review last month, the RBI had cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25%. Citing higher credit cost due to massive NPA piles and the resultant churning of margins, banks have, however, been reluctant in passing the benefit of RBI rate cuts to borrowers. Mint had reported last month that the heads of public and private sector banks have sought time from RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das to pass benefits of the RBI repo rate cut to borrowers."

GENEVA :
For Mahindra group, from whose stable electric luxury supercar Battista is being rolled out, the path to mass adoption of electric vehicles will be through fleet such as Ola, according to the group's Chairman Anand Mahindra.
At present electric vehicles (EVs) are out of reach of price sensitive buyers, specially in India, but the usage of such vehicles by fleet operators will help in achieving economies of scale in the industry and ultimately help in reaching personal mobility, Mahindra told PTI here in an interview.
Speaking at the sidelines of the 89th Geneva International Motor Show, he also said the group is also working on how to bring its GenZe electric scooters to India as it would be ""too expensive"" for the market there currently.
""Right now the break even for electric cars applies more to cars that are used much more. The more you use the electric cars the better your payback,"" he said.
Welcoming the  ₹10,000 crore FAME II scheme under which four-wheeler electric vehicles will get subsidy only for fleet operators and commercial purposes, Mahindra said, ""What the government has done is spot on.""
He, however, added, ""Whether they (government) had done it or not we had decided to focus on fleet anyway.""
When fleets start using EVs, economies of scale is created in the industry as the cost of these vehicles come down when more people buy them, he said.
Moreover, when people start using these cars seeing companies like Uber, Ola using it, people get accustomed to it and thus helping in popularisation of EVs, Mahindra added.
""Fleets are the best way to familiarise people to speed up adoption. So in some point, if see all these charts converge that's the time that people will start using it for personal mobility. Mahindra will be ready (for it) with some options which are both affordable and exciting,"" he said.
In the past, Mahindra had tied up with app-based cab aggregator Ola in partnership with the Indian government to build India's first electric mass mobility ecosystem in Nagpur.
When asked about the group's electric two-wheeler programme, Mahindra said,""We make GenZe e-scooters overseas (in the US). It is too expensive for India but we have some thoughts.""
He further said, ""The e-scooters will come to Europe first. So GenZe may even be marketed by under Peugeot which we own in Europe. So the question is how to bring it to India, we are working on it.""
Bullish on the segment, Mahindra said, ""Electric two-wheelers are going to be a big movement, shared fleets as well as personal mobility...the biggest trend in the world is going to be kick scooters, next biggest trend is e-bikes and e-scooters.""

Geneva Motor Show: Automobili Pininfarina, the designer of iconic Ferrari cars and now a part of India's Mahindra Group, unveiled on Tuesday the Battista, a 1900 BHP, 2300 NM electric supercar that is touted to be faster than a Formula 1 car in its 0-100km/h, sub-two second sprint. Named after Pininfarina's founder, the Battista is the legendary car designer's first production car—and an electric one at that.
When it arrives in 2020, the Battista will be the most powerful car ever designed and built in Italy. It has the potential to accelerate to 62 mph in less than two seconds, faster than a Formula 1 car, and break the 250 mph top speed barrier—all with a potential zero emission range of over 300 miles, the company said.
It will deliver a level of performance that is ""unachievable today in any road-legal sports car featuring internal combustion engine technology"", Pininfarina claimed.
""This is the most authentic and exciting automotive story imaginable. The Battista is the hypercar of the future, inspired by a legendary past,"" Automobili Pininfarina CEO Michael Perschke told reporters here. Electrification unlocks the door to a new level of performance and a zero-emission future, whilst a passion and respect for automotive history will define how this landmark car looks and feels, he added.
""We aim for the Battista to be a future classic and automotive icon, writing its own page in automotive history books,"" Perschke said.
No more than 150 Battistas will be handcrafted in Italy and allocated equally among the regions of North America, Europe and Middle East/Asia, Pininfarina said.
Customer service will be delivered through some of the world's best luxury car retail specialists, from Los Angeles to London to Tokyo.
The Turin, Italy-based company has named the model after Battista 'Pinin' Farina, the founder of the Carrozzeria Pininfarina coach building company that he started in 1930. The all-electric hypercar is designed and hand-built in very limited numbers at Pininfarina SpA.
Based out of Europe, Automobili Pininfarina combines its automotive design prowess with Mahindra's growing electric vehicle (EV) expertise, gained from participation in the Formula E electric racing car championship.
The Mahindra Group had acquired Pininfarina in late 2015 for an overall outgo of over €50 million after months of negotiations."

339,2019-03-11,Mahindra Mahindra,"Market-linked debentures have come back with a bang with issuance volume almost doubling in FY19Issuance of such debentures total  ₹12,910 crore so far in FY19, as compared to  ₹7,365 crore issued in FY18

Faced with tough times, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are leaving no sources untapped for funds and are even willing to turn creative. Enter structured products, which have a willing investor in high net-worth individuals (HNIs).
Market-linked debentures have come back with a bang with issuance volume almost doubling in the current fiscal year. As the chart above shows, issuance of such debentures added up to  ₹12,910 crore till date, far higher than the  ₹7,365 crore issued in FY18.
These are structured debt instruments that give investors exposure to equities.
These products are designed to not only provide assured payback of the initial investment but also a return that could mimic the stock market or even outperform it.
Sensing that there are ready investors waiting to put money, NBFCs such as Aditya Birla Finance Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Ltd, L&T Finance Holdings Ltd, and Tata Capital Financial Services Ltd have turned first-time issuers.
“For HNIs, this has been a popular product choice for many years now. There is principal protection and the return is linked to Nifty. The payoff is as high as 70-80% of Nifty gains,"" said Ajay Manglunia, head of fixed income of Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd.
The Edelweiss Group companies have been regular issuers of such debentures.
By design, market-linked debentures sound perfect but there are pitfalls.
For starters, these are complex structures and not every investor understands them. Notice the names of first-time issuers above. These are considered pristine credit and hence trusted by HNIs.
They may have fat pockets but HNIs won’t part with their cash for anyone just based on a decent rating.
Since credit has to be trustworthy, there aren’t that many market-linked debentures issued. The share of these structured debentures is minuscule, and at less than 1% of overall bond issuance.
This gives rise to the problem of liquidity, which forces investors to hold the debenture until maturity.
That said, CARE Ratings Ltd expects issuance to reach around  ₹14,000 crore in FY19.
A bullish stock market and a fairly high interest rate regime are the perfect mix to lure HNIs to these products.
Still, smarting from the liquidity crunch triggered by defaulter Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd last year, NBFCs do not want to let go of any opportunity to raise money.
For now, HNIs seem to have loosened their pockets for the respectable names among them."
338,2019-03-12,Mahindra Mahindra,"Private banks have over the past five years eaten into market share of public sector banks in savings depositsSBI, on account of its sheer size, may be able to protect its base, but its peers will suffer, should they choose to follow

India’s largest bank has bitten the bullet on making interest rates more pliable to changes in policy rates. State Bank of India (SBI) has linked the rate on the stickiest of its products, savings bank deposits, to the benchmark repo rate. The change applies to deposits exceeding  ₹1 lakh in value.
It is natural that when SBI’s cost of deposits comes down, so would lending rates. Ergo, the regulator’s complaints on poor transmission seem to have been addressed.
SBI’s move to link its savings rate to the policy rate, at a time when the probability of an RBI rate cut is high, makes smart business sense. Margins may improve immediately and the fact that savings deposits are sticky will ensure SBI doesn’t lose its customers.
Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities note that the difference between the current savings rate and the estimated repo rate-linked one has narrowed in recent times. “A variable interest rate does not necessarily mean a negative outcome for the customer as well,"" the firm said in a note.
In any case, the understanding is that savings accounts are a function of convenience and habit more than interest rates. But it may not be so simple and linear an argument.
The chart above shows that over the last five years, private banks have eaten into the market share of public sector peers in savings deposits. Incremental deposits are going to the likes of Kotak Mahindra Bank and Yes Bank, which offer higher interest rates than the 3.5% given by the remaining lenders.
Last week, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said in a television interview that 95% of its customers will not be impacted. However, by value, roughly one-third of the lender’s deposit base is estimated to get linked to the repo rate. That is because 80% of its savings deposits, which form 40% of its total deposits, will fall in the category of above  ₹1 lakh, an SBI official told BloombergQuint.
Large savings deposits can be traced to high net worth individuals and corporations. They are not as sticky as the rest of the crowd. SBI’s market share in savings deposits has largely remained unchanged over the last decade.
The same cannot be said about its peers. Public sector banks have lost a massive 2.58 percentage points market share over the last five years and private banks have gained 5.54 percentage points. SBI, by the sheer size of its franchise, may be able to protect its base, but its peers will suffer, should they choose to follow.
The move towards market benchmarking of deposit rates has begun. It would be interesting to see if the historic trend of stickiness persists, or if public sector lenders become big losers."
336,2019-03-12,Mahindra Mahindra,"Uday Kotak's wealth now stands at $11.4 billion mainly due to share price gains that have increased the value of his holding in KMB, currently 30%Kotak Mahindra Bank boasts one of the lowest NPA ratios and one the highest net interest margins among Indian banks

Mumbai: Going toe to toe with a powerful regulator isn’t normally good for your financial health. But it has proven to be profitable, on paper at least, for India’s billionaire banker Uday Kotak.
The founder of Mumbai-based Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. has seen his wealth nearly triple since March 2014, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said he failed to meet the first of its successive milestones to reduce his stake in the bank. His wealth now stands at $11.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, mainly due to share price gains that have increased the value of his holding in KMB, currently 30%.
The latest RBI deadline was for Kotak to reduce his holding below 20% by the end of last year, part of the regulator’s industrywide efforts to reduce the influence of founding shareholders in Indian banks. Kotak Mahindra is taking legal action to contest that, arguing that a sale last year of  ₹500 crore ($72 million) in preference shares complies with central bank rules. A new hearing is due to take place on the bank’s motion later Tuesday in the Bombay High Court.
Kotak Mahindra shares have outperformed those of most of its peers, thanks to the bank’s success in avoiding some of the asset quality concerns that have weighed on many of the country’s lenders. KMB boasts one of the lowest bad-loan ratios and one the highest net interest margins among Indian banks, making its shares the best performer in the NSE Nifty Bank Index over the past five years.
“Uday Kotak seems to delay implementation of the shareholding rules as much as he can, adding billions to his wealth in the process,"" said independent analyst Hemindra Hazari, who writes for the Smartkarma platform. “Had he followed the timelines, he would have had to sell his shares for far less a price than today.""
Last year, the High Court refused to shield Kotak Mahindra from any penalties that might be imposed by the RBI over the failure to cut Uday Kotak’s equity stake below 20%. In September, the central bank ordered Bandhan Bank Ltd. not to raise Chief Executive Officer Chandra Shekhar Ghosh’s salary and restricted the lender from opening new branches without its approval after the bank failed to meet shareholding requirements.
“The actions of the bank have been in accordance with RBI’s communications, the needs of the company, and the law. It is incorrect to impute any motives to that,"" said Rohit Rao, KMB’s chief communication officer. He noted that the bank’s share price gains have accrued to all shareholders, not just its founder. “We are unable to comment further"" since the matter is subjudice before the Bombay High Court, he added.
Kotak Mahindra missed the original deadlines set by the bank for progressively reducing its founder’s stake in 2014 and 2016, though it did meet a dilution requirement set by the RBI in 2017, according to court documents.
Shareholders would lose out if Uday Kotak is forced to reduce his stake, according to J.N. Gupta, managing director of Stakeholder Empowerment Services, an investor advisory firm.
“Given the size of the bank, issuing equity to reduce the stake is impractical,"" Gupta said. “Selling the stake in the secondary market will also hurt investors as it will divert his attention from the bank. Either way, it will hurt.""
Uday Kotak will find a long queue of willing buyers for his shares if the court’s decision goes in favor of the regulator, said Ajay Bodke, head of investment strategy at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd. “His bank is a jewel in the crown of the Indian banking sector."""

India’s central bank is warning that its authority could be undermined if courts rule against it in a case involving a major private-sector lender.
Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.’s legal petition against the Reserve Bank of India’s objection to the method used by the founder to pare his stake in the lender, if granted, would weaken its regulatory authority, according to the RBI. Billionaire founder Uday Kotak, who currently holds 30% of the bank, has missed multiple milestones to reduce his stake in the lender, as mandated by the central bank. The RBI required his holding to be cut below 20% by December.
The private lender is asking the court to approve its issuance of preference shares as a way to dilute its founder’s stake and is arguing that the central bank’s demands are against the public interest. The preference share sale has already been rejected by the RBI.
“The reliefs sought in the petition, if granted, shall result in making inroads into the RBI’s autonomy, and to permit the petitioners and others to become regulators of their own selves,"" the RBI said in a petition to the Bombay High Court, a copy of which has been seen by Bloomberg News.
The central bank has been in tussle with Kotak since 2014 when it said he failed to meet the first milestone to reduce his stake in the bank. The RBI has been trying to separate the management and ownership functions at the nation’s lenders to improve corporate governance, and the case before the courts could force a reinterpretation of ownership restrictions governing local banks.
An RBI spokesman didn’t respond to a telephone call and email seeking comment, while a Kotak spokesman asked for more time to respond.
That the lender and not the founder of the bank chose to file a complaint against the RBI shows “the need to make private banks more independent and not reflect the interests of one individual,"" the central bank also wrote in its submission to the court.
Stake dilution
Kotak Mahindra missed the original deadlines set by the bank for progressively reducing its founder’s stake in 2014 and 2016, though it did meet a dilution requirement set by the RBI in 2017, according to court documents.
The bank will pledge that its founder’s voting rights will be in line with RBI’s ownership rules until May 2020, Harish Salve, a lawyer representing Kotak Mahindra said in a Bombay High Court hearing on Tuesday. The central bank had ordered Kotak to cut his stake in the bank to 20% by December and further reduce it to 15% after May 2020.
The lender also sought an interim protection in the matter. The court will hear further arguments in the case on April 1
The banking regulator’s policy on founder’s shareholding is “inconsistent, unreasonable, arbitrary"" and as applied to Kotak Mahindra is “contrary to public interest,"" the lender’s lawyers said in its petition last year.
The RBI said in its petition that the lender has given various reasons for not meeting the central bank’s order, including its market capitalization, volatility and the global slowdown. “Overall, these tactics were nothing but a way to run down the clock,"" it said.

Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd on Tuesday told the Bombay high court that its promoters are ready to give an undertaking to cap their voting rights at 20% despite holding a 30% stake in the private lender to allay concerns of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on concentration of power.
Kotak Mahindra Bank moved the Bombay high court after RBI rejected its proposal to issue perpetual non-convertible preference shares in August to comply with rules concerning promoter shareholding. Billionaire founder Uday Kotak, who holds about 30% of the bank, has been asked by RBI to lower his stake to 20% by the end of December 2018 and to 15% by March 2020.
While the next hearing on the case has been scheduled for 1 April, RBI’s senior counsel Venkatesh Dhond sought a week’s time to file an affidavit in response to the bank’s writ petition.
The case, being heard by a two-judge bench of Justices B.P. Dharmadhikari and Sarang V. Kotwal, is being closely watched as it is the first time that a bank has moved court on a RBI directive.
The court observed that the matter is not so simple that interim relief can be provided and declined to grant a stay on the deadline set by RBI.
In December, Dhond said the dilution of promoter stake is aimed at ensuring that voting power is not concentrated in the hands of a single group and all banks have complied with the rule.
In a similar case, RBI earlier froze salaries of Bandhan Bank chief executive and founder Chandra Shekhar Ghosh and also denied the private lender permission to open branches.
A 10 March 2019 PTI report said RBI is reviewing ownership norms for private banks. RBI is looking at either setting up a panel to review these norms or granting more time to meet these rules, it said."
337,2019-03-13,Mahindra Mahindra,"The acquisition will help Mahindra CIE foray into aluminium die casting space and strengthen presence in two-wheeler marketThe deal is among several struck in India's auto components industry in a private equity-driven consolidation wave

Mumbai: Mahindra CIE Automotive Ltd has acquired Aurangabad Electricals Ltd for  ₹830 crore, marking its entry into the aluminium die-casting industry. The acquisition will also strengthen its presence in the two-wheeler market, said the company in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. The transaction is expected to be completed by 10 April.
Aluminium die-casting is used to make smooth, defined metal parts by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mould.
Aurangabad Electricals, founded in 1985, has five manufacturing facilities located across Aurangabad, Pune and Pantnagar in Maharashtra. It produces a range of body, brake and engine parts and supplies them to local and international two-wheeler and passenger vehicle companies and Tier-I auto component makers.
Aurangabad Electricals recorded revenues of  ₹565 crore,  ₹569 crore and  ₹651 crore during fiscal years 2015-16, 2016-I7 and 2017-18, respectively.
It reported a profit of  ₹34.4 crore in FY18.
Mahindra CIE made its last major acquisition in 2016 when it purchased automotive forging company Bill Forge for  ₹1,332 crore in a cash and stock deal with the aim of diversifying its business and increasing revenue and profit from Asian markets.
India’s auto component industry is set for a wave for consolidation as top private equity (PE) firms are buying and aggregating mid-sized auto parts makers to tap into the lucrative global market.
In 2018, global private equity giant Blackstone Group LLP bought auto parts maker Comstar at a valuation of nearly  ₹1,000 crore and followed it up soon after with the acquisition of Sona BLW Precision Forgings.
In April 2018, homegrown PE fund Kedaara Capital acquired Sunbeam Auto, which makes aluminium die casting parts, for nearly  ₹650 crore.
Spain’s CIE Automotive SA is an industrial group specializing in supplying components and sub-assemblies to automobile as well as Tier-I auto part makers in India, Europe and Mexico. It is listed on the stock exchanges in Madrid and Bilbao.
Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) had joined hands with CIE in September 2013 to form a global auto components supply network. It had acquired a 13.5% stake in the Spanish auto-parts supplier, while retaining 20% direct ownership in the new firm, Mahindra CIE Automotive, which is listed in India.
Last year CIE picked up an additional 5% stake for  ₹483 crore (around $70 million). The Spanish firm now holds 56.32% in the listed Indian entity. Mahindra Group has a 11.44% stake in Mahindra CIE. The stake is held through M&M’s unit, Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Ltd.

332,2019-03-14,Mahindra Mahindra,"A decade ago, Mahindra tried to break in to the US market with a low-cost pickup truck but failedAmong the vehicles under consideration for the US market is the new Marazzo

AUBURN HILLS,
		             MICH. :
""Warning: Don't do anything stupid!"" reads the sign to the right of Rick Haas' office computer.
It is the same tongue-in-cheek warning affixed to the dashboard of every off-road Mahindra Roxor vehicle that Indian automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd assembles in a suburb north of Detroit.
The motto might also apply to the Indian automaker's latest attempt to enter the U.S. auto market - an effort Haas, a former executive at Ford Motor Co and Tesla Inc, is leading.
A decade ago, Mahindra tried to break in to the U.S. market with a low-cost pickup truck. The foray ended in failure and a lawsuit from dealers demanding their franchise fees back.
Haas, the automaker's North American chief executive, says this time Mahindra has a more cautious ""pay-as-you-go strategy."" Instead of starting with a truck or passenger car, Mahindra is reintroducing its brand with the Roxor, a vehicle that looks like a vintage Jeep.
Mahindra has built around 3,000 off-road Roxors and is using the model, which starts at around $15,000, to demonstrate to American consumers and dealers ""acutely aware of our previous experience"" here that the Indian automaker can build a reliable product before it launches mainstream models for use on American roads, Haas told Reuters.
""Getting burned makes you cautious,"" Haas said.
RICH PROSPECTS, BIG RISKS
Mahindra is one of a handful of European and Asian automakers gearing up to enter the U.S. market in hopes of gaining sales as well as credibility that can boost their brands at home.
France's PSA and China's Zotye and GAC all have outlined plans for establishing beachheads in the world's second-largest market by sales, which offers rich pickings in segments including pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.
But the United States is a mature market that most industry executives say is heading for a downturn, and it is already crowded with over 40 automotive brands and 300-plus models on sale.
""There's not a line waiting out the front door of every potential newcomer to North America of people saying 'I cannot wait for a new car to show up here today,'"" said Larry Dominique, North American head of PSA, which has also taken a cautious approach to relaunching here.
PSA announced last month the Peugeot brand will lead its U.S. return - the same brand that crashed out of this market less than three decades ago.
Analysts and auto executives say new entrants must stand out in a crowd to crack the US market, as Tesla Inc has with electric vehicles.
Just offering a cheap car may not be enough, said Mark Wakefield, head of the North American automotive practice for consultancy AlixPartners. The higher quality of used vehicles presents a challenge, while delivering the expensive safety features American consumers and regulators demand.
""If you fail to deliver on that then you’re a pariah in the market,"" he said.
Prospective US entrants might look to the example of South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co, the last foreign automaker to successfully enter the US car market.
The Korean carmaker launched cheap models in the United States in 1986, as Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd had done before. Hyundai scored early successes, but quality problems set the brand back, and forced a relaunch. Now, it is overhauling its U.S. strategy, shifting from sedans to SUVs.
The problem for prospective entrants is that if they do find an untapped niche, consultants and analysts expect other automakers to rush to fill it themselves.
A NEW STRATEGY
Mahindra's first foray into the US auto market was a disaster, as plans to launch a low-cost pickup with high fuel efficiency never came to fruition, in part because it failed to meet federal emissions standards. Angry dealers who had signed on to sell the Scorpio pickup sued Mahindra.
Mahindra regrouped. Haas set up Mahindra's US office in 2013 with just a handful of people, and that has risen to 450.
The company decided not to go into direct competition with major automakers, but to enter the much smaller and less heavily regulated market for off-road recreational vehicles sold mainly in rural America.
The Roxor stands out because it looks like a World War II Jeep. Mahindra has had a license since the end of that war to make such vehicles in India. Municipalities, mining and construction companies, and many others seeking rugged off-road vehicles have shown interest, Haas said.
The Roxor also has caught the eye of the owner of the Jeep brand, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) NV, a potential competitor whose U.S. headquarters is just up the road from Mahindra's. Last August, FCA asked the U.S. International Trade Commission to block Roxor sales because the model is too similar to its own Jeep.
The commision has ruled FCA can pursue its intellectual property claims against the Roxor, but on Feb. 21 Mahindra asked the agency to review that ruling.
Mahindra has signed up a network of 390 powersports dealers all over the country to sell the Roxor. Haas said around a third of powersports dealers also own car dealerships so the Roxor allows him to establish the brand, then build relationships with car dealers.
""I can't say what our plans are, but the smoke is going to clear out of the air in the next year to 18 months,"" Haas said.
Among the vehicles under consideration for the US market is the new Marazzo, a minivan designed by Mahindra's Michigan engineers for sale in India that has scored well in international crash safety tests and features Apple CarPlay.
Instead of low prices, Mahindra plans to focus on its image of building rugged, durable vehicles for India's roads.
""We're India tough,"" Haas said. ""That's a value that resonates with a chunk of the population here.""
The speed of Mahindra's US rollout will depend not only on retail consumers but the US Postal Service, Haas said. The Postal Service is searching for its next generation of delivery vehicles and Mahindra is one of five finalists for the $6 billion project, which may be decided this year.
""That contract would make a fast (US) entry easier, as you might imagine,"" Haas said. ""If it doesn't happen, then we have to decide what we’re doing here.""

331,2019-03-14,Mahindra Mahindra,"While HDFC Capital will finance the projects through a combination of debt and equity, Tribeca will develop themThe platform will launch its first project in the second or third quarter of next financial year

MUMBAI :
HDFC Ltd’s real estate focused fund management arm HDFC Capital Advisors and Tribeca Developers, builders of Trump Towers in India, have formed a  ₹500-crore investment platform to build premium to mid-income houses in Mumbai and National Capital Region (NCR).
While HDFC Capital will finance the projects through a combination of debt and equity, Tribeca will develop them, said Kalpesh Mehta, founder, Tribeca Developers,over the phone. The platform plans to build around five projects totalling around 3000 units in Mumbai surburbs, Gurugram and Noida in the next four too five years.
These projects will comprise studio apartments, one and two bedroom flats costing between  ₹80 lakh to  ₹2 crore per unit depending on the location.
The platform will launch its first project in the second or third quarter of next financial year. Located in Gurugram, the project comprises 600 units spanning across 1 million sqft. HDFC Capital has already committed  ₹135 crore towards the project.
In the recent past, HDFC Capital has formed several such housing platforms mostly in the affordable residential category with developers including Mahindra Lifespaces Developers Ltd and Prestige Estates Projects.
In 2017, HDFC Capital had closed its second affordable housing fund of around $1-billion corpus, of which a major chunk of it was raised from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.
“The largest opportunity today from both demand as well as land supply side is in the mid-income. It is purely opportunistic,"" said Mehta. At present, Tribeca is developing four ongoing Trump Tower luxury housing projects in Pune, Mumbai, Gurugram and Kolkata in partnership with local developers. The Trump branded residences are priced between  ₹3.5-15 crore in India.
Tribeca’s entry into the mid income to premium segment comes following Trump Organisation’s announcement two years ago not to enter any new deal to develop Trump Towers across the global. The New York-based firm is a business venture of US president Donald Trump.
Most of the funds under the new platform will invest on construction of the projects as wells deposits over land, Mehta said. “We are not taking any land risk. So we are not buying any land. We will develop the projects either through joint venture or development management agreement with land owners,"" he said.
With the residential real estate sector in a consolidation phase, several developers are increasingly choosing to be land owners while staying away from the development business, said Mehta said. “This has opened up huge opportunity for developers like Tribeca to partner with land owners or local builders to jointly develop the land,"" he added.
“Housing remains a crucial need in India and the demand for housing is expected to grow substantially with increased urbanisation. HDFC’s endeavour is to participate in the huge opportunity of mid income and affordable housing in the country. We are committed to partnering with developers who are aligned with our vision and values,"" Deepak Parekh, chairman, HDFC Ltd said in a statement"

329,2019-03-22,Mahindra Mahindra,"DSP MF has made it mandatory for its staff to make new investments in own schemes onlyThe firm believes that its staffs must walk the talk on the advice given to the investors to avoid investing directly in the asset classes, and instead use the scheme of DSP MF as an investment vehicle

In a move that the fund house has described as ‘eating the same food that we serve to our customers and build complete skin in the game’, DSP Investment Managers Pvt. Ltd (DSPIM) has prohibited employees from making any direct investments in shares, bonds, debentures and derivatives of a company and made it mandatory for its employees to make any incremental investments only in the schemes of DSP Mutual Fund.
“It demonstrates conviction in our own funds and takes away the distractions that come with owning a direct portfolio that has a different volatility profile,"" said Kalpen Parekh, president, DSP Investment Managers Pvt. Ltd. “We are in a fiduciary business and we espouse mutual funds as the most efficient way to invest. When we dissuade investors from investing directly in an asset class, then as people who are in the responsible position of dealing with people’s hard earned money, we need to walk the talk—not just in letter but also in spirit,"" he added.
Existing investments of the employees, whether in mutual funds or other securities, may continue. Any systematic investment plans already registered may also continue. However, switch-out of such investments or any change in such systematic registrations are not permitted. Employees can make investments in third-party mutual funds schemes in categories where DSP Mutual Fund currently does not offer a product. While employees are not allowed to make any additional investment in securities, they can invest in initial public offerings and follow-on public offerings. Investments in fixed deposits, insurance policies, public provident fund and postal saving schemes are exempt from this directive.
Parekh says that it is important to demonstrate reasonable skin in the game. “If our design and execution of product and the fund management is right, then as investors, we will also benefit,"" he said.
DSPIM is not the first to come out with such restrictions. In 2015, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. Ltd initiated this policy for its own investors. When we asked Nilesh Shah, managing director of the company, on how that policy had fared, he said, “We structured it as a voluntary pledge. When we started this initiative, we were a small company looking to grow big. That brought people together. Now, we have grown significantly over the last four years and growth has been faster than the industry. Despite this, people who have come in later have also been willing to take the pledge. So they must be seeing some value in it.""
But how will employees feel about staying tied to a scheme that is doing poorly? “Our funds’ performance has been in line with others in the industry. If performance was bad, it may have been difficult to retain the employees on the pledge,"" said Shah.
“There may be points in time when the funds don’t do well and our money faces the same pain that the investors face. We made it mandatory for employees to make incremental investments only in our own schemes so that there is no easy route out, and to force ourselves to constantly strengthen our platform and create value for all the investors,"" said Parekh.
PPFAS Asset Management Co. Ltd, another early convert to this philosophy, has a different take on this. “We encourage our employees to invest in the fund so that they are better equipped to handle the queries and give advice. At no stage is anyone forced to do it,"" said Neil Parag Parikh, chairman and CEO, PPFAS AMC Ltd. They have taken it a step further and made the information on employee holdings available on their website and it is updated every month. “This transparency builds the confidence of the unitholders where they can track the investment activities of key employees,"" said Parikh. Currently, 7.5% of the flagship scheme, Parag Parikh Long Term Equity fund, is held by its employees. But he does not believe that making this exercise mandatory is the right way to go. “We have only two offerings—a liquid fund and an equity fund—and it may not fit into the employee’s needs. The decision to invest has to be made keeping in mind the asset allocation and risk-taking ability of the individual,"" said Parikh.
Others have also raised concerns on the legality of such a move that restricts the employee’s choice. “Such policies could be questioned as being coercive and more importantly could be seen as reflective of trust deficit that the organization has on its own products. However, the situation would differ if the employees are incentivised (by way of beneficial conditions) while investing in the products offered by their employer,"" said Nitin Sharma, legal head in a large multinational company.
“Policies containing restrictive covenants like these could run afoul of the law of the land, including the rights granted under the Constitution. Further, restricting employees to investing only in investment products of their employing entity may also have to be assessed from the standpoint of insider trading regulations and any sector-specific legal requirements (by the Securities and Exchange Board of India), if any,"" he added.
But Kalpen Parekh believes that it will lead to self-selection for the company. “The right talent that believes in this ideology will find us as a great place to work at and see that the intent is to make sure that the best ideas come into the funds’ portfolios for the advantage of all investors instead of personal portfolios. If we are advocating the DSP funds to our investors, then it must hold good for us too,"" he said. He believes that this will help maintain the best fiduciary standards in the industry that will reflect well on all who are part of this.
The move by fund houses to demonstrate conviction by putting their money where their mouth is will no doubt bolster investors’ confidence in the schemes. But investors should stay with an evaluation process that would identify the scheme that is best aligned to their needs and risk preference, and use any information on employees’ holdings in the scheme as one more data point to consider while making an investment or exit decision in a scheme."
328,2019-03-26,Mahindra Mahindra,"Fortis, which owns 57% stake in SRL Diagnostics, is in the process of hiring Kotak Mahindra Bank to manage the stake salesOne of the key parts of the IHH-Fortis deal was to provide exits to private equity investors in SRL Diagnostics

New Delhi: Fortis Healthcare Ltd is facilitating the sale of stakes owned by private equity investors in its SRL Diagnostics unit, two people aware of the matter said. Fortis, which owns 57% in SRL Diagnostics, is in the process of hiring Kotak Mahindra Bank as an investment banker to manage the transaction, one of the two people said on condition of anonymity.
While IHH Healthcare Bhd, the new owner of Fortis, had earlier planned to buy out the private equity firms, the Malaysian company has decided against it because of the legal wrangle between Japanese drug maker Daiichi Sankyo Co. Ltd and the Singh brothers, the founders of Fortis, said the people cited earlier.
Private equity investors Resurgence Fund (7.5%), IFC (7.5%), New York Jacob Ballas Fund (16%) and other shareholders (12%) own around 43% in SRL Diagnostics. “As is normally the process, activities pertaining to the IM (information memorandum) approaching potential interested parties, etc. will play out over the next few months,"" the first person said.
SRL Diagnostics’ revenue growth trailed that of its rivals in the year ended 31 March 2018. While Thyrocare Technologies Ltd and Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd grew revenues by 17.1% and 16%, respectively, SRL’s revenue rose by just 7.4%.
When IHH took over Fortis, one of the key parts of the deal was to provide exits to the private equity investors.
In the face of legal complications that delayed the open offer for Fortis, IHH’s vision to overhaul it seems to have run into rough weather. According to the agreement to acquire control of Fortis, IHH’s fund infusion was also to be used to buy out the stake of private equity players in SRL Diagnostics.
“The dialogue on SRL didn’t materalize. However, the window is still open. IHH can jump in at any time,"" said the second person, requesting anonymity. Fortis has an obligation to provide an exit to the private equity investors, according to the terms of the investment contract.
An IHH spokesperson declined to comment on what he termed as market speculation. Emails sent to SRL Diagnostics and Fortis remained unswered till publishing of this story.
In July 2018, IHH Healthcare won a bidding war to acquire Fortis and completed the deal in November, buying a 31.1% stake through preferential allotment of shares. To stabilize the business, IHH infused  ₹4,000 crore into Fortis, but an additional  ₹3,400 crore put into an escrow account to initiate an open offer is stuck due to a Supreme Court-ordered status quo on the IHH-Fortis deal in December.
The Supreme Court had put on hold the IHH-Fortis deal, ordering a status quo with regard to sale following a contempt plea moved by Daiichi Sankyo against the Singh brothers, the former promoters of Fortis and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd."
327,2019-03-28,Mahindra Mahindra,"A normal monsoon this year may fuel demand for FY20 by at least 6-8%, translating into 12-14% CAGR between FY17 and FY20Historically, a growth cycle that lasts 3-4 years is a result of good monsoon, alongside measures such as farm loan waivers

Rural distress notwithstanding, tractor sales are set for double-digit growth for the third straight year. After recording growth of 19% and 22% in FY17 and FY18, respectively, tractor sales are expected to grow by 10-12% in FY19, according to Crisil Research.
A normal monsoon this year may fuel demand for FY20 by at least 6-8%, said the research firm. All of this translates into 12-14% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between FY17 and FY20. Of course, on the back of strong growth in the past three years, it isn’t surprising that growth is expected to come off a bit.
Historically, a growth cycle that lasts 3-4 years is a result of good monsoon, alongside measures such as farm loan waivers. This time, too, farm loans have been waived off across seven states, including Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Besides, “higher tractor financing, better farm profitability for major kharif crops, scarcity of farm labour and use of tractors in construction are driving demand"", added Crisil.
With a good monsoon expected to aid sentiments, replacement demand can get triggered. Analysts say that the 41-50 horsepower segment, which accounts for half the tractor market, will lead demand expansion."

324,2019-03-31,Mahindra Mahindra,"RBI had asked the bank to cut promoter shareholding to 20 per cent of paid up capital by December 31, 2018As on December 31, 2018, Uday Kotak held 29.72 per cent stake in the bank

Mumbai/New Delhi: Locked in a legal battle with RBI over promoter stake dilution issue, Kotak Mahindra Bank has alleged the regulator is ""unfairly"" creating an impression that the lender was trying to further promoter Uday Kotak's interest.
Countering an affidavit filed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the Bombay High Court, where it has challenged a regulatory directive, Kotak Mahindra Bank said, “The reply unfairly seeks to create an impression that the promoters’ interest is being furthered through the petition and seeks to question the locus standi of the petitioners (the bank) in challenging the Reduction Communications.""
RBI had asked the bank to cut promoter shareholding to 20 per cent of paid up capital by December 31, 2018, and 15 per cent by March 31, 2020.
As on December 31, 2018, Uday Kotak, the bank’s vice chairman and managing director, held 29.72 per cent stake in the bank.
The lender in August 2018 had proposed perpetual non-cumulative preference shares (PNCPS) to cut promoter holding to 19.70 per cent, which the RBI rejected.
The bank has challenged RBI’s contention in the Bombay High Court, which is hearing the matter.
The RBI’s bank licensing rules mandate that a private bank’s promoter will need to pare holding to 40 per cent within three years, 20 per cent within 10 years and to 15 per cent within 15 years.
The RBI has told the Bombay High Court that the bank has petitioned the court, and not the promoters whose shareholding the central bank has asked to be lowered.
The RBI’s decisions seek to regulate the shareholding rights of bank’s promoters, the central bank said.
“They (the promoters) have no issue with holding being regulated in the manner provided for by the RBI,"" the banking regulator had told the Bombay High Court in response to Kotak Mahindra Bank’s petition challenging RBI’s direction to trim promoter shareholding.
In response, Kotak Mahindra Bank has said in an affidavit filed with the court that if that were the case, “the RBI then cannot take any action against the petitioner (the bank) in relation to these matters (i.e. reduction of promoter shareholding)"".
The bank also said that in such a case, the regulator’s series of correspondence over several years with the bank, and not the promoter, becomes questionable.
“The RBI has wrongly addressed correspondence to the petitioner (the bank) over the years, wherein it has also threatened regulatory action,"" the bank said.
If the RBI’s stand that such matters related to or affect the bank’s promoters, then the RBI would have “no basis to initiate any action against the bank"" for not paring promoter shareholding.
Moreover, the bank told the court that RBI’s view “runs contrary to its own allegation that failure to reduce promoter shareholding would result in the bank being serious breach of law"".
The RBI has attempted to “unfairly allege"" that the bank needs to be more independent and not reflect the interest of just one individual or family is “mischievous, incorrect, ignores the high standards of governance of the bank,"" it added.
The bank denied the allegations and what it termed as “insinuations"" and said that “it also belittles the impact of the RBI’s unreasonable and arbitrary position"" on the bank, its shareholders, depositors and public at large.
The bank said reducing promoter shareholding would require to raise a “huge amount of capital not warranted for its business and growth which would be detrimental to all stake holders including the non-promoter shareholders and disruptive to the banking system"".
Any suggestion that the petition “is a device to benefit any vested interests is baseless, misconceived and devoid of any merit"".

323,2019-04-01,Mahindra Mahindra,"RBI had directed the bank to dilute the promoter's shareholding from around 30% to 20% by 2018 Earlier, the bank has requested the court to quash and set aside the RBI directions on equity dilution.  

Mumbai: The Bombay High Court Monday sought an affidavit from the promoters of Kotak Mahindra Bank stating that they have complied with the RBI's directive to dilute the promoter's shareholding.
A division bench of Justices A S Oka and M S Sanklecha was hearing a petition filed by the bank challenging an RBI directive of August 13, 2018.
The RBI had directed the bank to dilute the promoter's shareholding from around 30 per cent to a maximum of 20 per cent of its paid-up voting equity capital by December 31, 2018 and to 15 per cent by March 31, 2020.
The bench on Monday sought to know as to why the bank had approached the court and why the promoters have not challenged the RBI orders.
""The bank cannot be the aggrieved party here. The RBI is not going to take any action against the bank. The aggrieved party is the promoters. Why have they (promoters) not come to court in challenge against the RBI directive?"" Justice Oka said.
""In our view, if the promoters have not challenged the RBI directive, then the RBI is bound and free to take action,"" the court said.
The bank's counsel Darius Khambata on Monday told the court that the promoter share holding of the paid-up capital has been reduced to 19.7 per cent.
The bench, however, noted that such a statement should come from the promoters and not the bank.
""The promoters shall file an affidavit stating this,"" the court directed and posted the petition for hearing on April 22.
The high court had in the past on two hearings refused to grant any interim relief to the bank.
In the petition, the bank sought a widening of the definition of the paid-up equity capital to include the preference shares as well beyond the present equity voting capital.
It also questioned the laws related to capping of the shareholding at a more fundamental level, asking if there is a legal basis to have shareholding caps.
According to the bank's plea, the RBI had initially asked it to only dilute promoter shareholding of its paid-up capital. However, the impugned letter sought dilution of paid-up voting equity capital.
As per the plea, after receiving the letter from RBI, the bank wrote two letters -- one on September 4, 2018 to the RBI and the other on September 24, 2018 to the RBI governor -- seeking clarification, but did not get any reply.
On a previous hearing on December 17, 2018, RBI counsel Venkatesh Dhond had opposed the plea and had said the reason behind asking for promoter stake dilution was to ensure voting power is not in the hands of one single group.
The lender in its petition has termed the RBI's directive as ""arbitrary, without any authority of law and contrary to the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, and Article 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution"".
""Even assuming that the RBI has the power to issue directions requiring reduction of promoter shareholding in banking companies, the said power can only be exercised, and has always been exercised by the RBI, with reference to the petitioner's paid-up capital and not in relation to its paid- up voting equity capital,"" the petitioner has argued.
The bank has requested the court to quash and set aside the RBI directions on equity dilution.
It has also pleaded with the court to declare that the reduction of promoter shareholding should be considered complied with, if it is achieved as a percentage of the paid-up capital and not the paid-up voting equity capital of the bank.

NEW DELHI :
Auto majors Maruti Suzuki India, Hyundai and Mahindra & Mahindra reported single digit sales growth in the financial year ended March 31, as slowdown hit passenger vehicles demand for almost nine months of the year.
Honda Cars India and Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) also reported single digit growth during the last fiscal.

Utility vehicles major Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) reported 2 % increase in passenger vehicle sales to 2,54,701 units as compared with 2,49,505 units in 2017-18.
Overall, the company closed the last fiscal with robust double digit growth of 11 %, despite strong headwinds faced by Indian automotive industry this year, M&M President Rajan Wadhera said.
""This growth has been supported by our three new product launches which have been well received in the market,"" he added.
Honda Cars India posted sales of 1,83,787 units in 2018-19, up 8 % as compared with 1,70,026 units in 2017-18.

321,2019-04-02,Mahindra Mahindra,"Higher oil prices and a weak rupee are among factors that have affected auto sales in India since SeptemberDecision of most auto firms to reduce production in March quarter to trim their inventory seen as affecting sales

New Delhi: Auto sales in India fell in March due to tepid demand in both urban and rural areas. This has led to most of the automakers, including Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, missing their sales growth projections for the just-ended fiscal year.
Maruti Suzuki said on Monday that its total sales in March fell 0.7% year-on-year to 147,613 vehicles.
Sales for the year ended 31 March increased by a modest 6.1% to about 1.75 million vehicles as the company missed its revised forecast of an 8% growth. This is the first time since FY14 that India’s largest passenger vehicle maker has missed its sales forecast.
Vehicle sales in India are counted as factory dispatches, or wholesales, and not retail sales.
Barring its sole light commercial vehicle model, Carry, the Suzuki Motor Corp. unit recorded a 1.5% year-on-year drop in passenger vehicle sales to 145,013 vehicles in March.
Sales at Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd grew 4% to 27,646 vehicles in March helped by the compact sport-utility vehicle, XUV300, which was launched in February.
For the last fiscal year, Mahindra’s passenger vehicle sales grew by a marginal 2% underscoring a sharp contraction in demand in rural regions. The local unit of Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. recorded a 2.2% y-o-y drop in sales in March to 12,818 units.
“We have closed FY19 with robust double-digit growth of 11% at an overall level, despite strong headwinds faced by the Indian automotive industry this year. This growth has been supported by our three new product launches, which have been well received in the market,"" said Rajan Wadhera, president, automotive sector, M&M, referring to the company’s entire product range comprising passenger vehicles, three-wheelers and commercial vehicles.
One of the factors behind the subdued performance is the decision of most of the companies to reduce production in the March quarter to trim their inventory. Higher oil prices and a weaker rupee are among factors which have affected vehicle sales in India since September. Sales during the festive season fell to a five-year low in 2018.
Honda Cars India Ltd, however, bucked the trend as it reported a 27% jump in sales to 17,202 vehicles in March thanks to demand for its compact sedan Amaze. The company also witnessed an 8% increase in sales in the last fiscal year.
Rajesh Goel, senior vice- president and director, sales and marketing at Honda Cars, said strong sales efforts from dealers and the company in a tough market led to the growth.
Mirroring the slowdown in the manufacturing sector and the overall economy, medium and heavy commercial vehicle sales of Tata Motors—India’s top commercial vehicle maker—fell 9% in March to 15,327 vehicles. Such vehicles are used for transporting goods and people.
Overall sales of Tata’s commercial vehicles—combining M&HCV and light commercial vehicles—grew 4% y-o-y to 50,917 units in March. The company recorded a 12% increase in full-year sales to 1,51,105 vehicles.
Ashok Leyland Ltd, the second-largest commercial vehicle maker, also posted a 7% decline in sales of heavy and medium commercial vehicles in March to 15,235 vehicles. For the full-year, sales increased by 13% on the back of robust growth in the fiscal first half. The weak sentiment continued in the two-wheeler segment with market leader Hero MotoCorp Ltd reporting a 20% drop in sales in March to 581,279 units."
317,2019-04-03,Mahindra Mahindra,"At the Digital Innovation Summit, Mint and EY felicitated firms that have leveraged new technologies in their businesses

A subsidiary of RPG Group, KEC International, is one of the leading engineering, procurement and construction companies in India. Its ability to estimate project cost at the time of bidding helped it win projects, deliver margins and mitigate risks. These estimates were based on the analysis of contour maps and physical surveys, which was both time-taking and prone to human errors. After trying out several alternatives, KEC decided to go with autonomous surveys using drones. Once the data was captured, it used image analytics, computer visions, and machine learning models to calculate excavation and backfilling of land. This allowed its bidding team to estimate project costs more accurately and this improved its bid-to-win ratio significantly. In terms of cost savings, the spending on excavation and backfilling quantity was reduced by up to 30%. Now KEC can survey 250 acres in five hours, which earlier took more than five days. This has also allowed it to build a repository of data in digital format for future use.
Internet of Things (IoT): Voltas Ltd
Voltas has seen immense benefits by using IoT to gather data to perform preventive and predictive maintenance of its cooling equipment. Providing services to a fragmented enterprise customer base of 3,500 across 45 locations in the country was proving to be a major challenge for the company. That is when it decided to turn away from a reactive after-sales service, where it had to be informed by the customer of the breakdown, to an I-T-based predictive and preventive maintenance system where all connected Voltas equipment share real-time data with their engineers, allowing them to remotely keep track of the equipment’s health. This not only helped them prevent failures but also ensured customers’ business remained unaffected by breakdowns. According to Voltas, the general turnaround time is 10-12 days, but with the help of IoT, it has managed to bring it down to three days. In terms of cost savings, this has allowed the company to reduce raw material and overhead rationalization by 10% and has led to revenue growth of 15% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) since deployment.
Robotic process automation (RPA): HDFC Bank Ltd
HDFC Bank processes around five million loan applications across multiple locations every year. The average processing time for each loan request was over 45 minutes as everything from application indexing, data entry, document verification and underwriting forward was being done manually. By using RPA, HDFC Bank has automated the data capturing process. Loan processing across all locations is now placed in a centralized server where real-time loan processing status would be visible to all credit administrators. It has also allowed the bank to allocate the cases to credit managers based on the nature of loan, location and eligibility.
This has reduced the turnaround time for processing loan requests by 50%, offering the bank the opportunity to scale up and handle more customers. The tangible benefits of RPA have been the improvement in productivity of data entry staff by 40% and decision-making staff by up to 12%. This has also minimized the scope for manual errors, resulting in better credit quality decisions.
Blockchain: ICICI Bank Ltd
ICICI Bank has emerged as one of the first banks in India to use blockchain for paperless trade process that is safe and secure. The platform is being used for exchange and authentication of overseas transactions and international trade documents. The switch to blockchain has helped the bank reduce the turnaround time of trade cycles, leading to better management of cash flow and inventories. It has also made transactions more transparent as auditing and tracing of blockchain transactions is a lot easier.
The bank hopes this will bring in new asset classes and open up new revenue generation opportunities for it. On a daily basis, the bank is processing all overseas transactions between India and Canada via blockchain. So far, it has processed Canadian $32 million on the platform. Another area where the technology has helped the bank is in trade, which is a paper-intensive process. The bank is looking at how to create a digital letter of credit within 10 minutes.
Augmented reality (AR)/Virtual reality (VR): Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd
In the intermediate commercial vehicles industry, most customers are single vehicle owners or driver owners, who usually rely on feedback or advice of friends and peers when it comes to buying new vehicles, since most original equipment manufacturers in the industry do not provide ownership experiences to them. Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) is using VR to provide individual buyers a more personalized experience.
The automaker’s VR platform provides 360-degree videos of the working of its Furio trucks in real-life environment. It puts the customer in the co-passenger seat while the driver can explain the various features of the truck. It includes a VR headset developed by Procus and a Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro smartphone that comes preloaded with a Furio VR App and mobile device management service.
It is being used for customer/driver meets or local events and during individual customer showroom/office visits. M&M is hoping the use of Furio VR will help improve the conversion ratio of leads to sales and save around  ₹15-30 lakh per dealership."
316,2019-04-03,Mahindra Mahindra,"To act like a digital company, businesses need to think of the entire customer journey and map it, says Bindra

For most of us, immersed in the practice and theory of transforming legacy businesses and companies into digital, digital transformation is a religion that has its own “holy trinity"" of the creator (Brahma), preserver (Vishnu) and destroyer (Shiva), says Jaspreet Bindra, founder of Digital Matters, an advisory firm.
Bindra equates “creator"" with business models, “preserver"" with customer experience and “destroyer"" with people. He adds that business models are like Brahma—difficult to please, and they need a lot of rigour to change.
Bindra likens most traditional or legacy companies to “pipes"". “There is cost at one end, and revenue is realized at the other end. Along the way, value is added in terms of product, branding, distribution and packaging and a value chain is created,"" he explains.
New digitally-enabled business models are the “platform"" models, which have both cost and revenue at each end. Suppliers and consumers are on both sides, are interchangeable, and matched by data and algorithms, according to Bindra. For instance, take the case of Airbnb, an asset-light, data-heavy platform model, as opposed to a Marriott, which is a “pipe"" model. When Marriott announced it would add 30,000 hotel rooms next year, Airbnb co-founder Brian Chesky tweeted by saying that his company would add that in the next two weeks. This kind of scalability is confounding as it means massive disruption of the existing business model, says Bindra.
Traditional businesses need to embrace these disruptive business models, according to Bindra, who cites the example of Trringo, an “Uber for tractors"" set up by the tractors and farm equipment business of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd to rent out the vehicles, as 90% of the time they were lying unused. Or take the instance of General Motors investing in platform models with Lyft, he says. Most legacy companies, cautions Bindra, tend to treat the online and offline worlds differently and have different products, pricing, look and feel for both —so, the online and offline customer experiences are remarkably different. However, “to act like a digital company, businesses have to think of the entire customer journey and map it, figure out delight and pain points in the journey, and use multiple digital interventions to make it more delightful, painless and seamless"", says Bindra.
Moreover, while digitization is about taking, say, a process and making it better, faster and cheaper using digital tools and technologies, digital transformation is a customer-centric value proposition, he adds.
For example, digitizing a service such as Meru cabs will make it run faster, cheaper and more efficiently. However, digitally transforming Meru will mean converting it to (a business model like that of) Uber or Ola—a totally different customer value proposition."

It operates across 10 states and Union territories through a network of more than 380 branches and doorstep centres.
The SFB’s loan portfolio stands at  ₹2,900 crore. It has a deposit base of  ₹1,500 crore.
The fundraise also saw capital infusion from the bank’s promoters and its 13 existing investors, including Sarva Capital, HDFC, IFC, IDFC Bank, Gaja Capital and ASK Pravi.
In 2017, the SFB had raised around  ₹160 crore.
Following the latest round of fundraising, the bank has 20 institutional investors with a healthy mix of institutional investors, development funds and private equity investors.
“In this financial year, the focus will be not just to deliver excellent customer experience, but also to create delight or wow factors for all the segments we cater to, through technological initiatives and innovations. This growth capital comes in just as we start the new financial year and provides us with a strong backing to pursue our business plans,"" said R. Baskar Babu, managing director and chief executive officer, Suryoday SFB.
Suryoday was one of the 10 institutions that had received in-principle approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in September 2015 to start a small finance bank.
The purpose of small finance banks is to expand access to financial services in rural and semi-urban areas. They offer basic banking services, accept deposits and lend to the underserved sections of society, including small businesses, small and marginal farmers, micro and small industries, and entities in the unorganized sector. It had started its banking operations in January 2017.
Many of the larger small finance banks, such as AU Small Finance Bank Ltd, Equitas Holdings Ltd and Ujjivan Financial Services Ltd, have gone public to raise funds.
In June 2017, AU Small Finance Bank had launched a  ₹1,900-crore initial public offering (IPO), while Equitas and Ujjivan went public in April 2016 to raise  ₹2,078 crore and  ₹885 crore, respectively."

Bengaluru: Self-drive car rental platform Zoomcar (ZoomCar India Pvt. Ltd) is in talks to raise around $500 million in a fresh funding round led by automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, said two people aware of the development. The funding round will include a mix of debt and equity financing, the people said, requesting anonymity.
An industry analyst said Zoomcar’s valuation may shoot up close to $1 billion, if at least 40% of the deal is financed through the equity route. Zoomcar was valued at around $170 million when it closed its Series C round in February 2018.
Mahindra is expected to pump in $300-400 million into the company, said the second person mentioned above. Zoomcar’s existing investors from the US are also likely participate in the current round. A large portion of the funding will be used to finance vehicle purchases, added the second person.
The company’s chief executive, Greg Moran, confirmed that the company is looking to raise up to $500 million, but did not disclose the investors.
“Zoomcar is in advanced talks to raise up to $500 million of equity and structured debt from leading global financial investors. The expectation is for fresh investors to lead the round along with participation from existing investors. This transaction will close in the current quarter,"" the company said in response to Mint’s queries. 
Mahindra did not respond to queries till publishing of this story.
Zoomcar was started by American duo Greg Moran and David Back in 2013 in Bengaluru. Back, however, left the firm citing personal reasons in early 2015.
Till date, Zoomcar has raised a little over $100 million from strategic investors. It lets users book vehicles and make payments online. Users need to locate a Zoomcar vehicle lot within their locality to pick up the vehicle. It also offers doorstep delivery of the rented vehicle.
The firm had also launched an associate programme in April 2016, which allowed people to lease their own cars to its platform under a revenue-sharing model.
Zoomcar charges a 25% commission on revenue that its associates make.
Moran told Mint that Zoomcar is targeting to add up to 3 lakh cars on its platform in the next 2-3 years, and plans to achieve around 25 million bookings within the same time period.
It currently has over 7,000 cars on its platform, with an additional 300 electric vehicles. Zoomcar had earlier launched its bicycle sharing operations named PEDL in late 2017 but suspended the operations a year later in December 2018.
Zoomcar reportedly sold a large part of its cycle assets to rival two-wheeler rental startup Bounce.
The firm raised $40 million in a Series C round led by Mahindra in February last year, $24 million in a Series B round in August 2016 led by Ford Smart Mobility, and another $21 million in two tranches between October 2014 and July 2015, from Sequoia Capital, Empire Angels and T.V. Mohandas Pai, among others.
Zoomcar may also become the second most funded startup in the mobility space, just behind its rival Ola if the ongoing deal succeeds. Ola also recently forayed into the car rental business on a pilot basis, and has pledged to invest $500 million into the new category."

Mahindra group chairman Anand Mahindra today said the United States was being hypocritical, a day after space agency NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) termed the space debris generated by the recently conducted Anti-Satellite missile (ASAT) test by India as a 'terrible thing'.
Anand Mahindra tweeted, ""A case of the pot calling the kettle black."" Till now, Mahindra's tweet has been retweeted by 3,100 people and 8,500 have liked it.
On 27 March, India achieved a historic feat by shooting down its own low-orbit satellite with a ground-to-space missile, making the country a space superpower. Only three other countries—the US, Russia and China—have ASAT capabilities.
On Monday, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said India’s move to shoot down of one of its own satellites was a ""terrible thing"" as it created about 400 pieces of orbital debris, according to a PTI report. The NASA chief warned that the risk of debris colliding with the International Space Station (ISS) had risen by 44% since India’s anti-satellite weapon test.
Reacting to Nasa's comment, Anand Mahindra tweeted, ""From a nation that created most of the debris in space over decades, this is an audacious statement....""
A case of the pot calling the kettle black. From a nation that created most of the debris in space over decades, this is an audacious statement.... https://t.co/QFqCnES2gt

BENGALURU :
Real estate developer Gaurs Group has raised  ₹500 crore from Kotak Mahindra Bank, through its subsidiary Kotak Mahindra Prime Ltd, to pace up construction work at Gaur City II, part of integrated township Gaur City and commercial project Gaur City Centre, in Greater Noida West.
This is the second debt transaction by the developer, after it raised  ₹640 crore from PNB Housing Finance Ltd for a housing project and a shopping mall development, earlier in the year.
While Gaur City II is part of the 237-acre integrated township project Gaur City, Gaur City Centre has a shopping mall, multi-level parking and a hospital.
The debt funding comes at a time when non-banking financial companies, or NBFCs, who have been a key source of funding for builders are undergoing a liquidity crisis. Property markets like Delhi-National Capital Region, India’s largest property market, have been impacted the most given the slow sales and because developers need debt to maintain the pace of construction, plan launches or repay loans.
“The investment would be used to pace up the construction at two of our projects in Greater Noida West. We have had a good run since two years and have sold good numbers which has helped us to complete projects within stipulated time. We also have excellent track record and relations with banks which has made us a preferred partner for such big fund deals,"" said Manoj Gaur, managing director, Gaurs Group in a statement.
NCR-based Gaurs Group also said that in March, it has clocked sales of over 600 units. “Kotak is a respected lender in the real estate space. The deal of the magnitude has been possible due to the consistent performance delivered by the Gaurs Group in last several quarters. This deal will cut down financing costs of the group significantly,"" said Vineet Singhal, group chief financial officer, Gaurs Group.
A spokesperson of Kotak Mahindra Group said, “We are extending the debt for development of quality residential and commercial projects. We value borrowers with good track record and who are progressively building organisational capabilities to deliver value to all stakeholders on a sustained basis.""
Gaurs Group is currently developing group housing and commercial projects in Greater Noida West, Siddharth Vihar (Ghaziabad) and Yamuna Expressway. The group has also announced its entry into affordable housing along with its expansion in education and hospitality segments."
313,2019-04-08,Mahindra Mahindra,"As earnings growth remains elusive, analysts said expectations of a full recovery in FY20 will not be pragmaticMeasures initiated by the US and Europe, as also by China, to overcome the economic slowdown are all factors that will be keenly watched

As India prepares for a new government in May, domestic equity markets are expected to be turbulent, but most analysts see growth opportunities in fiscal year (FY) 2020.
However, besides the elections, there are several challenges for India equities in FY20—liquidity condition, stability of the rupee, crude prices, the budget for the fiscal year tabled by the new government and the trade war between China and the US.
At this juncture, recovery in corporate earnings growth is also very crucial for Indian markets. Delay in expected corporate earnings, profitability growth and a fractured mandate by voters in the general elections are major concerns for equity markets in FY20, said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer, equity, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. He, however, expects the market breadth, as well as equity returns, to be better in the fiscal year, as compared to FY19.
Measures initiated by the US and Europe, as also by China, to overcome the economic slowdown are all factors that will be keenly watched by analysts, said Joseph Thomas, head of research, Emkay Wealth Management.
Thomas sees a couple of factors which could be hindrances to markets in FY20. First, liquidity condition in the interbank market is of prime importance, as the deficit is met by the Reserve Bank of India through repos, and open market operations (OMOs). “We need to see the systemic liquidity improving substantially through long-term money for the markets to retain the momentum,"" he added.
Second, any rise in Brent crude prices holds a threat to the economy with its impact on retail inflation and the current account deficit. A third factor is the likely intensity of the shadows of a global slowdown, with China slowing down to all-time lows, and German and French economies contracting, while Italy is still in a recession. Fourth, the government finances will also be one of the factors to be reckoned with. “Large government borrowings, persistent agrarian distress and low levels of employment are also factors which will impact growth and, therefore, earnings,"" Thomas added.
As earnings growth remains elusive, analysts said the expectations of a full recovery in FY20 will not be pragmatic. “As widely expected, 20% earnings growth in this year is a bit far-fetched,"" said Aditya Narain, head of research, institutional equities, Edelweiss Securities. “From consumption perspective, we are beginning to see some pressure, while from the investment cycle we are a bit cautious. As valuations are getting steeper, we see limited upside to the markets till December. Post-elections, we were expecting stimulus both from monetary and fiscal front, but it was done a little ahead of time. The big challenge for the markets will be liquidity.""
Another concern that could be hurting local equities is tapering fund flows. “Domestic money has been a strong support for the market. The return of foreign portfolio investors and persistently strong domestic institutional investor are big positives for the markets, especially on the liquidity front. A slowdown in retail flows, especially into mutual funds, may also be a likely damper,"" said Jinesh Gopani, head of equity, Axis Asset Management Co. Ltd.
Foreign institutional investor money was missing from India for most of FY19. They were net buyers of Indian equities worth $162.29 million in FY19, the lowest in three fiscal years. However, domestic institutional investors (DIIs), including mutual funds and insurance firms, were net buyers of  ₹72,109 crore Indian shares in FY19."
312,2019-04-09,Mahindra Mahindra,"The US carmaker's India unit will transfer most of its current automotive business to the newly created entityUnder the terms of the deal being negotiated, Ford will form a new unit in India in which it will hold a 49% stake, while India's Mahindra will own 51%

Ford Motor Co is nearing a deal with Mahindra & Mahindra to form a new joint-venture company in India, a move that will see the US automaker cease its independent operations in the country, two sources with direct knowledge of the talks told Reuters.
The deal would make Ford the latest automaker to pare back its interests in India. At the end of 2017, General Motors Co downsized its Indian operations and stopped selling cars locally, dealing a blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strategy to encourage domestic manufacturing.
Over two decades, Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford invested more than $2 billion in India but has consistently struggled - it currently has a market share of just 3 percent in India, one of the world's fastest-growing car markets.
Under the terms of the deal being negotiated, Ford will form a new unit in India in which it will hold a 49 percent stake, while Mahindra will own 51 percent, the two sources said.
The US carmaker's Indian unit will transfer most of its current automotive business to the new entity, including its assets and employees, according to one of the sources.
""It's like a partial exit (for Ford from India),"" the source said.
The deal is expected to close within 90 days, the sources said, adding the value of the transaction was not yet clear.
They spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Ford said it does not comment on speculation, but added both companies continue to work together ""to develop avenues of strategic cooperation that help us achieve commercial, manufacturing and business efficiencies"".
Mahindra too said it does not comment on speculation. It said in a statement it was ""working together in identified areas"" with Ford after a 2017 partnership arrangement, and ""will announce further definitive agreements as we progress on some of the other areas.""
Currently, Ford manufactures and sells its cars in India through its wholly-owned subsidiary. In 2017, it formed a strategic alliance with Mahindra under which, among other things, they will build new cars together, including sport-utility vehicles and electric variants.
Ford has been globally restructuring its businesses with an aim to save $11 billion over the next few years. Last month, its Russian joint venture said it would close two assembly plants and an engine factory in Russia, exiting the country's passenger vehicle market.
TOUGH MARKET
India has been a major growth area for global car manufacturers but growth has slowed of late - car sales grew by 3 percent to just over 3.3 million units in the last fiscal year to March 31, compared with 8 percent the previous year.
Even so, India is set to become the world's third-largest car market by 2023 with sales of over 5 million cars annually, according to forecasting firm IHS Markit.
Ford's decision is a stark reminder of how most foreign automakers have struggled to make major inroads in India, a market dominated by players such as Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor Co.
Ford sold close to 93,000 vehicles in India last fiscal year, a far cry from market leader Maruti Suzuki which commands a 51 percent market share and sold more than 1.7 million cars.
Automakers such as Maruti benefit in India from their vast dealership network and an autonomous local team that can quickly react to market changes.
One of the sources said the Ford-Mahindra deal would lead to more affordable Ford cars in the country, as the company would not need to pay any royalty to its global parent, as the Indian unit has to now.
The funds that accrue to Ford's India unit because of the deal will also be used to clear some of its accumulated losses, the two sources said.
Puneet Gupta, associate director at IHS Markit, said the deal would help Ford and Mahindra launch new models at a faster pace and lower development cost, which is critical to success in a price sensitive market like India.
""It's a win-win situation for both,"" Gupta said."
311,2019-04-10,Mahindra Mahindra,"Auto production in FY19 grew by 6.3%, not even half the growth rate clocked in FY18Soft commodity prices will not aid margins due to weak sales and a negative operating leverage

Mumbai: Automobile sales are decelerating, and incentives and discounts are not helping shore up demand. The uncertain outlook and mounting unsold inventory have compelled companies to cut production in the March quarter. The auto sector is thus faced with earnings downgrades for the next two years.
Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, a leading brokerage firm, in its March quarter preview, has cut earnings estimates for FY20 and FY21 for all 8 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that it covers. In contrast to the expectations of a turnaround in fortunes during the March quarter, which typically registers strong numbers for the sector, the net profit of almost all auto companies may witness double-digit declines for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Recent data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) shows that vehicle production in FY19 grew 6.3% year-on-year. This was not even half the growth witnessed in FY18.
The headwinds are strengthening. A truant 2019 monsoon, rampant rural distress led by weak farm income, increasing influence of shared mobility in urban areas, a rise in unemployment and the liquidity crunch are roadblocks to improved consumer sentiment. Pre-election sales of vehicles have also dipped in the past. 
All these point to a weak demand until after the elections.
Therefore, any improvement in sales can be expected only in the second half of FY20, beginning from the festival season, say analysts. There is hope of pre-buying in the March quarter of FY20, just before the BS-VI emission norms kick in. This is likely to substantially increase vehicle costs. Unfortunately, such regulatory changes have coincided with a cyclical downturn that would weigh on demand.
One would have expected some relief in margins on account of softer commodity prices. However, the forthcoming results are not expected to factor much gains. Low sales will translate to low operating leverage, which will weigh on profitability. “Weak demand is bringing in margin pressure from higher customer acquisition costs (marketing), as well as negative operating leverage,"" says IIFL Research.

In the auto sector, two-wheeler makers will feel more pain than commercial and passenger vehicle firms. Also, demand for two-wheelers may take longer to revive because of prolonged weakness in rural demand.
Siam’s outlook for FY20 is not encouraging with single-digit growth estimates in sales across most sub-sectors, except commercial vehicles.
No wonder auto stocks have been hammered on the Street since August, when the first signs of weakening sales were visible.
The Nifty Auto index has shed 33% in a year, widely under-pacing the Nifty 500 index for the first time in a decade. The only silver lining is that the valuations have come off."
310,2019-04-11,Mahindra Mahindra,"Kotak Mahindra AMC, HDFC AMC among mutual funds forced to withhold or roll over FMPs with exposure to the Essel GroupMutual funds have  ₹7,000 crore exposure to Essel Group. The paper in question was backed by shares in Zee

Troubles in the debt market have finally reached the doorsteps of mutual fund investors, with Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. Ltd withholding part of the redemptions from one of its fixed maturity plans (FMP).
The development has attracted the attention of the stock market regulator, which has asked all mutual funds to provide details of debt schemes backed by promoter shares.
Two Essel Group companies in which the FMP had invested had not repaid in full. That forced the asset manager to hold back part of the payments when the plan matured on 8 April.
The redemption clock began ticking in January when the Essel Group companies, to which mutual funds had lent a combined  ₹7,000 crore against debt securities, neared a payment default. The funds agreed not to sell the pledged promoter shares until end-September. In the meantime, Kotak’s FMP—which too had lent to Essel—has come up for redemption, rendering the AMC unable to pay the entire redemption amount.
Lakshmi Iyer, head of fixed income at Kotak AMC, said except for one FMP, the fund had returned “100% of the principal amount"" to investors. “The impact is primarily on the returns. We have kept aside some units with their corresponding net asset value (NAV) and we expect to allow investors to realize these units once the Essel Group companies pay us back, latest by 30 September 2019. We refrained from selling the shares that were collateral for the papers concerned because this would have caused a market panic and wouldn’t have allowed us to realize their full value,"" Iyer said over the phone.
FMPs are close-ended funds with a fixed maturity period. They invest in debt instruments, with maturity matching the tenure of the scheme. In this case, the loan was given against pledged shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, the flagship company of Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group.
Nilesh Shah, managing director of Kotak Mahindra AMC, said that in return for forbearance on selling the collateral against the Essel Group companies’ debt, the AMC has secured additional concessions. “We have taken personal guarantee of Subhash Chandra, the promoter of Essel Group, over and above Zee Entertainment shares for better security. We have also secured upside sharing on a graded basis on stake sale in Zee over and above the coupon rate of the existing debentures,"" he said. The Essel Group has put 50% stake in Zee on the block to raise money and repay debt.
An Essel group statement said: “The lenders have unanimously extended support to the Group and the same has positively resulted in saving the loss of public money. The arrangement with the lenders has also given the Group, the required time to realise the right value from the stake sale of ZEE Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. and has indeed stabilized the stock performance of the mentioned public listed entity.""
Separately, HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd, India’s largest asset manager, on Wednesday extended the maturity of one of its FMPs maturing on 15 April 2019 to 29 April 2020.
“The purpose of rollover or extension is due to current interest rate scenario and portfolio positioning; the yields prevailing in the short-maturity bucket present an option for investors to lock in their investments at current prevailing yields,"" an HDFC AMC statement to investors said.
Typically, in a situation where assets are not realized, AMCs have three options—take a hit on their books, roll over the scheme or mark down the value of security to zero.
Altogether, nine AMCs have lent to Essel Group across 87 schemes, including FMPs and open-ended debt funds. As a percentage of scheme assets, exposure to Essel Group ranges from a negligible amount to as much as 21.01% in Kotak FMP Series 187. Kotak AMC has exposure to Essel Group debt across six FMPs.
Other funds that have exposure to Essel Group debt are SBI Asset Management Co. Ltd, HDFC AMC, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd, Franklin Templeton Asset Management (India) Pvt. Ltd, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Ltd, UTI AMC Ltd, Baroda Asset Management India Ltd and ICICI Prudential AMC.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) was watching the situation closely, said a person aware of the matter.
“Sebi will write to Kotak for an explanation on whether trustee approvals were taken. Sebi has so far not given any opinion on the agreement between the fund houses to not sell the Essel Group securities. But Sebi is concerned and has asked all fund houses to give details of debt schemes, which hold paper backed by promoter shares. The roles of trustees on giving approval to such debt schemes is being monitored very closely,"" said this person.
Kotak AMC’s action and the regulator’s response are likely to lay down a precedent for other mutual funds exposed to bad debt. In December 2018, Sebi had allowed so-called side pockets for mutual funds, to segregate bad debt without affecting the larger scheme.
“This is not a side pocket in the literal sense but more of holding back the securities that were not realized,"" said Kaustubh Belapurkar, manager- research at Morningstar.
Fair valuation norms require all schemes holding other bonds of the defaulting issuer taking a write-down on their holdings; this would impact NAV and returns of those funds, said Arvind Chari, head-fixed income and alternatives at Quantum Advisors Pvt. Ltd."
309,2019-04-11,Mahindra Mahindra,"Two-wheeler inventories have fallen to 45-50 days from 90-100 days in January and FebruaryThe inventory for cars is still in the range of 45-50 days, higher than usual inventory of 30 days

Retail sales of automobiles in India increased 8% sequentially in March to 1.68 million vehicles as companies offered discounts and other incentives to lure buyers and reduce dealer stocks, showed data issued by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) on Wednesday.
Retail sales however fell compared with March last year because of the high base and prevailing weak market sentiments.
Retail sales of two-wheelers rose 10% month-on-month (m-o-m) in March to 1.32 million units, while those for passenger vehicles grew 5% to 242,708 units.
Sales of commercial vehicles grew at a modest 2% m-o-m to 61,896 units amid the prevailing liquidity crunch at non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), which has squeezed financing options for fleet owners.
Retail sales of automobiles started to decline since last September when customer sentiments turned negative as crude oil prices started moving north, and the rupee depreciated against the dollar to an all-time high which impacted returns in the stock markets.
The bankruptcy of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd, meanwhile, led to a liquidity crunch as NBFCs became over cautious in lending. As a result, vehicle sales fell to a six-year low during Diwali and Navratri last year.
With dealer inventories touching record high, companies had to cut production and offer increased benefits or discounts on vehicles to clear stocks.
The average inventory for passenger vehicles is, however, still in the range of 45-50 days, much higher than the inventory of 30 days typically maintained by most manufacturers, according to FADA. Two-wheeler makers managed to halve their inventories to 45-50 days from almost 90-100 days in January and February by enforcing production cuts at factories.
Showroom sales of passenger vehicles dropped 10% from the year-earlier in March, while sales in the two-wheeler segment fell 7%. Retail sales of commercial vehicles fell around 12% from the year earlier in March.
However, FADA, a lobby group for automobile dealers, said it expects customers to resume automobile purchases after the Lok Sabha elections, which conclude on 23 May.
“We at FADA believe that the worst for the automobile industry is now behind us and expect demand to stay at the current level in the months to come. We believe inquiry to conversion ratio to improve with a stable government at the centre and improvement in the liquidity situation,"" said Ashish Harsharaj Kale, president of FADA.
The subdued demand condition prevailing in the market was reflected in the wholesales data issued by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) on Monday.
Factory dispatches of passenger vehicles grew by just 2.7% to 3.37 million units in fiscal year 2019 (FY19)—the slowest since FY14 when sales fell 6%.
Anticipating continued pressure of sales volumes, Siam has projected a growth of around 3-5% in passenger vehicle sales for this fiscal year."

NEW DELHI :
Private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank has cut interest rate on savings account deposits up to  ₹1 lakh. The rate of interest has been lowered to 4.5% from 5% earlier, according to the bank’s website. The revision in interest rate comes into effect from April 15, 2019.
The interest rate on savings account deposits on balance above  ₹1 lakh and up to 1 crore remains unchanged at 6%. Similarly, the interest rate on savings account balance above  ₹1 crore remains steady at 5.5%.
The cut in interest rate on savings account deposits comes in the wake of Reserve Bank of India cutting repo rate by 25 basis points to 6% earlier this month.
SBI, the country’s largest lender, earlier this week revised interest rate of large savings accounts and also cut lending rates.
Starting 1 May, SBI will link savings bank deposits above  ₹1 lakh (275 bps below RBI’s repo rate) and short-term loans like overdraft with RBI’s repo rate in a move to improve interest rate transmission for consumers. So a cut in RBI’s repo rate will bring down the interest rate SBI will offer on savings account deposits above  ₹1 lakh.
From May 1, SBI savings account deposits above  ₹1 lakh will fetch 3.25%. SBI savings bank account customers with balances up to  ₹1 lakh will continue to get 3.5% interest rate."

Mumbai: Mahindra Susten, the renewable business arm of Mahindra group, has launched a formal process to sell around 160 megawatts (MW) of solar assets, two people aware of the development said.
The company offers diversified services within the renewable energy and cleantech space, such as turnkey solar engineering, procurement and construction services, both utility-scale solar and rooftop solar products, solar car charging stations, telecom tower solarization, operations and maintenance.

Emails sent to Mahindra Susten did not elicit any response. Avendus Capital declined to comment.
There are increasing instances of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in the Indian renewable energy space because of falling tariffs and the capital intensive nature of the business, particularly in the initial stage, making availability of low-cost funds critical for the success of a project.

Other M&A deals in the works in the sector include Morgan Stanley’s exit from its wind energy platform Continuum Wind Energy, reported by Mint in January this year.
Fotowatio Renewable Ventures also plans to exit its only investment in the Indian solar power space and Edelweiss Infrastructure Yield Plus Fund is in talks with Engie SA to pick up a significant stake in the French energy firm’s Indian solar business.
Several major M&A deals were struck in the sector last year.

New Delhi: American auto maker Ford Motor Co. and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, the country’s third largest vehicle manufacturer, will jointly develop a mid-sized sports utility vehicle (SUV) for India and other emerging markets, the firms said on Thursday.
The SUV will have a common Mahindra product platform and power train. This will help substantially reduce the cost of development for both companies.
After the two companies came together for the first time in 2017, Mahindra and Ford announced the development of a low displacement petrol engine and a telematics control unit, as part of the connected vehicles project in 2018.
As part of the tie-up, Mahindra dealers are now allowed to open mini showrooms to sell popular Ford cars such as the Ford EcoSport SUV, in regions where the American firm does not have a dealership.
Ford had got into the strategic alliance with Mahindra as it sought to cut costs through restructuring its businesses in markets where it was struggling. In India, the company has been primarily relying on exports, considering that domestic sales volumes had decreased significantly. 
The cost cutting efforts bore fruit with Ford reporting its first net profit in 2017. The plan helped Ford grow its India business from $2.1 billion in 2015-16 to $2.8 billion in 2016-17, and $3.4 billion in FY18.
The Ford partnership gives Mahindra the much-needed technological know-how in developing petrol engines and electric vehicles, besides offering connected solutions for passenger vehicles.
Pawan Goenka, managing director, Mahindra and Mahindra, said after having identified several areas for joint development, both companies continue to work together to develop products using the common products platform. This will also help gain economies of scale for both companies.
“I am happy with the significant progress we have made and synergies we have created since the announcement of our strategic alliance with Ford in 2017. Today’s announcement is another significant step in collaboration between the two companies,"" added Goenka.
According to a joint statement, the Mahindra-Ford partnership is focused on leveraging the benefits of both companies—Ford’s global reach and expertise and Mahindra’s scale and successful operating model in India. 
Both teams continue to collaborate on all areas of mutual interest, including electrification, distribution and product development.
“With today’s announcement we not only strengthen our ongoing partnership with Mahindra, but also sharpen our competitiveness in an important emerging market like India,"" said Jim Farley, president, Ford new businesses, technology and strategy.
“Ford’s technological leadership, combined with Mahindra’s successful operating model and product prowess, will surely help us deliver a vehicle that will meet the expectations of customers in India, as well as other emerging markets,"" he added.
Mahindra is also working on developing an electric version of Ford’s compact sedan Aspire.
In 2017, Ford had said that it was embarking on a decade-long restructuring plan that would cost the Detroit, US-based auto maker $11 billion, as it sought to increase its operational efficiencies across the world.
The announcement came amid prolonged poor performance in markets such as the US and China. The company also launched its ‘emerging mode operating model’ to improve its fortunes in markets like India.
On 5 December, Mint reported that Mahindra had started selling cars manufactured by Ford in India as the two auto makers sought to expand their alliance beyond joint development of vehicles."
302,2019-04-19,Mahindra Mahindra,"Hyundai is already in talks with strategic partners to invest in the development of components for electric vehiclesHyundai is also looking to roll out hybrid vehicles in India whenever the market is ready

New Delhi: South Korean carmaker Hyundai Motor Co. is considering the possibility of manufacturing certain electric vehicle (EV) components in India, besides launching hybrid vehicles here, said a senior company executive on Thursday.
Hyundai Motors is already in talks with strategic partners to invest in the development of components for electric vehicles, and believes that there will be adequate demand for hybrid vehicles.
Apart from offering incentives for electric vehicles, the union government has also announced its support for 10,000 units of hybrid vehicles over the next three years, as part of its Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles (FAME) scheme.
“The procurement division of our parent company is studying the possibility with some of the suppliers for manufacturing components of electric vehicles in India. We also have our hybrid vehicles in South Korea and US, and will bring them to India when the market is ready,"" said Seon Seob Kim, managing director, Hyundai Motor India Ltd.
Kim said the company is looking to launch its first electric vehicle in India in 2019. The vehicle, which will be brought into the country in a complete knock-down (CKD) form, will be assembled in Hyundai’s Chennai plant.
Among leading vehicle manufacturers, only Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Suzuki Motor Co. have announced their plans to develop components such as lithium-ion batteries and electric powertrains in India.
Besides, Hyundai India is looking to challenge Maruti Suzuki India Ltd on its leadership position in the utility vehicle segment, with the introduction of its first sub-four metre compact utility vehicle, Hyundai Venue.
According to Kim, the company will play an important role in expanding the segment and will eye for the leadership position with the Venue and the Creta.
“We will have a meaningful contribution in this segment with this new product and, with the overall SUV (sport utility vehicle) segment growing, we will look to take leadership position. This segment attracts a lot of young customers, and with Hyundai’s entry, this segment will also expand,"" added Kim, who took charge of the Indian subsidiary in December.
As of now, Hyundai sells 9,000-10,000 units of Creta in the domestic market. The company expects to sell another 8,000-10,000 units of the Venue, which will help it compete with the likes of Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza and Mahindra XUV 300.
The compact SUV segment has been the main driver of volume growth in the passenger vehicle segment in India and is being led by Maruti Suzuki’s Vitara Brezza. The Delhi-based manufacturer sells 10,000-11,000 units of the product every month. Others such as Mahindra and Tata Motors Ltd, with the launch of XUV300 and Nexon, respectively, are looking to boost volumes.
Hyundai’s market share in the SUV segment stands at about 13%, while Maruti Suzuki commands around 26% share with the Vitara Brezza and Ertiga.
Apart from electric mobility Hyundai Motor Group is planning to become the biggest mobility solutions service provider in the country with its investment in start-ups such as Revv and Ola Cabs. Hyundai recently launched a subscription-based car leasing service with Revv, while the company will supply electric vehicles to Ola’s fleet in the future as demand for electric vehicles is likely to come from commercial fleet segment."
300,2019-04-21,Mahindra Mahindra,"FMPs are market-linked instruments and are, therefore, exposed to the return and risk characteristics of the underlying bonds in the portfolioInvestors must recognise the risky nature of these products, and fund managers must turn more cautious as FMPs are often sold as replacement for FDs. They aren’t.

In the past few days, two fixed maturity plans (FMPs), from Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. Ltd and HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd, have faced trouble due to their exposure to Essel Group’s debt papers. In one case, investors got most of the payment, but the AMC held back some units until the recovery of money from Essel Group. In the other, the AMC rolled over the FMP for clients who agreed to it. In the coming months, the trouble may spread to FMPs of other fund houses having exposure to Essel Group. Shaikh Zoaib Saleem asked experts which of the two ways is better for investors:
It’s better to book losses and invest elsewhere
Pattabiraman Murari, Founder, FreeFincal
The way AMCs and rating agencies have dealt with the crisis is far from inspiring trust. Should investors exit or opt for roll over if the AMC gives that option? Even if one opts for a rollover and the fund house is able to recover the money, the delay will reduce the yield as the net asset value (NAV) will take weeks or months to recover to its pre-crisis value. I think it would be better for investors to take the loss, get rid of the uncertainty associated with debt recovery and invest elsewhere.
What else can be done to safeguard investors? Risk in a debt mutual fund is inevitable, but it can be compartmentalized. One can have debt funds that invest only in short-term gilts, only in long-term gilts, only in corporate bonds or only PSUs and so on. Such style of purity, especially in FMPs, offers choice. Those seeking higher yields can choose corporate- or PSU-based FMPs. Those who cannot stomach any credit risk can stick to gilt FMPs.
Investors must recognize that FMPs can’t replace FDs
Sandeep Parekh, Partner, Finsec Law Advisors
The mutual fund imbroglio is not as bad as it sounds. Had investments completely soured, the specific scheme would have written off the amount and returned the balance to investors. The deferral is the lesser of two evils. What was likely to be a default situation has been deferred with a higher security cover. There is higher probability of investors getting their money back , but there is no guarantee.
Whether to hold back units, or roll over the payback period, or just take a haircut is a call fund managers and investors must take. None of the options is inherently superior to the other as immediate liquidity must be faced with an immediate haircut, while a deferment is likely to return more money but only in the future. Ultimately, investors must recognise the risky nature of these products, and fund managers must turn more cautious as FMPs are often sold as replacement for fixed deposits (FDs). They aren’t.
Getting back some of the money is the better option
Suresh Sadagopan, Founder, Ladder7 Financial Advisories
The way the two fund houses have handled the problem is slightly different. But, fundamentally, in both the cases, the risk is still very much with the investor. That being said, I would prefer the Kotak AMC way of handling this situation because that would mean that I would have got almost 100% of my money back. If I invested  ₹100 and it has gone up to  ₹127 over a period of time, some money, maybe  ₹20, is stuck, but I still got  ₹107.
The fund houses are expected to do the due diligence, but as a debt fund investor, the risk also belongs to me.
One of the things that’s been said, which I agree with, is that AMCs should not get into the lending business. There is a thin line between direct lending to a business and buying securities. Direct lending involves more due diligence. AMCs are not business consultants and should not get into the business of being part-owners, which has happened in some cases.
FMP investors should get to decide if they want to stay
Vishal Dhawan, Founder, Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors
FMPs are market-linked instruments and are, therefore, exposed to the return and risk characteristics of the underlying bonds in the portfolio.
As they have a maturity date, they are perceived to be similar to bank FDs; also, they offer the benefit of tax arbitrage to investors in higher tax brackets. Thus, a lot of investors tend to use them for specific goals. Any fixed maturity instrument that does not permit liquidity at the point that it was promised could, therefore, create challenges for investors. So it is critical that, irrespective of the underlying performance, investors are able to choose whether they wish to stay or not. Investors who do not need liquidity could decide on the basis of the risk in the underlying security.
Ideally, investors should use open-ended debt funds so that they have more flexibility to make these changes, as underlying security performance, tax laws and needs of liquidity can change over a period."

297,2019-04-24,Mahindra Mahindra,"At least three banks are “under certification” at NPCI for the debit card-based e-mandate systemWhen you take a loan or start an SIP, you permit the lender or the mutual fund company to debit money from your account periodically

Registering a mandate for recurring payments like systematic investment plans (SIPs) and equated monthly instalments (EMIs) will now be easier for customers of Kotak Mahindra Bank. The bank has become the first bank to go live with debit card- as well as netbanking-based electronic mandate, using the National Payments Corp. of India’s (NPCI) new e-mandate platform.
Other banks too are expected to offer this facility soon. At least three banks are “under certification"" at NPCI for the debit card-based e-mandate system, while State Bank of India has completed the certification, but is not live yet. Many other banks are also under certification or have completed it (To see banks’ status click here).
What is an e-mandate?
When you take a loan or start an SIP, you permit the lender or the mutual fund company to debit money from your account periodically. Earlier, this was done through the electronic clearing system (ECS). For the past few years, this is being done through the National Automatic Clearing House (NACH). The mandate or permission is given by filling up and signing a physical form. The company that needs to debit money from your account takes the form to your bank as proof that you have allowed it to withdraw money from your account periodically.
The process became more efficient through e-NACH, where a digital submission and verification was made. Under e-NACH, the maximum time taken for registering the mandate came down to two days from 10-15 days earlier. The e-sign-based e-mandate used Aadhaar-based e-signature to take customers’ authorisation. However, the Supreme Court judgment in September 2018 on Aadhaar declared the portion of Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act that enabled private companies to use Aadhaar for establishing the identity of an individual as unconstitutional. This hit instant e-KYC (know your customer) through Aadhaar, and Aadhaar-based e-signature. Eventually, NPCI decided to suspend e-NACH in November 2018. While the e-sign-based e-mandate was suspended, the older NACH system continued.
Most fintech companies in the lending business were early adopters of the e-sign-based e-mandate as it cut the processing time and the costs. For consumers too, a digital process meant faster service and reduction or elimination of paperwork.
Some banks and mutual funds allowed consumers to use the bill-pay system to make periodic payments like SIPs, which is also a completely digital process. However, that didn’t work for lending companies as they need to pull money from bank accounts based on a contract.
What’s new?
Customers of Kotak Mahindra Bank will now be able to place an e-mandate using their debit cards or netbanking. This would not require Aadhaar-based e-sign to authenticate the identity of the user. Instead, unique debit card details or internet banking credentials will be used.
Once the system is available across major banks, registering an e-mandate for EMIs or SIPs would become a smoother experience for you."

BENGALURU :
Mumbai-based EnKash, owned by Nehat Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd., has raised $3 million in a Series A round from venture capital fund Mayfield India and early-stage investor and accelerator Axilor Ventures.
EnKash is a business-to-business (B2B) payments management and automation platform. The latest investment will be used to enhance its existing technology base and for building a leadership team, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.
Vikram Godse, managing partner, Mayfield, will join Enkash’s board of directors, the company said. Over the last three years, Mayfield India has also invested in other fintech companies such as LendingKart, Upwards Fintech, and M1 Exchange.
Industry experts say the B2B market records annual transaction values of more than $1 trillion globally. EnKash, which enables businesses to process high volume transactions, plans to make a dent in this market by adding support for credit-based payments and payment reconciliation for buyers and suppliers.
Founded in 2017, by Yadvendra Tyagi, Hemant Vishnoi and Naveen Bindal, EnKash connects corporates, vendors and credit providers. The product helps automate the entire process of B2B payments and ease the working capital requirements of suppliers.
It also helps businesses manage their purchase orders and invoices, and enable and track payments to suppliers or from buyers. The company believes that by automating B2B payments, buyers and suppliers can improve their cash flow by receiving advance payments or quick financing options on their invoices.
EnKash is live with banks like Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank and is in advanced discussions with several other financial institutions, it added in its statement.
“Businesses in India have been struggling with manual payment processes for a long time. We are easing B2B payment problems for thousands of businesses today. Along with the partnerships of Mayfield and Axilor, we are bullish about the positive impact that we can have in the buyer/supplier ecosystem,"" said Yadvendra Tyagi, chief executive of EnKash, in a statement.
“Their (Enkash’s) core tech platform solves issues around the dearth of working capital through a payment mechanism, which we believe will create tremendous value for the supplier ecosystem. We are excited to partner with them,"" added Vikram Godse, Managing Partner, Mayfield."
301,2019-04-26,Mahindra Mahindra,"You can earn an interest in the range of 3.5-6% on your savings accounts, depending on the amount and the bankKotak Mahindra Bank has lowered rate of interest on savings account deposits of up to  ₹1 lakh to 4.5%

A savings account is one of the basic financial products that everyone must have. All the major banks including State Bank of India (SBI), Bank Of Baroda (BoB), Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC and ICICI Bank offer their customers several variations of savings accounts. These are just basic savings accounts where you can leave your money and earn an interest in the range of 3.5-6%, depending on the amount and the bank. The interest amount then gets credited to the customer on a quarterly basis, according to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rules.
Here are the savings account interest rates for major Indian banks:
SBI: The State Bank of India, the largest one, offers its customers 3.50% interest rates on savings deposit balance of up to  ₹1 crore. Above  ₹1 crore, the interest rate levied on savings balance is 4% per annum. Following the 25bps reduction in repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 4 April, SBI’s cash credit and overdraft rate will be reduced by 25bps with effect from 1 May. The savings bank rate also stands revised to 3.5% for balances up to  ₹1 lakh and 3.25% for above  ₹1 lakh.
Kotak Mahindra Bank: Private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank has cut the interest rate on savings account deposits of up to  ₹1 lakh. The rate of interest has been lowered to 4.5% from 5% earlier, according to the bank’s website. The revision in interest rate came into effect from 15 April 2019. The interest rate on savings account deposits on balance above  ₹1 lakh and up to  ₹1 crore remains unchanged at 6%. Similarly, the interest rate on savings accounts balance of above  ₹1 crore remains steady at 5.5%.
Bank of Baroda: Bank of Baroda (BoB), which has become the second largest public sector bank after SBI following its amalgamation with Bengaluru-based Vijaya Bank and Mumbai-based Dena Bank, offers an interest rate of 3.50% to 4.00% on savings account.
HDFC Bank: HDFC Bank is offering an interest rate of 3.50% per annum (p.a.) on savings deposit balance below  ₹50 lakh. Above this amount, HDFC levies an interest rate of 4% p.a.
ICICI Bank: ICICI Bank, too like HDFC, gives its customers the same range of interest rates. For account balance below  ₹50 lakh, the interest rate is 3.5% per annum. The interest rate of 4% for savings balance amount over  ₹50 lakh."

Markets are expected to remain volatile this week. Crude oil price fluctuations, rupee movements, corporate earnings and the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rate will drive Indian markets. Share markets will have only three trading days this week with Monday and Wednesday being holidays due to general elections in Mumbai and Maharashtra Day, respectively.
According to Jimeet Modi, founder and CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote, markets are expected to move either 2-3% up or down from current levels.
""Open interest is consistently reducing in the futures market given the already elevated levels and uncertainty over the election outcome. Status quo is expected to be maintained going forward. At the sectoral level, FMCG, capital goods and healthcare are largely expected to move sideways with very little volatility. Realty, mid-caps, auto, metal, power and small-caps are in a corrective mode with further downward pressure going ahead,"" he said.
Major corporates scheduled to announce March quarter results this week are Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tata Power, Hindustan Unilever and Federal Bank among others.
Auto stocks will be in focus this week as automobile companies will declare their monthly sales for April. In March domestic automobile sales were hurt by weak consumer sentiment amid a rise in borrowing costs and increased fuel prices.
The markets will keenly observe fluctuations in crude oil prices. Brent crude has risen nearly 6% this month and could be a major headwind for Indian markets. Crude oil prices could have repercussions on the external sector (including currency), fiscal math, inflation and financial markets.
The Federal Reserve will meet this week to decide on raising rates. It is widely expected that the US central bank will not hike interest rates this time after it killed off rate-rise expectations at its March meeting. The latest Reuters poll all but puts to bed any risk of rates going up this economic cycle, given inflation remains below the Fed’s alarm threshold and unemployment is the lowest in generations.
Another important factor will be the rupee's movement against the dollar. The dollar has zipped to near two-year highs. The euro has tumbled to 22-month lows against the dollar and investors are preparing for worse, buying options to shield against a further downside. Emerging-market currencies are also in pain, with the Turkish lira and Argentine peso both sharply weaker."

294,2019-04-30,Mahindra Mahindra,"Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a 25% growth in net profit in March quarter aided by lower provisionsThe bank has no exposure to troubled Essel Group and Jet, and has negligible exposure to IL&FS

Sometimes, saying no makes all the difference. This is true for Kotak Mahindra Bank, which is reaping the benefits of turning away borrowers who are now a matter of concern for most other lenders.
The richly valued private lender reported a 25% growth in net profit for the March quarter as it did not have to beef up provisions like some of its peers. The bank’s provisions, in fact, fell marginally compared with the previous quarter.
The bank’s gross bad loan ratios rose marginally. However, when future stress is expected to be low, investors are bound to ignore a paltry rise in the bad loan proportion of the loan book.
Kotak Mahindra Bank’s special mention accounts 2 (SMA-2) fell to  ₹138 crore in the fourth quarter from  ₹344 crore in the previous quarter.
SMA-2 accounts are those where the dues have not been cleared for up to 60 days. These are accounts that are most likely to turn bad, as borrowers have only a month to pay back.
What this means is that the lender managed to make some of these borrowers pay up. However, it should be noted that from a year-ago period, SMA-2 has almost doubled.
The private lender has negligible exposure to defaulter Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) as well.
The bank even escaped an exposure to Jet Airways, another pain point for many lenders.
Kotak Mahindra Bank has said no to even the Essel Group. Ironically, the Kotak group’s mutual fund was hit by giving out loans to the Essel Group.
In an interaction with the media after the announcement of results, the bank’s management sounded sanguine on future asset quality and said there is some worry on the bank’s exposure to auto industry given the slowdown there. Big automakers have seen sales drop sharply in fiscal year (FY) 2019 raising concerns over their earnings.
Why then were investors not very enthused about the lender’s performance, given that its stock hardly reacted to the numbers on Tuesday?
A key overhang on the stock is the ongoing legal battle between Kotak Mahindra Bank and the Reserve Bank of India regarding promoter shareholding rules. Both the private lender’s and Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) counsels have made scathing arguments against each other.
Given the next hearing date is a year ahead, the issue is likely to nag investors.
In the light of this tussle with the regulator, analysts believe the stock is richly valued. The share price has gained 12% in the last two months and it now trades at a multiple of nearly five times its estimated book value for FY21.
That makes it the most expensive banking stock to own in town. Perhaps, it’s time now for investors to start saying no."

Mumbai: Banker Uday Kotak Tuesday warned of more liquidity crisis plaguing the financial sector, which is already passing through ""turbulent times"", for the newt two quarters and stressed on the need to have strong balance sheets to withstand difficult times.
The next six months are crucial for the financial sector, Kotak, the executive vice-chairman of Kotak Mahindra Bank said, adding the fear this time is the financial sector impacting both itself as well as the real sector.
Comments come days after smaller rival Yes Bank under a new chief executive warned that up to  ₹10,000 crore of assets existing on its book as standard assets can slip into NPAs and massively provided for the same, resulting in a maiden loss of over  ₹1,500 crore.
""We are in the midst of one of the significant challenges in the financial sector and I think the next few months are crucial in the sense how the financial sector shapes up across various segments,"" he told reporters after announcing the March quarter earnings of the bank wherein it reported a 14 percent growth in net income.
""This is the time when the quality of the balance sheet of financial players gets very crucial...the true test of a financial institution is the balance sheet,"" he added.
Rather than focusing on profits, market should look at the inherent strength of the balance sheet whether it can withstand difficulties, he said.
Kotak said the financial sector was the biggest beneficiary of the note-ban exercise as massive amount of liquidity flowed into banks, insurers and mutual funds. But soon, this money got invested in illiquid assets like land and realty, which was the biggest folly because once liquidity got tighter, exiting such assets has become tough.
He said the issues faced by infra lender IL&FS, which he chairs after its bankruptcy, was the ""first signal"" of the looming crisis. It can be noted that the same has been followed by the troubles faced by promoters who borrowed against pledged shares, especially from mutual funds.
Kotak said banks coming out of NPA pains was also one of the issues which led us into the present situation. ""We need a very strong approach both from the practitioners as well as policymakers to take the financial sector into safer waters from the more turbulent waters.""As a way-out, he said the best solution is more equity infusion into struggling players or consolidation and in the worst case there can be some mortalities as well."

290,2019-05-03,Mahindra Mahindra,"A slowdown in consumption amid a cash crunch in the banking system has left carmakers with a pile of unsold vehiclesPassenger vehicle growth in the financial year ended March was the slowest since 2014

India’s auto stocks have lost $42 billion in value in the last 16 months, and some analysts say the rout may not be over.
A gauge of automobile companies has fallen 30 percent since reaching a record in December 2017, and is the worst-performer among 19 sector indexes in the nation’s equity market this year. That’s as the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index rallied to a fresh peak last month.
A slowdown in consumption amid a cash crunch in the banking system has left carmakers with a pile of unsold vehicles in what was one of the world’s fastest-growing auto market until last year. Little surprise then that Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., Hero MotoCorp Ltd. and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. are among the biggest decliners on the Sensex this year, notching losses of up to 20 percent.
“Initial trends are looking weaker than expected,"" Nomura Holdings Inc. analysts Kapil Singh and Siddhartha Bera wrote in a May 2 note. “Most companies in the sector have further earnings risks due to weaker-than-expected demand.""
Passenger vehicle growth in the financial year ended March was the slowest since 2014, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. Maruti Suzuki, the nation’s largest by market share, slid for seven days through Tuesday after saying April revenue declined 17 percent from the year-ago month.
Only two of the 16 companies on the S&P BSE Auto Index have held their heads above water this year: Tata Motors Ltd., the maker of Jaguar Land Rover, rebounded last month after declining to its lowest level since 2011 in February. Bajaj Auto Ltd. is up 11 percent amid an increase in its sales of two-and-three wheelers for the year ended March by a quarter to 5 million units.
Auto companies that have attractive products, are disciplined in managing their inventories and invest in research and development should still outperform during the slowdown, Pramod Kumar and Anubhav Bajpai, analysts from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. wrote in a report.
But they are still cautious: “We don’t see any relief in the near term.""

288,2019-05-06,Mahindra Mahindra,"The lack of charging infrastructure has also contributed to puny demand for green passenger cars Mahindra Electric discontinued production of its first electric car this month

Dirty air has finally become an issue in Indian election manifestos, along with perennial subjects such as temple-building and farmers’ incomes. That shouldn’t be a surprise: Even politicians can’t escape air pollution, which has reduced life expectancy in areas near the capital New Delhi by more than 12 years.
To address the issue, the government earlier this year laid out a three-year subsidy program for electric vehicles valued at about $1.4 billion — about 10 times larger than a previous plan. There’s just one flaw in this impressive-looking commitment to putting more clean-energy vehicles on the roads: It’s likely to exacerbate rampant theft of electricity.
India is home to over 2 million electric two-wheelers and rickshaws — more than the number of electric cars in China. Sales of such smaller electric vehicles continue to rise. But in the absence of charging infrastructure, many of their drivers have been illegally siphoning power. Only 10 percent of the latest subsidy program is allocated for charging stations.
More than a quarter of all the power India generates is either pilfered for various purposes or lost in transmission, according to figures cited in local media as of mid-2018. The power sector loses more than $16 billion a year to theft — more than any other country in the world.
Power stolen to charge three-wheeler rickshaws costs more than $20 million a year in Delhi alone. There are 100,000 such vehicles on the capital’s roads, and only a quarter are registered. Losses for state electricity retailers rose more than 60 percent in the first nine months of the fiscal year through December.
The lack of charging infrastructure has also contributed to puny demand for green passenger cars. Mahindra Electric, a unit of automaker Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., discontinued production of its first electric car this month. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., the country’s largest carmaker, only recently started making electric vehicles.
Notwithstanding, the government keeps setting itself big goals. Two years ago, India’s plan envisaged a “transformative"" target of making all three-wheeler vehicles electric by 2030. Even under a business-as-usual scenario, it expected 40 percent of personal passenger cars to be battery-electric by then, from zero in 2015. In a report this month, a government planning body lauded the latest subsidy program and said it had the potential to boost penetration rates for electric-vehicle sales to 30 percent for passenger cars, 70 percent for commercial cars, 40 percent for buses and 80 percent for two- and three-wheelers by 2030.
Compare those goals with other countries’ targets and India’s start to look even more unrealistic: China, the world’s largest electric-car market, has been at it for a decade and is still targeting only 20 percent of total sales to be electric or hybrid by 2025.
Here’s the reality: Just having a green subsidy program in place is no longer enough.(1) Sure, it’s a step in the right direction, but as China and other countries are realizing, incentives have to be targeted, adequate and suited to the country’s situation.
Assuming a moderate level of adoption, India needs about $6 billion for charging infrastructure, $4 billion in incentives and a further $7 billion to build out battery capacity, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. That’s a far cry from the enlarged $1.4 billion outlay, with its $140 million for charging. The latest subsidy plan focuses mainly on public transport for rickshaws, cars and buses, and on two-wheelers only for personal usage. That means most of the burden for providing charging stations still falls on the government for now — not home-chargers.
The power-generation capacity just isn’t there to support such a program. Even the highest-income neighborhoods of Delhi have to contend with electricity cuts, let alone rural and lower-income areas. A target of installing almost 3,000 charging stations in major cities and at intervals of 25 kilometers on major highways, as the plan stipulates, seems far-fetched.
Election promises are easy to make on paper. If India’s politicians want to make the air breathable again, they need to give drivers somewhere to plug in.

287,2019-05-07,Mahindra Mahindra,"The used car market has touched the 4 million unit mark in FY 19 which is 1.2 times the new car marketThe used car segment was jolted first in 2016 by demonetisation,  and then by introduction of Goods and Services Tax in 2017

The size of India’s pre-owned or second-hand car market could be between 6.7 million units and 7.2 million units by 2022, with the value of the segment pegged at  ₹50,000 crore, according to a sector outlook released by Mahindra First Choice Wheels Ltd, the pre-used car business of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd.
According to the report, the share of organized retail channels will be around 30%, with the share of unorganized channels likely to continue at 40%. About 30% of customers will continue to buy the product directly from previous owner.
The used car market touched the 4-million-unit mark in FY19 which is 1.2 times the new car market, as sales of the latter remained subdued due to a host of factors like uncertainty before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and liquidity crunch being faced by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).
The used car segment first received a jolt in 2016 largely because of the demonetisation since a chunk of the transactions are cash based, only to be followed by the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 2017, wherein new and used vehicles were taxed equally. In 2018, though, the GST Council reduced taxes imposed on used cars to 12%-18% and removed the levy of additional cess.
The used car market is seeing tail winds following the rationalization of GST to 12-18% and is seeing increased investments across the value chain from procurement to retail, the report noted.
“If one looks at the shift in the market composition in the past decade, one would observe that the organized channel of the pre-owned car market has almost doubled its share from 10% to 18%, from FY11 to FY19. Over the past 4 years, the investment in companies in this sector has also been to the tune of over Rs. 5,000 crore,"" the company noted in a press statement.
Only 17% of the total pre-used cars sold in the market are financed, while the rest of the transaction takes place in cash. In the new car segment almost 85% of the purchases are financed.
According to Ashutosh Pandey, MD and CEO, Mahindra First Choice Wheels Ltd, the evolving consensus seems to be that the winning model in this space is the one that shares three key characteristics – it is transaction-led, full stack (retail and enterprise) and omnichannel (online and offline).
“An interesting, though not unexpected shift is the impact of technology in the consumers’ decision-making process, with price transparency and ease of vehicle discovery creating new ‘trusted’ channels in the pre-owned car ecosystem,"" added Pandey."

New Delhi: Retail sales of motor vehicles fell 8% to 1.64 million units in April from a year earlier as uncertainty over the outcome of general elections and a liquidity squeeze hurt demand, data released by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (Fada) showed.
Retail sales of passenger vehicles, an indicator of urban demand, fell by 2% to 242,457 units from 247,278 units in the year earlier.
The drop in retail sales follows an even faster decline in wholesale dispatches reported by the companies in April. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest automobile maker, reported a 19% drop in sales to 133,704 units, while the second-largest, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, posted a volume decline of 10%. The third largest carmaker, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, reported a 9% drop in vehicle dispatches in April.
Commercial vehicle sales fell 16% to 63,360 units owing to a slowdown in economic activity, lack of availability of finance and slow transmission of interest rate reductions.
The new truck axle norms, which allow trucks to carry more freight, along with a high base effect, also had an adverse impact on retail sales of commercial vehicles.
Fada president Ashish Harsharaj Kale said that inventory has come down from the extremely high levels of January and February, but is still well above the normal 30-day period.
“The near-term outlook continues to be negative with the absence of any immediate positive triggers which could affect retail sales. Despite the subdued retail sales, which are expected to continue for the next 8-12 weeks, we still believe that the outlook for auto retail can soon turn positive if there is a stable government, healthy monsoon and easing of the liquidity situation,"" added Kale.
Increased cost of ownership owing to a hike in insurance cost and subdued demand in the rural and urban areas led to a 9% year-on-year decline in sales of motorcycles and scooters to 1.29 million units in April.

According to a survey conducted by Fada among its members, average inventory with passenger vehicle dealers is still above the 30-day period and ranges between 40 and 45 days, while the same for two-wheelers have come down to 40-45 days from 85-90 days in February. Average stocks of commercial vehicles with dealers are also in the same range.
According to a statement issued by Fada, most of the vehicle categories reported a decline in sales due to the high base effect in the year-earlier period.
Thirty-nine percent of the members of the lobby group are of the opinion that the current liquidity scenario is quite bad for retail business while 47% think the situation is neither negative nor positive, the survey found.
“The liquidity situation has eased for customers compared to what we had experienced since the bankruptcy announcement of IL&FS (Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd) but for the dealers it is still very tough.

283,2019-05-13,Mahindra Mahindra,"The intent to localize key parts and aggregates in a reasonable time frame will benefit all stakeholdersWhile there is a broad agreement, certain deadlines by which manufacturers have to localize specific items may not be feasible to all

MUMBAI :
Top automakers have cheered the government’s recent push to localise manufacturing for hybrid and electric vehicle (xEV) under the revised norms of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles Scheme (FAME 2).
This is in sharp contrast to the several instances over the last decade where auto industry stakeholders have clashed with government agencies on multiple fronts such as dual fuel policy, roll out of CNG stations, vehicular pollution, emission norms, safety mandates, as well as the government’s thrust on biofuels and electrification of vehicles.
Mint had on 7 May reported that the latest draft guidelines on FAME list components such as control units, chargers, and AC units that need to be built locally, with specific deadlines, for manufacturers to qualify for subsidies under a government scheme launched to encourage the adoption of such vehicles.
FAME, which was introduced on 1 April 2015, entered its second phase (FAME 2) in April 2019.
The country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki has already made significant investment in the local xEV supply chain and is setting up an EV battery plant in Gujarat and others are expected to follow suit.
“The intent to localize the key parts and aggregates in a reasonable timeframe will benefit all stakeholders in the long term,"" said Shailesh Chandra, president, electric mobility business and corporate strategy, Tata Motors. “Our team is studying the latest notification to understand its full implications. The government’s approach of defining a PMP (phased manufacturing program) does help bring clarity to the value chain, including the suppliers, to work towards progressive localization,"" he said.
“Tata Motors has a local supplier base available for most of the parts notified under the PMP and is working closely with the identified suppliers to localize the remaining parts,"" he said.
“The PMP under FAME 2 will boost local manufacturing of EV components, including the battery packs, power electronics, and electric motors to be made in India for the world,"" said Mahesh Babu, chief executive officer, Mahindra Electric.
“Our EV strategy is in line with the government’s vision of making India a sustainable EV market,"" said Puneet Anand, senior general manager and group head, marketing, Hyundai Motor India. Mint had reported on 19 April that Hyundai is talking to suppliers to develop EV parts in India.
While there is a broad agreement, certain deadlines by which manufacturers have to localize specific items may not be feasible to all.
“These issues are under discussions with the government and we hope a few alterations will be incorporated,"" said Karthick Athmanathan, head, EV and eMobility solutions, Ashok Leyland. The Chennai-based company said that as part of cost rationalization, aftermarket spare support, and inventory control, it has been engaged with its EV suppliers for the past one year.
Nishant Arya, executive director, JBM Group, also agreed that the move is a positive step towards India’s adoption of EVs but also demands clarity on incentives at the supplier level. “The key requirement here is clarity on incentives on these investments to domestic manufacturers. This shall give them an opportunity to plan and work towards investing in innovation and technology, creating an overall robust ecosystem,"" Arya said.
The incentives under FAME 2 are strictly for localization and not for funding imports, said Vinnie Mehta, director general, Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India. He, however, expects the government to relax deadlines for genuine challenges on a case-by-case basis."

Domestic car sales declined 19.9% to 160,279 units in April, while utility vehicles sales fell 6.6% to 73,854 units during the period, according to the data.
In April, market leader Maruti Suzuki reported a 19% fall in dispatches, while other manufacturers like Hyundai Motor India ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd also reported double digit fall in volumes.
According to Vishnu Mathur, director general, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, some kind of recovery in sales will come only after the general elections are over as consumers resume thinking on discretionary spends.
“Demand in the rural economy is not looking great and it has reflected in the sales of motorcycles which were down by 11.8%. We cannot expect a sudden recovery in sales any time soon,"" added Mathur.

India’s total market capitalization, or the value of all shares traded, has eroded this month after equities went into a tailspin in May because of a slew of factors. Aggregate market cap in dollar terms fell 4.8%, losing $104.7 billion, since the beginning of May, showed Bloomberg data. Among the world’s biggest stock markets, China’s market cap has slipped 5.59%—the most in May so far.
However, in this year so far, China’s market capitalization has jumped 24.28%—the most among the top 10 countries. China’s market capitalization is at $6.68 trillion, much lower than the $31.17 trillion of market topper US.
Last week, India fell two notches to rank ninth in the table with a market capitalization of $2.08 trillion. Canada and Germany were at the seventh and eighth positions, respectively. India is the only one among the top 10 countries by market cap that has not seen any growth in 2019.
In dollar terms, India’s benchmark Sensex index fell 4.6% in this month so far and gained 3.38% in 2019 till date.

In contrast, the contribution of the Sensex to the country’s total market capitalization has grown from 44.87% in January to 46.84% at current levels. The BSE MidCap and SmallCap indices lost 8.51% and 6.15%, respectively, in 2019.
Fear of an escalating trade war between the US and China, uncertainty over the general elections, muted quarterly earnings and slowdown in the economy have rattled investor sentiment, which has dragged stocks in the last few weeks, say analysts. Volatility in Indian markets has also spiked, as the Lok Sabha elections, crude oil prices and global geopolitical developments weighed on equities.
“Another reason for the markets falling now could be due to profit booking, as Indian equities had jumped considerably in the beginning of this year,"" said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer (equity) at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. Ltd.
Upadhyaya thinks once the poll uncertainty is over on 23 May, markets will shift focus on other fundamental issues, such as crude oil prices, state of the economy and earnings. In 2019, crude oil prices have risen 34% but have cooled off this month.
“Election uncertainty has driven markets in the last year with cyclical segments witnessing a significant de-rating despite posting good results and order books. Elections impact returns in the short term, whereas earnings drive returns over the long term. With the election results getting out of the way in May, focus should shift to earnings growth visibility,"" said Anoop Bhaskar, head (equity), IDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd.
Foreign institutional investor (FII) flows continued to be positive in India, whereas domestic institutional investors (DIIs) are still cautious pending the election results. In this year so far, FIIs were net buyers of Indian shares worth $10,093.78 million, while DIIs have sold shares worth  ₹13,368.4 crore

Mahindra Partners, the private equity and corporate investment arm of the Mahindra Group, said on Wednesday that it has acquired a stake in New Delhi-based eye care chain Centre for Sight for  ₹206.5 crore from early investor Matrix Partners, giving Matrix a complete exit.

The non-bank lenders, which have been hit by high borrowing costs and largely shut out from the bond market after the crisis at shadow lender IL&FS Group broke out last year, are facing the risk that more borrowers will be unable to repay their debt as the cash crunch drags on. Oil industry firms, steel producers and mineral companies, all of which rely on NBFCs for funding, are finding it difficult to raise money, Iyer said.
Muted government spending and high election-linked expenditure have created a cash deficit in India’s banking system in the past few months. Authorities are already using open-market debt purchase operations and currency swaps as a “potent liquidity tool,"" but more is needed to get enough cash into the system, Iyer said.
India’s cash deficit, measured by how much lenders need to borrow from the central bank to carry out their operations, is the worst since 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The banking system has experienced a liquidity deficit for all but 10 days so far in 2019, the data show.
Policy makers appear to be aware of the potential risks. The nation’s top bureaucrat for corporate affairs, Injeti Srinivas, warned of an imminent crisis in NBFCs due to over-leveraging and a credit squeeze among other reasons, and those are “a perfect recipe for disaster,"" the Press Trust of India reported.
The troubles have hit borrowers reliant on non-bank lenders for financing, such as property developers. In an industry group letter to India’s finance minister, real estate companies complained that some lenders are delaying loan disbursals and raising interest rates arbitrarily.
There were 10,190 NBFCs operating as of September 2018, and their outstanding loans came to about 20 trillion rupees ($285 billion), according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). That’s around a fifth of the balance sheet of all the nation’s banks.
Iyer thinks there will be consolidation in the sector in the next two to three quarters.
In the meantime, investors should try not to act too much on rumors in a volatile market, as “when that small matchstick will become a forest fire, we don’t know,’’ she said. “The last thing that we want right now is a forest fire.’’"

NEW DELHI :
Majority of India Inc Monday chose not to react to exit polls, giving a second term to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as they await elections results on May 23.
When reached out, major industry chambers Ficci, CII and Assocham declined to comment on the exit polls.
Responding to a tweet by Chief Economist of Mahindra Group Sachchidanand Shukla on what to look forward to this week, group Chairman Anand Mahindra said, ""This week will have only one 'Thing' we'll all be looking out for!"" hinting at the May 23 results.
Apart from the election results, Shukla had listed US Fed's policy meeting on May 22-23, European Parliament Elections on May 23-26 and PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index) numbers for Japan, the US and Eurozone, among the global events to watch out for.
Reacting to the exit polls, industry body PHDCCI President Rajeev Talwar told PTI, ""All of us in India must respect the mandate of the voter. If they deem it fit to give a second term to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, then it is much better than any opinion of anyone else"".
The Indian voter has changed regimes whenever they have felt appropriate. They have also given a repeated term in their own wisdom. Therefore, probably if Modi gets a second term, it is best for the Indian economy, India's prestige and a peaceful Indian society, he said.
""As an industry representative I believe there are a number of reforms which have happened and ones which need to take place. This is a decisive government and the reforms must continue, (if) we are to become a USD 7 trillion economy in the next five years,"" Talwar said.
RPG Enterprises Chairman Harsh Goenka, who is known for his witty and humourous tweets, said that now one thing is sure, ""the next PM's initial starts with 'N'!"".
He also shared a joke from Whatsapp, ""Based on #Exitpolls there will be a STABLE government and no HORSE trading necessary. No wonder, PM's residence is on RACE COURSE Road.""
Brokerage Edelweiss Securities said if the NDA returns to power with a clear majority in line with exit polls, markets would rejoice the policy continuity.
""Besides, NDA is seen to be relatively more fiscally disciplined and less populist in nature, which should augur well for inflationary dynamics,"" it said.
Edelweiss said factors such as the lagged impact of tighter financial conditions, sluggish private capex ahead of various domestic election-related and other external uncertainties and possible slower public capex amid fiscal constraints will weigh on growth outlook ahead.
""We expect only marginal cyclical improvement in growth in FY20 amid easier monetary stance and some consumption led the fiscal push in early FY20. But we see domestic structural overhang and global slowdown concerns constraining significant pick-up in growth,"" it said.
In a report on Monday, Kotak Institutional Equities said, ""we could see a small rally post-May 23 election results if the results are in line with the market's expectations"".

274,2019-05-21,Mahindra Mahindra,"After an exceptionally strong show in Q3, Tech Mahindra’s growth fell off the cliff in Q4Worse still, profit margins fell at a higher-than-expected rate, underscoring cost pressures

After an exceptionally strong performance in the December quarter, things were expected to cool down at Tech Mahindra Ltd. But as it turns out, growth fell off the cliff in the March quarter. Dollar revenues grew just 0.5% on a sequential basis, notably lower than the Street’s estimates. Worse still, profit margins narrowed at a higher-than-expected rate, underscoring cost pressures.
It’s interesting to note that the company’s revenue growth has moderated at a time when its largest business vertical, communications, returned to the growth mode. Revenue at the division, which generates about 41% of overall sales, grew 4.4% on a sequential basis. Growth stood at 4.6% on a year-on-year basis, up from 0.1% in the December quarter. Company-wide growth, on the other hand, slowed to merely 1.9% in the March quarter year-on-year, down from 4.3% in the December quarter.
Evidently, other business segments are performing poorly. Revenue in the enterprise business segment dropped 2.2% on a sequential basis. According to the management, closure and deferment of some projects weighed on revenue in the enterprise business.
The disappointment does not end there. A notable rise in sales and general administration expenses resulted in profit margins moderating by 70 basis points, snapping a long streak of improvement on this front (see chart).
The performance will displease investors. But a 7% fall so far this month vis-à-vis the 5.6% drop in the Nifty IT index, and low valuations, mean the damage may be limited. Tech Mahindra is trading at about 12 times FY21 earnings estimates, a notable discount to tier-I IT firms.
On the positive side, the company continues to see strong order bookings. It signed contracts worth $408 million last quarter. This comes on the back of $440 million in deal wins in the December quarter and $550 million in the three months ended September.
The strong deal wins should help the company deliver good growth in FY20, said the management. “We are encouraged by the revival of the communications business,"" C.P. Gurnani, managing director and chief executive officer, Tech Mahindra, said in a statement.
Though the enterprise business vertical lagged in the March quarter, the hope is that execution of the order book should help it maintain the growth momentum in FY20. Revenue in the non-communication vertical, which largely constitutes the enterprise business, grew 7.9% in FY19.
But as they say, there is many a slip between the cup and the lip. It remains to be seen if orders translate into revenues at a pace investors like. Further, high attrition and elevated expenses can weigh on profitability as well. The Tech Mahindra stock may be cheap, but the narrative around it isn’t compelling."

Indian markets are likely to stay volatile today ahead of the general election results. SGX Nifty trends indicate a positive opening for markets in India. Asian stocks were on shaky ground today, as earlier relief over Washington's temporary relaxation of curbs against China's Huawei Technologies failed to offset deeper worries about trade frictions between the world's two largest economies.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan initially edged up following gains on Wall Street but was last down 0.15%.
The US Commerce Department on Monday granted Huawei Technologies Co Ltd a license to buy US goods until August 19, a move intended to give telecom operators that rely on Huawei time to make other arrangements. The United States blocked Huawei from buying US goods last week, a major escalation in the trade war against China, saying the firm was involved in activities contrary to national security.
Back home, key companies expected to declare March quarter earnings today are Cipla, Bank Of Baroda, IndusInd Bank, Canara Bank, Central Bank Of India, Bajaj Electricals, Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar, and JK Lakshmi Cement.
Shares of Tech Mahindra are likely to be in focus today after reporting a dip in net profit for the quarter ended March 31, hurt by a decline in its margins. Its net profit fell 6% quarter on quarter to  ₹1,132 crore.
Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL) will also be watched out after it announced late Tuesday that it has stopped accepting fresh public deposits and renewals of existing deposits with immediate effect. It also halted pre-mature withdrawals of existing deposits to ""help reorganise its liability management"".
Among currencies, dollar traded at 110.58 yen after popping up to a two-week high of 110.67 against the safe-haven Japanese currency as risk aversion in the broader markets softened. The greenback was also supported as US yields rose in the wake of gains by Wall Street shares.
The euro was little changed at $1.11 after brushing a 2.5-week trough of $1.11. The pound was steady at $1.27. Sterling had sunk to a four-month low of $1.26 on Tuesday on Brexit worries but bounced back after British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed a “new"" Brexit deal.
In commodities, US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 0.59% at $62.76 per barrel after American Petroleum Institute data showed that US crude stockpiles rose unexpectedly last week.

Tech Mahindra shares fell 3% after March-quarter profit dropped 7.4% and missed estimates. Shares of DHFL, one of India's biggest home loan lenders, fell 9%, after it stopped taking new deposits and blocked premature withdrawals following a credit rating downgrade.
However, analysts predict that the markets will quickly discount the election results.

270,2019-05-26,Mahindra Mahindra,"While retail loans like credit cards, personal loans are growing, consumers are concerned about banks not being able to pass on interest rate changes to themShanti Ekambaram, president, consumer banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank, talks about how banks are dealing with consumer issues

While retail loans like credit cards and personal loans are growing, consumers are concerned about banks not being able to pass on interest rate changes to them, especially in a falling interest rate regime. Even the Reserve Bank of India has raised the issue from time to time. Shanti Ekambaram, president, consumer banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank, talks about how banks are dealing with such consumer issues
What are the new trends in the banking space that could be of interest to consumers?
If you look at credit growth, which I think is a key barometer of the economy, in the last few quarters, credit growth from the retail segment has been growing reasonably well. We have seen growth in credit cards and personal loans. Some of these products have grown because of the increase in discretionary spending and aspirational lifestyle values of the younger generation. In the last three-four months, we’ve seen a little bit of slowdown in traditional products like cars, homes and a little in (consumer) durables, which has been different from the trend of the last three to five years. Maybe this is just reflecting on the overall economy.
So I would say credit growth continues to be reasonably good. Some segments are continuing to show a strong trend, while others are showing a slowdown. Digital adoption among customers also continues at a healthy pace.
There has been a sharp growth in unsecured loans. This could be risky if there are defaults. Is that a cause of worry at the bank’s level?
Any lending is subject to economic cycles. Credit cards are no different. Any wholesale lending is dependent on economy, investment and volume growth, among others. Retail will depend on jobs. While job growth may not have been that rapid, there is no loss of employment and that is what is critical. Second, I think for each bank, the percentage of unsecured loans to the total portfolio also matters. For example, at Kotak, it is a small portion of the total portfolio. Our secured lending is much higher than unsecured lending. So I’d say that if there are rapid massive job losses like what you saw in the post Lehman phase, which had an impact on retail and had a contagion effect, if that were to repeat, there could be (impact on retail asset quality). It’s not exactly a worry, but you have to watch the trends. You haven’t seen job losses in the economy, if the economy continues to grow and there are no job losses, we should be okay.
Interest rates are coming down, but there is concern that the cuts are not getting passed on to consumers. This is particularly true for home loans.
Post February, when the first rate cut happened, a lot of banks have been reducing rates which is basically MCLR (marginal cost of lending rate) and transmitting the same to customers. The challenge for banks is that liquidity is always very tight in March. RBI did provide liquidity through the swap windows or through OMOs (open market operations), etc., but if you look at the markets today after two rate cuts and forex swaps, liquidity continues to be tight. One of the reasons is that the government stopped spending because of elections; hopefully it will restart.
Growth in deposits has been slow, because of which banks have not been able to bring down deposit rates significantly. As banks are focused on growing the deposit base because there is credit demand, their ability to lower deposit rates has been marginal. And banks are driven by the cost of funds. So transmission has been happening.
How can this be improved?
Banks are trying to see how they can be more cost-effective in their deposits and this transmission will continue based on how you can lower the cost of your deposits. For example, there has been an increase in the small savings rate. Now banks are competing for deposits with small savings rate. They have not been able to reduce their deposit rate because they need the deposit flow. So that’s really the challenge that banks are facing. If your cost of funds doesn’t go down, your ability to transmit will be more gradual and I think it would continue to be transmitted. I think the factors of liquidity and the ability to reduce deposit rates for cost of funds are important.
SBI has linked its savings account deposits rates with the repo rate. How is the industry perceiving this move? Will people move their money from savings accounts to fixed deposits?
It is interesting but it is still early days. If one third of their savings base is linked with an external rate, over a period of time, it can make a difference to their cost of funds either way, taking it up or down. It remains to be seen whether customers are indifferent. But it will certainly help the bank. If a one-year term deposit is getting 7.3% and your savings account rate is 3.25%, what will you do? Customers look at different products but there is also inertia when it comes to money.
RBI came out with a draft framework for external benchmarking of retail loans and it could not be implemented. What are your thoughts on that?
Conceptually, that is interesting, but practically, banks’ deposits are mostly on a fixed rate and lending mostly on a floating rate. So you have this classic interest rate mismatch. Your deposits are fixed and there is no correlation between them and the money markets. The external benchmark is really linked to the money market. So until this changes structurally, it could pose risks for banks. So the structural deposit side of a bank’s balance sheet has to get closer and closer to market rates. But deposit rates are fixed and they come from very small individuals, while money market rates are determined by more institutional groups. How do you bridge that gap? And when your deposit rates become a little more floating, then you think of external benchmarks. So the difference really is the cost of deposits versus the rates in the money market, which is a wide gap. So to get the whole small consumer base used to a floating rate will take some time. It is a question of adoption.
There has been some stress in debt mutual funds recently. How do you look at it?
As bankers, we have always been lending money. Banks have large credit departments. Before you lend money, your level of due diligence is really deep and wide. Mutual funds, when they take credit exposure, largely go by ratings. They have very thin teams who do not do the kind of due diligence that a bank does. So in an environment that has changed in India, the level of due diligence required has to go up. Then the real question is what are the norms for credit exposure. Banks have very stringent norms for credit exposure. Perhaps some more norms could be needed.
Even individual depositors in some instruments often go by ratings?
It only teaches us that don’t just go by ratings. Read up a few things and understand a bit before you put your money. Every investor, retail or otherwise, perhaps has to increase the level of diligence before putting their money in an instrument. And there is no return without risk. So if you see you are getting a higher return, look closely. Don’t invest in something just because someone told you to. Read and try to understand. If you can’t, ask someone who does. If you don’t get an explanation, be safe in your investments."

In January, SBI’s board of directors approved a plan to raise up to  ₹20,000 crore through various equity and equity-linked instruments, including a QIP.
The state-owned lender, the country’s largest, could launch the deal as early as the next fortnight, according to one of the persons mentioned above.
“SBI was waiting for the elections to get over as political uncertainty is an issue with many investors. The stock has done well since the mandate of the election was announced. They have been talking with investors and they want to launch the transaction soon,"" said this person.
SBI’s stock has seen its value increase by 20.4% since the start of the year. After the results of the general elections were announced on 23 May, it has moved up by more than 5%, data from stock exchanges show.
On Tuesday, the lender’s shares closed the day at  ₹360.40 apiece, down by 0.29% on the BSE, while the benchmark Sensex closed at 39,749.73 points, up 0.17%.
An email sent to SBI enquiring about its QIP plans went unanswered.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, CLSA, Kotak Mahindra Capital, and SBI Capital Markets have been advising the bank on this fundraise, Bloomberg reported in January. HSBC declined to comment, while emails sent to the other advisors did not elicit a response.
The latest QIP from the lender is expected to be slightly larger than its previous fundraise in 2017 from the public markets when it raised  ₹15,000 crore through the largest QIP witnessed in the country.
A large chunk of that QIP was snapped up by the Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC), which accounted for more than 35% of the shares offered in the QIP, while another investor, EuroPacific Growth Fund, subscribed to a little over 10% of the shares on offer, data from stock exchange filings show.
Earlier this month, the bank reported a profit of  ₹838.40 crore for the fourth quarter, missing analysts’ estimates after making hefty provisions to pare bad debt. In the corresponding quarter of the previous year, it posted a loss of  ₹7,718.17 crore.
However, the bank’s asset quality improved during the quarter with new bad loans falling sharply.
The bank classified its exposure of  ₹1,125 crore out of  ₹3,487 crore toward Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) as a non-performing asset (NPA) in this quarter. As a percentage of total loans, gross NPAs stood at 7.53%, compared with 8.71% in the previous three months, and 10.91% in the year-ago quarter.
Net NPAs were at 3.01% in the March quarter against 3.95% in the previous quarter, and 5.73% in the corresponding quarter of last year.
So far this year, three companies have raised a total of  ₹4,382.4 crore through QIPs, while in 2018, 25 companies raised  ₹16,587 crore through the route, data from primary market tracker Prime Database shows.
A QIP is a capital-raising tool through which publicly traded firms can sell securities such as shares and convertible debentures to institutional buyers."

NEW DELHI :
The Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government's new Cabinet will infuse renewed vigour in India's economy with landmark reforms on the back of a decisive mandate as the country aims to become a global economic power house, India Inc said Thursday.
Modi on Thursday sworn in as the prime minister for a second term, heading the National Democratic Alliance government, in the presence of a large gathering of national and international dignitaries.

""Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken care to include experienced leaders with proven ability who have led new initiatives with great success in the past. The addition of new inclusions in the Council of Ministers will help to bring in fresh ideas under the guidance and leadership of the Prime Minister,"" CII President Vikram Kirloskar said.
Tweeting while on his way to attend the ceremony, Mahindra said, ""Bumper to bumper as the sun sets on the way to the PM's swearing in ceremony. But of course it's the dawn of a new government & of new opportunities"".

Mahindra and Mahindra’s fourth quarter performance showed all signs of a slowdown in rural markets with the company’s net profit declining 16% year-on-year to  ₹969 crore, even as India’s farmers are witnessing an erosion in their income, affecting their likelihood to buy tractors.
However, the shares of the country’s biggest tractor maker barely budged on the bourses on Wednesday.
Perhaps, Mahindra’s better than expected operating profit performance has brought cheer.
The company’s Ebitda margin contracted by 160 basis points to 13.5% but was still better than analysts’ expectations. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Brokerage Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd was expecting that figure to be 12.5%. Small wonder then that the stock was hardly hurt by the overall disappointing numbers.
The results announced on Wednesday include performance of the Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturer’s Ltd unit. The subsidiary will merge itself with Mahindra, the company said Wednesday.
Mahindra sold 14.7% less tractors in the fourth quarter than it did a year ago. Revenue from farm equipment services fell 13.7% to  ₹3,206 crore.
The sharp slowdown was expected by investors given the rural distress witnessed over the last one year.
The question is whether this will persist. The growth in tractor business is unlikely to be more than 5% in the current fiscal year if the forecast of a monsoon that is marginally below normal is taken into account, the company said.
The company’s passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles, too, did not shine because of the deceleration in consumption that the auto industry has been battling for many months. However, it did well in comparison to the tractor segment and to some extent compensated for the dismal tractor sales.
Passenger vehicle volumes increased by 7%, while revenue increased by 4.7%.
This was on the back of the launch of new vehicles, including the Mahindra XUV 300—the automaker’s latest offering in the compact sports-utility vehicle segment.
Consumers have tightened their purses in the wake of the liquidity crunch faced by some non-banking financial companies since September. This has affected consumer demand for automobiles in general, including those of Mahindra.
Mahindra shares have as such underperformed the Nifty 100 index in the past one year. The valuations, however, are not demanding. The stock trades at 14 times estimated earnings for financial year 2020, according to Bloomberg. The fortunes of Mahindra—and of its peers—now hinge on how swiftly the government invigorates consumption and resolves the liquidity logjams among non-bank lenders.
Investors are thus likely to be cautious until meaningful signs of demand revival are visible."

MUMBAI :
Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) Ltd said profit after tax dropped 20% in the fourth quarter from  ₹1,059 crore a year ago to  ₹849 crore, driven by falling tractor sales and a sharp rise in costs.
“In Q4, we have done better than market estimates. Reason behind fall in profits is the high base from the corresponding quarter (Q4FY18), which was a great three-month period for us. We will ascribe the rise in costs during Q4FY19 to the new product launches, which are not at mature margins at the moment. It is also accentuated by other costs that are associated with the new launches. Passing the rise in costs to consumers becomes challenging under the given scenario when the market is passing through low demand sentiment. Secondly, the overall tractor industry has declined,"" V.S. Parthasarathy, group chief financial officer, M&M, said.
Net standalone revenue was  ₹14,035 crore, up 5.5% year-on-year (y-o-y), and beat Bloomberg estimates of  ₹13,343 crore. Revenue from automotive and farm segments stood at  ₹10,442 crore (up 13% y-o-y) and  ₹3,206 crore (down 14% y-o-y), respectively.
The combined Q4FY19 results of M&M and Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Ltd (MVML) showed net revenue of  ₹13,808 crore, up 4.70% y-o-y. Its total comprehensive income after tax for the period stood at  ₹962 crore, suggesting a net profit margin of 6.96%, as against  ₹1,156 crore from the year-ago period, when the net profit margin stood at 8.76%.
The company sold 163,937 vehicles (both passenger and commercial), up 5% y-o-y, and 56,903 tractors, down 15% y-o-y, during the quarter.
M&M said overall tractor sales grew 20% y-o-y to 320,594 units during April-August and just 1.2% y-o-y at 466,710 units in the September-March period. Its market share in the domestic tractor segment declined from 42.9% in FY18 to 41.4% in FY19.
Pawan Goenka, managing director, M&M, said five key areas to watch out for in FY20 are: The policies of the new government, availability and cost of finance, monsoon, trade protectionism and sanctions, and the BS-VI transition. “We hope that the new government continues its push in infrastructure, agriculture and other sectors, we are expecting a 25 basis points rate cut to boost market demand and below-normal monsoon. Also, the biggest challenge would be to plan the inventory during the changing emission norms from BS-IV to BS-VI,"" he added.
M&M said it plans to invest  ₹18,000 crore over the next three years, including  ₹12,000 crore for capex and  ₹6,000 crore in subsidiaries.
“We are not slowing down in making new investments across capex and new product development,"" said Goenka, who confirmed that there won’t be any major passenger vehicle launch in FY20 as the company is busy preparing the roll out plan for its BSVI compliant products. “We will start our new product launches in FY21,"" he added.
M&M is investing in expanding production capacity at its plant in Chakan as other manufacturing units including Nashik and Kandivali (Mumbai) are running at full capacity.
“There is no requirement of additional capacity on the tractor side. Our investments in new products over next three years is going to be more than what we had invested in the last 5-6 years,"" Goenka said.
On the electric vehicles front, the company plans to launch the e-KUV by end FY20 and an electric variant of the XUV300 (codenamed S201) in the next 18 months. “We are exploring the (Ford) Aspire car (from Ford alliance) to be made electric under the Mahindra umbrella,"" said Goenka.
He confirmed that the first model under the Mahindra-Ford alliance will be the C-SUV, which is codenamed 605. The launch timeline, however, remains undisclosed."

263,2019-06-02,Mahindra Mahindra,"The MPC headed by RBI Governor will meet for 3 days beginning 3 June to firm up the second bi-monthly monetary policy of the fiscalThe RBI needs to continue lowering interest rates in order to provide a stimulus to the economy, says CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee

New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India may go for another round of rate cut, third in a row, on Thursday to prop up the economic growth which dropped to a five-year low in the final quarter of 2018-19, opined experts.
The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is slated to announce its bi-monthly policy on Thursday amidst Narendra Modi-led government starting its second term. The central bank had cut the short-term lending rate (repo rate) by 25 basis points each in its last two policy reviews. The MPC headed by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das will meet for three days beginning 3 June to firm up the second bi-monthly monetary policy of the fiscal.
 India's largest bank SBI in a recent research report had said that the RBI needs to go in for a larger rate cut, more than 25 basis points, in the next monetary policy review in June to reverse the current slowdown in the economy.
On expectations from the MPC, CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said the RBI needs to continue lowering interest rates in order to provide a stimulus to the economy. ""This is needed to address the slowdown in production and sales across consumer goods categories including segments such as passenger cars, two-wheelers as well as non-durables,"" he said, adding that with inflation still far below the RBI’s target of 4%, there is an ample room for a reduction in the policy rate. 
Shanti Ekambaram, President, Consumer Banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank opined that macro environment was conducive for the RBI to cut rates.""One can expect both liquidity measures and a rate cut. Rate cut expectation ranges from 25 bps to 50 bps,"" she said. 
Without making any judgement on rate cut by the RBI, Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said there has been reduction in policy rate in the last two policies announced since February. It is for the Monetary Policy Committee to take a view on policy rate taking into consideration low inflation and moderation in the economic growth. Inflation continues to be much lower than the target, he said, adding core inflation also now on a decline. 
On the other hand, Karthik Srinivasan, Head, Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA expects the MPC to maintain a status quo in the upcoming meeting.""We expect MPC to adopt a wait and watch approach and look for the fiscal policy announcements during the union budget in July 2019,"" Srinivasan said. India's GDP growth slowed to a five-year low of 5.8% in the fourth quarter of 2018-19 mainly due to poor performance of agriculture and manufacturing sectors."

India’s wealth managers saw a rise in assets under management in 2018, bucking a slowing trend in most of Asia, according to a survey by Asian Private Banker.
The top 20 wealth firms in India expanded their AUM by 18% over the previous year to $193 billion, the report published Monday showed. In contrast, assets at the 20 largest private banks across the whole of Asia fell 3.6% as market turbulence deterred rich clients from deploying their wealth, according to an APB survey in April.
Domestic asset managers continued to expand their hold on the market, accounting for about 78% of the top 20’s AUM last year, versus 64% in 2015, according to the survey.
The wealth management arm of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. retained the top slot in India, boosting assets under management to $33.6 billion, Monday’s report showed. BNP Paribas SA kept its leading position among foreign wealth managers in India with total assets of $13.8 billion last year.
There were a total of 3,564 wealth managers at India’s top 20 firms last year, Asian Private Banker said, yielding an average $54 million of AUM per individual.

After hitting a record high in March, payment transactions via Unified Payments Interface (UPI) declined second time in a row in May. Last month, as many as 733.54 million transactions were clocked across its various platforms, down 6% from April, according to data from National Payments Corp. of India.
Despite a slowdown in volume, value of such transactions continued to expand. Data showed that transactions worth  ₹1.53 lakh crore were made, up 7.3% from April.
During March, transactions hit a record high of 799.54 million worth  ₹1.33 lakh crore, up from 93,000 transactions when it was launched close to three years ago. UPI’s growth has more or less been consistent since then, both in terms of value and volume.
“In case of smaller banks across the country and regional rural banks, the UPI adoption is still happening in a big way and hence we have been witnessing growth in both volumes and value,"" Mandar Agashe, Founder and Vice Chairman of payments solution provider Sarvatra Technologies said. “The existing user base of customers is now opting for higher value and more frequent transactions, instead of smaller value transactions.""
Currently, 143 banks are live on UPI, down from 144 in April.
UPI allows users to transfer money across multiple bank accounts on a real-time basis, without putting out details of the beneficiary’s bank account. Funds can be immediately transferred through one’s mobile phone 24x7 and 365 days, regardless of the bank’s working hours. The payments system was developed by the NPCI, which is an umbrella organisation for all retail payments in the country.
While the pilot was launched in April, 2016, banks started uploading their UPI-enabled apps four months later. UPI gained momentum after Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the UPI-based, Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app, in December 2016, soon after he announced the massive exercise to scrap  ₹500 and  ₹1,000 notes in November 2016.
The growing popularity of UPI can be attributed to its simple, safe, cost-effective and mobile-based payment system. Transactions via UPI have surpassed mobile wallet payments in terms of volume of transactions as well as value.
According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), payment systems such as UPI and Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) are likely to register average annualised growth of over 100% by 2021.
With an aim of a less-cash society, the banking regulator in May announced the vision for payments in India during the three-year time period of 2019-2021, which will enable safe, secure, accessible and affordable payment system. The idea is also to provide more payment options to the population that has been untouched by payment systems. It expects digital transactions to quadruple to 8,707 crore in December 2021 from 2,069 crore in December 2018."

Industry executives on Monday sought tax cuts, lower interest rates and bold reforms in land acquisition and labour laws in a blueprint prepared to aid the Modi administration in adding momentum to economic growth.
Vikram Kirloskar, chairman and managing director of Kirloskar Systems Ltd. and president of industry chamber Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said at a briefing that sharpening the competitiveness of businesses is key to overcoming the risks to economic growth such as protectionist trends in global trade, tighter liquidity conditions at home and abroad and volatile oil prices.
The industry chamber expects the Indian economy to expand at 7-7.4% in 2019-20. Economic growth had slowed down to 5.8% in the March quarter of 2018-19, its lowest pace in five years, Mint reported on 1 June. The Modi government will present its first budget of the second term on 5 July, which will indicate the direction of economic policies India will adopt in the near future.
Industry executives cited the tight liquidity condition as one of the speed breakers to growth. Kirloskar urged the government to explore reducing taxes on the returns that equity investments fetch, whether it is capital gains or dividends distributed by companies, to make such investments more attractive.
“With a landslide electoral victory and new council of ministers in place, we expect the government to engage strongly with industry to ideate and implement impactful policy solutions for double-digit growth, said Kirloskar. A statement from the industry chamber said it has in a pre-budget wish list sought reduction in the corporate tax rate to 25% for all companies and progressively lowering it further to 18% without exemptions. At present, new manufacturing companies and companies with annual sales up to  ₹250 crore are taxed at a concessional rate of 25%.
Uday Kotak, founder and managing director and chief executive officer of Kotak Mahindra Bank and president-designate of CII, who was present on the occasion, explained that equity is getting taxed at multiple levels, which makes savers more comfortable putting their money in debt. “Then you don’t have enough risk capital available in the country for building new businesses or for expanding existing ones,"" said Kotak. He said taxes on equity returns have to be such that these encourage investors to take equity risks."
259,2019-06-03,Mahindra Mahindra,"Will launch the BS-VI diesel vehicle as soon as the BS-VI fuel is available pan India, says MD Pawan GoenkaThe company has also confirmed that it will not upgrade its 1.2 liter diesel engine that currently powers its KUV100 model to BS-VI norms

MUMBAI :
Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) will be ready with BS-VI compliant petrol and diesel vehicles in 3-4 months or by end Q2FY20, Pawan Goenka, MD said today in a knowledge sharing session in Mumbai.
“We would probably launch the BS-VI petrol vehicle as soon as we are ready. However, we will launch the BS-VI diesel vehicle as soon as the BS-VI fuel is available pan India. I assume this would be by either late December or early January (2020),"" said Goenka speaking on the timeline of M&M’s roll out BSVI compliant vehicles.
The company said it has invested more than  ₹1,000 crore in developing new petrol and diesel engine platforms to comply with the BS-VI emission norms, which see implementation from 1 April 2020. M&M, in a presentation, said that it has developed 8 diesel and 8 petrol engines (most petrol engines will be CNG ready) over the past 3.5 years to prepare for the BS-VI mandate. In the process, the company said it filed over 30 patents as it worked with 125 vendors (including 32 technology vendors) developing 1,482 and 543 engine parts for its diesel and petrol powertrain platforms respectively.
According to the company, of the total number of 2,025 parts developed from scratch, 2,005 parts or 99% of all parts are localized, thus falling in line with its expected cost targets. M&M said a team of 700 engineers along with consultants and suppliers on the BS-VI project. While Bosch, AVL and Delphi were the consultants, primary vendors included ZF, Mahle, Bharat Forge, Continental, Magneti Marelli, Valeo, Federal Mogul, Tenneco, Mahindra CIE and others.
“The team work between our engineers, suppliers and our consultants was the best that I have ever seen. All worked like a mission chasing a challenge, which nobody in the world has ever achieved. We have achieved our time targets; cost targets and are also ready with the product well in time so that there is enough time to conduct full validation, which was a major concern initially,"" added Goenka who stressed that the past three-and-half years were the most challenging period for any product development and sourcing organization in the auto industry in India.
Notably, in Europe, the vehicular emissions transitioned from Euro stage-IV to stage-VI in over 10 years.
“It is not about just being ready but managing the transition flawlessly,"" he said emphasizing that M&M has built new development capabilities that now highlight globally competitive petrol engines – an area of expertise that M&M was not known for until 2 years ago.
“One of the major concerns was to develop a portfolio of petrol engines, something that we were lacking in 2016. However, we have a stamp of approval when Ford and SsangYong decided to use Mahinda’s new petrol engine in their vehicles. This means we have managed to develop an engine that is globally competitive,"" Goenka stated.
M&M’s BS-VI compliant petrol engine portfolio comprises G15TGDI (1.5 liter), G12TGDI (1.2 liter turbocharged unit), G12TCMPFI (1.2 liter, 3-cylinder turbocharged unit used in XUV300) and G06 (625cc petrol/CNG for light commercial vehicle application). M&M’s new BSVI petrol engines will power 8 vehicle platforms.
On the other hand, the newly developed BS-VI compliant diesel engine portfolio comprises D25 (2.5 liter for Bolero), mHawk (2.1 liter for XUV500, Scorpio models), 4D15 (1.5 liter for XUV300 and Marazzo) among others. The company said its new BS-VI diesel engines will power 16 vehicle platforms.
The company has confirmed that it will not upgrade its 1.2 liter diesel engine that currently powers its KUV100 model to BS-VI norms. However, Goenka reiterated that 1.5 liter diesel engine will continue to be a good proposition under the BS-VI norms. “The 2–2.2 liter engine segment will largely remain a diesel territory. The penetration of petrol engines in this space will remain small in future,"" he summed up.

You pay only for insurance and after the policy term ends, you don’t get any money back. But on death during the policy term, it pays a huge corpus to the nominees.
Look at the premium (cost of the plan) and the claims settlement record of the insurer.
We list premium rates for some policies of a sum assured of  ₹ 1 crore across three age categories for policy terms of 30, 25 and 20 years. The claims settlement rate is measured by the value of the policies as a lower settlement rate is indicative of high ticket-size policies being rejected."

NEW DELHI :
To develop its Bengaluru based facility into hub for manufacturing electric vehicles, Mahindra Electric Mobilty Ltd – a subsidiary of conglomerate Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd – is in talks with other manufacturers of electric vehicles for supply of parts like electric powertrains and others. The move by the company comes on the back of the union government’s focus on domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles and it related components under the second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles (FAME) scheme.
In the last financial year, Mahindra and Mahindra announced investment to the tune of  ₹1000 crore in Karnataka to develop a facility for manufacturing electric vehicles.
According to Mahesh Babu, chief executive, Mahindra Electric Mobilty Ltd, the company is in talks to some of the global partners and the company’s aim is to make India a manufacturing hub for electric vehicles.
“Mahindra is investing in aggregates like electric motor, battery pack, motor transmission and power dynamics required for developing an electric vehicle. Since the industry is in a very nascent stage Mahindra will supply these parts to other manufacturers as well. We are now gearing up to supply electric powertrains to Ssangyong. The supply will start by early 2020,"" added Babu.
At present, Mahindra Electric is the only automobile manufacturing company to offer both its electric three and four-wheelers to different fleet aggregators.
The union government also wants manufacturers to gradually develop manufacturing capacities for developing electric vehicles to avail the subsidies under the Fame 2 scheme.
“We cannot use government money to use government money to subsidise the imports. We want to make a India a manufacturing hub a  ₹10000 crore has been sanctioned by the government for this purpose. We want to promote electric two and three wheelers an d the cities (STUs) should also make use of the subsidies to use electric busses and clean the environment,"" said Amitabh Kant, Niti Aayog, chief executive, Niti Aayog on the sidelines of a press conference conducted by Mahindra Electric and Blu Smart Mobility.
As the union government is trying to push electric vehicles in public transport, Mahindra is collaborating with different fleet aggregators to supply its vehicles. In one such move the company has decided to collaborate with fleet aggregator Blu Smart Mobility wherein 1500 electric vehicles of Mahindra Electric will be available on the platform by next year.
Mahindra has already announced its collaboration with South Korean lithium-ion battery manufacturing company LG Chem Ltd for manufacturing batteries for electric vehicles in India and this will also help the company increase the localization of batteries – most valuable part of an electric vehicle- in its products in the electric segment.
“L G Chem will supply us the cells and with their collaboration we will set up the manufacturing facility for converting the cells to modules and then to battery packs. The plant will be set up in Chakhan and Mahindra will own the IPR (intellectual property rights),"" added babu
“If, you don’t do this module and packing now, then 100% of the value comes from abroad and when your import cells it is close to 65-70%. The remaining 30-35% will be local value add and that will be a cost saving,"" he said."

To develop its Bengaluru facility into a hub for manufacturing electric vehicles, Mahindra Electric Mobility Ltd (MEM), a unit of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M), is in talks with global manufacturers to sell its locally made components such as electric powertrains.
In 2018-19, M&M had announced investments of  ₹1,000 crore in Karnataka to develop an electric vehicle manufacturing facility.
M&M’s move follows the Union government’s decision to promote domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles and related components under the second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles (FAME) scheme.
According to Mahesh Babu, chief executive, MEM, the company is in talks with some of its global partners. “Mahindra is investing in aggregates like electric motor, battery pack, motor transmission and power dynamics required for developing an electric vehicle.

The supply will start by early 2020,"" added Babu.
At present, Mahindra Electric is the only automobile manufacturing company to offer electric three- and four-wheeler products to fleet aggregators.
The centre also wants companies to gradually develop manufacturing capacities for electric vehicles to avail the subsidies under the Fame-II scheme.
“We cannot use government money to subsidize imports. We want to make India a manufacturing hub and  ₹10,000 crore has been sanctioned by the government for this purpose.

To kick-start the centre’s plan to use electric vehicles in public transport, Mahindra is collaborating with fleet aggregator Blu Smart Mobility. According to the plan, 1,500 electric vehicles made by MEM will be available on Blu Smart’s platform by next year.
Mahindra has already announced its collaboration with South Korean lithium-ion battery manufacturer LG Chem Ltd, which will help the company make the batteries locally.
“LG Chem will supply us the cells and, with their collaboration, we will set up a manufacturing facility for converting the cells to modules, and then to battery packs. The plant will be set up in Chakan, Pune and Mahindra will own the IPR (intellectual property rights),"" added Babu.

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank Friday imposed a penalty of  ₹2 crore on Kotak Mahindra Bank for not complying with its directions regarding dilution of promoters' shareholding in the company.
The private sector lender was directed by RBI to furnish information about details of the shareholding held by its promoters and to submit details of the proposed course of action for complying with the permitted timeline for dilution of promoter shareholding.
""Subsequently, the bank was directed to convey its commitment to achieve the dilution as per the timelines stipulated,"" the RBI said.
However, Kotak Mahindra Bank failed to comply with the directions and a show cause notice was issued to the bank as to why penalty should not be imposed for non-compliance, it added.
""After considering the reply received from the bank, submissions made by the bank during the personal hearing and the documents submitted by it, RBI came to the conclusion that the bank had failed to comply with the directions issued by RBI and decided to impose monetary penalty on the bank,"" the central bank said while imposing a ""monetary penalty of  ₹20 million"".
The action, RBI said, is based on the deficiencies in regulatory compliance and ""is not intended"" to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank.
In a BSE filing Friday, Kotak Mahindra Bank said it is examining the order.
As per RBI's banking licensing norms, a private bank's promoter holding has to be brought down to 40 per cent within three years of operations, 20 per cent within 10 years and 15 per cent within 15 years.
In consonance with RBI norms, Kotak Mahindra Bank last August proposed to issue non-convertible perpetual non-cumulative preference shares to reduce promoter stake to 19.7 per cent, worth  ₹500 crore at  ₹5 apiece, which the RBI shot down arguing that preference shares do not comprise core equity and help promoters retain voting rights.
As a result, the tussle went to Bombay High Court and the matter is still pending with the court.

253,2019-06-11,Mahindra Mahindra,"Zoomcar may look at a share-swap deal, which will allow it to pay existing investors using equity sharesTop investors in both Zoomcar and Drivezy are likely to hold stakes in the merged entity

BENGALURU :
Self-drive car rental company Zoomcar and car and bike rental startup Drivezy are in preliminary talks for an equal merger, three people aware of the matter said.
Zoomcar, which was started by American duo Greg Moran and David Back in 2013 in Bengaluru, is now backed by Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M). Drivezy, launched as JustRide in August 2015, assumed its current brand in July 2017.
Talks are still exploratory and may not culminate in a deal unless lenders to both companies approve the terms of the deal, said two of the three people cited above, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Top investors in both startups are likely to hold stakes in the merged entity, they added.
Financial details of the transaction could not be ascertained. However, one of the three people cited above said, “Zoomcar might look at a share-swap deal, which will allow the company to pay existing shareholders using equity shares, rather than paying the sum entirely in cash"".
Questions emailed to Zoomcar on Friday remained unanswered till press time.
A Drivezy spokesperson said, “We refrain from commenting on this information"".
Mint reported in April that M&M was looking to invest as much as $400 million in Zoomcar. Drivezy is also looking to raise around $400 million and an additional $100 million in debt funding to fuel its expansion across India and a planned US launch, according to a TechCrunch report in April.
Zoomcar is seeking a valuation of $350-500 million while Drivezy is seeking a valuation of $400 million, two people close the development who were briefed on the details of the deal said on condition of anonymity.
Both Zoomcar and Drivezy have raised debt funding in the past and have fixed repayment schedules.
So, any merger deal will need to be vetted by all lenders.
“If both companies are going to merge, the new ownership structure should be comfortable to each and every debt lender... All the assets and liabilities will be put on the table. And they (lenders) will approve any merger only when there is enough money to cover debt and its repayments,"" said the third person cited above.
Zoomcar has raised more than $100 million in debt and equity funding till date.
It currently operates over 7,000 four-wheelers and 300 electric vehicles on its platform. Users can locate Zoomcar vehicles within their vicinity and pick them up.
Drivezy had raised $5 million via an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2018. It later turned to debt funding to grow its fleet of vehicles and set up a special purpose entity to raise and manage debt money.
It has so far raised around $40 million from investors such as Das Capital, Y Combinator and White Unicorn Ventures. It claims to have more than 15,000 bikes and around 3,000 cars on its self-drive rental platform.
The development comes at a time when urban mobility startups in India are shifting focus to last-mile travel, over self-drive rental products to grow their user base.
Last-mile mobility startups are also currently a lucrative investment proposition for several debt and strategic investors in the country when compared to self-drive platforms, since last-mile users exhibit high retention rates, and the market is largely unexplored in India."

Tumbling auto sales in May reinforce the gloom surrounding auto firms. Data released by the Society for Indian Automobile Manufacturers Ltd on Tuesday showed a drop in domestic wholesales numbers across segments. This reinforces a weak demand sentiment in the market, even as it implies high inventory and weaker retail sales.
It looks like passenger vehicles (PV) and medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCVs) were worst hit. Sales in May contracted sharply by 20.6% and 19.7% from the year-ago period in these two segments, higher than 17.1% and 13.6% seen in the month of April. That’s not all. Over the past week, seven out of top ten PV firms have announced prodution cuts for the month of June. If some have called it a routine maintenance shutdown, others have stated their intent to align production with dealer inventory levels.
Media reports indicate that PV leaders such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd in the listed universe along with others such as Skoda Auto and Honda Cars India have had to trim production.
In M&HCVs, the fall was led by Tata Motors’ 38% decline, year on year, while Ashok Leyland sales saw a small single-digit contraction.
According to Arya Sen of Jefferies India Pvt Ltd, two-wheeler sales dropped too, but it was less painful than in the month of April.The delayed marriage season helped to improve motorcycle sales during this period.
Yet, there are concerns of production cuts in two-wheelers too, in the future months. Inventory is over 45 days for most companies. Some analysts reckon that the cost of ownership due to new technological compliances will hurt two-wheeler users the most, unless companies bear the burden of higher costs.
According to dealers, the trend has not improved so far in June. Another bad month will imply a weak June quarter performance by auto firms. As such, the Nifty auto index has been toeing the line of falling sales. It is down 25% in a year compared to the Nifty, which has risen by about 10%."
251,2019-06-11,Mahindra Mahindra,"Sales of passenger vehicles register the steepest decline in nearly 18 yearsTop carmakers such as Maruti Suzuki have been forced to close factories temporarily to reduce stocks

Mumbai: Passenger vehicle sales in India posted the steepest drop in nearly 18 years in May amid weak demand and a liquidity crunch faced by non-bank vehicle financiers, prompting major auto makers to cut production.
Sales fell 20.6% in May to 239,347 vehicles from a year earlier, according to data released on Tuesday by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). It was the biggest fall since a 22% decline in September 2001 and the seventh consecutive drop in monthly domestic passenger vehicle sales. Vehicle sales in India are counted as factory dispatches and not retail sales.
With retail demand staying weak for several months, some of the top carmakers such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd have announced temporary factory closures to trim mounting stocks at their dealerships as well as factories.
In the passenger vehicle segment, car sales fell 26% from the year earlier in May to 147,546 units. Sales of utility vehicles and vans fell 5.6% and 27%, respectively.
The “auto industry has been moving towards inventory correction"", said Vishnu Mathur, director general of Siam. “The industry is investing huge amounts of money in R&D (research and development) for upcoming safety and emission norms,"" he said, pointing to new regulations that will come into force from early next year. These rules are leading companies to alter their business models, with the top carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, announcing that it will stop manufacturing diesel cars from 1 April 2020. Others such as Tata Motors and Mahindra have said that they would upgrade most of their diesel engines to the new Bharat Stage VI emission norms from next April while discontinuing a few diesel vehicles.
In the commercial vehicle category, sales declined 10% from the year earlier in May to 68,847 units. Sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles fell 20% last month, while light commercial vehicles posted a 3.7% drop.
Two-wheelers also continued to stay in negative territory, with demand staying weak in both rural and urban areas.
Total sales of two-wheelers fell 6.7% from the year earlier in May to nearly 1.73 million units. Factory dispatches of motorcycles declined 4.9% in May to 1.16 million units. Scooter sales dropped 7.9% to 511,724 units.
Two-wheeler sales, especially in urban centres, have remained subdued, underscoring overall weak market sentiment and an absence of jobs, coupled with an increase in vehicle insurance premiums.
The three-wheeler segment, too, posted a decline, falling 5.8% last month to 51,650 units.
With lower sales across segments, overall industry sales of automobiles in India declined 8.6% from the year earlier in May to nearly 2.09 million vehicles.
Total automobile production in India declined 8% from the year earlier in May to more than 2.51 million units. This included a 12% cut in passenger vehicle production and a 10.5% cut in production of commercial vehicles.
On the exports front, passenger cars and motorcycles registered growth rates of 8% and 5%, respectively, according to Siam. A total of 48,447 cars and 265,585 motorcycles were exported last month.
“While the wholesale data continues to drop, the dimension of this downturn is now moving beyond the regular reasons such as negative consumer sentiments, fuel price volatility, increased insurance costs and others. It is time when government intervention is required in the form of demand stimulus and tax rationalization,"" said Sugato Sen, deputy director general of Siam.
Sen suggested the government cut the goods and services tax on all vehicle categories to 18% from the current 28%, reduce corporate tax to 25% from 30%, along with reinstating incentives for R&D investments to arrest the downturn in the automobile sector."

MUMBAI :
The real estate sector grappling with liquidity crisis on the back of slow sales and reduced availability of credit, major listed realty players have reported robust sales and increased project launches in FY19, the report said.
Top 10 listed entities, including Ashiana Housing, Brigade Enterprises, DLF, Godrej Properties, Mahindra Lifespace Developers, Oberoi Realty, Prestige Estates Projects, Puravankara, Peninsula Land and Sobha sold nearly 32.19 million sqft, registering a robust 44% growth over the previous year, rating agency Icra said.
Icra's Shubham Jain noted that despite GST related disruptions and the NBFC financing slowdown, these companies have reported healthy sales during last fiscal.
""Home-buyers are increasingly leaning towards developers with an established track record of on-time and quality project completion. Pricing also remains a key driver of purchase decisions. Thus, focused execution, resulting in timely deliveries, and developer emphasis on increasing affordability of residential projects, has supported sales levels for the larger listed players,"" Jain added.
He further said that due to liquidity crunch the sector has been going through a phase of consolidation, with smaller players, who have been finding it difficult to cope with the prevailing market conditions, losing ground to larger, more established players.
According to Icra, sales velocity in FY19 reflects the highest level achieved over the past five years, with strong sales of 10.99 million sqft having been registered in Q4FY19 alone.
Collections also remained high, standing at  ₹16,814 crore during FY19, recording a growth of 13% over FY18, it said.
""In order to capitalise on healthy sales momentum, large listed players have increased the pace of project launches as well, with the same standing at a high 34.32 million sqft during FY19, depicting a robust 62% growth as compared to the previous year,"" Jain said.
In addition to the ramp-up in deliveries, sales momentum for the major listed developers has also been supported by a downtrend in average sales price, driven by increasing developer focus on affordability, the agency said.
The average sales price for the sample set stood at  ₹6,633 per sqft in FY19 as compared to  ₹7,158 per sqft in the previous year, registering a decline of 7.3%.
Consequently, the quarter-to-sell (QTS), which reflects the number of quarters required to sell the available inventory, has seen a declining trend over the past three years.
Icra notes that QTS, has declined to eight quarters in FY19 compared to 10 quarters in FY18 and 14 quarters in FY17.
Jain said that going forward, large organised players with established brands and proven execution ability are expected to continue to benefit from the ongoing consolidation in the residential real estate segment.
""However, headwinds remain in the form of transition to the revised GST structure without availability of input tax credit and overall weakness in demand. Proposals undertaken during the upcoming union budget would remain a key look-out area,"" Jain added."

243,2019-06-23,Mahindra Mahindra,"Every time you make a transaction at an ATM machine that does not belong to your card-issuing bank, it pays an interchange fee to the operator of the ATM you have usedThe card issuing bank pays a fee of  ₹15 for each cash transaction and  ₹5 for each non-cash one

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently set up a committee to review the ATM interchange fee. Every time you make a transaction at an ATM machine that does not belong to your card-issuing bank, it pays an interchange fee to the operator of the ATM you have used. At present, the card issuing bank pays a fee of  ₹15 for each cash transaction and  ₹5 for each non-cash one. While operators have been pushing for a fee hike for some time, citing increased costs, some banks have been resisting the move. The extra cost burden will eventually get passed on to customers. Disha Sanghvi asks experts if a fee hike is inevitable and why.
V Balasubramanian, President - Merchant & Terminal Business, FSS
Rate hike will add more ATMs, promote inclusion
We have been pushing for a hike in interchange rate as new regulatory requirements, coupled with low interchange rates, were making it unfeasible for service providers to deploy or operate ATMs.
We are happy about the recent announcement by RBI about the review of the interchange rate mechanism in the interest of offering better services.
The hike in interchange rate is inevitable for several reasons. First, the significant increase in the cost of operations of ATMs due to the need to comply with various regulations. Second, the acquiring banks will deploy more ATMs if the interchange is increased, as this will make them viable. This will help the industry grow and promote financial inclusion, especially in the digitally-backward, cash-rich rural economy. Third, the Nandan Nilekani report clearly highlights the role of cash and ATMs in promoting digital transactions. In India, there is an immense need for ATMs, especially in tier II-IV cities and rural areas. With interchange rate hike, both banks and white-label ATM operators will deploy more ATMs.
Surinder Chawla, Head, Retail Liabilities and Wealth Management, RBL Bank
Let banks decide how much they want to charge
Financial inclusion and expansion of bank accounts across various strata of society and regions has given an impetus to ATMs and their nationwide distribution through government and private sector initiatives. ATMs will be vital to financial institutions.
There is growing incidence of cyber crimes, and a number of advisories and risk-mitigation inputs from the regulator have been mandated. Banks have invested in securing their ATM networks and customer touchpoints. This has led to reasonably high costs for all stakeholders, including service providers and cash transit agencies, which need to be paid by banks. Also, the pricing of ATM transactions has been static for the last few years.
While the ATM industry is clamouring for an increase in the pricing of ATM transactions to recover costs, it may be time to liberalize this service, like interest rates were freed to let market forces determine pricing. Banks can compete and decide the number of free transactions they want to offer, as well as the pricing, with a maximum cap to be determined by the regulator.
Himanshu Pujara, Regional managing director, Asia Pacific, Euronet Worldwide
More cards are issued than the ATM network can support
RBI’s payment system benchmarking report underlined what industry participants have been saying for years now: that while India is a cash-dependent economy, the per capita ATM coverage is among the lowest in the world. This is a result of low incentives offered to ATM deployers and the disproportionate costs of running the channel.
The recent RBI regulations on various security measures for ATMs and the guidelines of the ministry of home affairs on revised cash loading processes are good for consumers and the industry overall. However, these have led to the penalising of the ATM deploying entity, which is picking up the cost, while certain banks that issue more cards than can be supported by their ATM network continue to enjoy the lower interchange fee established years ago.
For reference, the number of ATMs in the country has grown by 2% over the last 20 months, while banks have issued 120 million new cards in the period. The only way for the ATM industry to continue to survive is by increasing the ATM interchange fee.
Puneet Kapoor, Senior executive vice president, Kotak Mahindra Bank
New mandates will further increase costs for operators
With the ongoing implementation of guidelines issued last year by the ministry of home affairs and RBI’s circular on the mechanism of cash loading in ATMs, the cost of running ATMs is going to increase for both banks and operators.
At present, only the cash that is required for the day is supplemented in the machines, but the new directive says operators must swap out the cassette, or the box that holds the cash, itself. The impact of this change in terms of the cost incurred is being absorbed by banks.
Another mandate announced in the last monetary policy says that all ATM machines need to be grouted to a wall, pillar or floor, in order to enhance the security. This is an expensive exercise. Each of these proposed changes will increase costs.
As these changes get implemented, the viability of running an ATM network will be more compromised. A hike in the ATM interchange fee is desirable because for someone who is running a large network of ATMs, there is a significant cost to be absorbed, even in the current protocol itself."
242,2019-06-23,Mahindra Mahindra,"Used car dealers such as Mahindra First Choice Wheels reported 40-50% growth in FY19The ratio of used-to-new cars has been steady at around 1.2 in the last three years

As new car sales growth chugs in the slow lane, the double-digit growth registered in the used car market raises some pertinent questions. Do used car sales rise during an economic slowdown? Further, does this impact growth in new car sales?
Based on available data, new car sales growth in India was about 3% in FY19. Analysts say the sluggish growth may persist until FY21. However, used car sales dealers, such as Mahindra First Choice Wheels Ltd, recorded 40-50% year-on-year growth in FY19, while the overall market grew 10-12%. At first look, it seems there is an inverse relationship between expansion in the used car market and new car sales, with the former impacting the latter.
But that may not be the case. “While talks of double-digit growth in used car market impacting new car sales have surfaced, our analysis suggest that around 75% of used car trade-ins lead to a new car purchase,"" analysts at JM Financial Services Ltd point out in a recent report on used cars. They add that the ratio of used-to-new cars has been steady at around 1.2 in the last three years. This is far lower than that seen in mature markets, where the average hovers around 2.5.
Also, the ratio rises in developed markets during major downturns. For example, in the US, the used-to-new car ratio hit a high of 3.4 during the global financial crisis of FY08 and FY09, mirroring a decline in new car buyers. Along with the US, the ratio in France and Germany rose during the dot-com bubble burst.
According to Mitul Shah, vice-president (research) at Reliance Securities Ltd, used car sales rise during a slowdown as people even sell the additional car and do not replace it immediately. This impacts the ratio of used-to-new car sales.
However, the stable ratio in India could be for various reasons. The surge in growth seen in Mahindra First Choice Wheels and portals such as Cars24 is due to the shift from unorganized to organized dealers.
Overall sales of used cars may not be growing at the same pace. The IndianBlueBook’s India Pre-owned Car Market Report indicates that organized dealers accounted for 18% of used car sales in FY19, compared to 10% in FY11. IndianBlueBook is a pricing guide for vehicle valuation in India and part of Mahindra First Choice Wheels.
Perhaps, the impact will be more pronounced in the future as the share of organized dealers increases, certification for used cars improves, and the cost and availability of finance for used cars improves.
At present, the rate of interest on used car loans is about 13%. New cars get financed at about 9%. If these dynamics turn in favour of customers, the used car market could start having a larger impact on new car purchases, especially during major downturns."

240,2019-06-24,Mahindra Mahindra,"NBFC is in process of raising $160 mn in overseas loans, could raise another $300 mn via offshore bondsMahindra Finance is looking to tap the overseas markets to raise funds through a mix of loans, bonds

Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services, the non-bank arm of the Mahindra group, is looking to tap the overseas markets to raise at least $460 million through a mix of loans and bonds.
The company had raised $200 million in FY19 through the external ECB route, and is in the process of raising another $160 million in overseas loans, said Ramesh Iyer, vice-chairman and managing director, Mahindra Finance, in an interview.
The lender is also looking to raise another $300 million through offshore bonds and is in the process of obtaining an international credit rating, Iyer added.
“Taking into account Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) yearly automatic route limit of $750 million, we would be left with a headroom of $590 million in FY20. We raised the $200 million at Libor plus 160 basis points (bps) in FY19 and the upcoming one (of $160 million) is expected to be closer to Libor plus 150bps.""
London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) is a key global benchmark for interest rates. One basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Raising money from overseas would let Mahindra Finance diversify its sources of fund raising. It would also let the company tap international funds at a time when local liquidity has dried up.
Mahindra Finance primarily offers financing for purchasing new and pre-owned auto and utility vehicles, tractors, cars, commercial vehicles, construction equipment and for small and medium enterprises.
Simplifying ECB norms in January this year, the RBI allowed all entities eligible for foreign direct investment (FDI) to borrow up to $750 million each year under the automatic route. “All eligible borrowers can raise ECB up to $750 million or equivalent per financial year under auto route,"" according to the central bank’s 16 January notification.
“When you usually go to the bond market, a benchmark deal as expected by the institutional market is of $300 million. Effectively, one can say that whenever we may want to approach this offshore bond market, we will look to raise at least $300 million,"" he said, adding that once it secures the rating for the bond, “the investor can come through any route—dollar-denominated, masala, among others—as we will know which market is right and most attractive"".
The tenor of these instruments could be at least three years and the fully hedged cost would be 5-10bps, lower than the current domestic rates, he said.
Domestic companies raised $2.65 billion through the automatic route in ECBs in April this year, compared to $2.25 billion in the same month last year, RBI data showed.
As on March 2019, Mahindra Finance’s funding was largely from banks, which have a 46.4% share in total funds, followed by insurance and pension funds at 15.8%, and mutual funds (14.4%), among others. On the liquidity drought in the non-bank sector, Iyer said it is not an industry problem, but a player-specific issue.
“See, it originally started as an industry problem as NBFCs were unable to raise money. I think what we have seen in a period of time, maybe, is every lender is now going to player-specific. For instance, we have not had problems raising money.""
Iyer said that if the refinance window is allowed by the central bank, non-banking financing companies (NBFCs) could borrow from the refinancing window against their assets.
“At the NBFC association level, there has been this discussion on how this needs to be structured because there is no single class of NBFCs. I think that is the level of discussion and not about why NBFCs need or do not, it is a discussion on how we create a structure which would work seamlessly,"" he added.
Iyer said while rural demand is slow in the first half of the year, it eventually picks up in the second half due to the onset of the festive season. While footfall at automobile dealerships has been comparatively low this year, he said, the company is not feeling the pressure because it is able to generate 15-20% of its monthly business on its own.
Pre-owned vehicles, he said will be in focus for the company. “Earlier pre-owned vehicle used to be 5-6% of our balance sheet, it moved to 8-10% now and we think it has an ability to become 15% of the balance sheet,"" said Iyer, without giving a time frame.

Nalanda Capital exits Mindtree following Sebi’s notice
Singapore-based Nalanda Capital sold its entire 10.61% stake in Mindtree Ltd to Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) for  ₹ ₹1,707.46 crore in an ongoing open offer for shareholders that closes on June 28, Mint reported. The move, according to two people aware of the development, could have been prompted by the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (Sebi) show-cause notice to Nalanda for pressing Mindtree’s public shareholders to refrain from tendering shares to L&T at  ₹980 per share in the open offer. A third person familiar with the development said another reason behind Nalanda’s move could be the promoters of Mindtree losing control of the board. The stake purchases from Nalanda, mutual funds and some index funds have brought L&T’s shareholding close to 48% in Mindtree, the first person quoted earlier told Mint.

Piramal Capital and Housing Finance may raise up to $400 million through external commercial borrowings (ECBs) to ease liquidity pressure as domestic lenders stay wary of lending to the financial services sector, The Economic Times reported citing two bankers familiar with the matter. Even as the pricing of the two-to-five-year loan has not been finalized, such loans are typically given at a markup or spread of 200-300 basis points over the dollar-linked London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor), dealers told ET, citing past deals. The housing finance firm, with a wholesale book of  ₹51,436 crore, out of which real estate loans account for  ₹40,160 crore, is facing woes of a capital crunch in the real estate market due to its heavy developer loans. The company recently also sold off a 10% stake in Shriram Transport Finance for  ₹2,300 crore, and may also exit his investments of 20% in Shriram Capital and 10% in Shriram City Union.

New Delhi: Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra Wednesday said lowering GST on automobiles would help the economy, stating that the auto industry has a huge multiplier effect on small companies and employment.
In a tweet, Mahindra echoed calls from the auto industry to reduce goods and services tax (GST) on vehicles amid a prolonged sales slump, with passenger vehicle sales recording the steepest decline in nearly 18 years in May when it dropped by over 20 per cent.
""What we're all searching for is the 'Mt. Mandara' which can start the 'Manthan' of the economy & get it spinning faster. I'm biased, of course, but the auto industry is one such 'Mandara'. It has a huge multiplier effect on small companies & on employment. Lowering GST would help,"" he said.
He was responding to a tweet by automotive magazine 'Autocar Professional' in which Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) ex-president John K Paul was quoted as saying that reducing GST on vehicles will kick-start growth again in the Indian auto industry, which is the third-largest employer in the country.
Earlier this month, the Society of Automobile Industry (SIAM) had sought reduction of GST on all vehicles to 18 per cent from the current rate of 28 per cent in the upcoming Budget.
The passenger vehicle (PV) sales declined for a seventh straight month in May to 2,39,347 units against 3,01,238 units in the year-ago month. In fact, barring October last year, when sales were up 1.55 per cent, PV offtake has been in the negative in 10 of the last 11 months.
The dip last month is the worst since September 2001, when sales had dropped by 21.91 per cent.
All major segments, including two-wheelers and commercial vehicles, witnessed a decline in sales in May, SIAM had said.
Vehicle sales across categories registered a decline of 8.62 per cent to 20,86,358 units from 22,83,262 units in May 2018.

234,2019-06-27,Mahindra Mahindra,"Manulife CEO Gori sees the combination of Mahindra’s local market brand with Manulife’s global capability and knowledge as a key stepManulife last week announced a joint venture with India’s Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services, a firm with over 6 million customers

Toronto: Manulife Financial Corp. has done business in Asia for more than a century, but never in India. Now the insurer sees the country becoming a big part of its operations in the region.
“We think that India can be an important part — and quite a significant part — of our business there"" in the next 10 to 20 years, Manulife Chief Executive Officer Roy Gori, 50, said in an interview at the insurer’s Toronto headquarters.
Manulife last week announced a joint venture with India’s Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd., a firm with more than 6 million customers and assets under management in excess of $8.5 billion. India was one of the few countries in the region the insurer had yet to enter.
Manulife’s initial investment is small: Canada’s largest life insurer agreed to invest $35 million in two Mahindra Finance units, according to a 21 June filing with India’s stock exchange. Still, Gori sees the combination of Mahindra’s local market brand with Manulife’s global capability and knowledge as a key step.
“This is just almost perfect chemistry to create a value proposition in the market that will allow us to win and ultimately create value for consumers and ultimately for our shareholders as well,"" Gori said.
While Manulife hasn’t disclosed any key targets for the joint venture, Gori said India is going to figure “quite significantly"" in Manulife’s plans for Asia that could extend into other products and services. “The first phase for us is all about asset management and we want to make sure that we can execute against the opportunity that we’re excited about. Beyond that, we’ll clearly be open to looking at other opportunities.""
Since 1897
Manulife has been in Asia since 1897, when the insurer sold its first policy in the region, in Shanghai. It now has a presence in more than a dozen Asian markets, with more than 11,000 employees and 80,000-plus contracted agents offering insurance, wealth-management products and asset-management services. Manulife’s assets under management in Asia totaled C$192.9 billion ($147 billion) as of 31 March.
Manulife has used joint ventures before to expand in Asia, starting in Indonesia in 1985 with a partnership involving Dharmala Group and International Finance Corp. Manulife was part of China’s first joint-venture life-insurance company, Manulife-Sinochem, in 1996, four years after becoming the first Canadian life insurer to open an office in China. Manulife started a partnership in Japan in 1999, the same year it entered Vietnam, and it has continued its expansion to other Asian nations, including Cambodia and Myanmar.
It has not previously been in India though.
“We’ve been assessing the India opportunity for a long period of time, and quite frankly we’ve been in discussions with Mahindra for more than a year,"" Gori said. “It’s a very strong consumer brand.""
India’s population — which now totals about 1.4 billion, and is forecast to surpass China’s in the next decade — is fueling “tremendous"" growth in the asset-management industry, Gori said. The industry has posted a compound annual growth rate of 15% in the past 10 years.
“It’s clear that there is further growth and upside in terms of the industry and its evolution,"" Gori said.
Other comments from the interview:
Gori is one year into a transformation plan for the 132-year-old insurer, with goals for 2022 that include accelerated growth in four “high potential"" areas: Asia insurance; wealth and asset management; behavioral insurance (which encourages clients to lead healthier lifestyles through the use of technology) and Canada growth benefits. The plan is to push those areas to about two-thirds of core earnings from about half currently.
“We’re going to be investing more resources, more capital, more expense into growing those businesses, because we see they have not only tremendous opportunity and upside, but also that they’re delivering great returns for our shareholders,"" Gori said. “We’re feeling pretty good about the progress we’re making.""
On the US and its John Hancock unit:
“A third of our profitability comes from the US today and Hancock has operated in the US for 150-plus years,"" Gori said. “It’s a very strong, well-recognized brand that’s been in the marketplace for a long period of time and for us contributes significant profitability.
“We feel that it’s a market that we have the capability to succeed in,"" he said. “Our growth over the last five years demonstrates that we’ve actually been making good progress.""
On pushing Vitality, its behavioral insurance program, in the US:
“We believe that we can’t simply be complacent with the solutions that we’re offering, which is why we’ve pivoted to Vitality,"" he said. “We think the industry in the US has been a little bit stale. It has operated through very traditional products over a very long period of time, and the consumer needs new products to really have insurance be in their consideration set.""
On use of capital:
“That financial flexibility that comes with reducing our leverage is something that we’re going to continue to focus on, and that is our No. 1 priority as it relates to our capital position,"" he said. Debt will be repaid at renewal periods rather than being paid down early, he added.
Returning capital is the next priority: “We announced our buyback program last year and we’ve been steadily buying back our stock,"" Gori said. “We’re going to continue to be looking for opportunities, because we believe our stock price today is undervalued versus its potential and certainly where we believe the value exists.""
Manulife may also consider acquisitions, though those will likely be “opportunistic"" and aren’t needed for Manulife to reach its earnings growth targets. “We’re in a great position in that we don’t need that to get growth and to really achieve our aspirations from a company business perspective."""
233,2019-06-29,Mahindra Mahindra,"If you are sure you want to use the car only for two-three years, then you can consider car on lease after evaluating your cash flowYou can lease car directly from the manufacturer without worrying about the resale value, down payments and equated monthly installment

Mumbai: To buy or to rent? The question can be asked for most things: homes, household appliances or vehicles. With changing lifestyles and growing frequency in change of job locations, more and more people are abstaining from buying cars.
Automobile companies such as Hyundai, Mercedes, Mahindra and Mahindra, Fiat and Skoda are offering leasing services, according to Darshini Kansara, research analyst at Careratings, a research agency. Let’s decode the concept of taking a car on lease.
How does it work?
In this scheme, you can lease car directly from the manufacturer without worrying about the resale value, down payments and equated monthly installment (EMIs). The legal ownership of the car remains with the manufacturer.
“This service will work for you if you need to relocate to another city for two-three years and you would need a car for daily commutation,"" said Vikas Jain, national sales head, Hyundai Motor India Ltd. You can pick a car of your choice on the manufacturer’s website after considering the model, subscription amount, mileage and charges. The charges are for rental, insurance cover, car switching and maintenance. “Insurance premium is for three years—we divide that amount and charge the customer on a monthly basis, only for the months he or she keeps the car,"" said Jain. You can also switch the car models depending on your manufacturer. Its cost is based on customized calculation factoring usage, inclusions and exclusion.
“Suppose the on-road price of the car is  ₹50 lakh approximately. Under loan, you will pay  ₹1.19 lakh EMI with total outflow of  ₹60 lakh in three years, including down payment and recurring cost of insurance and maintenance. In comparison, you can pay rent of  ₹1.05 lakh with outflow of only  ₹37 lakh in three years and the car is returned at the end,"" said Prasad Salunke, head of sales and marketing, Daimler Financial Services. With Mercedes, you have the option to own the car by buying from dealer at fair market price, said Salunke.
Should you rent it?
Car on lease works if you do not want to have the car for long term. If you are sure you want to use the car only for two-three years, then you can consider it after evaluating your cash flow. Otherwise, it may be expensive. For example, Hyundai Creta E+ 1.4 CRDI, for a 48-month contract will cost  ₹42,700 monthly (inclusive of road tax plus goods and services tax; services are optional by paying an additional monthly fee) and the total amount you shell out will be  ₹13.04 lakh. If you opt for the same version for purchase on loan, you would need to make a down payment of  ₹3.85 lakh and pay an EMI of  ₹15,521 for five years. The total amount you end up paying is  ₹11.31 lakh. “In case you want to keep the car for the long term, which would be seven years or above, then buying the car would be a more viable option. Consider that you wanted to keep it for a longer term than that, the cost of depreciation you incur annually will be much lesser than the subscription amount,"" said Pawan Agrawal, founder of Investguru.in, a financial advisory firm. This is not a one-fits-all options, so do the math before opting for it."
232,2019-07-01,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra Group’s real estate arm is building three affordable housing projects costing  ₹8-25 lakh in Mumbai, ChennaiThe firm is currently studying various state tenders in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Odisha and Bihar, among others

MUMBAI :
Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd is looking to build homes costing  ₹5-10 lakh for the first time, targeting economically weaker sections (EWS) through public-private partnerships (PPP) with various state governments, a top executive said.
The Mahindra Group’s real estate arm, which operates its low-cost housing business under the Happinest brand, is currently building three affordable housing projects costing  ₹8-25 lakh in Mumbai and Chennai.
The strategy to build homes under the PPP model is in line with the company’s “ambitious"" target to sell around 10,000 affordable homes every year in the next three to four years, Arvind Subramanian, chief executive, Mahindra Happinest Developers Ltd said in an interview. The company has delivered over 1,600 homes so far and is currently developing about 3,500 units.
“We see an opportunity in participating in the absolute lower end of the market through the PPP model. This makes sense to us because it takes away sales and collection risk. At this stage, we are studying various state government tenders,"" he said.
Under the government’s affordable housing scheme Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), state governments invite tenders to build affordable homes especially for the EWS categories. “Traditionally EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) players are more suited to participate in such tenders rather than developers. But we are seeing some variations in how some states are taking it forward. So, there is potentially a role where a developer can participate as well,"" he said.
The firm is currently studying various state tenders in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Odisha and Bihar, among others. “What this would give us is the required scale and innovation needed in our self development business as well,"" he added.
Mahindra Lifespace is meanwhile planning its fourth affordable housing project, at Kalyan near Mumbai, by September this year, with around 1,200 units. It is also looking to enter Pune in the near future.
“We have set our sights very high. We want to sell and deliver 10,000 homes a year in about 4-5 years. That’s the journey we are on. By the end of this year, we should be doing about 5,000 units under-development. There is a strong pipeline of projects getting into next year,"" Subramanian said.
In 2017, Mahindra Lifespace partnered HDFC Capital Advisors Ltd to jointly invest  ₹500 crore over the next three years to develop affordable housing projects. In March this year, the joint platform launched its first affordable project at Palghar in Mumbai’s outskirts. So far, it has invested over  ₹100 crore of the total funds, he added."

Known to be a prolific Tweeter, the Mahindra group honcho is also known for his witty replies on Twitter. He regularly tweets about matters ranging from Mahindra group vehicles to social and economic issues. He has 7.03 million followers on Twitter
The downfall of Jet Airways illustrates the challenge of making money in India's  aviation sector, dominated by low-cost carriers such as IndiGo and SpiceJet. The Indian market is also highly price-sensitive, and airlines, despite high fuel cost, compete to keep fares low.  When India’s Kingfisher Airlines went bankrupt in 2012, lessors were forced to write off millions of dollars in losses and thousands of people lost their jobs.
Cash-stripped Jet Airways had suspended its entire operations in mid-April after lenders refused to extend funding. Last month, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted an insolvency petition against Jet Airways and directed the resolution professional for the airline to try to finish the process within three months.
On Friday, Jet Airways Employee Consortium and AdiGroup said they would jointly bid for acquiring up to 75% stake in Jet Airways through the NCLT process.
The airline owes  ₹8,500 crore to banks and around  ₹25,000 crore in arrears to vendors, lessors and employees."

New Delhi: The country's largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) has cut vehicle production for the fifth consecutive month in June, according to a regulatory filing.
The auto major said it slashed total vehicle production, including Super Carry LCV, by 15.6% last month to 1,11,917 units as compared to 1,32,616 units in the year-ago month.
Total passenger vehicle production stood at 1,09,641 units last month, down 16.34% from 1,31,068 units in June 2018.
The auto major cut production of mini segment vehicles, including models like Alto, by 48.2% to 15,087 units last month as against 29,131 units in the year-ago period.
Similarly, it slashed production of compact segment cars like WagonR, Swift and Dzire by 1.46% to 66,436 units in June from 67,426 units earlier.
Production of utility vehicles witnessed a decline of 5.26% to 17,074 units, as against 18,023 units in June last year.
The company said production of vans declined by 27.87% to 8,501 units last month compared to 11,787 units in June 2018.
The car market leader had cut total production by over 18% in May. Similarly, it had slashed production by around 10% across its factories in April.
In March, the company had reported a production cut of 20.9%, while in February the company had reduced production by over 8% to 1,48,959 units from 1,62,524 units produced in the year-ago month.
Auto manufacturers have been facing muted sales for quite some time now. The slowdown has forced companies to adjust their production schedules to market demand.
Automakers like Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and Tata Motors have also announced adjusting production to tapering market demand to cut down inventories.
In May, overall passenger vehicle wholesales in India witnessed the steepest decline in nearly 18 years, dropping by over 20 per cent amid continued weakness in retail offtake.
The decline in May was the worst since September 2001, when sales had dropped by 21.91%.
In fact, barring October last year, when sales went up 1.55%, passenger vehicle offtake has been in the negative zone in 10 of the last 11 months.
Passenger vehicle retail sales were, however, comparatively better in May. As per automobile dealers' body FADA, retail sales in May dipped 1% to 2,51,049 units as compared to the same period last year.
Both SIAM and FADA are yet to release detailed sales data for June."
226,2019-07-08,Mahindra Mahindra,"Firm says working on localizing farm machines to make them affordable for farmersM&M is working on the farm machinery ecosystem as it sees a strategic growth opportunity

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), India’s largest tractor manufacturer, is now looking beyond tractors to boost its farm equipment business. The company is aggressively working on the farm machinery ecosystem as it views this space as a strategic growth opportunity, said Shubhabrata Saha, chief of operations, farm division, M&M.
The growing focus on farm machinery comes against the backdrop of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious plan of doubling the income of farmers by 2022.
It is also a countermeasure to increasing competitive intensity and market forces in the tractor segment amid a slowdown in short-term demand. M&M’s Q1FY20 domestic tractor sales stood at 82,913 units, down 15% year-on-year. The management estimates a subdued FY20 growth of 5% in tractors, which are more profitable than the company’s own vertical.
The focus on improving farm productivity in the foreseeable future comes from the government’s thrust on doubling the income of farmers and from factors such as the shortage of labour, fast-growing population, and depleting groundwater resources, Saha said in an interview.
“Productivity per inch of farmland will have to increase significantly and this will lead to faster penetration of farm mechanisation as a measure to adopt better agricultural practices,"" he said.
M&M, which is also the leader in the domestic tractor market with a 41.4% share in FY19, sees new opportunities in crop-specific farm machines, products and services around crop care, crop inputs, soil mapping and testing, pestilence protection using drones and other areas.
“In India, the application of a tractor is primarily land preparation. It is hardly used when the plant grows or the crop is harvested. The industry is slated to see an inflexion point soon when application of specific farm machinery will be able to impact farm productivity and farmers’ lives,"" Saha said. The M&M official quoted examples of crop-specific farm machinery deployed for potato farming, rice transplanters, sprayers used in horticulture and others, to buttress his case.
The use of crop-specific machines such as the ones used for potato farming and rice transplanters are very limited in India and, thus, will see significant growth in penetration in the near future, Saha said. M&M says the company is working on localizing a number of these technologies, including harvesters, to make them affordable for farmers in India.
“We are also working on soil mapping to help farmers estimate the right input of fertilisers. We expect the next 3-5 years to be very exciting for farm equipment. Also, the government is expected to give a fillip to farm mechanisation,"" he said.
The company has been fast building up its capabilities and portfolio under its farm equipment sector, which covers farm machinery and tractors business. It has made eight acquisitions in four years.
M&M got access to technologies around rice-transplanters and associated value chain, harvesters and farm implements with the acquisition of a 33% stake in Japan’s Mitsubishi Agriculture Machinery (October 2015), 35% stake in Finland’s Sampo Rosenlew (March 2016) and a 75% equity stake in Turkey-based Hisarlar.
M&M’s Belgium-based Dewulf Group exposed it to potato farming equipment, which it plans to offer to Indian farmers.
The company’s latest acquisition of a 11.25% stake in Switzerland’s agriculture technology startup Gamaya SA gives it access to hyperspectral imagery analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, which captures and interprets useful information on the state of crops for the farmers."
225,2019-07-11,Mahindra Mahindra,"Total sales of cars, SUVs and vans in Q1 declined 18.4% year-on-year, the sharpest since a 23.1% drop in Q3 of 2000-01Every segment of the auto industry reported a double-digit decline

NEW DELHI :
India’s automobile industry continued to languish, with passenger vehicle (PV) sales falling the most in nearly two decades in the June quarter, underscoring subdued consumer sentiment, a slowdown in economic activity, farm distress and a liquidity squeeze.
All the automakers, including market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and second-ranked Hyundai Motor India Ltd, posted lower sales during the period, showed data issued by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam).
A total of 712,620 cars, utility vehicles and vans were sold last quarter, an 18.4% decline from the year earlier. It was the sharpest decline since a 23.1% drop in the third quarter of 2000-01.
“Consumer sentiments remain sheepish, which continue to weigh on demand for discretionary items like cars,"" said Ashish Modani, vice president and co-head of corporate ratings at Icra Ltd. “Moreover, inventory rationalization at PV dealerships has taken a toll on wholesale dispatches."" He said “wholesale dispatches are likely to remain weak for the next 1-2 months and we expect some signs of recovery from the festive season"" that starts in August.
Vehicle sales in India are counted as factory dispatches, or wholesales.
In June, total domestic sales of automobiles fell 12.3% to more than 1.99 million units as all the segments, barring three-wheelers, posted a double-digit drop in sales.
Sale of passenger vehicles fell 17.5% to 225,732 units. This was the eighth consecutive drop in monthly passenger vehicle sales. Sales have fallen in 11 of the 12 months since July 2018.
Last month’s sales comprised 139,628 cars, a 24% decline from the year earlier. Utility vehicle sales fell 0.9% to 72,917 units, while sales of vans fell 18% to 13,187 units.
Weak retail sales led companies such as Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd to temporarily shut factories to correct mounting stocks at their dealerships. Some dealers were forced to shut shop as customers stayed away. Data compiled by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations showed that 64 dealerships have closed down operations in the Greater Mumbai area alone in the last year-and-a-half, 61 of them associated with passenger vehicles.
According to Siam, the passenger vehicle segment recorded its worst performance in five years in 2018-19, with sales growing 2.7%.
Siam president Rajan Wadhera said the auto industry has not witnessed such a sharp drop in sales in the past decade. He said the industry is hoping for a recovery in the months ahead, with the arrival of festivals and an improvement in the availability of loans. “The automakers are in a situation where their cost is more than the revenue,"" he said.
Automobile sales have been hit by the tightening of credit norms by banks after a liquidity crisis was triggered due to payment defaults by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd. Uncertainty during the recent elections, an overall slowdown in economic activity and drought in some states added to the woes of automakers. The economic slowdown is reflected in GDP growth falling below 6% in the March quarter, while factory output entered negative territory in March after 21 months.
This is reflected in the sales of commercial vehicles—considered a barometer of economic growth—which declined 12.3% to 70,771 units in June due to the revised truck axle norms and lack of financing options from non-bank lenders for truck fleet owners.

223,2019-07-12,Mahindra Mahindra,"India's economy grew at its slowest pace in more than four years in the March quarterThe auto sector also expects diesel to struggle

India's strong diesel demand growth is decoupling from the car market as motorists increasingly turn to gasoline vehicles, leaving it more reliant on patchy demand from construction and heavy industry.
A slowdown in demand growth in India — one of Asia's biggest diesel guzzlers -- could add to a persistent glut of diesel in the region, fuelled in part by strong exports from China, and put pressure on regional refining profit margins.
Transportation has historically accounted for two-thirds of India's diesel use, but a steady decline in diesel's discount to gasoline has seen sales of diesel-powered cars fall to a record low share of total sales, according to industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).
This diminishing draw from autos means diesel demand growth in Asia's third-largest economy could now depend mainly on government and company infrastructure spending, rather than daily use by an increasingly mobile population.
India's economy grew at its slowest pace in more than four years in the March quarter and the risk of a wider fiscal deficit threatens government spending as private investment falls, leaving the outlook for construction activity appears uncertain over the near to medium term.
The largest drivers of diesel demand growth in India are commercial vehicles including trucks and public transport, where consumption is linked to the overall economy, followed by passenger vehicles, said K Ravichandran, senior vice president at ICRA, a unit of Moody's Investors Service.
""India's diesel demand growth will largely depend on the performance of the economy, now that diesel passenger vehicles have become less glamorous as the price differential with petrol is coming down,"" Ravichandran said.
GEAR SHIFT
Diesel-powered cars accounted for 19% of total car sales in India in the 2018/19 financial year, compared with nearly 50% of sales in 2012/13, according to SIAM.
That drop in diesel-fuelled auto sales in turn contributed to slower diesel consumption growth, from roughly 7% annually from 2010 through 2013, to 3% for 2018-19, according to data from the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural gas.
Industry executives expect diesel sales to continue to struggle as diesel's historical price advantage to gasoline diminishes. In 2010, diesel traded at a roughly 23 rupees ($0.33) per litre discount to gasoline, but is now less than 7 rupees cheaper, according Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell, a think-tank attached to the federal oil ministry.
""The motivation for owning a diesel vehicle is basically the pricing. With that price differential reducing, there is going to be a preference for petrol vehicles,"" said M K Surana, the chairman of India's third largest state refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd
Surana expects diesel demand to grow 2.5%-3% in 2019/20, below the India's petroleum ministry's initial projections of 3.5%.
The auto sector also expects diesel to struggle. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, India's biggest automaker, will stop making diesel cars next fiscal year, blaming uncertain fuel prices and stricter emission standards.
Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, India's third largest automaker, plans to stop production of some diesel vehicles.
Beyond diesel, India's overall auto sales have been sluggish, recording the slowest pace of growth in four years in 2018-19, according to SIAM.
FARM SECTOR SLOWDOWN
At the same time, a renewables push across the farm sector could cut diesel use in irrigation pumps if the government follows through on plans to boost solar generation capacity.
In February, India approved subsidised sales of solar pumps to millions of farmers, which it expects will cut diesel demand by about 1.1 million tonnes a year. The country consumed 83.5 million tonnes of diesel in 2018/19.
The government's ambitious target for electric vehicles to make up 30 percent of auto sales by 2030 may also dent diesel demand.
Still, over the longer term India's overall growth trajectory is expected to underpin fuel demand.
""Strong economic momentum should support industrial/freight activities, providing further impetus to long-term gasoil demand growth,"" said Sri Paravaikkarasu, director at Singapore-based consultancy FGE.

219,2019-07-16,Mahindra Mahindra,"A combination of the government’s policy incentives, market dynamics and environmental imperatives would drive down prices of non-polluting vehicles

Will electric cars soon be within the reach of the average Indian car buyer? Hyundai has declared plans to invest  ₹2,000 crore in India to roll out a  ₹10-lakh electric car. Mahindra is expected to launch a micro SUV in the  ₹8-9 lakh range next year. Tata Motors’ electric version of its forthcoming Altroz hatchback could hit the streets by 2020. Maruti Suzuki, Toyota and Nissan also have their eyes set on this emerging market. All this suggests that a combination of policy incentives, market dynamics and environmental imperatives will drive down prices of green vehicles.
Automakers may have been reluctant to give up on internal-combustion engines, but they do realise that the market could transform over the next decade. So far, electric cars have been too expensive. Hyundai’s Kona electric SUV is priced above  ₹25 lakh. Once cheaper options arrive, competition should spur firms to invest in technology to boost the performance of their cars. Buyers will then be spoilt for choice at attractive price-points. The establishment of a network of charging stations could take care of the rest. For now, EV makers need to match fossil-fuel vehicles on the price-performance equation."

217,2019-07-17,Mahindra Mahindra,"While a low inflation is good for the consumers, it is also a sign of weak demandCrisil chief economist D.K. Joshi said retail inflation has dramatically come down because of low food inflation

India’s wholesale price index-based inflation in June, which came in at a 23-month low of 2.02%, and core inflation, at 31-month low of 0.8%, have raised concerns on whether the country has a low inflation problem now.
""Low inflation is often a good thing. But like blood pressure, it may not always be a sign of health if it keeps falling. Moderately high inflation signals growing consumption and spurs investment. Some pump-priming via lower interest rates & measures to increase consumption may help,"" chairman of the Mahindra Group, Anand Mahindra tweeted on Monday.
However, retail inflation that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tracks for monetary policy decisions in fact inched to an eight month high of 3.18% in June though core inflation slowed to 4.11%.
While a low inflation is good for consumers, it is also a sign of weak demand and thus takes away the pricing power of producers, discouraging fresh investments and job creation. So a moderate level of inflation that does not pinch the consumer and encourages business activity is usually considered good for the economy. As part of the Monetary Policy Framework, the government has mandated the RBI to keep retail inflation at 4%, within a band of 2 percentage points.
Crisil Ltd chief economist D.K. Joshi said retail inflation has dramatically come down because of low food inflation which has implications for farmers and demand in the rural areas. “When food prices go up, it (retail inflation) will also cross 4%. But right now, low inflation has given a unique opportunity to cut policy rates and prop up the economy,"" he added.
The RBI is often criticised for relying too heavily on the headline retail inflation in which the food basket has around 55% weight, to decide its monetary policy. Since food prices have their own seasonality and remain volatile, RBI’s inflation forecasts have often gone wrong on the higher side.
As NIPFP director Rathin Roy has often pointed out, since the current Monetary Policy Framework is up for review by March, 2021, the government and RBI should use the opportunity to comprehensively review the agreement including the inflation indicators that RBI should be targeting. This may also resolve the conflicting signals that we receive from various inflation indicators"

Automobile and other companies in India are following through on the government’s push to turn the country into a global manufacturing hub for electric vehicles by announcing plans to tap this emerging market.
With the government revealing serious intent for the EV segment with a host of incentives in the budget, automakers are gearing up to prepare for a future beyond petrol and diesel vehicles.
Hyundai Motor Co., India’s second-largest carmaker, plans to set up a lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant for its affordable electric vehicles designed for the Indian market. Hyundai’s sourcing department is in talks with vendors to create a separate supply chain for such vehicles.
Salt-to-software conglomerate Tata group through its companies such as Tata Motors Ltd, Tata Power Ltd and Tata Chemicals Ltd is investing in various aspects of electric mobility. Last week, Tata Chemicals was allotted land to build a lithium-ion cell manufacturing plant in Dholera in Gujarat by the state government.
New entrant MG Motor India Ltd would introduce an electric sport-utility vehicle as its second product in the domestic market by the end of December. The unit of China’s SAIC Motor Corp. will be assembling the eZS SUV in India. Meanwhile, SAIC recently tied up with Finland-based clean energy major Fortum to install 50-kilowatt fast-charging stations in five cities in India.
Naveen Munjal-led electric scooter maker Hero Electric will expand its manufacturing capacity five-fold to 500,000 units a year to meet a potential rise in demand for electric vehicles.
Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in the 2019 budget income tax rebates of up to  ₹1.5 lakh to customers on interest paid on loans to buy electric vehicles, with a total exemption benefit of  ₹2.5 lakh over the entire loan period. Some companies such as Hyundai and MG Motor are looking at electric mobility as an evolving space which can help them either get a headstart over rivals.
Sitharaman also announced a customs duty exemption on lithium-ion cells, which will help lower the cost of lithium-ion batteries as they are not produced in India. Makers of components such as solar electric charging infrastructure and lithium storage batteries can avail investment-linked income tax exemptions and other indirect tax benefits.
Seon Seob Kim, managing director and chief executive, Hyundai Motor India, said in an interview earlier in July that the company won’t be able to achieve cost competitiveness in mass-market electric vehicles without localizing major components.
“Our procurement division is now at a very early stage of finding out right partners to set up an electric vehicle ecosystem. It will be a different set of suppliers compared to the internal combustion engines,"" Kim said. “Right now, our teams are trying to contact them and understand them and maybe work together to increase their capabilities and also improve the level of technology (for the particular parts). So, that is quite a priority item"".
Companies under the Tata group are working on various aspects of electric mobility. For instance, Tata Power is working on charging infrastructure for electric vehicles while Tata Chemicals plans to build a lithium-ion cell manufacturing plant in Gujarat.
Tata Motors is working closely with its Jaguar Land Rover unit to design electric vehicles.
Shailesh Chandra, president, electric mobility business and corporate strategy, Tata Motors said the intent of teaming up with the group companies is to bank upon the specific individual strengths without losing focus on the core domain, ensure faster time-to-market for the new generation electric vehicles and build an ecosystem, which can support wider technology adoption in the domestic market.
“We realized that EV adoption is not about just designing, producing and selling the products. It is about the whole ecosystem. Without that, we can make products but there will be no buyers for them. That’s when we realized that this is where we need partners so that we focus on the areas that are core to us in future,"" Chandra said in an interview on 12 July.
India’s largest electric vehicle maker Mahindra and Mahindra has committed more than  ₹1,000 crore to build manufacturing lines for electric vehicles and powertrains—to be supplied to other OEMs—in Maharashtra and Karnataka.

Indian shares fell sharply on Friday afternoon to close at their worst levels since mid-May, as investors fretted over weak corporate earnings and the government's refusal to tweak the surcharge on foreign investors.
The broader NSE Nifty dropped 1.53% to 11,419.25, while the benchmark BSE Sensex closed 1.44% lower at 38,337.01. The indexes posted their second straight weekly loss.
Whatever hopes there were around the finance minister removing the surcharge on foreign investors have been dashed, said Neeraj Dewan, a director with Quantum Securities, New Delhi, adding that sentiment had also been dampened by weak earnings by some lenders.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Thursday that foreign portfolio investors could instead register as companies to avoid a new tax surcharge imposed on individual tax payers as well as trusts in the budget for the fiscal year that began on April 1.
Corporate earnings for the June quarter have also failed to impress investors, with several lenders flagging stress in their books. IT heavyweight Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, which kicked off the results season last week, also reported lower margins.
Financial and auto stocks accounted for most of the losses.
Bajaj Finance Ltd declined 4.2%, while Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd dropped 3.7%.
RBL Bank Ltd plunged 13.7% to its lowest close since Oct. 29 after the lender highlighted risks to its asset quality, despite reporting a 41% jump in quarterly profit.
Larger rival Yes Bank Ltd reported a weak quarter earlier this week, sparking a sell-off in its stock. Its shares declined 3% in the current session.
Auto maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd was the biggest loser in the market, sliding 4.4% to its lowest close since Feb. 2016, while peers Tata Motors Ltd and Eicher Motors Ltd dropped 3.7%-4%, driving the Nifty Auto index 3.3% lower.
Meanwhile, electricity producer NTPC Ltd was the top gainer among the seven stocks in the green on the NSE Nifty, closing 2.2% higher.
The Mumbai market moved inversely to its global peers, which rose as investors bet on a U.S. interest rate cut at the end of July after a speech by a top Federal Reserve official further cemented expectations for one.

Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company has a total exposure of around  ₹140 crore in crisis-hit home loan and property finance firm Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL), a source said.

Do nice boys finish last? Bandhan Bank Ltd’s promoters probably know the answer since they are in a race to meet regulatory rules on shareholding.
It is a tough road and the stock is already paying a price, having fallen since the beginning of the year. One of the lender’s much larger competitors, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, chose rather to take the regulator to court on the shareholding issue, and its shares are doing much better.
Investors didn’t show Bandhan Bank any love after a strong performance in the June quarter (Q1) either. The lender continues to report robust growth and low toxic level in loans.
Indeed, small is not only beautiful, but it is highly profitable, too. Bandhan Bank beat Street estimates for the second time by reporting a sharp 45% jump in net profit for the June quarter against an expected modest increase of around 30% by the Street.
That this profit growth came on the back of strong core income growth of 36% was another reason to rejoice.
The lender managed to maintain its asset quality metrics and even ramped up provisioning to be safe. Gross bad loans were 2.02% of its loan book that expanded to a healthy 39% for the June quarter.
Provisions were raised by 56% from a year ago, which meant that its coverage ratio also improved. Having realized its folly of lending to large companies, when its strong point was basically microloans, Bandhan Bank is now back to focusing on such small loans again.
The growth in non-microloans has decelerated and the bank’s overall loan book, too, is growing slower than before because of this. Microloans continue to grow near long-term average for the bank.
To be sure, loan growth has decelerated over the last one year. Another worry is the sharp fall in the share of low-cost current account savings account (CASA) deposits on a sequential basis. The CASA ratio dropped from 40% in the March quarter to 36.06% as of June end. That said, it is still higher than a year ago.
The stock trades at a multiple of almost four times its estimated book value for FY21. That is lower than Kotak Mahindra Bank’s multiple of five times, even though Bandhan Bank’s lower base means its growth is likely to be higher.
As pointed out earlier, investors still worry that the bank has given no clear road map as to how the promoter stake would come down to the permissible level of 40%. While announcing the Q1 results, too, the management had not thrown any light on this.
The last attempt of the bank to shed promoter weight, through the acquisition of Gruh Finance Ltd, was a costly one, and the effect of it is yet to play out on the books of Bandhan Bank."
213,2019-07-21,Mahindra Mahindra,"Always compare the interest rates on offer before investing in fixed depositsFD rates vary across banks, tenure and the amount you need to invest

Fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular among investors, who are looking for guaranteed income. Interest earned from FDs gets added to your total income and is accordingly taxed at your slab rate. Many banks including SBI, ICICI, HDFC, Axis, IDFC First Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank offer FDs ranging from 7 days to ten years. Recently, top lenders revised their FD rates after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lowered repo rate, also known as lending rate, by 25 basis points for the third time in a row. FD rates vary across banks, tenure and the amount you need to invest. Always compare the interest rates on offer before investing in these deposits.
Here are a list of top banks along with the latest FD rates offered by them:
SBI offers FDs ranging from seven days to one year. For FDs with maturity period of 7 days to less than 1 year, SBI offers a 6.40% interest rate. On FDs maturing between one year and two years, the bank is offering 7% interest rate. On FDs maturing in 2-3 years, SBI offers 6.75%. On maturity between three and five years, the bank is offering 6.70% interest rate. SBI offers an interest rate of 6.60% on FDs with maturity between five years and 10 years.
Kotak Mahindra Bank is offering 5.5% interest rate on deposits maturing between seven days to 90 days. On maturity period of 91 days to 270 days, the bank is offering a 6.50% rate of interest. The bank is offering 7% interest rate on the maturity period of 271 days to 389 days. On FDs maturing in 390 days to 23 months, Kotak Mahindra Bank offers 7.10% interest rate.

209,2019-07-22,Mahindra Mahindra,"Asia stocks eased on Monday as investors reduced expectations of an aggressive interest rate cut by FedKotak Mahindra Bank, United Spirits, DHFL, ICICI Securities and others to declare their Q1 results today

Mumbai: The Indian equity markets are expected to be wobbly amidst weak global peers. Asia stocks eased on Monday as investors reduced expectations of an aggressive interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, while heightened Middle East tensions following an Iranian seizure of a British tanker lifted crude oil prices.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.1%. South Korea's KOSPI shed 0.3%, Australian stocks lost 0.2% and Japan's Nikkei fell 0.5%.
Global equity markets had risen briefly towards the end of last week after dovish comments by New York Fed President John Williams boosted the prospect of the central bank lowering rates by 50 basis points at its 30-31 July meeting.
But the stock markets gave back those gains on Friday, with Wall Street shares ending in negative territory, after the New York Fed walked back Williams’ comments by saying his speech was not about potential policy action at the upcoming Fed meeting.
Expectations for a 50 basis points cut were scaled back further after the Wall Street Journal reported the Fed was likely to cut rates by 25 bps when it meets later this month, and may make further cuts in the future given global growth and trade uncertainties.
Back home, key companies which will announce their June quarter results on Monday are Kotak Mahindra Bank, United Spirits, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL), Oriental Bank of Commerce, TVS Motor Company, ICICI Securities, Just Dial, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals and Mastek.
Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL)and HDFC Bank are likely to be in focus on Monday after they announced their June quarter earnings after markets closed for trading last week. Reliance Industries Ltd on Friday reported a 6.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) increase in net profit for the June quarter, beating Street estimates on the back of strong performances by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Reliance Retail. RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM), or the amount a refiner earns by refining one barrel of crude oil, narrowed to $8.1 a barrel—an 18-quarter-low for the company.
HDFC Bank Ltd on Saturday said its first quarter net profit rose 21% on account of higher provisions and other income. Asset quality deteriorated marginally as gross non-performing assets (NPAs), as a percentage of total advances, rose to 1.4% in the June quarter compared to 1.33% in the year-ago period.
Meanwhile, the dollar and US Treasury yields rose on the greater likelihood of a shallower 25 bps rate cut.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 97.152 after rising 0.4% on Friday. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield stretched Friday’s rise and climbed to 2.058%.
The greenback was nearly flat at 107.830 yen after adding 0.4% on Friday thanks to the rise in US yields. The euro was little changed at $1.1218 after shedding 0.5% on Friday.
In commodities, Brent crude futures were up 1.26% at $63.26 per barrel following a gain of about 0.9% on Friday. Crude was buoyant after Iran’s Revolutionary Guards on Friday captured a British-flagged oil tanker in the Gulf after Britain seized an Iranian vessel earlier this month, further raising tensions along a vital international oil shipping route.
Gold slipped from a six-year high as the dollar firmed and as expectations for a deep rate cut by the Fed were dialed back.
Spot gold traded at $1,425.82 an ounce after going as high as $1,452.60 on Friday, its strongest since May 2013.

As India’s consumer spending slows down after a multiyear boom, one life insurer is betting on the nation’s plans to upgrade its infrastructure. “Investment is a better way to revive the economy, not consumption,"" said Hemant Kanawala, head of equities at Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance Co. in Mumbai. “Jobs will be created only if investments pick up, and that will boost consumption in a way,"" he said.
India’s latest budget targets the building of highways and railroads as well as providing water to all citizens. The spending plan comes amid a slowdown in the economy and a credit crisis in the shadow banking system that have dented consumer appetites.
With government plans to spend about 1.6 trillion rupees ($23.3 billion) on transportation infrastructure this year, Kotak Mahindra Life prefers shares of cement makers, engineering firms and construction contractors. The budget earmarks 100 billion rupees for drinking water projects in rural areas.
Kanawala also favors lenders that have good access to borrowing resources, as they’re likely to gain share amid the problems in the non-bank financial industry.
Kotak Mahindra Life has about  ₹9,500 crore in equity holdings. Kotak Classic Opportunities - its top fund with  ₹4,370 crore of stocks - has returned 11% annually over the past five years, beating 73% of rivals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

“Among financial stocks, apart from banks, we prefer shares of insurance firms and asset management companies."""

Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank on Monday reported a 33% increase in its June quarter net profit due to higher net interest income and lower provisions. Net profit for the quarter stood at  ₹1,360.20 crore, up 32.71%, from  ₹1,024.94 crore a year ago. According to 13 Bloomberg analyst, the bank was expected to post a profit of  ₹1334.10 crore.

205,2019-07-22,Mahindra Mahindra,"Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a deceleration in loan growth to 18% for Q1 from 22% a year agoThe management cited a slowdown in demand and flagged concerns over auto, real estate, small biz

When the valuable HDFC Bank’s shares dropped about 3% reacting to slowing loan growth, can the most expensive private bank stock be unaffected?
Kotak Mahindra Bank shares, too, dropped 3.6% on Monday, ahead of the release of its first-quarter results. Sure enough, the bank reported a deceleration in loan growth for the June quarter to 18%, lower than the 22% growth for the corresponding period in FY19. Sequentially, loans hardly grew at all.
Loans to companies grew just 7.4%, a far cry from double-digit growth the lender reported in previous quarters. While for any first quarter, a slowdown would be taken in stride, times are not good in terms of economic growth.
What should worry investors is the commentary from the management. The message that the management sent out to investors was that of caution. Dipak Gupta, joint managing director said that sectors such as automobiles, non-bank finance companies and even small businesses demanded greater caution, given the bumpy times ahead. “Corporate has been sluggish and will be sluggish,"" he said in a media conference.
Indeed, carmakers aren’t selling as much as they used to, real estate is in a prolonged slowdown and non-bank lenders who nudged customers to borrow and buy cars and houses are under increased stress. For a bank lending to all these sectors, times are not looking good.
So, Kotak Mahindra Bank has fortified itself with provisions and its coverage ratio is a healthy 67%. Gupta said that the lender would focus on seeking “good pockets"" and avoid huge risks. It should avoid risk, given that for the June quarter, there was a 76% surge in borrowers who haven’t repaid for more than 60 days. A delay of a month more would turn them bad.
For the June quarter, however, the lender reported an enviable gross bad-loan ratio of 2.19%. The bank has reduced its exposure to non-bank finance companies after troubles began intensifying for many of them in the aftermath of defaults triggered by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) last year.
The intent to avoid troubled sectors is visible and the management said that loan growth will continue to come from retail. Even though it is cautious on automakers, non-bank lenders and developers, the lender is willing to chase retail borrowers seeking loans to buy homes and cars. Gupta said that despite the slowdown, repayments won’t be affected here.
Incipient signs of a slowdown aside, the bank’s valuations could borrow strength from its robust core income growth and margins. Both net-interest income and net-interest margins were above Street expectations for the June quarter. Even after the 3% fall on Monday, the stock quotes at a multiple of over 5 times its estimated book value for FY21.
If it guns for good pockets as indicated, perhaps investors would continue to favour the stock."

Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd reported a 32.7% jump in its first-quarter profit on Monday, but its results fell marginally shy of estimates and it became the third private-sector Indian bank in a row to sound a cautionary note about the slowing pace of domestic growth.
The lender, helmed by billionaire Uday Kotak who is one of Asia's richest bankers, said its advances in the June quarter rose 18%, compared with a rise of 24% a year ago.
""The corporate loan book grew slowly in the June quarter,"" said Jaimin Bhatt, chief financial officer of Kotak Mahindra Bank, at a press briefing following the bank's results. ""And on the retail front, we've seen negative growth in auto loans both on a year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter basis.""
A series of factors from distress in the rural economy due to a run of droughts in key agricultural belts, to a liquidity crunch in the shadow banking sector following the collapse of infrastructure lender IL&FS, has led to a rapid cooling in the domestic economy, presenting a challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government as it begins its second term.
Dipak Gupta, joint managing director at Kotak Mahindra Bank, warned the small and medium enterprises segment continued to be a pain point.
""We've been cautious about the slowdown for some six to nine months and will continue to remain cautious,"" said Gupta, adding that the bank was seeing some stress in its unsecured loan book, but this was ""not at alarming levels"".
HDFC Bank, the largest private bank in the country, also warned of slower retail loan growth, in an analyst call on Saturday after announcing its results. The bank stated that the slowdown in the auto sector and stress in the agricultural space were hurting growth.
Following the warning, HDFC Bank's stock on Monday closed at an over two-month low. Its warning came close of the heels of one from smaller rival RBL Bank, which also saw its stock plunge after it flagged risks to its asset quality and warned of a rise in bad loans.
Meanwhile, Kotak's gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans came in slightly higher at 2.19% by the end of June, versus 2.14% at the end of the March quarter and 2.17% in the same period a year ago. The bank said it expected its credit cost to remain in the range of 50-60 basis points, as guided earlier.
The banks in Asia's third largest economy have been dealing with a huge pile of stressed loans worth over $150 billion, with the state-run banks holding the vast majority of the bad debt.
The warnings from the private sector lenders like HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, which have been investor darlings, have amplified concerns around slowing growth and spooked investors.

Stocks of rural- and consumer-centric lenders no longer have the love of their investors, with the narrative of consumption slowdown gathering traction. In this context, the first quarter results of Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd were disastrous.
The non-banking financial company (NBFC) reported a massive 75% fall in net profit for the June quarter, missing estimates by a mile. It was obvious that investors would balk, and they did by sending the stock tumbling over 10% on Wednesday. It’s now down about 30% since early June.
Mahindra Finance had to set aside  ₹6,196 crore as provisions towards bad loans. This is 111% higher than last year. Gross impaired loans at stage 3, according to the Ind-AS accounting standards, were 7.4% of loans, higher than the 5.9% a year ago.
In a call with analysts, the management explained that elevated provisions were a fallout of the new accounting norms, which do not take into account seasonal factors. “We would see an improvement in gross NPAs (non-performing assets),"" said Ramesh Iyer, managing director, Mahindra Finance.
To be sure, the first quarter is typically weak on asset quality, but the extent of the pain seems to be more this time around.
When it came to disbursals, both the June quarter performance and management outlook were far from being sanguine. Iyer said loan growth could be muted this year.
There was a sharp drop in disbursements of tractor loans, a signal that rural distress isn’t over yet. The uneven monsoon distribution and the possible delay in sowing partly explains this fall.
The lender also saw a massive fall of 59% in disbursals to small businesses. Car loans shrank around 2%, a fallout of the slowdown in the auto sector.
But Mahindra Finance lucked out in loans to purchase utility vehicles and other automobiles. Disbursals towards these grew 15%, the only saving grace in an otherwise dismal disbursal growth. That said the growth in assets under management was a decent 22%.
Analysts believe there is a lot of uncertainty over the outlook, and even though the management had guided for an improvement on asset quality, the risk of the slowdown affecting repayments cannot be ruled out.
The silver lining was that the company managed to keep its liability mix kosher. Given the recent liquidity scare for NBFCs, it is comforting that Mahindra Finance’s inflows outstrip its outflows in the short term.
The consumption slowdown is real and uncertain rural conditions are making it difficult for investors to have confidence on stocks of lenders such as Mahindra Finance."

SINGAPORE :
Aviation regulators in Australia and the European Union have lifted orders grounding GippsAero GA8 planes after initial results of an inquiry into a crash in Sweden this month that killed nine people, the regulators said on their websites.
Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) said the precautionary suspension was triggered by initial information that the plane had broken up in flight.
However, it had since received information that there was no evidence of a potential unsafe condition associated with the aircraft, it added.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said CASA had informed it that an inspection of the crashed plane showed it appeared to have been exposed to aerodynamic loads beyond certification levels.
The single-engine GA8 is made in Australia by Mahindra Aerospace, a unit of India's Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, and 63 of the 228 planes worldwide are registered in Australia, CASA says.
Nine Swedes were killed when a GA8, dubbed the Airvan 8, crashed during a skydiving trip near the city of Umea in northern Sweden on July 14.
The GA8 is typically used for skydiving, tourism, air patrols, medical evacuations and humanitarian missions in remote locations, Mahindra Aerospace says on its website.

198,2019-07-29,Mahindra Mahindra,"In their current form, such banks serve largely as money-transfer channels. This business model, however, appears unsustainable in the absence of other reliable streams of revenue

Since at least 1969, financial inclusion has been a core goal of Indian policy. Among the relatively recent efforts in that direction, letting payments banks operate has been a decidedly bold move. Unlike classic banks that borrow cheaply from depositors to lend at higher rates of interest to businesses and others, these banks are not advancers of loans. Instead, they were conceptualized as new-age entities that would leverage information and communication technologies to grant transactional ease to people in far-flung parts of the country, especially those who have never visited a bank before. However, the nascent industry stares at a bleak future, with competition snapping at everyone’s heels, targets hard to achieve, and virtually all space for manoeuvre blocked. Aditya Birla Idea Payments Bank said as much when it announced it was folding up barely 18 months after it began operations. The decision, the bank recently stated, was taken “due to unanticipated developments in the business landscape that have made the economic model unviable"".
It was on 19 August 2015 that the Reserve Bank of India gave in-principle approval to 11 entities to set up payments banks in the country. Four of them, including Sun Pharmaceuticals and Tech Mahindra, dropped out within months, but others were hopeful that millions of people—particularly the poor—would open small savings accounts with them and use a variety of remittance services via their mobile phones. Airtel’s bank was first off the block, its launch coinciding with demonetization in November 2016, and the concept seemed well-suited for a telecom network of its size and reach. Apart from it, Fino, India Post, Jio and Paytm are among the brands of payments banks still in operation. As a pre-existent online payment device, Paytm had already stolen a march on the rest by getting its app onto handset screens and establishing a consumer interface—the first challenge for any online business. It also made the most of the cash scarcity caused by demonetization, its user base doubling from 140 million in October 2016 to 270 million in November 2017. Most of the rest, though, have found it tough signing customers up. They had pinned their hopes on a cheap Aadhaar-based verification process, but this got a jolt once the Supreme Court ruled that this number was not mandatory for bank accounts or phone connections. Too few sign-ups, coupled with the regulatory limit of  ₹1 lakh per account on deposits they’re allowed to accept, leave payments banks with little money for asset creation. In any case, under the rules, 75% of deposits have to be invested in low-yield government bonds. As they pay depositors higher rates than regular banks, they need to cover their costs on far thinner spreads. It’s a wafer-margin business that requires high-volume money transfers to justify. For most, that’s a tall order.
Like with other network-based concepts, it can be argued, payments banks are a winner-takes-all business. This suggests that only one or two will survive. Even so, the very model looks like getting crushed between that of regular lenders and simple payment devices. Perhaps they need to be converted into either full banks or transaction enablers. This would kill the original idea. But then, reaching payment services to the last woman in the farthest village was never their sole responsibility. State-run banks could also fan out across the countryside to hardsell Jan Dhan accounts and get their apps onto millions of phones."

Mumbai: The fifth largest software exporter Tech Mahindra Tuesday reported a tepid 7 percent rise in June quarter net income at  ₹959.3 crore, restricted by crimping margin that fell 390 bps to a lowly 15.2 percent.
The Mahindra group company, however, sounded confident of accelerating growth going forward, with managing director and chief executive CP Gurnani mentioning that the company is in the ""final stages"" of negotiating at least two large deals.
In a first, he also disclosed that they closed $475 million worth of deals in the reporting quarter.
Revenue grew by a slower 4.55 percent to  ₹8,653 crore on annual basis but fell 2.69 percent on a sequentially.
As against March quarter, its margin printed at 15.2 percent, down 3.9 percent on sequentially and slipped 1.70 percent annualised. The average industry margin is over 24 percent for the peers.
Chief financial officer Manoj Bhat explained that there was a 100 bps impact on margins each due to wage hikes and seasonal weakness in its largest revenue contributing communications business, while there was another 50 bps impact each on US visas fees and rupee gains during the quarter.
""We are optimistic about the communications vertical and growth over the next three quarters...this year we will focus on growth,"" Gurnani told reporters.
He said there was a ""temporary sluggishness"" in the enterprise segment which hit revenue.
Pointing to the two large deals under negotiations now, he said the pipeline is also good on deals and also on acquisition prospects.
To a question on profitability, he said the company has to balance between transition for large deals and also pursuing digital business, which has now grown to 36 percent of the total revenue pie.
The company will continue to work on margin levers, he said specifying it will not look specifically at utilisation levels which go down as employees get trained for the future.
Utilisation level for its 1.25 lakh employees came down to 82 percent from 84 percent a year ago.
Meanwhile, the company also announced the acquisition of a Boston- based firm MadPow, a strategic design consultancy, for an undisclosed sum.
The company counter closed 0.93 percent down to  ₹640.30 on the BSE, as against a 0.77 percent correction on the benchmark."
193,2019-07-31,Mahindra Mahindra,"The tragic death of Café Coffee Day’s founder V.G. Siddhartha earlier this week has a wake-up question for a startup nation: Are we treating our entrepreneurs fairly?

The confirmation of Café Coffee Day (CCD) founder V.G. Siddhartha’s death has not just been met with disbelief and dismay around India, it has concentrated minds on an important question: Are we fair to our entrepreneurs? CCD is a big brand and Siddhartha’s untimely demise reflects poorly on the prevailing business atmosphere, replete with “pressures"" mentioned in a letter to the board of CCD and its employees. This document, which has widely been taken as his suicide note, referred to an acute financial crisis, an inability to buy shares back from an unnamed private equity partner, the duress that creditors had imposed, and also “harassment"" by income tax authorities. That such a burden of stress could push a prominent businessman to the brink is disquieting. Condolence messages apart, the empathy his circumstances have evoked from corporate India suggests a broad anxiety over the vilification and worse that faltering firms and their promoters are often put to by an insensitive financial system. Unsurprisingly, the “harassment"" brings back memories of the Rajan Pillai case of the early 1990s, when another government was in power.
Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw told The Quint that many businesses complain of being labelled “money launderers the moment there is some financial stress"". That people running their own companies are vulnerable to myriad strains is a point that can’t be overstated. “[E]ntrepreneurs must not allow business failure to destroy their self-esteem,"" tweeted industrialist Anand Mahindra. “That will bring about the death of entrepreneurship."" Aarin Capital’s T.V. Mohandas Pai has called for a shift in popular perspective. “Society should change the way it treats entrepreneurs,"" and “they should not be called thieves, etc. (without proof or substantiation)"". The details of CCD’s troubles that are available in the public domain are too sketchy for us to grasp the bleakness Siddhartha may have been staring at. The coffee chain’s parent firm, Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd, reportedly owed  ₹6,500 crore to various entities, and the net proceeds from Siddhartha’s stake sale in Mindtree—which fetched a total of  ₹3,200 crore—were insufficient; also, credit lines appear to have dried up. The tax authorities’ attachment of some assets on two occasions, it seems, worsened things for him. The tax department has defended itself, however, saying that its enforcement actions were taken in accordance with legal provisions. It said that Siddhartha had admitted an unaccounted income of  ₹362.11 crore, which he later failed to disclose in a tax return statement, prompting it to attach the assets in the “interests of revenue"".
In general, this is a country with such complex laws that it’s not uncommon for entrepreneurs to fall foul of some provision or the other—even unwittingly. Moreover, plenty of grey areas exist, especially on tax matters. Guilt in many cases is a matter of legal interpretation. Such nuances tend to be lost on the public at large, all the more so after the past few years’ uproar over black money and unpaid corporate loans. For the tax regime to be effective, India would do well to follow the due, and fair, process of law, especially when the offender is an entrepreneur. Our law enforcers and society will also have to re-examine their attitudes towards business. Siddhartha’s death could send out the wrong signal to budding Indian entrepreneurs, discouraging them from taking up new ventures. It’s up to all of us not to let that happen."

NEW DELHI :
Industry captains on Wednesday paid rich tributes to V G Siddhartha, founder of India's biggest coffee chain Cafe Coffee Day, remembering his entrepreneurial spirit and humble nature but also cautioned entrepreneurs not to let failures destroy their self-esteem.
Industry leaders such as Kiran Mazumdar Shaw of Biocon, automobile czar Anand Mahindra, Paytm's Vijay Shekhar Sharma, Sachin Bansal of Ola and IT honcho C P Rupani remembered Siddhartha as a ""humble and soft speaking"" man.
The body of the Cafe Coffee Day founder was found on Wednesday in the Netravati river in Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka after 36 hours of intense search.
In a tweet, Biocon Chairperson and Managing Director Kiran Mazumdar Shaw said, ""My deepest condolences to VG Siddhartha's widow Malavika and his sons and to Shri & Smt SM Krishna and family. RIP.""
Embattled liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya said Siddhartha was an ""Excellent human and brilliant entrepreneur"". However, Mallya added that he was ""devastated with the contents of his letter"".
""The Govt agencies and banks can drive anyone to despair. See what they are doing to me despite offer of full repayment. Vicious and unrelenting,"" he tweeted.
Siddhartha had in a purported letter written by him indicated that pressure from banks, a private equity investor and tax authorities drove him to end his life.
Karti P Chidambaram, son of Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram, who is facing ED probe in the Aircel Maxis case, said the government agencies are the biggest impediments to ease of business.
""Managing the systematic harassment by the State n it’s pliant agencies is the biggest challenge. IT, ED, CBI, ROC etc are the biggest impediments for ease of business,"" Karti said.
Meanwhile, Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra said entrepreneurs must not allow business failures to destroy their self-esteem.
""I did not know him & have no knowledge of his financial circumstances. I only know that entrepreneurs must not allow business failure to destroy their self-esteem. That will bring about the death of entrepreneurship,"" said Mahindra.
Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma tweeted that he was ""saddened beyond words.""
Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal said that Siddhartha was an ""inspiring entrepreneur and investor"".
""I had known #VGSiddhartha personally and was always amazed at his energy and positivity,"" Bansal added.
Tech Mahindra MD and CEO CP Gurnani, while saluting his entrepreneurship, said it was a ""Very sad day"".
"" ..some of us were daydreaming that he may not have jumped off the bridge ...wish he had stayed alive to fight. My heart goes out to his family,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Coffee Day Enterprises on Wednesday named independent director S V Ranganath as the interim chairman of the company.

Tech Mahindra Ltd’s shares had underperformed the market after its revenue growth fell sharply in the March quarter. Profit margins narrowed at a higher-than-expected pace as well, raising concerns about its earnings. The June quarter results, released after market hours on Tuesday, provide no major reason to alter the stock’s trajectory.
Dollar revenues grew just 1.9% year-on-year; and fell 1.6% compared to the March quarter. “In the current quarter, the company faces seasonality, however, even after factoring the seasonality, Tech Mahindra’s revenues were below our expectation,"" ICICI Direct Research said in a note.
Worse still, the fall in profitability was far higher than Street expectations. Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margins contracted 1.5 percentage points from a year ago.
As a consequence, operating earnings (Ebit) in dollar terms dropped 9% from a year ago. Sequentially, they are down as much as 26%. “Margins are way below estimates leaving room for earnings-per-share cuts,"" an analyst said in a note to his clients.
The performance is weak across key business verticals. Revenues in the communications division, the largest business vertical, were down 3.2%, sequentially. Revenues at manufacturing, banking and financial services, and retail also lagged. Contribution from the top 10 clients, who together generate more than 30% of Tech Mahindra’s revenues, has seen a notable fall sequentially. And, as if all this wasn’t bad enough, employee attrition remained elevated at 21%.
However, digital business continues to see positive momentum. Tech Mahindra acquired a US-based company at an enterprise value of $25 million to enhance its capabilities in digital transformation offerings.
Further, deal wins remain healthy with the company signing contracts worth nearly half a billion dollars, on the back of deal wins worth $408 million in the March quarter. “We remain optimistic on the demand environment, evident from a very strong pipeline and deal conversions. Digital will continue to be a primary growth driver,"" C.P. Gurnani, managing director and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
But the slow transformation of the deal wins into revenues and earnings may keep Tech Mahindra investors on the sidelines, even though valuations are less than 12 times estimated FY21 earnings."

In the wake of Cafe Coffee Day (CCD) founder VG Siddhartha's death, noted industrialist Anand Mahindra has advised entrepreneurs to not allow business failure to destroy their self-esteem.
""I did not know him & have no knowledge of his financial circumstances. I only know that entrepreneurs must not allow business failure to destroy their self-esteem. That will bring about the death of entrepreneurship,"" Anand Mahindra tweeted.
After being missing for two days, Siddhartha's body was found in Mangaluru today. He is suspected to have jumped off a bridge on Monday evening after getting down from his car.
Two days before he went missing, Siddhartha had purportedly written a letter indicating he was anxious about pressure from banks, investors and the tax authorities. He also mentioned that there were certain transactions of which no one in the company or his family was aware of.
The authenticity of the letter is, however, yet to be verified.
Coffee Day Enterprises board has initiated a probe into past transactions made by the company and Siddhartha. Shares in Coffee Day hit their lower limit for the trading day and plunged 20% to a fresh all-time low of 122.75 rupees on Wednesday, fresh off the back of another 20% slide on Tuesday.
Siddhartha, his family and their holding companies pledged or encumbered about 75.7% of their stake in Coffee Day toward various borrowings. Coffee Day's 2018 annual report showed Siddhartha had personally guaranteed most of the borrowings."
192,2019-08-01,Mahindra Mahindra,"The govt took a tough stance after firms didn’t meet the deadline for submitting plans to transition to electricNITI Aayog had asked two- and three-wheeler makers to prepare a plan for next 5 years to make transition to EVs

New Delhi: Two- and three-wheeler makers in India may be asked by the government to pay up for causing vehicular pollution if they do not meet a deadline to produce electric vehicles (EVs).
The hardening of stance comes after the manufacturers not only failed to adhere to the two-week government deadline to submit their plans to convert a part of their internal combustion engine (ICE)-driven two-wheelers and all three-wheelers into electric, but also sought four months instead.
Federal policy think tank NITI Aayog, which is spearheading the government’s EV initiatives, and the ministry of road transport and highways, among others, have been considering a policy proposal to ban all ICE-driven two-wheelers under 150cc by 2025, and three-wheelers by 2023. Nearly 80% of all vehicles sold in India are two- and three-wheelers.
At a meeting held on 21 June, NITI Aayog had asked executives of two- and three-wheeler makers to prepare a plan of action for the next five years to make the transition to EVs, and submit it within a fortnight.
In case the companies fail to meet the deadline, the government plans to impose the “polluter pays"" principle—wherein the victim of pollution has to be compensated and the manufacturer also pays for the cost of environment degradation, said a senior government official on condition of anonymity. The Centre is also not averse to further tightening the fuel efficiency norms for transportation fuels such as petrol and diesel, added the official.
“There is no question of reconsidering the decision. While some manufacturers have finally come around to the idea, there are others who are trying to lobby at different political levels to delay the inevitable,"" said another senior government official, requesting anonymity.
India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, has taken several steps in the past few months in its push to combat widespread pollution in its major cities. The government also aims to trim its hefty fuel import bill through the shift to electric vehicles.
Last month’s meeting at NITI Aayog was attended by executives of top two- and three-wheeler makers, including Bajaj Auto Ltd managing director Rajiv Bajaj, TVS Motor Co. Ltd chairman Venu Srinivasan, and Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers director general Vishnu Mathur. Even as the companies protested the suggestion, NITI Aayog asked them to spell out their respective plans in two weeks. These companies are yet to respond.
“They were supposed to get back to us in two weeks. Now they (automobile companies) have sought four months’ time... Three wheeler-makers such as Mahindra and Mahindra are ready (to switch to electric mobility). It is only the two-wheeler makers—Bajaj Auto and TVS—that are not ready and are opposing,"" said the government official cited earlier.
Queries emailed to the spokesperson of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd on Monday remained unanswered. Bajaj Auto and TVS declined to comment. NITI Aayog did not respond to an email sent on Tuesday.
At the 21 June meeting, NITI Aayog cautioned automakers that if they didn’t take steps to reduce pollution by shifting to EVs, then the courts would eventually step in.
“If the two-wheeler makers are not ready for this transition, they will be left behind as the startups (working on electric mobility) will definitely take the lead,"" the official said.
The Narendra Modi government is making an aggressive push for a cleaner and cost-effective mode of transport.
As part of the strategy, India is putting the final shape on a plan to build at least four Tesla-style giga factories to manufacture batteries with an investment of around $4 billion, as reported by Mint on 25 July. The plan to set up these factories of 10 gigawatt hours each to accomplish what Tesla has done at its Gigafactory in Nevada, US, also involves a nearly $1 billion concessional loan facility to be drawn from multilateral lenders such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Investment Bank, New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
To be sure, EVs have an almost negligible presence in India’s auto market, billed to become the world’s third largest by 2025.
“As electric vehicles represent the next generation in sustainable mobility, India must emphasize on them. Currently, the market share of electric cars is only 0.06% when compared to 2% in China and 39% in Norway,"" according to the Economic Survey 2019.
The government has been trying to incentivize the adoption of EVs through several steps in the past few months, similar to those taken by governments in China and Europe. Last Saturday, the Goods and Services Tax Council headed by finance minister Nirmala Sithraman reduced tax on EVs and chargers to 5% from 12% and 18%, respectively. Besides, in the Union budget earlier in July, Sitharaman announced tax rebates of up to  ₹1.5 lakh to customers on interest paid on loans to buy EVs, with a total exemption benefit of  ₹2.5 lakh over the entire loan period. She also announced customs duty exemption on lithium-ion cells, which will help lower the cost of lithium-ion batteries in India, as they are not produced locally.
As part of the strategy to encourage private sector investment in the strategically important sector, the government is also looking at a raft of tax incentives for manufacturers and a suitable basic customs duty safeguard from 2021-2030 for making advanced chemistry cells and battery in India.
In March, the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles or FAME 2 scheme—to expand commercial vehicle fleet—was also announced with an outlay of  ₹10,000 crore."

MUMBAI :
Mahindra Susten, the renewable business arm of Mahindra group, which is in the process of selling 160 megawatts (MW) of solar assets, has received interest from two potential buyers, CLP India and the Piramal group, said two people aware of the development, requesting anonymity.
Mint had reported in April that the Mahindra Group had appointed investment bank Avendus to seek buyers for a part of its solar portfolio.
“They (Mahindra Susten) have received interest from CLP India and Piramal, which recently tied up with Canadian pension fundCPPIB, to buy renewable assets under an infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) structure. They had received interest from other parties, too, but these two are currently looking into the deal,"" said the first person. The sale process could fetch a valuation of over  ₹1,000 crore, he added. 
“Mahindra Susten’s business model is to build and sell assets,"" said the second person, adding that it will use the sale proceeds to develop its pipeline of around 1 gigawatt (GW). 
When contacted, a Mahindra Susten spokesperson declined to comment. “At CLP, as a policy, we do not comment on market speculation,"" a CLP spokesperson said in an emailed response. Emailed queries to the Piramal group did not elicit any response.
Mahindra Susten offers diversified services within the renewable energy and cleantech space such as turnkey solar engineering, procurement and construction services, for utility-scale solar and rooftop solar products, solar car charging stations, telecom tower solarization, operations and maintenance.
CLP India, which is backed by Canada’s second largest pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), has emerged as one of the major buyers for infrastructure assets in recent times. On 3 July, Kalpataru Power Transmission announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with CLP India Pvt. Ltd to sell its stake in three power transmission assets for an enterprise valuation of  ₹3,275 crore.
Mint had reported on 29 May that CLP India was engaged in talks to acquire Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners-owned Continuum Wind Energy. Continuum has more than 700MW of operational wind assets and it has a pipeline of almost 1,700MW, making it one of the largest portfolios on sale in the market right now.
CLP’s India portfolio includes renewable and conventional energy amounting to over 3,000MW. CLP India’s sixteen wind energy projects and three solar energy projects span across seven states. The company also owns a coal-fired power plant in Haryana and a gas-based combined cycle power plant in Gujarat.
The Piramal group tied up with Canada’s largest pension fund CPPIB in May to co-sponsor India’s first renewable energy-focused infrastructure investment trust. The proposed InvIT will have an initial targeted corpus of $600 million with an option to scale up further. CPPIB and Piramal will initially allocate $360 million and $90 million, respectively, to the corpus.
The InvIT plans to acquire up to 1.5-2GW of stable and long-term cash-generating renewable assets, with a focus on diversification of clients of both solar and wind assets, as well as electricity customers. 
The Indian renewable energy space has seen strong merger and acquisition activity recently. Mint reported on 12 April that ReNew Power Ltd, India’s largest clean energy company, and state-run power utility NTPC Ltd have shown interest in the ongoing sale process of PTC India Ltd’s wind power business, which includes 290MW of wind assets. Fotowatio Renewable Ventures also plans to exit its only investment in the Indian solar power space and Engie SA is planning to sell a significant stake in the French energy firm’s Indian solar business. 
Several major M&A deals were also struck in the sector last year.
Greenko Group, one of India’s top renewable energy platforms, bought Orange Renewable from Singapore’s AT Capital Group at an enterprise value of under $1 billion and another 385MW of renewable assets from Skeiron Renewable Energy."
190,2019-08-01,Mahindra Mahindra,"The company’s passenger vehicle wholesales fell 15% YoY to 16,831 unitsThe fall in demand for LCVs is a clear indication that SMEs have also been hit

Mumbai: Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) reported a decline of 16% year-on-year (YoY) in its total domestic wholesales to 37,434 units in July, as the economic downturn continues to hurt the auto industry.
The company’s passenger vehicle wholesales fell 15% YoY to 16,831 units during the month, while commercial vehicle sales declined 17% to 15,969 units. The drop in wholesale numbers hint at more production cuts, which automakers have been undertaking to manage unsold inventory.
The company had reported a decline of 2% YoY and 9.4% YoY in passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles, respectively, in the first quarter of the current fiscal, according to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).
For M&M, the bigger decline in CV sales came from subdued sales in the light commercial vehicle (LCV) category, where the Bolero range of light trucks-- under 3.5 ton--dominates. It reported total domestic sales of LCVs, below 3.5 tons, at 14,874 units in July, down 16% YoY.
The fall in demand for LCVs is a clear indication that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have also been hit.
The medium and heavy commercial vehicle (M&HCV) category, which primarily reflects the economic health of sectors such as transportation and infrastructure, has reported a drop of 52% from 866 units sold in July last year to 417 units last month.
Commenting on company’s monthly sales performance, Veejay Ram Nakra, chief of sales and marketing, automotive division, M&M said “the headwinds faced by the automotive industry continue as a result of subdued consumer sentiment, triggered by various factors.

We hope that the overall buying sentiment will improve in the run-up to the festival season and with the monsoon turning out to be better than initially anticipated.""
Meanwhile, M&M’s farm equipment sector reported a decline of 11% YoY in domestic tractor sales to 19,174 units in July. At 818 units, tractor exports fell 26% YoY.

New Delhi: The RBI's interest rate decision, US-China trade conflict and quarterly earnings would influence trading in the equity markets this week, say analysts.
Participants will also keep an eye on taxation issues following reports that the Prime Minister's Office and the finance ministry have held talks regarding tax surcharge on FPIs announced in the Budget.
However, the key trigger this week is likely to be the Reserve Bank's three-day policy meeting, beginning Monday (5 August).
The central bank is expected to cut the benchmark interest rate for the fourth time in a row to boost the economy at time when key indicators are pointing towards a slowdown, experts said.
""The market is now awaiting the RBI meet which is scheduled this week,"" said Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research.
PMI data for the services sector is due on Monday, which would also influence trading sentiment, according to marketmen.
According to Arun Thukral, MD and CEO, Axis Securities, ""The recent correction has been driven by various factors — global weakness, selling by FPIs along with signs of a slowdown in domestic economy. Having breached the psychologically crucial levels, markets are expected to be volatile in the near term.""
Also, the ongoing results season will continue to determine the market trend.
Cipla, HCL Technologies Limited, Lupin, M&M, Tata Steel, Hexaware Technologies and GAIL India are among the major corporates scheduled to announce their results this week.
""The BSE-30 share index declined 2.1% this week led by weak domestic and global cues. Commentary of the US Federal Reserve on the future rate cut, weak underlying trends in quarterly results, slump in automobile sales dented investor sentiments,"" said Sanjeev Zarbade, VP PCG Research, Kotak Securities.
Global markets were rattled last week after US President Donald Trump announced fresh tariffs on Chinese imports, which Beijing vowed to retaliate.

187,2019-08-04,Mahindra Mahindra,"Shadow banks, or NBFCs have long funded vast chunk of auto salesDealer inventories hit 55-60 day levels, up from 45 days - FADA

MUMBAI:
Sudhir Gharpure and his sales team sat chatting at a big Maruti Suzuki dealership on the outskirts of Mumbai some two hours after its doors were opened on a recent Saturday morning - not a single customer was in sight.
""There used to be close to 15-20 bookings each day, but now we're down to 3-5 on good days,"" said Gharpure, the general manager at the dealership.
Gharpure's experience is not an isolated one. Across India dealerships are being pushed out of business and the Indian auto sector is going through its biggest slump in nearly two decades. Passenger vehicle sales fell for eight straight months until June, and in May sales dropped 20.55% - the sharpest recorded fall in 18 years.
Preliminary data indicates passenger vehicle sales may have plunged as much as 30 percent in July. The slump in India, along with a simultaneous slide in Chinese auto sales, is a blow for automakers wrestling with higher costs driven by more stringent emission norms and a push to develop electric cars.
Unlike in China, where the plunge in cars sales has been caused largely by new emissions rules, India has seen a mix of factors that have combined to erode demand for automobiles.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 2016 ban on high-value bank notes, higher tax rates under a new goods and services tax regime, a boom of ride-sharing firms such as Uber and Ola, and a weak rural economy have all played a role.
But many dealers and automakers agree it is a deepening liquidity crunch among India's shadow banks that has been the biggest single factor in an auto sales collapse, which some fear may lead to more than a million job losses.
Non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), or shadow banks, have dramatically slashed lending following the collapse of one of the biggest, IL&FS, in late 2018.
IL&FS, or Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd, was a behemoth in shadow banking and its defaults and unravelling, amid fraud allegations, have dried up funding for rivals and led to a surge in their borrowing costs.
Non-bank or shadow banking firms generate credit outside traditional lenders, by means such as collective investment vehicles, broker-dealers or funds that invest in bonds and money markets.
In India, NBFCs have in recent years helped fund nearly 55-60% of commercial vehicles both new and used, 30% of passenger cars and nearly 65% of the two-wheelers in the country, according to rating agency ICRA.
To aggravate matters, the stress in the autos market has also prompted banks to begin trimming their exposure to the sector.
""The car doesn't sell, it's the finance that sells,"" said R. Vijayaraghavan, a senior marketing consultant at the same Mumbai dealership. ""Today the finance is not selling, so the cars are not selling.""
Problems amplified
Some 286 dealerships have shut down in the last 18 months across India as rising costs for inventory management have made businesses unviable, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA), a lobby group of auto dealers.
""The slowdown in the (NBFC) sector has dragged down vehicle sales growth,"" said A.M. Karthik, financial sector head at ICRA. ""Now the auto slowdown is becoming more visible as the liquidity squeeze continues.""
Automakers including Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors , and Mahindra & Mahindra are feeling the heat and have either cut production or temporarily closed plants to correct mounting stocks.
According to FADA data, passenger vehicle inventories now stand at 50-60 days up from around 45 days earlier, while those of two-wheelers are even higher at 80-90 days. For commercial vehicles, inventory levels range between 45 and 50 days.
""We are asking dealers to maintain an inventory of 21 days, which is almost half of the current levels,"" said Ashish Kale, president of FADA.
At least four dealers from different brands said, however, there was little scope to reduce inventories as automakers were pushing them to buy stock despite there being no demand even with heavy discounting and other sops on offer.
While 70-75% of car sales were previously financed in-house by NBFC or bank agents sitting at a dealership, that has fallen to about 50%, say dealers, as buyers struggle to qualify under more stringent lending norms put in place by lenders that are under pressure to shore up their books.
Moreover, as many NBFCs typically lent to less creditworthy clients, banks are reticent to rush in to fill the void, as they themselves struggle to cope with an existing pile of about $150 billion in bad loans.
""The banking sector is certainly one of the factors that has affected the growth of the industry,"" said R.C. Bhargava, chair of Maruti Suzuki, noting interest rates for car buyers have gone up in the last 12 months despite the central bank cutting rates.
Early recovery unlikely
With the autos sector employing more than 35 million people directly and indirectly, and contributing more than 7% to India's GDP and accounting for 49% of its manufacturing GDP, the fallout from the autos slump is huge and presents a big challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government as it begins its second term.
The entire supply chain, from vehicle manufacturers to component makers, are bleeding amid the slump.
""I've been making my payments for the last 30 years and the lenders know me,"" said Adarsh Gupta, the director of finance at Autolite (India), a component manufacturing firm. ""But even a two-day delay has people crying that I will default.
""I too want to pay, but because of the fall in cashflows I'm facing short-term issues and because of that it's difficult to get more financing. This is the vicious cycle we are in.""
Still, automakers are hopeful of a recovery in the months ahead, helped by the September-December festive season that traditionally sees a surge in consumer spending.
""One can only wish that things improve sooner rather than later. With festive demand starting to seep through, we should start seeing a gradual improvement in sales,"" said P.B. Balaji, group CFO at Tata Motors.
Analysts are more sceptical though, and say without vehicle financing becoming cheaper and easier the chances for that are low. With no silver lining in sight, analysts fear bad debts could mount in the auto sector, forcing banks to further reduce their exposure.
""We see market prices and sales coming down so there may be issues,"" said a top official at the Indian Banks' Association. ""We could see a spillover in terms of bad loans for the overall sector, but we are going to wait and watch.""
Dealers said they were hopeful of tiding over the current downturn as the broader growth story for India remains intact, but there could be a lot more pain before a recovery kicks in.
""The future is going to be multi-brand car showrooms,"" said marketing consultant Vijayaraghavan. ""That is the only way for dealerships to survive going forward as overhead costs need to be shared.""

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday that the government plans to take policy measures “fairly quickly"" to address the challenges plaguing the industry. She said also that the government is open to hearing out the grievances of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs).
The minister was speaking to reporters after meeting chief executives of private and state-run banks as she kicked off a series of meetings planned with various industry heads. She met the heads of State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Punjab National Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank among others. The meeting also discussed the credit requirements of non-bank lenders, automobile industry and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and the transmission of interest rate cuts to the economy.
“Behind the series of meetings is to hear them out and fairly quickly after that come out with something that will help those sectors...We are getting inputs from various sectors and trying to respond so that the confidence of those sectors is being restored,"" Sitharaman said.
Over the next few days, the minister will meet representatives from several sectors —FPIs, automakers, industry associations, financial markets, MSMEs, industry associations and real estate to listen to their challenges. This is the first time the finance minister is meeting top executives in the second term of the National Democratic Alliance government, in a way acknowledging the ongoing economic slowdown and the government’s willingness to take inputs from businesses.
Sitharaman said the economic affairs secretary will soon hold talks with FPIs on their problems. There has been a massive outflow of overseas funds following the Union budget announcement to impose higher surcharge on some of these investors.
Bankers who attended the meeting sought the government’s intervention on tax notices asking lenders to pay service tax and Goods and Services Tax (GST) on minimum balance accounts. Banks will soon respond to the notices, Sitharaman said, adding Jan Dhan accounts and basic deposit and savings accounts do not attract any charges.
On the decision to borrow overseas in foreign currency, Sitharaman said she will not speculate on the number of tranches and the finance ministry has done nothing in this regard, besides the announcement in the budget, owing to commitments in the ongoing Parliament session.
During the March quarter, India’s economy grew at 5.8%, the slowest in five years. Growth in 2018-19 was 6.8%, down from 7.2% a year ago. Besides the slowdown in fresh private investments, subdued demand and stress at non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are affecting growth.
In signs of a persistent slowdown, India’s automobile makers are finding it hard to sell vehicles, and NBFCs and MSMEs are struggling to access credit.
Overall credit growth continues to be at 12%, which is marginally lower than 13.3% at the end of March, the finance ministry said in a statement after the meeting.
“At the same time, with turnaround in the NPA cycle, high provision cover of over 75%, and record recovery, banks’ balance sheet are healthier than before. Banks are now, therefore, in position to step up lending,"" said a finance ministry statement.
MoS for finance Anurag Thakur, finance secretary Rajiv Kumar, economic affairs secretary Atanu Chakraborty, expenditure secretary G.C. Murmu, revenue secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey, RBI deputy governor NS Vishawanathan, were among those who attended the meeting."
186,2019-08-05,Mahindra Mahindra,"Vendors are either temporarily shutting plants or adjusting output by reducing daily shifts in factoriesThe current 15-20% cut in production has led to a crisis-like situation in the auto ancillary industry

MUMBAI :
Auto parts makers in India have been hit hard by automobile companies cutting production to trim inventory amid weak demand.
The vendors are being forced to follow the path of the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) by either temporarily shutting plants or adjusting output by reducing the number of daily shifts in their factories.
Automakers such as Maruti Suzuki Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M), Ashok Leyland Ltd and Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India Ltd have temporarily closed plants in the past few months. Initial reports for July suggest that the passenger car sales have slipped by over 29% making it the worst month in the past 2 decades.
Mint reached out to more than a dozen auto parts makers and learnt that while production cuts are resulting in mounting fixed costs and loss of jobs for contractual shop floor workers, smaller businesses are beginning to default on loans.
On 20 July, Bosch Ltd, one of the largest auto parts makers in India, said it has suspended operations at its Gangaikondan plant in Tamil Nadu for five days starting 23 July to ‘avoid unnecessary buildup of inventory’. Later, it suspended operations at its Naganathapura unit in Karnataka for two days (27 and 29 July) followed by single-day shutdowns at Jaipur (27 July) and Bidadi (29 July).
Bosch is not alone. Other key tier one vendors such as Exide Industries, Continental Automotive Components (India), ZF, Brose India Automotive Systems, Schaeffler India, Brembo Brakes India, Kalyani Maxion Wheels, Varroc Group, Eaton, IAC India have adjusted their respective production schedules to align their inventory as per the revised forecasts by the car companies.
A spokesperson at Exide said capacity is usually diverted to the aftermarket segment during low demand from automakers. “So, in the short run, this works to our advantage because aftermarket offers us better margin. However, if the demand slump continues for a very long time, then there is cause for concern,"" he stated.
Kalyani Maxion Wheels shut its truck wheel manufacturing plant for five days while the car wheel facility was closed for three days, one person at the company said. Meanwhile, Brose, a German supplier of window regulators and door modules for cars, trimmed its daily production schedule from three shifts to a single shift.
“Facilities are being shut on weekends; few shifts are being suspended impacting a large proportion of contractual workers, which comprise about 50% of all manpower employed by the auto industry. Few smaller enterprises are even beginning to default on loans raised from the financial institutions due to this economic slowdown,"" said a senior industry official, who declined to be named.
Jignesh Raval, MD, Sintercom India Ltd, maker of sintered parts for engines and transmissions, said, “The offtake continues to be low from our customers. This has forced us to cut our production to two shifts to control our inventory. If we don’t see further improvements, we will have to consider a block closure for a week in August.""
The current 15-20% cut in vehicle production has led to a crisis-like situation in the auto ancillary industry and if the trend continues, an estimated one million people could be laid off, Ram Venkataramani, president, Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA) said recently.
Prashanth Doreswamy, market head, Continental India, a powertrain and chassis parts supplier, said various factors have contributed to the downturn. “We are closely monitoring our production and process costs. We are continuing to optimize them. Hiring is being looked at carefully,"" he said.
However, he said the company, which invested in two greenfield plants recently, is keeping its expansion plans on track.
Suresh K.V., head of ZF Region India, said his company is also impacted by the overall weak automobile demand. “We are carefully monitoring the situation such as inventory levels on a daily basis and balance our labour capacities between the different production lines,"" he said.
Vinodkumar Ramachandran, partner and head, Automotive and Industrial Manufacturing, KPMG in India sees vendors increasing their focus on agility and optimization of resources on weekly basis to manage costs. “They are focused on lowering their breakeven levels by converting fixed cost to variable cost and deploying technologies and automation to lower their enabling function costs,"" he added."
184,2019-08-07,Mahindra Mahindra,"According to Motilal Oswal Securities, M&M’s Q1FY20 net revenue is expected to decline 7% YoYThe company had said earlier that it plans to invest  ₹18,000 crore over the next three years

India’s largest tractor manufacturer and one of the leading players in the utility vehicle segment, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is expected to report a year-on-year decline in its revenue for April-June of the current fiscal due to declining sales across passenger and commercial vehicles, as well as tractors.
The company’s domestic wholesale volumes declined across vehicle categories during Q1FY20. According to data released by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), M&M dispatched 59,399 units of passenger vehicles in Q1, which marked a year-on-year decline of 2%. In the commercial vehicle segment, it reported a drop of more than 9% YoY with volumes at 51,594 units during the three-month period. For three-wheelers (excluding electric vehicles), the company reported domestic wholesales of 12,697 units, down 2.37% YoY.
Quarterly wholesales for M&M’s farm equipment sector were in line with the downward trend. It reported total domestic sales of 82,913 tractors for the quarter ending June, down 15% YoY. Tractor exports, on the other hand, were flat.
According to Motilal Oswal Securities, M&M’s Q1FY20 net revenue is expected to decline 7% YoY and about 10% QoQ to  ₹124.5 billion. The profit after tax (PAT), which had declined 20% in the fourth quarter of last fiscal, is expected to decline again by 20% YoY and EBIDTA margin is expected to shrink 150bp YoY to 14.3%, suggested the broking firm.
ICICI Securities expects M&M’s EBIDTA margin to decline 208bps YoY to 13.7% on account of lower production volumes, higher variable marketing expenses, and poorer product mix. The company’s outlook for growth and margin guidance in utility vehicles and tractor volumes along with updates on responses to newly launched products such as XUV300 and Marazzo remain the key factors to watch out for today.
The company had earlier said it plans to invest  ₹18,000 crore over the next three years, including  ₹12,000 crore for capex and  ₹6,000 crore in subsidiaries. M&M, which is ready with its BSVI compliant engines and is working on its production plans for this year, is not expected to launch any new major product in FY20. The company, however, has plans to begin rolling out new products in FY21."
183,2019-08-07,Mahindra Mahindra,"A slump in sales is also triggering massive job cuts in the sector that employs 35 million people directly and indirectlyM&M's heavy goods segment, which makes trucks and tippers, saw its worst growth in nearly six years

MUMBAI/BENGALURU :
Indian automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) said on Wednesday it saw a ""huge danger"" of job losses in the ailing domestic auto sector, as it sought government intervention, including tax reductions to revive demand.
A lending crisis among the country's shadow banks, which fund nearly 55-60% of commercial vehicles and 30% of passenger cars, has led to automakers, including M&M and its rivals Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd, to either cut production or temporarily close plants.
M&M said in a statement it was only able to maintain margins due to falling commodity prices and the government must reduce the goods and services tax (GST) rate to spur demand.
A slump in sales is also triggering massive job cuts in the sector that employs 35 million people directly and indirectly. Reuters reported on Tuesday that initial estimates suggest automakers, parts manufacturers and dealers have laid off about 350,000 workers since April.
""Now job losses are happening in four areas OEMs (original equipment makers), suppliers, dealers and unorganised sector,"" Managing Director Pawan Goenka told reporters in Mumbai in a post-earnings press meet.
M&M's heavy goods segment, which makes trucks and tippers, saw its worst growth in nearly six years, the company added, as it reported a June-quarter consolidated profit that nearly halved from a year ago to 9.14 billion rupees ($129.10 million).
""Given the current challenging global and domestic growth environment, a concerted policy effort will be required to prop sentiment, put a floor under consumption and revive growth,"" M&M said.

MUMBAI :
Mahindra & Mahindra on Wednesday reported a 52.56% decline in consolidated profit after tax to  ₹894.11 crore in the first quarter ended June 30, hit by lower vehicle sales.
The company had posted a consolidated profit after tax of  ₹1,884.66 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year, Mahindra & Mahindra said in a regulatory filing.
Its total income during the June 2019 period stood at  ₹26,289.48 crore as compared to  ₹26,260.64 crore in the same quarter a year ago.
In the first quarter, M&M said its total vehicle sales stood at 1,23,690 units as against 1,30,484 units in the year-ago period, down 5%.
Tractor sales fell 15% to 82,013 units, compared to 96,527 units a year ago.
Exports of vehicles and tractors were at 10,923 units, against 12,730 units in the year-ago quarter, showing a drop of 14 per cent.
M&M said passenger vehicles demand continues to be impacted by the slowing down of the overall economy, which along with tight credit conditions and delayed monsoon has impacted consumer sentiment in both urban and rural India.
The stress in the agriculture sector and finance availability has impacted the demand for pick-up segment of light commercial vehicles, it added.
The heavy commercial goods vehicle segment has posted a de-growth of 32 per cent, the worst reduction in 23 quarters.
""The slowing down of economic activity coupled with the increase in freight capacity of existing fleet due to implementation of new axle loading norms has resulted in many transporters either reducing or temporarily suspending their fleet-purchase plans,"" the company added.
Tractor demand in the first quarter of 2019-20 remained sluggish and was adversely impacted due to a weak sentiment in the agriculture economy resulting from the delay in southwest monsoon, poor spatial distribution in June and weak agricultural incomes impacted by poor price realisation, it added.
On the outlook, the company said, ""Domestically, data broadly paints a picture of subdued demand, notably in private consumption with firms and households continuing to hold back spending.""
The lagged effect of interest rate cuts, liquidity infusion and targeted fiscal spending after the Budget, especially government actions on improving incomes for farmers, cash transfers and sops for affordable housing, could provide support to growth going forward, it added
""However, given the current challenging global and domestic growth environment, a concerted policy effort will be required to prop sentiment, put a floor under consumption and revive growth,"" M&M said."
181,2019-08-07,Mahindra Mahindra,"Anand Mahindra says most obvious and welcome first aid would be some temporary relief on the GST front, either by modifying the slabs, or, if that is not possible, by removing the cessMahindra also urged that the auto industry needs lending support for suppliers as well as the dealers

Mumbai: Anand Mahindra, chairman Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), has urged the government to take a few short-term measures for reviving the automotive industry including revising the goods and services tax (GST) or removing the cess, and by rolling back the hike in road tax mandated by state governments.
“The most obvious and welcome first aid would be some temporary relief on the GST front, either by modifying the slabs, or, if that is not possible, by removing the cess. Another suggestion would be a re-look at the registration fees, which have gone up very substantially and a roll back of the increases in road tax mandated by state governments after the introduction of GST. I’m hopeful that these few actions along with the traditional post monsoon revival will set us back on track and positively impact the economy,"" Mahindra said.
He, however, said that he understood the government’s skepticism on giving GST concessions. “I can well understand the government’s hesitancy in looking at GST concessions. But there is a paradox here. The auto industry contributes revenues of upwards of  ₹180,000 crores to government treasuries. The paradox is that while the government needs to be lauded for its fiscal responsibility, the current slowdown in the auto industry poses a greater threat to the financial arithmetic.""
Highlighting the impact of auto industry slowdown on government’s tax collection, Mahindra, quoting Siam estimates, said, “The slowdown has resulted in an 8% loss in GST collection in the first six months of 2019. Just to catch up with the FY19 GST collections, the auto industry will need to grow at a rate of at least 7% in the remaining 8 months of the FY20.""
On liquidity crunch, difficulties in raising loans, and the cut in repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India today, Mahindra urged that the auto industry needs lending support for suppliers as well as the dealers.
“On the resource side, we need support for wholesale and retail financing. On this front, I think all the right steps are being taken. The rate cuts necessary for revival have been put in place and the future looks brighter for our stressed NBFCs. I am confident that these measures will bear fruit, creating greater liquidity for NBFCs, which will ultimately make its way into the hands of the consumer. I would appeal to lenders to take a more supportive approach to the suppliers and dealers, who are the backbone of the auto ecosystem,"" he remarked while speaking at the 73rd annual general meeting (AGM).
Mahindra, who backs the government push on electric vehicle (EV) adoption, said making India the global manufacturing hub of EVs is “a clear and achievable goal."""

Mumbai: Mahindra & Mahindra, which reported on Wednesday a 52.56% decline in consolidated profit after tax to  ₹894.11 crore in the first quarter ended June 30 due to lower volume growth, has said it plans to roll out a range of new electric vehicles.
At the same time, chairman Anand Mahindra at the company's 73rd annual general meeting said there is a ""tectonic shift"" occurring in the industry and the time is ripe for that shift.
He said that the task of going all EVs is achievable and India has the potential to become a hub for these vehicles. ""To come back to the joint road-map, I can see a clear and achievable goal to make India the global hub for EVs,"" Mahindra said.
He also said that the company is investing  ₹12,000 crore for capex over next 3 years in addition to an investment of  ₹6,000 crore in its subsidiaries over the same time. In total, M&M is investing  ₹18,000 crore over next 3 years.
Commenting on the government's EV push, Mahindra told shareholders, ""Why should it come as a surprise that the government is putting all its weight behind the introduction of EVs.""
The company already has the electric version of its Verito sedan and it will bring out at least three more e-four wheelers in another two and half year, said Pawan Goenka, managing director, M&M at the announcement of the Q1 earnings.

""Its worth mentioning that our performance has been better than the performance of the industry, across all the sectors in which we operate.
""In the three wheeler segment, industry de-grew 7% and we only de-grew 2.4%; in commercial vehicles, we were slightly better than industry (9.4% vs 9.5% degrowth) and in passenger vehicles, while industry de- grew 18%, we de-grew less than 2%,"" said Mahindra.
Although the industry has been facing challenges so far, we are now experiencing the full bounty of the monsoons, he said.
""This teamed with the forecast of normalisation of rain in August and September, makes me hopeful that there will be an uptick in the industry,"" he told shareholders.
Welcoming the government's push for electric vehicles, Mahindra said,""we have a long engagement with EVs. We are fully future ready, and just waiting for the wave to rise.""
On the other hand, Goenka at the results announcement said while the electric three wheelers are a 'low hanging fruit', the company will be rolling with new electric four wheeler as well.
""On the four wheeler portfolio, we only have an electric Verito now, by the end of this year, we will launch the electric KUV, followed by S210 a year later, then an E- Aspire six months after that,"" Goenka said.
With the five percent GST reduction, the business case for EVerito becomes almost even, he said.
At present, Mahindra currently has about 1,500-2,000 e-Veritos in the market.
The industry is currently going through one of the biggest slow downs in the recent times, he said adding the retail financing is a problem because of host of issues such as liquidity, interest rates and the banks tightening norms for financing.
""This has led to non-availability of financing to some customers that is one of the reasons for degrowth to some extent in the industry,"" he added.
He said that the the interest rate cuts have also not been passed on and they are going to stay because of which transaction cost remains still very high, which has in turn resulted in price hike.
The overall GDP growth, the delayed monsoon, rural spending and income all factors together have led to negative sentiment, he said.
Seeking a cut in the GST rates, Goenka said the industry needs some kind of shot in the arm and therefore we will have to wait and see what the government decides to do for the auto industry.
""A 6-7 percent reduction in excise duty during the period of earlier recessions, have led the industry take-off in the past. What we need right now is to have some kind of relief in GST. Hope it comes and that will definitely help the industry to change the sentiment,"" Goenka said.
Noting that the fall in sales in tractors was a due to the macroeconomic factors that are affecting the industry, he projected a flat growth for the tractor industry this fiscal with a ""positive bias,"" including monsoon, which had just 6% deficit till Tuesday of the normal.
He said that in the current environment, there is a huge danger of job losses, which are happening in areas like OEMS, suppliers, dealers and unorganised sectors or typically the service sector.
He also said that as many as 260 dealerships have been closed in the last 6-9 months due to lack of affordability amid the downturn."
179,2019-08-07,Mahindra Mahindra,"Govt needs to be lauded for fiscal responsibility, but auto slump a threat to fiscal arithmetic, says chairman Mahindra said a revival of the auto industry would lead to a revival of freight, leading to a revival of truck sales

As a vicious slowdown in the automobile sector puts millions of jobs at risk, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) chairman Anand Mahindra has called for a reduction in various taxes and levies to breathe life back into the industry.
“The most obvious and welcome first aid would be some temporary relief on the GST front, either by modifying the slabs, or, if that is not possible, by removing the cess,"" Mahindra said at the company’s 73rd annual general meeting (AGM) in Mumbai. “Another suggestion would be a re-look at the registration fees, which have gone up very substantially and a roll back of the increases in road tax mandated by state governments after the introduction of GST. I’m hopeful that these few actions along with the traditional post-monsoon revival will set us back on track and positively impact the economy.""
However, Mahindra said he understood the government’s scepticism on giving GST concessions. “I can well understand the government’s hesitancy in looking at GST concessions. But there is a paradox here. The auto industry contributes revenues of upwards of  ₹180,000 crore to government treasuries. The paradox is that while the government needs to be lauded for its fiscal responsibility, the current slowdown in the auto industry poses a greater threat to the financial arithmetic.""
Highlighting the impact of the auto industry slowdown on tax collection, Mahindra, citing Siam estimates, said, “The slowdown has resulted in an 8% loss in GST collection in the first six months of 2019. Just to catch up with the FY19 GST collections, the auto industry will need to grow at a rate of at least 7% in the remaining eight months of the FY20.""
He called the auto industry “a living, breathing ecosystem that has economic and social repercussions well beyond the number of vehicles sold.""
“In India, it constitutes 7.1% of the GDP, and 49% of the manufacturing GDP. Inclusive of its value chain, it supports almost 37 million jobs. Its ecosystem runs wide and deep,"" said Mahindra, stressing the auto sector is a key driver of the economy in almost every country “with a huge multiplier effect"".
Mahindra said a revival of the auto industry would lead to a revival of freight, leading to a revival of truck sales. “All this revival would lead to the revival of jobs and hence, consumption. In a virtuous cycle, that would get us closer to the $5 trillion economy, which is our common goal,"" he added.
On the liquidity crunch, difficulties in raising loans, and Wednesday’s cut in the repo rate, Mahindra said the auto industry needs lending support for suppliers as well as the dealers. “On the resource side, we need support for wholesale and retail financing. On this front, I think all the right steps are being taken. The rate cuts necessary for revival have been put in place and the future looks brighter for our stressed NBFCs. I am confident that these measures will bear fruit, creating greater liquidity for NBFCs, which will ultimately make its way into the hands of the consumer. I would appeal to lenders to take a more supportive approach to the suppliers and dealers, who are the backbone of the auto ecosystem,"" he remarked.
Mahindra, who has backed the government push on electric vehicle adoption, said making India a global manufacturing hub for EVs is “a clear and achievable goal."""
176,2019-08-08,Mahindra Mahindra,"Asian shares braced for more volatilityPakistan on Wednesday said it will downgrade diplomatic ties with India

Indian stock markets are likely to be under pressure on Thursday amidst geo-political tension. Asian shares braced for more volatility on Thursday as eye-catching easings by central banks stoked fears of global recession, driving US yields to near-record lows and lifting gold past $1,500 for the first time since 2013.
Spot gold was last at $1,503.56 per ounce, having been as far as $1,510. The precious metal has surged 16% since May as the worsening Sino-US trade dispute sparked a rush to safe havens.
Early Thursday, Asian share markets were wobbly, as investors tried to find their footing after enduring a string of heavy losses. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.03%, having shed 8% in less than two weeks.
Japan’s Nikkei inched up 0.1%, and away from seven-month lows. There was much relief that Wall Street had managed a late come back overnight, so that the Dow ended with a loss of just 0.09% having been down 500 points at one stage. The S&P 500 tacked on 0.08% and the Nasdaq 0.38%.
Back home, the Reserve Bank of India’s consumer confidence survey released on Wednesday reported a drop in consumer confidence in July as Indian households remained pessimistic about jobs and the general economic situation.
Anand Mahindra, chairman Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), has urged the government to take a few short-term measures for reviving the automotive industry including revising the goods and services tax (GST) or removing the cess, and by rolling back the hike in road tax mandated by state governments.
InterGlobe Aviation Ltd’s independent director Anupam Khanna has questioned chairman M Damodaran’s style of functioning and stressed the importance of keeping shareholders and regulators informed of any uncertainty related to the ongoing feud between the founders of the airline.
Markets regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), on Wednesday evening, tightened the norms for pledging of shares by promoters of listed companies.
Pakistan on Wednesday said it will downgrade diplomatic ties with India and suspend bilateral trade, asking India to withdraw its envoy to Pakistan in retaliation against the reorganization of Jammu and Kashmir and revocation of its special status.
Meanwhile, yields on US 30-year bonds dived as deep as 2.123%, not far from an all-time low of 2.089% set in 2016. Ten-year yields dropped further below three-month rates, an inversion that has reliably predicted recessions in the past.
The latest spasm began when central banks in New Zealand, India and Thailand surprised markets with aggressive easings, while the Philippines is expected to cut later Thursday.
The euro has also bounced to $1.1217, from a two-year trough of $1.1025, while the US dollar index has backtracked to 97.595, from a recent peak of 98.932. New Zealand’s dollar was still picking up the pieces after sliding as much as 2.6% on Wednesday when the country’s central bank slashed rates by a steep 50 basis points and flagged the risk of negative rates. The kiwi was huddled at $0.6447 having shed 1.3% for the week so far.
Oil prices were attempting a recovery as talk that Saudi Arabia was mulling options to halt crude’s descent helped offset a build in stockpiles and fears of slowing demand. Brent crude futures climbed $1.20 to $57.43, though that followed steep losses on Wednesday, while US crude rose $1.23 to $52.32 a barrel.

Bengaluru: Indian automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd said on Thursday it plans to open a plant in Flint, Michigan, to make vehicles including mail delivery trucks for the US market, a move that could create up to 2,000 jobs.
Mahindra already produces its off-road Roxor vehicle at its manufacturing facility in Auburn Hills, Michigan, which is at full capacity.
""A significant facility expansion is envisioned to support manufacturing and assembly of new products for the US market,"" Mahindra said in a statement.
Production of the company's mail delivery trucks is dependent on Mahindra winning the United States Postal Service's 'next generation delivery vehicle' contract, which will be announced later this year and has four other contenders, the company said.
Mahindra said it is also in talks with several other states that have suitable sites, and its decision could be influenced in part by the financial incentives that Michigan will provide.
""While we're keeping our options open, we think the former Buick City site in Flint would be a great fit for us,"" said Rick Haas, chief executive officer of Mahindra Automotive North America.

The unprecedented slowdown in India’s automobile industry has severely hit automakers with Nissan Motor Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. bearing the maximum brunt of shuttered retail outlets.
Car market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) and Renault also witnessed several dealership outlets close amid a sharp fall in demand.
Japan’s Nissan had the most shutdowns with 44 dealer outlets closing in the 18-months through April 2019, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (Fada). Nissan has been witnessing lower sales of its namesake as well as Datsun brand of vehicles in India.
Hyundai closed 39 dealerships during the period as overall customer orders fell despite robust demand for its recently introduced Venue compact sport-utility vehicle model.
Growing economic uncertainties, rise in insurance costs and an ongoing credit crunch has crimped automobile demand. Rural sentiments have been hit by irregular rainfall this year. Passenger vehicle sales have fallen for the ninth month in a row in July. With banks tightening credit norms for dealers, many have been starved of funds, forcing them to pull down the shutters.
Fada, which represents about 15,000 dealerships and 26,000 outlets across India, said a total of 286 dealership outlets downed their shutters in the 18 month-period.
The closure of retail outlets along with manpower downsizing across the 26,000 outlets has resulted in losses of about 200,000 direct and indirect jobs during the May to July period, adding to the 32,000 people who lost their jobs in the prior 18-months ended April, said Ashish Harsharaj Kale, president, Fada. He said the 26,000 dealer outlets employ about 2.5 million people.
“The dealerships are beginning to reduce manpower costs, which is the last resort among other cost cutting measures for us. While the vehicle manufacturers are now helping us control inventory, June and July were the worst months for trade. Our initial estimates suggest that about 7-8% of manpower reduction has taken place in the last three months,"" he said. Nissan contested that only 25 outlets have seen closures in the past 18 months.
“While we have had 25 outlets closures in the last one and a half year, at present, we have over 270 touchpoints across 220 cities and will continue to strengthen our presence across the country,"" said a spokesperson for Nissan India.
Hyundai did not respond to queries until press time.
Meanwhile, Tata Motors and M&M saw closures of 27 and 24 dealership outlets respectively, including both passenger and commercial vehicle retail outlets. Renault, Honda and Ford had 21, 19 and 17 dealership outlets close down, respectively, in the same period, according to Fada. Only 13 dealerships outlets of Maruti Suzuki closed down, which has the biggest retail network among domestic automakers.
S.N. Barman, vice president, sales and marketing, Tata Motors (TML) said, “During these 19 months, we have severed our relationship with 22 dealer principals. This was primarily done due to non-compliance with TML business objectives, customer interests and market coverage.""
Barman said TML has appointed more than 59 new dealer principals who opened 93 outlets. In an e-mailed response, an M&M spokesperson said, “In the past 18 months we have had a few dealer closures across the country and this is nothing unusual.""
Maruti Suzuki, Renault and Honda did not respond to emailed queries."
177,2019-08-08,Mahindra Mahindra,"Investors reckon that the auto segment’s operating performance was worse than expectedIt is well known that the general mood in the auto industry is sombre

Shares of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) touched a new 52-week low on Wednesday, mirroring investor disappointment about the company’s June quarter results.
Indeed, revenue and profit margins came slightly ahead of the Street’s forecasts. But the all-round weakness in revenue and profit underscored weakness in both automotive (auto) and farm equipment (FE) segments.
Overall, M&M’s June quarter net revenue of  ₹12,805.5 crore (including Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Ltd) was 4.1% lower year-on-year. Further, negative operating leverage due to plummeting sales dented the Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin, which fell by 180 basis points to 14%. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Investors reckon that the auto segment’s operating performance was worse than expected. Even improved realizations failed to compensate for the cost pressures. The upshot: the Ebit margin declined by a sharp 290 basis points to 6.5%.
According to Bharat Gianani, an analyst at Sharekhan Ltd, “This was below the estimated 8.8%. Higher marketing expense on the back of new launches and increased discounting dragged the auto segment margins.""
It is well known that the general mood in the auto industry is sombre. In passenger vehicles (PVs), Q1 FY20 marks the fourth quarter of contraction in sales, the worst since Q3 FY01. The company adds that 32% year-on-year drop in commercial vehicle (CV) sales makes it the worst-ever in 23 quarters. Note that M&M has a presence in both PVs and CVs.
This is not to say that there was any respite in the FE segment. Sales fell 14.3%, in tandem with the industry sales drop during the quarter. Weak and untimely monsoon with poor spatial distribution led to weak price realizations in this segment. This hurt the Ebit margin, which narrowed by 160 basis points to 19.3%.
In short, on the whole, weak sales and margins translated into a 15% year-on-year drop in Ebitda to  ₹1,794 crore.
The saga doesn’t end here. Sales across the board continue to plummet, raising concerns about the anticipated demand pickup in the second half of FY20. July figures were dismal too, with auto segment sales declining by 16% year-on-year and FE sales by 12% year-on-year.
Hopes are that the pickup in the monsoon and close to 110 basis point rate cut by the central bank so far in 2019 should improve sentiment both in rural and urban areas.
On Wednesday, the M&M stock ultimately closed 6% lower. Since April, the stock has dropped 23%, worse than the 18% and 8% drop in the Nifty Auto index and the Nifty 200 index, respectively. This is not surprising given that the auto giant, a formidable force in both auto and FE segments, is not immune to the slowdown."

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), India’s leading manufacturers of utility vehicles (UVs) and it’s wholly owned subsidiary, Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Limited (MVML), has notified BSE that it will be observing no production days for 8-14 days across plants in Q2FY20.
“The Company at its Automotive Sector, and Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (""MVML""), as part of aligning its production with sales requirements, would be observing 'No Production Days' ranging between 8 -14 days in various plants of the Company and MVML during the second quarter of the Financial Year 2019-2020,"" it said in the public notification.
The step is taken as a measure to control the accumulating inventory of passenger vehicles across its dealership network and at the stockyards at its manufacturing plants. The company saw a decline of 15% and 16% year-on-year in passenger car and commercial vehicle wholesales respectively in July, as a direct result of the downsizing of vehicle production in previous month(s).
The company also said that it does not envisage any adverse impact on availability of vehicles in the market due to adequacy of vehicle stocks to serve the market requirements."
173,2019-08-10,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra and Mahindra has been leading the electric vehicle evolution in IndiaGovernment has been trying to encourage adoption of electric mobility through a number of policy initiatives 

In an indication that mass adoption of electric vehicles in India is still some years away, a shareholder of Mahindra and Mahindra - country’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer by quite a margin - asked managing director Pawan Goenka when the company will venture into or launch electric vehicles.
This incident left Goenka - one of the veterans in the Indian automobile industry- dismayed as Mahindra has been the pioneer in developing electric vehicles in Indian.
“In Mahindra AGM our shareholders asked us when are we getting into EVs. If after producing and selling EVs for 9 yrs, after having 5000 eCars on the INDIAN roads, after 135 M eMiles behind us if our share holders don’t know that we make EVs, we have failed in our communication,"" tweeted Pawan Goenka a day after the annual general meeting in Mumbai.
Mahindra has been leading the electric vehicle evolution in India and is expected to launch electric variant of two of its popular products - KUV100 and XUV 300. The company will also launch a third product in collaboration with Ford Motor Company.
Apart from the the electric sedan E-verito, Mahindra has also launched its new electric three wheeler Treo and have partnered with start ups like Smart E to supply its eco-friendly vehicles.
None of the automakers in India have such diversified products in the electric space as of now.
Mahindra has also set up a lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant in Maharashtra with South Korea’s LG Chen. The company has also invested more than  ₹1000 crore on setting up a capacity to develop and manufacturer electric powertrains in Karnataka which will be supplied to other automakers in closing subsidiary Ssangyong Motor Co.
The union government has been trying to encourage adoption of electric mobility through a number of policy initiatives as it wants to curb crude imports and high level of pollution in Indian cities.
Pushing ahead with its goal to have more electric vehicles to curb rampant pollution afflicting major cities and trim costly oil imports, the government has, from 1 April 2019, started the second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME 2) scheme, with an outlay of  ₹10,000 crore. Although this sum may not be significant compared to some developed countries, the incentives announced in the budget for this sector will go a long way in restoring the confidence of investors and customers alike.
In her maiden budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced income tax rebates of up to  ₹1.5 lakh to customers on interest paid on loans to buy electric vehicles, with a total exemption benefit of  ₹2.5 lakh over the entire loan period. The minister also announced customs duty exemption on lithium–ion cells, which will help lower the cost of lithium-ion batteries in India as they are not produced locally. Makers of components such as solar electric charging infrastructure and lithium storage batteries and other components will be offered investment linked income tax exemptions under Section 35 AD of the Income Tax Act, and other indirect tax benefits."

171,2019-08-13,Mahindra Mahindra,"The fund, managed by Kotak Investment Advisors, is anchored by a $500 million commitment from ADIAKotak Special Situations Fund looks to invest in stressed assets opportunities

Kotak Special Situations Fund, which aims to invest in distressed assets, has reached its final close with total commitments of $1 billion ( ₹7,000 crore) from investors, a top executive said.
The fund, launched in February 2019, is anchored by a $500 million commitment from sovereign wealth fund Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). The fund will be managed by Kotak Investment Advisors Ltd.
Other investors are sovereign wealth funds and one very large family foundation based out of India, Srini Sriniwasan, managing director and chief executive officer of Kotak Investment Advisors Ltd said in a phone interview. The capital, he said, could be deployed at any point over the next four years while the fund life will be about ten years.
“This is a sector-agnostic fund that addresses the stressed assets problem in the country. Right now, the stressed asset opportunity can be divided into two parts—one is for those assets that are going through the NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) process and the others are those companies, which under the new RBI’s (Reserve Bank of India) dispensation, allow for a potential one-time settlement with their lenders to avoid the NCLT process. We are happy to finance both these opportunities,"" said Sriniwasan.
“The average ticket size could be anywhere between  ₹350-700 crore for a single investment as we don’t want to have a very high concentration of a single stressed asset. But in terms of our actual ability to do a transaction, we can do much larger deals of more than  ₹1,200-1,500 crore each, because our investors have given us capital with the expectation that we will be able to show them additional co-investment opportunities so they can put more capital to work. In that sense, we would be interested in any transaction that is between  ₹350-1,500 crore?,"" he added.
With the final close of its special situations fund, Kotak joins other investors that have been tapping the distressed debt opportunity in India, which has the world’s worst non-performing loan ratio.
The country’s banking system saw its bad loans peak at 11.5% in March 2018 and then decline to 9.3% in March this year.
The Reserve Bank of India expects gross non-performing assets to decline further to 9% by March next year, as capital infusions from the government help public sector banks, while private sector banks tap markets to raise capital.
“The Kotak Special Situations Fund has been closed at an opportune time for us. We have a flexible investment mandate enabling us to provide much needed capital to address the short-term financial dislocation in the market as well as long-term capital to address the NPL (non-performing loan) issue,"" said Sriniwasan.
In January, Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd closed its distressed assets focused fund EISAF II, with a corpus of $1.3 billion. AION Capital, a joint venture between US-headquartered global private equity fund Apollo Global and domestic alternative assets manager ICICI Venture, is on the road to raise its second fund, targeting a corpus of over $1 billion.
Aditya Birla Capital Ltd, the financial services arm of Aditya Birla Group, has tied up with alternative assets manager Varde Partners to invest in distressed assets in India.
Other investors active in the space include Piramal Enterprises Ltd which has set up a distressed asset investment platform with Bain Capital Credit, in order to invest $1 billion in stressed assets, Hong Kong-based SSG Capital Management and new entrants such as Cerberus Capital Management Lp.
“In addition to the opportunities that arise out of the IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) process, the fund also has the flexibility to provide structured credit solutions in the current environment where capital availability is scarce,"" said Sriniwasan.
“That may be a short-term investment opportunity for companies that are facing liquidity issues, and we have the flexibility to participate in such opportunities as well,"" he added.
Kotak Investment Advisors is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and was set up in 2005 with its first private equity fund.
So far, the alternate assets business has raised $3.8 billion across different asset classes including private equity funds, real estate funds, infrastructure funds, the special situations credit fund and listed equities."
169,2019-08-14,Mahindra Mahindra,"New-age private institutions boast of an interdisciplinary approach to learning and globally noted academics as teachersKrea signals the taking roots of private universities in the higher education sector in India

Bengaluru: What connects former Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan, Biocon Ltd. Chairman Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Anand Mahindra, chairman of Mahindra Group, Aditya Mittal, president of Arcelor-Mittal, Dheeraj Hinduja, chairman of Ashok Leyland, Sajjan Jindal, Chairman of JSW Group, and Anu Aga, Director of Thermax, and some others of the same league?
Apart from being the thought leaders of India Inc., they are all on the governing council of an ambitious  ₹750 crore project started on Tuesday to change the way liberal arts is taught in the country, through an upcoming university 70 km away from Chennai, in Andhra Pradesh’s Sri City, called Krea.
Apart from Rajan himself, the academic council at Krea include John Etchemendy, former provost at Stanford, to Manjul Bhargava, noted mathematics professor at Princeton, to TM Krishna, musician, writer and public intellectual. The first batch of students, 110 of them in total, began their classes in ‘School of Interwoven Arts and Sciences’ on Tuesday as teachers introduce themselves like doing a Ted Talk presentation.
“The whole experience will be very different, not just the curriculum,"" said Kapil Viswanathan, Vice-Chairman of Krea. “First, we are bringing together the arts with the sciences, we believe that even if you want to be a poet, you need to learn data science. Likewise, if you want to be a computer scientist, you still need to understand humanities from the point of view of aesthetics and art.""
Krea signals the taking roots of private universities in the higher education sector in India, where lack of quality of top-notch institutions like Harvard makes students spend an estimated $6 billion to study abroad. New-age private institutions like Ashoka University, O P Jindal Global University, Shiv Nadar University and now Krea University boast of an interdisciplinary approach to learning and globally noted academics as teachers. Funded with private capital, they are also free from the limitations of public sector universities and have global ambitions.
In simple terms, it shows higher education sector in India is coming of age, said Raghuram Rajan, in an earlier interview to Mint. “I think it combines a few trends. One is that we now have relatively wealthy entrepreneurs who are finding some way to give back. And it is no longer, say, building a temple. The second is the desire for higher education has exploded, especially quality in higher education,"" he said.
“The number of quality institutions we have, haven't been changed. Yes, the government is setting about creating more IITs and so on. But those are very strongly limited by the number of faculties. So if you multiply the IITs by four, you can provide the land and funding, but you can't provide the faculty overnight, especially if some of the salaries that are at big pay. The supply is limited. Much of the supply has to be obtained by drawing on or bringing back students from abroad, bringing back faculty through navigating the world. So that limits what public universities can do. These actually create openings for a private university,"" Rajan said.
“There is not a single Indian university in the top 300-400, except IISc perhaps. So the idea was to create a world-class university located in India. It's there in the name itself. We wanted to be creative and action-oriented,"" said Sunder Ramaswamy, noted economist and Krea’s vice-chancellor. “We are different in a couple of fundamental ways— we have faculty across the board, the way we admitting students is extremely different from others, and we don't want any discipline untouched other than engineering,"" he said.
“I was fascinated with this idea of creating a new paradigm in under-education,"" said N Vagul, former chairman of ICICI Bank Limited and a board member at Krea, when asked about he joined the experiment. “When I was a youngster, I wanted certain things to change, like casteism, communalism, corruption. But nothing has changed, only multiplied,"" he said.
“Our undergraduate education is all about getting a job. The parameters of the success of any business school in India has become the placement record, not what they teach or what they learn. And it is reflected in society. When you grow up, when the environment changes around you, you are not adopted into the new environment. You still stuck,"" Vagul said.
What does they want to achieve? R Seshasayee, former chairman of Infosys another board member, says three things: “One, we want this institution to set a new standard of higher learning. Second, in this process, we will also develop a new way of learning, which is interwoven learning. This is an experimentation, but so far this idea has caught on people from the academic world, who are all very reputed leaders, all of them believe that this is an idea whose time has come. Third, we would want students to go through this institution to become leaders, not only do we need leaders who have a domain expert on one subject or the other, but are capable of making a social impact in an ethical fashion."""

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), along with its local partner in Sri Lanka Ideal Motors, has set up the island nation's first passenger car assembly plant.
The Indian carmaker has set up a joint venture with Ideal Motors, its dealer partner in Sri Lanka for 10 years. The 65:35 JV between Ideal Motors and M&M is christened Mahindra Ideal Lanka Private Limited, which will operate the assembly plant at Welipenna, about 60 km from Colombo. The vehicle assembly unit will also see a vendor development park coming up in the vicinity.
Inaugurated today in the presence of the Prime Minister of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Pawan Goenka, MD, M&M Ltd, Arvind Mathew, chief of international operations, M&M among others, the assembly plant is set up with an investment of 2 billion Sri Lankan rupees.
The unit will have an installed yearly capacity of up to 5,000 units and will provide direct and indirect employment to about 200 people over the next two years.
The CKD (completely knocked down) unit plant, which has a clear operational roadmap for the next three years, will roll out several vehicles starting from M&M's compact sports utility vehicle (SUV) KUV100. The first vehicle was rolled out today. The local assembly operations include localisation of four components such as tyres, batteries, exhausts and seating systems. While tyres will be supplied by Ceat tyres, the automotive batteries will come from the battery maker Exide, both Indian companies with footprints in Sri Lanka.
""Sri Lanka is one of the top strategic markets for M&M. More than 75,000 Mahindra vehicles ply on the roads here and we have a strong network of 400 touchpoints across the country, thanks to Ideal Motors. Since there is a government push for electric vehicles in Sri Lanka, we have already planned two EVs for this market. We will bring our electric three-wheeler here,"" said Goenka.
The Sri Lanka passenger car market's size is in the range of 32,000-35,000 units per annum, of which new car sales account for only 25%."

NEW DELHI :
Automobile manufacturing companies are betting big on upcoming new launches to entice customers to showrooms during the festive season at a time when vehicle sales are languishing. Four mass market vehicle manufacturers,Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Renault India Pvt ltd and Kia Motors India Ltd, will introduce at least five new offerings just before the start of the festive season.
Maruti Suzuki will launch its new multi-utility vehicle XL 6, to be sold from the Nexa chain of dealerships. The company will also introduce a hatchback named S-Presso just before Diwali.
Hyundai will launch its hatchback Grand I 10 Nios next week and this will be the third launch of the company in the current calendar year. Hyundai Motor Group’s another subsidiary Kia Motors India Ltd will introduce its first vehicle Seltos during the next week as well. The South Korean manufacturer has also received significant number of bookings for its first product.
French vehicle manufacturer Renault will be eyeing to make a comeback in the Indian market with the Triber, a seven-seater sport utility vehicle within the sub-4 metre range. This product will be crucial for the company after its previous product Captur (an SUV) didn’t draw enough volumes.
Due to a credit crunch, lack of consumption demand and change in regulations such as a hike in insurance premiums of new safety features like anti-lock braking systems, sales of automobiles across segments have declined drastically, which led to massive job losses as automobile makers reduce production.
India’s passenger vehicle industry suffered its worst sales performance in nearly 19 years in July as a slowing economy, higher ownership costs and floods in some states deterred buyers.
Sales fell 31% to 200,790 vehicles last month from 290,931 units a year earlier, showed data released on Tuesday by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). It was the worst sales performance since a 35% decline in December 2000.
This was also the ninth straight drop in monthly passenger vehicle sales. Sales have fallen in 12 of the 13 months since July 2018, underscoring the sharp slowdown in demand in the world’s fourth-largest automobile market.
Two companies that managed to limit their loss volumes are Mahindra and Mahindra and Hyundai, as both launched their respective compact utility vehicles, XUV 300 and Venue, recently.
Severe floods in states such as Maharashtra, Kerala and Karnataka before the onset of Onam and Ganesh Chaturthi are also affecting the fortunes of the automobile industry.
Last year vehicle manufacturers experienced their worst vehicles sales during the festival period -- Onam to Diwali -- due to a liquidity crisis triggered by the bankruptcy of IL&FS and worsening economic factors like increase in crude oil prices and a a depreciating rupee.
Hence, to create some buzz amongst buyers most of the leading manufacturers have lined up a host of launches. Vehicle sales during the festive season comprise almost a third of the total vehicles sold in a year.
Despite the new launches, car makers are very cautious about moving inventory in the market before the festive season."

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) Ltd, one of India’s top utility vehicle and tractor makers, has deferred a portion of its new investments and shed some temporary jobs since April to cope with the sharp slowdown in demand in the domestic industry.
“About 15%-20% of capex from our original capex plan could be deferred,"" said M&M’s managing director Pawan Goenka. He said however that the decision won’t affect the new product development plans of M&M or “any other capex meant for bringing the right products to the customers.""
M&M had in late May announced its plan to invest  ₹18,000 crore over the next three years, including  ₹12,000 crore towards capital expenditure and  ₹6,000 crore in its subsidiaries.
“We may have cut down on about 1,500 jobs of temporary workers since 1 April 2019. We are trying not to remove more (headcount) but if the slowdown persists, we will probably be forced to,"" Goenka said on the sidelines of the opening of a vehicle assembly plant in Sri Lanka on Saturday.
He said that the concerns of job losses are more at auto parts suppliers and vehicle dealerships.
Sales have also been hit in other segments such as commercial vehicles and three-wheelers.
Goenka said the impact of the ongoing slowdown would multiply if there are no signs of a revival during the upcoming festival season.
“We have already seen 12 months of slowdown in the domestic market. If we miss this festive season and don’t see any turnaround, then I think you will see a fairly significant effect in terms of jobs, investments and even bankruptcies,"" he said, adding many suppliers may even file for bankruptcy.
M&M, India’s largest tractor maker, has also lowered its sales growth forecast for this fiscal year to 6-8% from 8-9% previously. “The floods obviously are very bad in some areas but will probably not have any huge negative impact on tractor sales. The dealers appear to be fairly positive because the rains have come and they are looking at a possibility of good tractor sales during this festive season,"" Goenka said.
M&M has set up a vehicle assembly unit in Sri Lanka along with Ideal Motors, its local dealer partner. The assembly plant is the first such in the island nation and it will be run by Mahindra Ideal Lanka Pvt. Ltd, a 65:35 joint venture between Ideal Motors and M&M. Situated at Welipenna, about 60km from Colombo, the 10-acre assembly unit is built on a 65-acre plot, which will also house a vendor development park in the vicinity.
The JV has earmarked 2 billion Sri Lankan rupees for the plant, which will have an installed yearly capacity of up to 5,000 units and will provide direct and indirect employment to about 200 people over the next two years.
The CKD (completely knocked down) unit will roll out several vehicles starting from M&M’s compact sport-utility vehicle KUV100 (petrol variant). The first vehicle was rolled out on Saturday. The local assembly operations include localisation of four components: tyres, batteries, exhausts and seating systems. While Ceat Ltd will supply tyres, Exide Industries would supply the batteries; both Indian companies with footprints in Sri Lanka.

159,2019-08-20,Mahindra Mahindra,"The demand slowdown in the market is ‘very much cyclical and not structural’, says Seon Seob KimKim said such a positive step was necessary under the current circumstances in order to make 'people come forward'

NEW DELHI :
The ongoing slowdown in India’s automobile market is transient and government intervention can drive a turnaround in the coming quarters, especially during the festival season, said a top executive of Hyundai Motor India Ltd.
With automobile sales on the decline for about a year, companies have been urging the government to either reduce the goods and services tax (GST) on automobiles, or offer some other financial relief to revive demand.
“The festival season might be a great opportunity for Hyundai and all other OEM’s (original equipment manufacturers) in terms of recovery of demand and revival. In many areas, the customer sentiment is subdued and we are preparing interesting customer communication programmes,"" said Seon Seob Kim, managing director and chief executive, Hyundai Motor India.
Wholesale dispatches of passenger vehicles fell 31% from the year earlier in July to 200,790 vehicles, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. It was the sharpest drop since the 35% fall in December 2000. July also witnessed the ninth straight drop in monthly wholesale passenger vehicle sales.
Sales have fallen in 12 of the 13 months since July 2018, underscoring the sharp slowdown in demand in the world’s fourth-largest automobile market.
Kim said the slowdown in the local market was “very much cyclical and not structural"". From an OEM perspective, India still has huge growth potential and the number of cars sold per 1,000 people is very low compared to the US, China and South Korea. This means that even if the domestic market is passing through a difficult time, it is going to be a very short-term trend, he added.
A range of factors, such as higher ownership costs and economic uncertainties, have led to a decline in auto sales in India. Companies are hoping that sales will recover during the festive season, which starts with Onam in September and ends with Diwali in late October.
“If the government helps at this stage, I believe the recovery can happen this year itself. The burden on customers has increased when it comes to purchasing cars due to increase in insurance premiums, registration charges and then BS VI transition. This has not been done intentionally, but yes, it has an impact,"" Kim said.
At a time when other manufacturers have cut production, Hyundai has grown its overall market share to a record 19.4%, he added. The company is leading the sports utility vehicle segment for the first time in two decades of its existence in India thanks to demand for its compact SUV, Venue.
Hyundai Tuesday introduced its latest offering in the small car segment, the Grand i10 Nios, costing  ₹4.99-7.99 lakh. It was the firm’s third launch since January after Venue, and electric SUV Kona.
The Grand i10 Nios is based on a new platform compared to the existing Grand i10 car and will have BS VI complaint petrol and BS IV diesel engine versions. Since 2013, the South Korean manufacturer has sold more than 751,000 Grand i10s in India.
“Our rate of (sales) decline is much smaller than that of those of other OEMs and that has led to the increase in our market share to 19.4%, which is the highest-ever. Automotive industry is a key contributor in some of the major economies and huge contribution comes from the value chain companies as well,"" Kim said.

160,2019-08-21,Mahindra Mahindra,"Choosing the right vehicle, such as the Mahindra XUV300, can make all the difference!

Is your travel bucket list languishing in a non-descript corner? Thanks to career goals, personal commitments or lack of finances, you haven’t ticked off much from the list. On days that you feel sorry about your mundane life, you seek solace simply in going through that.
Well, we feel you there!
It is not always easy to pack your bags and embark on a journey of wanderlust. So, why not explore your own city like a tourist? But, before you do that, make sure that you have the right vehicle. The Mahindra XUV300 would be a great choice—this compact SUV is stylish, fun to drive, and comes with top-notch safety and tech features.
Make your escapades more memorable with the XUV300! Here are a few tips to get you started.
Delhi
Ankita Sood, a chef-cum-food consultant, believes that Chandni Chowk should be the beginning point of all adventures in Delhi. “The old havelis and the tiny shops that sell spices and jewellery make you feel like you have stepped into a time capsule. And, if you like ‘breakfasting like a king’, you dash off to the Paranthewali Gali or the Old Famous Jalebi Walla in Khari Baoli,"" shares Sood.
But it is not easy to manoeuvre around this area. Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) vehicles, especially the Mahindra XUV300 AutoSHIFT will make it a lot easier.
While you are in the vicinity, Sood suggests a drive down to Jama Masjid for a lesson in Mughal history and architecture. Follow this up by a drive to Delhi Haat or Janpath, where you can buy trinkets, souvenirs and more.
Being mindful of the driving culture of NCR is essential when you take your Mahindra XUV300 out for a spin, as NCR scores little less when it comes to traffic compliance index amongst metros. The traffic flow in the capital is intermittent that sees short periods of movement with regular interruptions (stop-and-go). The convenience of its advanced autoSHIFT technology and segment-first features like Front Parking Sensors and ‘comfort’ mode of its Smart Steering System make your drive absolutely effortless.
“In the evening, take a stroll at Lodhi Gardens. You could even drive down to India Gate or catch a play at the National School of Drama. And, end the day by digging into delectable international fare at Aerocity or Cyber Hub,"" she concludes.
Mumbai
There’s a reason Mumbai is called the Maximum City—there’s so much on offer that it leaves residents spoilt for choice!
“I would recommend starting the day by going all the way to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park at Borivali. It is one of the few green spots in the city that also houses the majestic Kanheri caves,"" says Abhishek Jha, a media professional.
He also likes to go there to spot wild animals to experience stillness and serenity. “There are not many places that can boast of letting you spot leopards in the middle of city,"" he quips.
In the neighbourhood is Dadasaheb Phalke Nagar or the Film City, the site for multiple Bollywood shoots.
One of the most congested cities in the world, Mumbai faces lot of traffic woes. The roads are riddled with potholes and monsoons make it only worse. However, Mahindra XUV300’s comfortable suspension, large 17"" wheels, ample ground clearance and ESP with Hill Start Assist ensure you glide over them like a pro.
If you have the willpower to wade through a sea of tourists, drive through the lovely Bandra-Worli Sea Link (one of the prettiest bridges in the country) in the Mahindra XUV 300 and stop at The Gateway of India. For lunch, you should go to the iconic Leopold Cafe (remember how Gregory David Roberts described it in his bestseller, Shantaram?) at Colaba Causeway.
“To revel in the glory of Victorian Gothic revival architecture, make a pit stop at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. It is a great backdrop for selfies,"" adds Jha.
Round off the night by hitting the Bandra-Kurla Complex, which has a wide variety of restaurants and bars.
Hyderabad
“Kick-start your day by driving down to the Golconda Fort. After all, the city was created in 16th century by the Golconda dynasty. The romance and adventure associated with this era come alive in this monument,"" shares Shalini Chakraborty Majumdar, who moved to Hyderabad a couple of years ago along with her husband.
Your next destination should be the Qutub Shahi tombs, which are located only 10 minutes away from the fort. In the words of Shalini, you should also sample the Hyderabadi biryani at Hotel Shadab, which is in the old part of the town.
Thereafter, explore the Salar Jung Museum that houses a rare collection of antiques. Also squeeze in some time for the Chowmahalla Palace, which is the official residence of the Nizams of Hyderabad.
“At night, head to the area near Charminar. You will love the food there—kebabs, nihari, paaya and korma,"" says Shalini.
Among the big cities, Hyderabad fares better when it comes to adherence to road safety norms, especially with the new Telangana government issuing strict disciplinarian action against offenders. In addition, there is a general empathy towards pedestrians and the roads are wide and open. Mahindra XUV300's features like best-in-segment performance, segment-first 7 airbags and 4 disc brakes ensure you have fun safely.
Kolkata
The erstwhile capital of British India, Kolkata is known for its cultural heritage. It is also a city that remains firmly rooted in its past, while embracing modernity with open arms.
“I love to begin the day on a spiritual note. It is beautiful to witness the morning puja at the Dakshineswar temple or the Kalighat temple,"" elaborates businessman Nikhil Nahata.
You can’t be in Kolkata and not visit the Victoria Memorial, he further says. The early-20th century marble building, dedicated to Queen Victoria, is one of the iconic constructions of modern Indian history. A visit to the 111-year-old Jewish bakery, Nahoum, should also be on your agenda.
Kolkata has a high regard for traffic norms, and it is usually safe to drive around the city. However, the city suffers from extreme humid conditions. Its segment-first automatic climate control system with dual zone cooling, comfortable seating for 5 adults and electric sunroof make the Mahindra XUV300 one of the most comfortable choices to hit the roads.
“If you want to keep your kids engaged, amusement parks like Nicco Park or Aquatica are good options,"" says Nahata.
As the evening sets in, drive up to Prinsep Ghat and take a jetty ride to go back in time. Round off the day with a trip to Park Street for the best of Continental, Mughlai and Chinese cuisines.
Travel like a pro
Traffic snarls and bumpy rides make driving in cities quite a mammoth task. But, if you have a great vehicle, such as the Mahindra XUV300, the going gets a lot easier.
It’s fuel-efficient, stylish, and allows you to breeze through traffic. The compact SUV comes in petrol and diesel variants.
It is indeed the perfect car for all your adventures! Click here to book a test drive."

New Delhi: Mahindra & Mahindra, homegrown utility vehicles major, is acquiring 55% stake in ride hailing and radio taxi operator Meru Travel Solutions for a cash consideration of up to  ₹201.5 crore, according to a regulatory filing by the company.
The company signed a share subscription and shareholder agreement on Saturday for subscribing up to 55% of equity share capital of Meru Travel Solutions Pvt Ltd in tranches, Mahindra & Mahindra said in a BSE filing.
Under the agreement, after investment of the first tranche in Meru, M&M will have the right to appoint majority of the directors on the board of Meru and will control its composition, it added.
""Upon obtaining such right, Meru will become a subsidiary of the company,"" M&M said, adding subsidiaries of Meru — Meru Mobility Tech Pvt Ltd, V-Link Automotive Services Pvt Ltd and V-Link Fleet Solutions Pvt Ltd — would in turn also become subsidiaries of M&M.
As per the filing, the acquisition will be through cash consideration and M&M would invest an amount not exceeding  ₹201.5 crore in Meru.
Under the deal structure, M&M will make a primary investment of an amount not exceeding  ₹103.5 crore for a stake of up to 55% in Meru in tranches.
The agreement also envisages M&M to have the right of call option to acquire shares from certain existing investors of Meru and these existing investors of Meru would have put option to sell shares for an amount not exceeding  ₹98 crore, it added.
Meru, which was incorporated in December 2006, had clocked consolidated revenue of  ₹156.6 crore in 2018-19,  ₹189.9 crore in 2017-18 and  ₹277.2 crore in 2016-17.
As automobile companies adapt to the changing times, they have been making investments in new technology driven mobility solutions providers. Earlier this year, South Korea's Hyundai and Kia together had announced that they were investing $ 300 million (about  ₹2,100 crore) in India's ride hailing major Ola."
154,2019-09-01,Mahindra Mahindra,"Automaker will pay up to  ₹103 crore to acquire the stake in the ride-hailing companyMahindra’s investment stems from an existing relationship with True North

Mumbai: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) has agreed to buy a 55% stake in ride-hailing firm Meru Cabs, expanding the automaker’s presence in the growing market for shared mobility.
M&M will pay up to  ₹103 crore for acquiring the stake which will be done through an issue of new shares. In a stock exchange filing on Saturday, M&M also said that it has an option to buy the remaining 45% stake in Meru from existing investors for up to  ₹98 crore.
M&M said it will make the first tranche of investment in Meru Travel Solutions Pvt. Ltd by the end of October. “After investment of the first tranche in Meru, the company will have the right to appoint a majority of the directors on the board of Meru and as such will control the composition of the board of directors of Meru,"" it said.
Once the deal is closed, Meru and its subsidiaries including Meru Mobility Tech Pvt. Ltd, V Link Automotive Services Pvt. Ltd and V Link Fleet Solutions Pvt. Ltd will become units of M&M. The Mumbai-based automaker is already an investor in self-drive car rental platform ZoomCar India Pvt. Ltd.
Private equity firm True North, which holds about 80% in Meru, will see its stake reduce to 35%, managing partner Vishal Nevatia said. True North first invested in Meru in 2007, when it was called V Link Group, and used to provide fleet management solutions to media houses and corporate clients.
“Mahindra’s investment will help Meru plan for a new course of growth. It is the only cab aggregator in India which is cash-positive and profitable. Mahindra also wants to tap into the sharing and rental mobility space with Meru, because automobile firms today realize that selling cars is not the only way to sustain growth,"" Nevatia said over the phone. True North has invested about $80 million in Meru since 2007, and will look to exit in the next two to three years, he added.
Meru has two main businesses—cab-hailing and radio taxi services in Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi, and transportation solutions to leading companies in various sectors such as call centres, banks and airlines via its subsidiary V Link Fleet Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
For the year ended 31 March 2019, Meru’s holding entity’s revenue fell for the second straight year. Its revenues have fallen from  ₹277 crore in FY17 to  ₹190 crore in FY18 to  ₹156 crore in FY19, according to the filing.
Nevatia attributed the falling revenues to drivers leaving Meru in the last two years for app cab operators such as Ola and Uber, which were burning cash and offering better incentives.
“However, we see these drivers coming back to Meru’s platform because Ola and Uber are rationalizing costs, and expect growth to return,"" Nevatia said.
Mahindra’s investment in Meru also indicates the growing interest of traditional car-makers in ride-hailing startups.
In March this year, Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors led a $300-million investment in Ola, while South-East Asian rival Grab raised funds from Toyota and Hyundai last year.
Mahindra’s investment also stems from its previous relationship with True North. In 2007, M&M and the PE firm acquired DGP Hinoday, an auto parts maker. Later, M&M merged all its auto parts entities into Mahindra CIE and listed it on the stock exchanges.
True North sold its entire stake in the listed entity in early 2015."

152,2019-09-01,Mahindra Mahindra,"Automobiles currently attract the highest tax rate of 28%, apart from a cessDispatches to dealerships during the month plunged 34% from a year ago, the sharpest decline since September 2001

New Delhi: The Union government has finally decided to bite the bullet on a tax cut for the automobile sector, on a day the industry reported the worst August for passenger vehicles in 18 years. Dispatches to dealerships during the month plunged 34% from a year ago, sales data showed, in the sharpest decline since September 2001.
The government will take a proposal to reduce the goods and services tax (GST) rate on automobiles to the GST Council, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters in Chennai, while briefing them on efforts to arrest the economic downturn. Automobiles currently attract the highest tax rate of 28%, apart from a cess.
Six top automakers together dispatched 171,193 vehicles to dealerships in August, 34% below 259,925 vehicles recorded in August 2018. Indian manufacturers count factory dispatches to dealerships as sales. These numbers follow a 31% sales drop in July.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, which makes one in every two cars sold in the country, posted domestic sales of 93,173 units, down 36% year-on-year (y-o-y) as demand for its small cars cooled.
Sales of Maruti’s small cars fell 40% y-o-y to 64,397 units in August. Analysts have pinned hopes on Maruti’s Bharat Stage VI compliant S-Presso hatchback to be launched this month to revive sales in the festive season. Sales of midsize sedan Ciaz fell 77% to 1,596 units. Although at 8,658 units, van sales fell 37%, utility vehicle sales rose 3%.
“It (the tax cut proposal) has got to go to the GST Council, where all state finance ministers assemble,"" Sitharaman said. “It is for them to take a call. I have suggested to them (automobile makers) that I will take it to the Council but the final decision will be theirs... I will wait for the GST Council to take a call."" The federal indirect tax body meets next on 20 September.
Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) reported total passenger vehicle sales of 13,507 units, down 32% y-o-y, and a 28% y-o-y drop in commercial vehicle (CV) sales to 14,684 units. Among CVs, medium and heavy commercial vehicles were hit the most, falling 69% to 354 units.
Tata Motors Ltd posted domestic passenger vehicle sales of 7,316 units, a 58% decline y-o-y. “Our retail sales were 42% more than offtake and as a result, the network stock came down by over 3,000 vehicles. This prepares dealers well for the festival season,"" said Mayank Pareek, president (passenger vehicles business unit) at Tata Motors. Sales of CVs fell 45% y-o-y to 21,824 units on poor freight availability and lower truck rentals. Girish Wagh, president of the CV unit, however, said retail sales could have exceeded wholesales by over 25% in August.
Mint reported on 11 August that the GST Council is preparing for a meeting to be convened after the finance ministry decides on the extent of benefits to be given to the auto industry.
A reduction in GST, or cess, or both, could give some relief for the automobile sector facing a crippling demand slowdown, while taking a toll on flagging tax revenues. Central and state governments may have different views on this, and reversing a rate reduction later may be more politically difficult in the case of GST than in the case of cess.
A decision on the rate cut will be taken by the council in light of the tax revenue collection trends.
The finance ministry said on Sunday that central and state governments collected  ₹98,202 crore in August for transactions in the previous month, a 4.5% increase from a year ago, but below the  ₹1.02 trillion collected in July 2019. Although subdued revenue collections reduce the fiscal space for tax cuts, the government at times takes the view that a revival in industrial growth could help make good any revenue loss from a tax cut.
“While the GST rate is one of the key factors impacting automobile prices and thereby demand, any reduction in rates would need to consider the revenue impact in the context of the current year collections being lower than that budgeted,"" said M.S. Mani, partner at Deloitte India.
ICICI Securities said in a recent report that prospective buyers are deferring purchases as automobiles are not currently a consumer priority.
“The auto industry continues to be subdued in the month of August due to several external factors. We are optimistic and hopeful of a good festive season going ahead,"" said Veejay Ram Nakra, chief of sales and marketing (automotive division) at M&M.
Meanwhile, Sitharaman also said the government’s efforts to promote electric mobility should not be misconstrued as promoting electric vehicles at the expense of internal combustion engine vehicles.
“All vehicles will have their due market share. It is not that we are promoting one segment of the industry at the expense of another,"" said the minister.
She also said the feedback received from the industry about the measures announced so far to support growth was positive.
A report by credit rating agency Icra Ltd, which estimates a 4-7% decline for the overall passenger vehicle segment in FY20, pointed out that entry-level and midsize hatchbacks have witnessed a price increase of over 10% and 6-8%, respectively due to new regulations and commodity prices.
Calls for strong measures to support the industry have been growing in recent weeks, as economic indicators give worrying signs of a sharp deceleration in growth.
India’s economy grew 5% in the June quarter, its slowest pace in six years, official data showed last week.
This has also prompted criticism from the opposition Congress party on the government’s stewardship of Asia’s third largest economy, which has already lost the tag of the ‘fastest growing major economies’ in the world to China.
“With GDP at 5% growth for the last quarter, it shows the impact of growth momentum and slowdown in consumer spending. It is a free fall for the auto wholesales in August as well, and this trend is likely to continue till the BS IV inventory is cleared as consumers are waiting for heavier discounts on BS IV compliant vehicles,"" said Gaurav Vangaal, country lead, LVP forecasting, IHS Markit.
Automobile companies and lobby groups have been urging a tax reduction for vehicles across the board. As a consequence of the decline in consumption demand, lack of liquidity with banks and NBFCs and regulatory changes, sales of automobiles have been on a downward trend since July 2018.
According to a senior industry executive, some customers have been postponing their purchases expecting better discounts from auto makers, at the fag end of this fiscal year. Now, if there is again another round of speculation on reduction in GST rates levied on automobiles, then demand during festive season will be impacted, he said."

149,2019-09-04,Mahindra Mahindra,"The move will help the commercial vehicle maker further consolidate its position in the LCV segmentWith this, Ashok Leyland plans to take on segment leaders Mahindra and Mahindra’s (M&M) Bolero pickup trucks and Tata Motors’ Ace family

NEW DELHI :
India’s third-largest commercial vehicle maker, Ashok Leyland, plans to develop a range of light commercial vehicles (LCVs) in the sub-5 tonne category. The move will help the company further consolidate its position in the LCV segment, while reducing its dependency on medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCVs).
MHCVs, a segment that has been affected the most by the ongoing demand slowdown, contributed about 70% of Ashok Leyland’s total annual vehicle sales last year.
N. Saravanan, chief technology officer, Ashok Leyland, said in an interview: “We do have an LCV platform that we are developing, but it’s too soon to disclose that. At some point in the near future, we will have an entire range of LCVs going all the way up to 5 tonnes. We are looking at extending the LCV platform to a slightly higher range."" The company’s only product in the sub-5 tonne category is Dost and Dost Plus.
With this, Ashok Leyland plans to take on segment leaders Mahindra and Mahindra’s (M&M) Bolero pickup trucks and Tata Motors’ Ace family.
Ashok Leyland’s Dost LCV, which is positioned in the goods carrier category with a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of 2-3.5 tonnes, sold 49,467 units in FY2019, up 24% year-on-year (y-o-y). Meanwhile, the Bolero powered M&M’s sales to 176,203 units in FY19. In the sub-2 tonne category, Tata Motors reported sales of 156,409 units of the Ace LCV last fiscal year.
Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) data shows that the CV maker has recorded growth in the LCV segment despite the ongoing demand slump. In the April-July period, it recorded 9% y-o-y growth to 16,754 units, against 15% decline to 31,350 units in the wholesale volumes of its MHCVs due to the slowdown in freight movement.
Meanwhile, the flagship company of Hinduja Group on Tuesday said it has become the first CV maker in India to get BS-VI compliance certification from Pune-based Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) for its complete range of heavy-duty trucks (16 tonnes and above). Affiliated to the ministry of heavy industries and public enterprises, ARAI is an autonomous body offering research and homologation services for all vehicle types.
The company’s heavy-duty trucks, or MHCV range cater to mining and construction, haulage and tractor-trailer applications. “All intermediate commercial vehicles (ICVs), including buses, will be BS-VI compliant in the next few weeks as the process of homologation is underway,"" Saravanan said.
He added that the roll out strategy of the all-new, BS-VI compliant CVs will depend upon the availability of BS-VI grade fuel (diesel). “We are closely working with the oil companies. As soon as we see the availability of BS-VI grade fuel in key corridors, we will start rolling out these trucks.""
Saravanan, however, refused to divulge whether BS-VI compliant MHCVs will be priced higher. Ashok Leyland has developed an all-new modular vehicle platform for 16 tonne and above trucks, including tippers, mining trucks and haulage vehicles. Under the platform, known as the MBP programme, the transition to BS-VI emission norms will be carried out and existing MHCV platforms will be discontinued from April 2020. “The model allows you to mix and match the various component systems in a seamless manner. The idea is to meet customer requirements, which is primarily having customized variants for various applications, without building up too much of inventory of various parts,"" Saravanan said."
150,2019-09-04,Mahindra Mahindra,"Dealers wary of stocking up for festival months, see flat sales growth when compared with previous yearSales during the festive season are expected to remain flat or grow marginally, says Fada

NEW DELHI :
With consumption demand not showing any signs of recovery in the domestic market, automobile dealers do not expect sales to grow significantly during the current festival months (September and October), against last year. Most of them are gearing up for a flat or marginal growth for the second successive year.
Last year, automobile manufacturing companies experienced one of the worst festival season sales in the last five years, in the aftermath of the bankruptcy of IL&FS and the lack of liquidity in the banking system.
According to Ashish Kale, president, Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), sales during the upcoming festival season are expected to remain flat or grow marginally, compared to last year, since dealers are not confident and have taken a cautious approach before taking stocks from the manufacturers.
Sales of automobiles during the festival months comprise almost a third of the total vehicles sold during a particular year. Last year in July and August, automakers substantially increased dispatches of vehicles to dealerships, compared to the retail demand, expecting robust sales, but ended up with huge inventory as retail sales tanked.
Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) started to witness decline in sales of vehicles since July 2018, as regulatory changes such as enhanced safety regulations, lack of credit availability from the banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) had an adverse impact on the overall consumer demand. The slowdown intensified since the beginning of the current financial year as wholesales declined by double digits.
“Last year, retail sales in September were still fine and passenger vehicle sales began to decline at the end of the month. This time we won’t see huge growth and wait for the measures announced by the government to make an impact. It is tough to say whether the measures will have the desired impact or not just after 10 days,"" added Kale.
The muted expectation of dealers come at a time when vehicle manufacturers such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and others reported a double-digit fall in wholesale dispatches to dealerships in July and August before the festival season kicks off with Ganesh Chaturthi in the western states and Onam on 12 September in southern states, especially Kerala.
Maruti’s domestic wholesales in August declined significantly by 35.9% year-on-year to 94,728 units. This is the third time the company pushed less than one lakh vehicles to its dealerships in a particular month since July 2017. Vehicles dispatched by the top six passenger vehicle manufacturers during the same period declined by 34% year-on-year to 171,193 vehicles.
According to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), passenger vehicle sales in July fell significantly by 31% to 200,790 vehicles. It was the worst sales performance since a 35% decline in December 2000.
One of the most important reasons behind the slowdown had been the lack of credit options available to both customers and dealers alike from banks and NBFCS as financial institutions tightened their respective credit norms.
“The pressure on dealers for capital is still on, but it has improved from the past. NBFCs used to fund 15-20% of our customers who came to buy vehicles for the first time and their credit worthiness aren’t quite high. These were the customers who use to give us the additional numbers,"" according to Kale.
FADA is hoping that the GST Council will decide to reduce the rate of taxes levied on vehicles and that will be able to generate some demand in the coming months.
Expecting that customers will shy away from buying vehicles during the festival season, Maruti Suzuki has decided against dispatching stocks to dealerships during the festive season as inventory with dealerships has already exceeded by more than a month."
148,2019-09-05,Mahindra Mahindra,"The cash and bank balances of leading tractor makers have risen appreciably over the last three yearsAll eyes are now on an improvement in sales, given the slew of market-friendly measures recently announced by the government to accelerate sales

Tractor firms are bracing for a further deceleration in sales in FY20. The ray of hope is that manufacturers could pull off decent profit margins.
Earlier forecasts of flat sales in FY20 have been downgraded. Analysts point to a 7-8% decline from the year-ago period. The drop in farm productivity during the second half of FY19 and meagre rural income weighed rather heavily on demand.
That apart, “lower growth in spending on rural infrastructure has impacted non-farm tractor demand in recent months. Additionally, exports, which contribute 10-11% of sales, declined 28% in the first quarter of this fiscal due to moderation in demand from Latin America"", according to a report by Crisil Ltd.
However, input costs have been generally supportive. In the last six months, steel prices, which make up more than three-fourths of raw material costs, have been sliding. This should counterbalance the discounts offered on products to shore up sales in the faltering market, according to analysts.
Discounts are also likely to contract in the coming months with a better monsoon. As such, tractor makers may be able to clock fairly decent profit margins despite negative operating leverage and in the wake of sales having slipped by double digits in the last couple of months.
“In spite of lower volumes, the earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins of tractor firms will be resilient between 14% and 16%, bolstered by easing commodity prices,"" said the Crisil report, adding that margins even expanded in FY16, when sales declined 10% year-on-year.
However, the scenario is not quite the same now. “The sharp downturn is the result of a combination of many factors and competition is severe, too,"" according to Mitul Shah, vice president, research at Reliance Securities Ltd. Besides, it remains to be seen if low raw material costs sustain.
Shares of leading tractor manufacturers have sputtered along with other auto stocks given the bleak outlook for the whole sector as well as its attendant dependants, the auto ancillaries sector.
The saving grace during the sharp deceleration is that tractor makers have displayed sturdy balance sheets. The cash and bank balances of leading tractor firms, such as Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Escorts Ltd, have risen appreciably over the last three years. Even the interest cover ratio has improved as the companies have shown resilience in profitability.
All eyes are now on an improvement in sales, given the slew of market-friendly measures recently announced by the government to accelerate sales."
147,2019-09-05,Mahindra Mahindra,"Bajaj Finance Ltd. has picked banks including Nomura Holdings Inc. and Kotak Mahindra BankBajaj Finance plans to sell the shares by December, the people said

Indian shadow lender Bajaj Finance Ltd. has picked banks including Nomura Holdings Inc. and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. to arrange a share sale of about $1 billion, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The financier has also selected JM Financial Ltd. for the proposed offering and may add more arrangers later, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. The company plans to sell the shares by December, the people said. Bajaj Finance may raise equity capital, subject to board and shareholder approval, Managing Director Rajeev Jain had told investors in July, without providing further details.
Selling shares will help Bajaj Finance to raise funds to expand lending as many of its peers grapple with a liquidity crunch. The credit profile of the financier has remained unscathed even as many of its rivals got shunned from India’s credit market after a string of defaults from IL&FS Group to Dewan Housing Finance Corp Ltd. over the past year.
Deliberations are ongoing and details including fundraising size could still change, the people said. Representatives for Bajaj Finance and Nomura declined to comment, while those for Kotak and JM didn’t immediately respond to emails and phone calls seeking comments.
The lender’s shares rose 23% this year, making it one of the top gainers on 116 member BSE Finance Index. Bajaj Finance rose 0.2% to 3,258 rupees at 11:45 a.m. in Mumbai on Thursday.

146,2019-09-05,Mahindra Mahindra,"M&M MD Pawan Goenka says if slowdown is not reversed within this fiscal, it would lead to more job losses in the sectorGoenka says if sales do not pick up in the festive season, the company may have to undertake the shut-down exercise again in October to adjust the production

New Delhi: Owing to the slowdown in the automobile industry, Mahindra & Mahindra has deferred its planned capex of around  ₹1,000 crore by a year, which, if not reversed within this fiscal, would lead to more job losses in the sector, the company's MD Pawan Goenka said on Thursday.
The company that recently underwent a plant shut-down exercise to adjust production also said that if sales do not pick up in the festive season, it may have to undertake the exercise again in October.
""At Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), we probably will end up deferring about 10 per cent capex for auto and tractor (together)... it would come to around  ₹800- ₹1,000 crore,"" Goenka told reporters here on the sideline of SIAM annual convention.
He was responding to a query on whether the current slowdown in the auto industry has forced the company to postpone investments.
While the company has not slowed down on investments on new products, it has deferred investments on other activities such as capacity enhancement and discretionary capex like repair and maintenance, Goenka said.
""The capacity that we expected to need in two or three years from now is less as compared to the year ago, therefore there will be slowdown in capacity investment as we would not like to invest... probably for a year,"" Goenka said.
He said the auto industry is currently going through a challenging slump which has already resulted in mass job losses.
""...If the industry does not turn back on to positive growth for the remaining part of the months of fiscal year, we may see more layoffs,"" he said.
According to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) vehicle manufacturers have laid off around 15,000 temporary workers while dealers have witnessed around 2.8 lakh job losses.
Goenka further said, ""Employment levels that we have today amongst original equipment manufacturers and suppliers is probably more than what the current level of production will justify."" Referring the the lay off of 1,500 temporary workers out of a total of 30,000 at M&M, he said, ""That is like 5 per cent reduction when volume is down by 20 per cent. We are not removing (employees) just because volumes are down, but if it continues beyond a certain point then the industry would be unable to carry the extra (workforce)"".
Goenka said there is a need for support from the government to help the auto industry come out of the current slowdown in the form of GST cut. He stated that in the past, when slowdowns happened, reduction in excise duties had helped in picking up demand immediately.
M&M, which underwent plant shutdown in August to adjust production may have to undertake similar exercise again in October if demand remains subdued, Goenka said.
""Probably in the month of September, we will produce full capacity; and in October, we may adjust if sale in Navratra don't go as per expectations,"" he said."
145,2019-09-05,Mahindra Mahindra,"Bajaj Finance has appointed i-banks Kotak Mahindra Capital, JM Financial and Nomura to manage the share saleThe proposed share sale is expected to be closed within the current fiscal year

Mumbai: Consumer focussed lender Bajaj Finance Ltd has hired investment banks to help it raise up to $1 billion through a share sale, said two people aware of the development.
“They are looking to raise funds through a qualified institutional placement (QIP). The lender has appointed i-banks Kotak Mahindra Capital, JM Financial and Nomura to manage the share sale,"" said one of the persons cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to the media.
The proposed share sale is expected to be closed within the current fiscal year, he added.
Emails sent to Bajaj Finance, Kotak Mahindra Capital and JM Financial did not elicit a response. A spokesperson for Nomura declined to comment.
On Thursday, Bajaj Finance told stock exchanges that its board of directors will meet on 17 September to consider, “a proposal for raising of funds by way of qualified institutions placement, subject to such regulatory/statutory approvals as may be required, including approval of the shareholders of the company"".
QIP is a capital-raising tool through which listed companies can sell shares, fully and partly convertible debentures, or any securities other than warrants that are convertible into stocks, to a qualified institutional buyer.
The proposed share sale will help the non-bank lender shore up its balance sheet when consumer demand is showing signs of weakness and liquidity has been scarce for lenders.
For the quarter ended 30 June, Bajaj Finance’s assets under management grew by 41% to  ₹1.29 trillion.
“Gross NPA and Net NPA stood at 1.60% and 0.64%, respectively, on 30 June 2019. Adjusted for IL&FS exposure, GNPA and NNPA stood at 1.42% and 0.50%, respectively,"" the lender said in its recent exchange filings.
Bajaj Finance has also been exploring other routes to diversify its funding sources. “During the quarter, we established a secured Euro Medium Term Note (MTN) Programme for programme value of $1.50 billion on Singapore stock exchange. We intend to raise $750 million through ECB (external commercial borrowing), as allowed under automatic route, to diversify and strengthen our liability profile by March 2020,"" the lender said.
Till August, only five firms had tapped the markets to raise funds via QIP this year, raising a total of  ₹8,412.87 crore, while in 2018, 25 firms raised  ₹16,587 crore through this route, data from primary market tracker Primer Database shows."
144,2019-09-06,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra XUV300 starts at a price point of  ₹7.90 lakh (ex-showroom) for the petrol W4 variant, while the diesel W4 variant is priced at  ₹8.49 lakh (ex-showroom)If you consider only the technology inside, the Mahindra XUV300 does seem to come in behind the Nissan Kicks or Hyundai Venue

News Delhi: If you ask anyone in India to name the most popular Mahindra car on the road, the XUV would be perhaps the first name that most would recall. The latest Mahindra XUV300, which the company wants you to pronounce as “three double oh"", is the toned-down version of the XUV500 that operates in the full-fledged sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment.
While the XUV300 isn’t the most technologically-advanced car on Indian roads anymore, if you consider its price, the tech isn’t shabby at all. It starts at a price point of  ₹7.90 lakh (ex-showroom) for the petrol W4 variant, while the diesel W4 variant is priced at  ₹8.49 lakh (ex-showroom).
One of the first bits of technology that sellers will probably show you on a test drive is Mahindra’s Ecosense technology. You will find this in the XUV500, too, and it gives you a driving score based on how you drive. It’s placed as a separate option on the infotainment screen and rates the driver on acceleration, gear selection, speed, clutch override, idling and aggressive braking.
The idea, of course, is to help you improve your driving skills and optimize fuel consumption in your car. The better you drive, more efficient will the fuel consumption be. You can even share this score on social media. But while this is a commendable step, it would perhaps have been better if Mahindra could also provide the driver pointers on what they’re doing wrong.
Then there’s the Mahindra Blue Sense app, which offers smartwatch control among other things. You can access data like tyre pressure, parking location and emergency assist to call Mahindra’s customer care. The smartwatch control works on Wear OS supported smartwatches, allowing you to control music and the other options mentioned above.
The XUV300 also brought a segment first feature in allowing dual-zone climate control for the front passengers. This allows you to set different air conditioner temperatures for the driver and front seat passenger. There are also three memory slots to save your settings so you don’t have to tweak the temperature manually every time.
But by now you’re probably wondering why we haven’t mentioned any of the usual infotainment features that many include. That’s because while Blue Sense and Ecosense do make for smart technology, Mahindra seems to depend on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for the other infotainment features.
They work only when you connect your phone via USB, like in most vehicles, and basically put your phone on the infotainment screen. It makes sense too, considering the more affordable pricing of this vehicle. CarPlay and Android Auto are easy enough to control and easier to get used to than regular infotainment systems that automakers put by themselves.
Further, touch latency on the 7-inch touchscreen is just low enough to make usage seamless. We only wish Mahindra had included some more controls on the steering wheel so drivers didn’t have to take their focus off the road in most scenarios. The steering does have phone and audio controls though, which is standard among most vehicles today.
If you consider only the technology inside, the Mahindra XUV300 does seem to come in behind the Nissan Kicks or Hyundai Venue. However, all things considered, the technology inside this car is quite practical and given that there aren’t many cars in this segment that boast such technology, this is definitely one worth considering."
143,2019-09-06,Mahindra Mahindra,"In early trade, the stock was trading at  ₹728 up 4.68% on the NSEIn August, Tech Mahindra shares gained almost 9%

New Delhi: Share of Tech Mahindra surged as much as 5% on the BSE on Friday as the company announced expansion of its strategic collaboration with AT&T to accelerate AT&T’s IT network application, shared systems modernization and movement to the cloud.
Tech Mahindra will assume management of the applications that support AT&T’s network and shared systems.
At 12:30 pm, the stock was trading up 3.56% at  ₹720.10 on the BSE. The stock is the top gainer on both the NSE and the BSE.
In early trade, the stock was trading at  ₹728, up 4.68%, on the NSE.
""The multi-year agreement will enable AT&T to focus on core objectives, including having the most advanced software defined 56 network, and migrate the majority of its non-network workloads to the public cloud by 2024. This comprehensive program will help drive sustainable operational improvement across the network and software development domains,"" the company said in a regulatory filing on Thursday.
Tech Mahindra shares gained almost 9% in August.
While the deal size is not known, it is said to be one of the largest deals in the last few years, and among the five deals that the management had suggested as part of the company's pipeline in its Q1FY20 commentary.
""The company suggests that while the rebadging costs will be minimal compared with the size of the deal, it may incur significant transition costs in the near term. This will support in lifting revenue growth in the Communications vertical (already recovering in recent quarters, with us penciling in an estimated 7% dollar revenue growth in FY20 for communications),"" Emkay Global said in its report.
""We see this deal as providing further confidence to the recovery that the Street (including us) is building on the communications vertical ( estimated 40% of revenues), although the overall revenue growth trajectory remains unchanged due to a sharp moderation in the enterprise segment through recent quarters,"" the report added.
The fifth-largest software exporter reported a tepid 7% rise in net income to  ₹959.3 crore in the June quarter. Revenue grew by a slower 4.55% to  ₹8,653 crore on an annual basis, but fell 2.69% sequentially."

Singapore: The real estate and financial services sectors in India are set to witness a significant consolidation in the next two years, said Uday Kotak, CEO and MD of Kotak Mahindra Bank.
Speaking at the HT-MintAsia Leadership Summit in Singapore on Friday, Kotak said banks need to be very alert because no one knows “who’s going to eat your lunch the next day"".
“One of the things we’ve got to consider ourselves lucky is that, globally, Google and Amazon have decided not to go into banking,"" he said.
Drawing an analogy between the banking sector and Bollywood films, Kotak said private banking in India is currently “seeing a love story developing, but there’s a villain in the middle"". “I think the villain is slowing growth and Indians are scared to invest (in the economy) because they are worried that things might not get better. It’s a classic thing I’ve seen so many times over—and we go through it every few years. Look at the 1998 Asian financial crisis, then 2008 and now 2018,"" he said.
And, what have these cycles taught him? “My view is it’s never as good as it looks and it is never ever as bad as it looks."" Kotak said interest rates should be cut further and the rupee allowed to depreciate a little more. There is also work to be done on the governance front, he said.
“I think on the governance framework side, there is an issue with six layers of checks and balances that are not working —the management, board of directors, institutional investors, auditors, regulators and rating agencies. Quality of governance is also an extremely important part.""
He said the financial sector is going through an “evolution"", citing IBC as an example. “When it was ushered in, we believed we were going to have a fantastic cleaning up of the system quickly. But it has taken longer...Once you’re doing a clean-up, a speedy clean-up is as important. Second, I don’t think India is fully ready for challenges in financial sector resolution. An example is DHFL. So, how do we resolve the financial sector when the insolvency and bankruptcy court don’t apply to the sector? We need a fourth financial sector resolution mechanism,"" he said.

141,2019-09-06,Mahindra Mahindra,"Uday Kotak has pointed to a behavioural shift as a factor. People are increasingly seeking alternatives to private transport, in his observation

Uday Kotak, chief executive officer of Kotak Mahindra Bank, has stirred a debate over sliding car sales. The usual assumption is that the current economic slump is to blame. Kotak, however, has pointed to a behavioural shift as a factor. People are increasingly seeking alternatives to private transport, in his observation. He has cited the example of his son, who, he says, now prefers to use Uber and Ola.
Uber, of course, has made it a mission to convince people that the availability of its service means it’s pointless owning a car. Cabs are easy to hail, and not much more expensive, if maintenance costs and a driver’s salary are considered. The finer point of a change in behaviour, though, concerns the declining influence of a four-wheeler as a status symbol. A culture that places a premium on convenience may be upon us, and car marketers may have to rethink their strategies. Does this mean their sales pitches need to turn utility-oriented? Perhaps not. The market could get polarized. Those who simply need to get from point A to point B will opt for cabs. Passionate motorists, however, would still want to get behind the wheel."
140,2019-09-09,Mahindra Mahindra,"Tech Mahindra’s announcement of the AT&T deal brings some respite to the company’s investorsEven as the deal brings in incremental revenues for the firm, it can be margin dilutive initially

Tech Mahindra Ltd’s investors can breathe a little easy, and look beyond the gloom and doom headlines following the announcement of a large strategic deal with leading US network operator AT&T Inc.
While Tech Mahindra has not disclosed the deal size, analysts suggest this could well be one of the largest contracts secured by the Indian IT services firm. The deal entails optimizing AT&T’s core operations and modernizing its internal network applications to accelerate innovation.
Investors gave a thumbs up to the transaction, taking the company’s shares up by 3.8% on Friday on the National Stock Exchange.
Even as the deal brings in incremental revenues, transition costs in the near term can be expected to weigh on profit margins. “We would not be surprised if the deal has negative Ebitda initially,"" said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a report on 6 September. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and is a key measure of profitability.
“Tech Mahindra has moved away from the ‘scale at any cost’ approach of the past to a profitable growth approach in the past three years. Assuming this approach continues, Tech Mahindra can make higher margins if executed well,"" added Kotak. The brokerage firm has revised its revenue and earnings estimates upwards for FY22 as a result of the deal announcement.
The deal is expected to help support revenue growth of Tech Mahindra’s telecom (or communications) vertical, which accounted for 42% of total revenues in the June quarter. Note, that growth rates of this segment have shown an improvement in recent quarters, albeit on a low base.
Notwithstanding the gain on Friday, Tech Mahindra shares are 7% down so far in FY20—blame it on the lacklustre financial performance in the past two quarters. The flip side is that valuations are not demanding. Currently, the stock trades at about 15 times estimated earnings for FY20, according to Bloomberg data.
While the better outlook for the telecom segment is encouraging, this doesn’t necessarily mean things will look up on an overall basis, especially given the pressure in the enterprise segment. “The overall revenue growth trajectory remains unchanged due to a sharp moderation in the enterprise segment through recent quarters,"" said analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd in a report on Friday.
Note that the enterprise segment’s revenues had declined by 2.2% in the June quarter.
Even so, the steadying effect of the recent deal win will calm investors’ nerves. Large deal wins of this nature can be used by a company to showcase itself to other clients and, hence, gain more business. “We raise FY21-22 constant currency revenue growth estimates by 3-4%. We forecast 12% revenue growth in FY21,"" said analysts at Kotak."

136,2019-09-10,Mahindra Mahindra,"Lack of private investments over the past few years, subdued demand and trade tensions and large imports of electronics from China are hurting the Indian economy

Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra tweeted Tuesday on how a surplus monsoon and low crude oil prices could take the economy back to a high growth path. Mint decodes his optimism to explore the tailwinds as well as the headwinds facing the economy.
What’s keeping crude prices low?
In August, the average price of the Indian crude oil basket was $59.35 per barrel. This is lower than the $71 per barrel price in April, but very marginally higher than January’s $59.27. Crude prices, despite the best efforts of certain members of oil cartel, Opec, have remained benign. This is due to the weakening growth forecast for most economies of the world amid a global shift in automobiles and fossil fuel-based power towards renewables like electric, solar and wind. The US, which used to be a net crude importer, has been pumping oil and is now also exporting. This has kept a lid on crude oil prices.
Anand Mahindra @anandmahindra: “I try to make it a habit every morning to look for silver linings & +ve news.This shows how dramatically the monsoon deficit has been wiped out & is now solidly in surplus. This, plus relatively low oil prices, could give our economy the push it needs to move back to a higher gear.""
How has the progress of the monsoon been?
Monsoon rainfall, after starting slow, has more than made up the deficit in the last two months. From a deficit of 35% at the end of June, rains across India are now 3% above normal, which is something to cheer about. The nature’s fury has led to floods in agriculturally important states like Punjab, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. This could affect the sowing of crops. The spatial and temporal distribution has remained uneven, with states such as Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal facing deficient rainfall, according to the India Meteorological Department.
How is food production likely to be impacted?
Sowing of kharif crops is down including rice’s. A surplus monsoon will give a brighter picture for production if torrential rains have not hit cultivation.
How could the two benefit the economy?
Mahindra’s comments are significant as his tractors business depends on rural demand, which in turn depends on the monsoon. Mahindra and Mahindra’s domestic tractor sales were down 15% in August. A healthy monsoon will lead to good crop production, benefiting farmers. This directly helps consumer companies and makers of paint and cement. Similarly, low crude oil prices will save the country precious foreign exchange, and help farmers and companies control their energy spend.
Are low oil prices and good rains enough?
Lack of private investments over the past few years, subdued demand and trade tensions and large imports of electronics from China are hurting the Indian economy. Government spending on unproductive social welfare schemes continue to be high. India’s banking and NBFC sector is still reeling under high NPAs. Even as the government reversed some of its unpopular tax measures, sentiment has not revived. Important sectors like auto and energy are undergoing structural changes, hurting jobs and growth."

Under the share purchase agreement, Advent will buy a 67.90% stake from the promoters Delhi Flour Mills and existing investors, including WestBridge, Aravali Investment Holdings, and Jwalamukhi Investment Holdings. The packaged snacks company, which began selling Crax chips in 1984, later expanded its portfolio to add namkeen and wheat puffs under the ‘Natkhat’ brand. WestBridge, which took a stake in DFM in 2014, will fully exit the company. The acquisition will trigger an open offer to DFM’s public shareholders for an additional 26% stake in the company in line with rules of the Securities and Exchange Board of India. The open offer will be made at  ₹249.50 per share and based on its response, Advent could end up paying between  ₹852 crore and  ₹938 crore for the entire deal.
Fogg maker Vini in talks to raise fresh capital to fund growth plan
Vini Cosmetics, maker of Fogg deodorants, is in talks with several investment firms, including its existing private equity investor WestBridge Capital, to raise money and fund its next growth plan, Mint reported citing founder and promoter Darshan Patel. The fundraising plan, which may involve dilution of promoter stakes, is in line with its strategy to expand its product portfolio and double its revenue to  ₹2,000 crore in the next three years. “We are in talks with several investors. We want to bring in strategic investors who can help take this company to another level...from a small to a midsize company,"" Patel told Mint over the phone. As part of the growth plan, the Ahmedabad-based firm would look at both the organic and inorganic route to expand its product portfolio. At present, the company earns more than 80% of its revenue from the Fogg deodorant brand, while the rest comes from other products, such facial powder White Tone and facial cream Glam-Up. Patel launched Vini Cosmetics in 2010 after spending two decades at Paras Pharmaceuticals, which he co-owned with his brothers. Patel had a 24% stake in the company. In 2006, he sold his stake to private equity firm Actis Capital for $43 million following differences with his brothers. He later exited the company, which was acquired by Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc in 2010 for  ₹3,260 crore.
Roadis in Talks to buy out partner Soma in Indian Venture
Roadis, which builds and operates highways globally, is in talks to buy out partner Soma Enterprises in their equally-owned joint venture in India, The Economic Times reported citing two people aware of the matter. The discussions are at an initial stage and it is yet to be decided whether the assets are to be kept independently under the Roadis platform or its newly formed JV with National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF). The JV, Soma Roadis, has four highway concessions under the build-operate-transfer model in India, stretching 710 kilometres — Panipat-Jalandhar (291 km), Kishangarh-Ajmer-Beawar (94 km), Surat-Hazira Port (133 km) and Varanasi-Aurangabad (192 km). Roadis was previously known as Isolux Infrastructure, a subsidiary of Spanish group Isolux Corsan. Soma Enterprises formed the JV with Isolux Infrastructure in 2009. Canadian pension investment manager PSP Investments acquired Isolux Infrastructure in 2016 and renamed it Roadis. Roadis’ JV with NIIF, the country’s sovereign wealth fund, was formed in April.

137,2019-09-10,Mahindra Mahindra,"A mix of robotics, AI and IoT is making the Indian factory smarter. How  will  the  shop floor look 10 years from now?While India may have missed the manufacturing bus of the 1980s and 1990s, the bus has now become more advanced. And the edge lies in industrial IoT,  robotics,  AI  and 3D  printing

Bengaluru: Three years ago, TAL Manufacturing Solutions Ltd, a unit of Tata Motors Ltd, showcased a robot called BRABO at the “Make in India"" week in Mumbai. Short for “Bravo Robot"", BRABO was touted by the company as the first “Made in India"" industrial robot, and is designed to lift loads of up to 10 kilograms.
Mahindra and Mahindra LTd already has a “robotic weld line"" at its factory in Nashik, which now caters to many of its products including the Marazzo and the XUV300. Tata Motors, too, uses robots in its Pune factory, while Godrej and Welspun run their shop floors with the help of an Intelligent Plant Framework, which enables tracking of machinery and productivity on the floor in real time.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd has numerous robots employed at its Manesar and Gurugram car factories, with more than 2,000 robots working at the weld shop in its Manesar facility alone. Manjushree Technopack Ltd’s Bidadi (in Bengaluru) manufacturing plant also has more than a dozen of its packaging machines connected to a network, providing monthly updates on maintenance issues.
Automation, of course, is no stranger to shop floors. Many factories all over the world and India have been using computer numerical control (CNC) machines for years. These machines allow operators to feed a program of instructions directly into a mini-computer via a small board, similar to a traditional keyboard. After loading the required tools in the machine, the rest is done automatically by the CNC machines, which use these instructions to control machinery such as the grinder, milling machine, and lathe. But next-gen automation is likely to be vastly different on one score: it will either make humans redundant or vastly alter the necessary skill set that is required to hold on to one’s spot on the shop floor. A human-machine interface, or HMI, may eventually make the good old CNC machine voice-activated, for example, allowing an operator to just speak instructions.
These oncoming changes will leave long-lasting impacts on India’s labour force, particularly in some sectors—automotive, textile, and banking and financial services, apart from information technology—which have become far more attuned to global shifts due to the nature of modern supply chains. The “smart factory"" will, in all likelihood, change the popular conception of what a shop floor looks like.
An army of robots
The number of robots in use worldwide multiplied threefold over the past two decades to 2.25 million, according to a June 2019 report by Oxford Economics. Trends suggest the global stock of robots will multiply even faster in the next 20 years, reaching as many as 20 million by 2030—with 14 million in China alone, the report adds.
India is way behind at the moment. But things can change very quickly. The automotive industry, which is currently racked by a slowdown, is a great example. In the face of stagnation, firms that had begun to ramp up their robot density (robots per 10,000 workers) in the mid-2000s have now merely chosen not to rehire a bulk of the short-term, rotational, low-skilled contract workforce. According to a 22 January 2019 report by the International Federation of Robotics, India’s automotive sector was the main customer for industrial robots, accounting for as much as 62% of the total supply.
“On average, each newly installed robot displaces 1.6 manufacturing workers,"" the report says. Despite these rapid changes, industry players like Harshvendra Soin, chief people officer at Tech Mahindra, say: “We believe the future will be more human than we think."" However, some factories are now beginning to acquire the capability for “lights out"" production—meaning, they can operate without the presence of human workers. In fact, Japanese robotics firm FANUC, which is considered to be the poster boy for such factories, has been operating a “lights out"" factory with robots since 2001.
Unique quandary
India is in a unique quandary. While the country needs to find jobs for its booming population, the globally competitive opportunities are almost entirely in smart manufacturing, most of which require less human hands per unit of output. “The conventional ways of doing incremental business will no longer suffice. India needs to push its people to adopt disruptive ways of doing business,"" said Ashutosh Sharma, secretary, Department of Science and Technology at the 4th Confederation of Indian Industries Smart Manufacturing Summit, held on 26 October 2018 in Delhi.
While India may have missed the manufacturing bus of the 1980s and 90s, which powered China’s growth, the bus has now become more advanced. And the competitive edge lies in artificial intelligence (AI), industrial Internet of Things (IoT), wearables, robotics and additive manufacturing (better known as 3D printing), which are all set to fundamentally transform global production.
In any case, automation on the shop floor is now being taken to new levels. Machines develop faults like parts getting worn out or equipment not getting calibrated properly. An operator could, thus, waste a lot of time trying to locate the origin of the problem. It’s here that automation is being combined with AI and IoT on the shop floor to resolve such issues.
AI, for instance, can be integrated with CNC machines to enable self-diagnosis. Thus, when a fault develops, it will be detected and the software will try and solve the problem. Apart from using the data that is collected thus for diagnostics, a more advanced AI system could analyze that data and alter the settings of the machine to optimize a prototype being manufactured.
According to a 10 May blog by Craig Lyjak, EY Global Smart Factory leader, the smart factory is no longer a futuristic vision. It is the heart of the broader Industry 4.0, or the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which refers to the gradual combination of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices with digital technologies. The most prominent of these technologies, according to Lyjak, include computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software, cloud computing, IoT, advanced sensor technologies, 3D printing, industrial robotics, data analytics, AI and machine learning (ML), and enhanced machine-to-machine (M2M) communications.
These technologies are already showing impressive results both globally and in India. In 2016, The Times of India reported that the country’s first “self-aware"" factory was being set up in Bengaluru at the Indian Institute of Science’s Centre for Product Design and Manufacturing with seed funding from the Boeing Co. The factory is enabling data to be continuously collected and monitored, from both sensor-fitted machines and digitally connected wearables in order to provide real-time insights about every movement and process taking place on the factory floor. The factory remains a “work in progress"".
On its part, German auto-component maker Bosch’s Bidadi plant has cobots, or collaborative robots, working alongside humans. GE’s Chakan (in Pune) factory’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is linked to the manufacturing execution system (MES). Equipment efficiency is monitored in real time to decide production schedules like availability of forks or lifts, raw material trucks, workers and machines while sensors (read IoT) send warnings on possible breakdowns.
Digital factories
While the Indian automobile industry is unquestionably at the vanguard of the oncoming change, other companies are not entirely untouched. Mondelez India describes its Sri City (in Andhra Pradesh) unit as an “integrated digital factory"", one which can pack 6,300 chocolate bars a minute, while Jaipur Watch Co. has added a new collection of stainless steel watches that were 3D printed.
Lyjak cites the example of Microsoft Dynamics’ integration with smart factory processes and technologies as a case in point. Microsoft Dynamics’ Remote Assist application, for instance, combines Microsoft HoloLens (a self-contained, holographic computer) with mixed reality, video calling, annotations, and file sharing to enable experts to remotely troubleshoot complex problems and help technicians. This saves time, reduces travel costs and improves operational efficiency on the shop floor.
Further, AI is used to optimize the multi-robot fulfilment system in Amazon warehouses. The average cost for a spot welding robot, according to the report, is projected to decrease by 22% by 2025, and robots-as-a-service models are beginning to appear.
Although bringing AI onto the shop floor would require a massive capital investment, the return on investment (ROI) is higher, according to SaaSnic Technologies. AI and ML, for instance, can test numerous demand forecasting models with precision, while automatically adjusting to different variables such as new product introductions, supply chain disruptions or sudden changes in demand. Using AI systems, every single part of a product can be tracked from when it’s first manufactured to when it is assembled and shipped to the customer.
Walmart, for instance, cut its physical inventory from one month to 24 hours by using drones that fly through the warehouse, scan products, and check for misplaced items. Using algorithms that learn from experience to optimize logistics, BMW tracks a part from the point it was manufactured to when the vehicle is sold—from all of its assembly facilities across the world. In finance operations, AI can close operations and automate monthly, quarterly and year-end processes. Using ML, bots can learn from human inputs to make better judgments and adapt to the behaviour patterns of accounting professionals.
The future office
Smart robots also assist shop floor operations indirectly by increasing employee satisfaction and appealing to a millennial mindset. A couple of months ago, for instance, Indian IT services provider Tech Mahindra introduced a Human Resource (HR) humanoid at its Noida Special Economic Zone Campus in Uttar Pradesh. Christened K2, this was the second HR humanoid (a robot that resembles a human) from the Mahindra Group company—the first was launched at its Hyderabad campus in May.
K2 can address HR-related employee queries and even handle personal requests for actions like providing payslips, tax forms, etc. With the help of AI, K2 can start a conversation without any need for wake-up commands. It can even converse with differently-abled employees by responding to queries with a text display along with speech. Tech Mahindra now plans to deploy the next humanoid at its Pune campus.
Despite the immense potential benefits of enhancing ERP systems with AI, there are risks with regard to sharing of sensitive data and regulations that need to be considered, such as the European Union general data protection regulation (GDPR), besides the loss of jobs to automation and robots. That said, the benefits may outweigh the risks if governments devise sensible privacy regulations, and revamp labour policies to factor in the impact of these new technologies on the workforce.
As an example, Tech Mahindra, which has already implemented an AI-based facial recognition (which typically raises privacy invasion concerns) system to register the attendance of employees, claims it has “drastically reduced the time spent by an associate in updating the timesheet"". The company also has Talex—an AI-driven marketplace of talent that maps skills of the existing talent pool.
But the increasingly common use of AI and robotics in the Indian context may lie inside the e-commerce package. Gurugram-based AI-powered robotics firm GreyOrange’s Butler, for example, is an autonomous robot that uses goods-to-person technology for inventory storage and order picking. It populates the many warehouses that have come up across the country in order to fuel the e-commerce boom. Butler runs on a software platform that uses AI algorithms and ML, which optimize path planning, maximize storage, and accelerate order fulfilment.
The final piece of the puzzle is the ability to hire these intelligent machines on contract, like workers. As a precursor for what may become commonplace soon, US-based Hirebotics allows firms to hire cloud-connected robots. The hourly wage starts at $15 per hour and they can work a minimum of 80 hours a week—and, they neither tire nor need bathroom breaks. Of course, companies have to give Hirebotics a 30-day written notice if they fire any robot. What these robot work contracts show is this: the future is already here."
133,2019-09-12,Mahindra Mahindra,"The subscription model will be available on select cars for a period of one to four yearsM&M has rolled out 7 models from its passenger car portfolio for subscription

India’s leading utility vehicle manufacturer, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) has rolled out subscription-based passenger car ownership model in partnership with Revv, a four-year old startup that operates in the car-sharing space.
Seen as M&M’s attempt to cater to the varied car ownership requirements of the salaried and self-employed buyers, largely millennials, in tier I and II cities across India, the announcement comes as the beginning of festive season has failed to give any early indications of an uptick in the domestic vehicle demand.
The subscription model will be available on select cars for a period of one to four years, wherein the customer will be required to pay a refundable deposit and a month’s charges in advance, M&M said.
Last year in October, M&M had forayed into the car leasing space for retail buyers by partnering Orix and ALD Automotive. Veejay Ram Nakra, chief of sales and marketing, automotive division, M&M Ltd said the carmaker aims to address all kinds of customer requirements ranging from complete ownership, leasing and now subscription-based models.
M&M said it has recorded annual volumes of about 2,500 units under its personal portfolio of car leasing business in the past year. Nakra, however, refused to disclose the volume of subscriptions expected in the first one year of the business.
The company said that benefits of car subscription model includes zero down payment, no road tax, insurance, no risk of resale value and no maintenance cost as the monthly fixed amount includes all those costs. “The subscription model offers flexibility as no checking of the customer’s cibil score is required. Although the minimum duration is one year, the subscription plan can let young professionals change or upgrade the cars they want. They get access to driving a brand new car under our subscription-based model,"" said Nakra.
According to the senior company official, in the car-leasing format the buyer typically owns a single product for 3-4 years wherein the car could be either brand new or a used model.
M&M has rolled out 7 models from its passenger car portfolio for subscription including XUV300, Scorpio, XUV500, Marazzo, Alturas G4 and others. In partnership with Revv, M&M cars will be available across 8 cities including Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore and others under phase one. “We plan to add 11 more cities under the said model in the second phase,"" added Nakra.
Meanwhile, Revv, which has upto 3,500 cars in its fleet available for subscription across India, also has an arrangement with Hyundai Motor India Ltd, besides M&M. Earlier, Gurgaon-based Revv had signed up for the subscription-based model in January 2019, and has recorded up to 350 subscribers per month, its co-founders told Mint.
“We have about 1,100 passenger cars out in the market via subscription today. We are expecting the total to go up to 2,500 cars by December 2019. In CY2020, our internal target is to triple the subscription base as we continue to expand our footprint across India,"" Anupam Agarwal and Karan Jain of Revv told Mint.
For Revv, which is expanding from 19 to 22 cities by next week, Bangalore is the single biggest market followed by Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad for subscription-based cars."

NEW DELHI :
An octogenarian woman from Tamil Nadu, who had been selling idlis for just  ₹1 each to feed the poor for the last 30 years, has got noticed after businessman Anand Mahindra tweeted out a video of hers. Mahindra was particularly concerned about the health of her lungs as she was burning wood to steam fluffy idlis.

New Delhi: Auto-makers Maruti Suzuki India and Tata Motors' domestic passenger vehicle market share declined in April-August this year, while Hyundai and M&M witnessed gain in the same period, as per data compiled by industry body SIAM.
The country's largest car-maker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) saw its market share dip by over 2 percentage points during the period under review and slip below 50% in the domestic passenger vehicle segment in April-August.
The company sold 5,55,064 units this fiscal as compared with 7,57,289 units during April-August previous year. Its market share has come down from 52.16% last year to 49.83% in the April-August this fiscal.
Overall PV sales during the April-August of the current fiscal stands at 11,09,930 units as compared to 14,51,647 units.
When contacted MSI executive director (marketing and sales) Shashank Srivastava told PTI that while cars and vans (A and C segment) have performed well, there has been a drop in sales of utility vehicles (B segment).
""This is because of constraint in supply of Ertiga having a large waiting period,"" he added.
Besides, there is a shift in consumer preference in SUV segment towards petrol where currently the company does not have a variant, Srivastava said adding that MSI plans to introduce petrol variants of Vitara Brezza and S-Cross BS-VI later this fiscal.
Similarly, Tata Motors has reported sales of 60,093 units this fiscal so far as against 98,702 units last year. Its market share has fallen by 1.39 percentage points to 5.41% in the current fiscal as against 6.79% last year.

Despite selling less this fiscal, the company's market share has risen from 15.59% last fiscal to 18.36%.
""2019 is a milestone year for Hyundai Motor India as we launched three products in three different segments...the new launches have led to increase in customer traction, footfalls in showrooms and market share,"" Hyundai Motor India Ltd National Sales Head Vikas Jain said.
Similarly, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) sold 89,733 units this fiscal so far as compared with 1,00,015 units in April-August last financial year, still its market share has risen by 1.19 percentage points this fiscal to 8.08% from 6.89%.

130,2019-09-16,Mahindra Mahindra,"Sales of used cars are estimated to rise to as many as 4.4 million units this fiscal from 4 million in the previous fiscalCar resellers expect the surge in sales of used cars to continue due to new regulations and changing consumer tastes.

Mumbai: India’s used car market is booming at a time when the domestic automotive industry is battling one of its worst sales slump.
The demand in used cars is being driven by smaller towns and cities as stricter regulations, especially on emissions, and changing consumer preferences in major cities lead many to discard their older cars for new vehicles.
Sales of pre-owned cars are estimated to increase to as many as 4.4 million units this fiscal from 4 million in the previous fiscal, according to used car dealer Mahindra First Choice Wheels. Online classifieds platform OLX India has an almost similar sales forecast of 4.4-4.5 million units.
Mint spoke to several organized and stand-alone used car resellers, all of whom expect the current surge in sales of used cars to continue because of new regulations as well as changing consumer tastes.
“Car owners in metropolitan cities change their vehicles faster. Secondly, when government notifications ban vehicles such as petrol cars older than 15 years and diesel cars older than 10 years in Delhi-NCR, where do these vehicles go? They are sold in the used car market, refurbished and then sold again in the smaller cities and towns,"" said Ashutosh Pandey, chief executive of Mahindra First Choice Wheels, the used car selling arm of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. He said Delhi-NCR, Mumbai and Bengaluru comprise the bulk of supplies of used cars.
Sunny Kataria, vice president of auto at OLX India, said demand for used cars from tier II cities increased 10% in the second half of fiscal 2019.
“While supply of pre-owned cars largely rests on tier I cities, the demand for the same is increasing in the tier II and smaller cities,"" Kataria said.
India’s used car market can be broadly categorised into OEM (original equipment manufacturer) retail franchisees, classified players, consumer-to-business and other transactional platforms.
Robust demand for used vehicles comes at a time when the automotive industry is experiencing sharply weakening demand. Passenger vehicle sales in India plunged 32% from a year earlier in August to 196,524 units, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). It was the 10th straight decline in monthly passenger vehicle sales and the worst since Siam began compiling monthly sales data in 1997-98.
Lucknow-based Wasim Khan, owner of three used car garages, said that although consumer spending is on the decline, car buyers do not want to compromise on their aspirations to own big cars with new features such as connectivity in infotainment systems, sunroofs and even airbags. “They want all that in second-hand cars within their budgets,"" said Khan, who bought some diesel cars last year from Delhi NCR-based owners such as Fiat Linea, Volkswagen Vento, Tata Safari, Mahindra Scorpio and Honda City.
Shubh Bansal, co-founder of Truebil, a four-year-old online startup for used vehicles, said: “There are several hyperlocal parameters that drive the pre-owned car market, which remains largely unorganized. The demand-supply equation matters a lot in this space"".
Citing a few examples, he said it is difficult to find a buyer for a 10-year-old Honda City in Mumbai, but satellite towns such as Kolhapur, Pune and Nashik will have buyers for such vehicles.
“There is huge demand for 7-10-year-old cars in satellite cities situated adjacent to the large metros,"" said Bansal.
Truebil, which raised about $20 million, including $1 million from Japanese venture capital firm Spiral Ventures last week, has tied up with dealers in smaller cities to auction cars bought from bigger cities.
OLX India said in a recent report that the car buying decisions of millennials are more rooted in pragmatism and aspirations, thereby fuelling growth in this segment. Value-seeking millennials and Indian families are turning to pre-owned cars as resale value, technology and safety are the top three considerations, it said.
“At 440 million, millennials comprise over a third of India’s population and nearly half of the total working population. Indian millennials are driving India’s consumption story and this trend is also reflected in the pre-owned cars market,"" the OLX report said. The study forecasts the used car market to breach five million in sales in FY21."

128,2019-09-16,Mahindra Mahindra,"Subscriptions transform transactions from one-time sales into meaningful relationships

Talking about issues plaguing the Indian automobile sector, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman ascribed part of the problem to millennials subscribing to Uber and Ola instead of buying cars. A few days after her comments, Mahindra launched a subscription-based car ownership model, just like its global counterparts Ford, Volvo, Hyundai and Porsche.
It’s true that people across the world, especially millennials, depend on Uber and Ola. Why can’t we subscribe to transportation just the way we subscribe to water, internet and electricity?
At the 2019 Subscribed conference in San Francisco, Ford’s director of connectivity Jamie Allison said his company’s new charter is to make the “bed-to-bed"" journey as simple as possible. Companies are waking up to the fact that they can’t solve mobility issues simply by selling more cars.
In the digital age, we prefer outcomes to ownership and customization to standardization. That is why subscription is the future of business and every company is doing its best to adopt a subscription-based model as soon as possible.
This trend goes beyond business. American rapper Kanye West is popularly called the first SaaS (software-as-a-service) musician. In 2016, he launched The Life Of Pablo, an unfinished album, where he kept tweaking the lyrics based on the feedback from fans and constantly changed the order of songs. In Tech Speak, he launched an minimal viable product (MVP ) and reimagined his customers into subscribers and creative participants.
Research shows companies that run on subscription models grow their revenue more than nine times faster than S&P 500 firms. There are three reasons subscriptions work for businesses in the digital age. First, they expand optionality for the customer. If customers aren’t satisfied, switching to another service provider is straightforward.
Second, subscriptions transform transactions into meaningful relationships. Instead of focusing on one-time sales, entrepreneurs need to provide value over an extended period of time. This is a win-win scenario. Entrepreneurs work hard to understand unmet customer needs and figure out innovative means to provide services that go beyond the expectations of the underlying contract. This makes the service provider better and enhances customer surplus.
Lastly, subscriptions ease out the financial burden of customers. Instead of committing a sizable chunk of their savings to acquiring assets, they can avail the desired services for a fraction of the cost.
Let’s see this in action. Cars are depreciating assets. The moment we drive them out of the showroom, their value drops by almost 50%. This is probably why subscription services like Porsche Passport appeal to millennials. They can drive the latest Porsche models for as long as we want without having to deal with the headaches of ownership. All this at a cost that is both affordable and attractive.
Building a culture
Every MBA student learns about the four Ps in marketing: product, price, promotion and place. Today, product ownership is dead. Hence, the first of four Ps is better understood as service. With that in mind, we can pivot again the entire business to focus on customer satisfaction. Tien Tzuo, chief executive of enterprise software company Zuora, offers a great framework to visualize any company as an integrated organization of subsystems tied to what the customer truly wants. He suggests that organizations need to incentivize radical collaboration across organizational silos and constantly evolve to delight customers. This might be chaotic in the short-term, but it brings organizations closer to what they intend to achieve. Today, the whole world runs as a service: education, transportation, media and healthcare.
While subscriptions are not a new idea, ubiquitous Internet connectivity coupled with decreasing infrastructure cost and high levels of customer awareness have made subscriptions the perfect complements to businesses in the digital age.
In 2002, commenting on the decline of iTunes downloads, Steve Jobs said the subscription model was bankrupt and destined to fail. The same year song-writer David Bowie made a far more prescient statement: “Music subscriptions are going to become like running water of electricity. While Jobs got several things right, he underestimated the power of subscriptions, the heart and soul of businesses in the digital age. Bowie saw what Jobs couldn’t. Millennial Matters recalibrates the skills needed to survive and find meaning in the workplace of tomorrow.

Great! Welcome splendidly!
In July, Mahindra had promised on Twitter that he would ban plastic bottles in the boardroom after a Twitter user politely suggested that the board room should have steel bottles instead of plastic ones. ""I think the boardroom should have steel bottles instead of plastic bottles,"" she tweeted. ""Plastic bottles will be banished. We were all embarrassed to see them that day,"" Mahindra had responded.
Yes, plastic bottles will be banished. We were all embarrassed to see them that day... https://t.co/RwZA4tWoRE
India is getting ready to ban single-use plastic. Last month, during his monthly radio address to the nation, 'Mann Ki Baat', the Prime Minister had pitched for launching a ""new mass movement"" against single-use plastic from October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. He also spoke about the initiative during the Independence Day address, urging people to join the movement.
The Mahindra group honcho is also known for his witty replies on Twitter. Recently he reignited the issue of the best smartphone debate by clicking a picture from his Google Pixel phone and tweeting with caption, ""Manhattan moonscape. Have to admit, my pixel takes much sharper pics than my iPhone X. And I'm told the Samsung is even better?"" Mr Mahindra tweeted."

Industrialist Anand Mahindra had triggered a debate on Twitter after he posted an image clicked through this Google Pixel smartphone. The discussion is not over yet. Now, Mahindra himself has gone one step ahead taking the debate forward with his latest tweet that compares photographs taken from his Google Pixel smartphone and iPhone X. But he stays away from passing any judgement and asking Twitterarti to evaluate the pictures themselves.
Here goes his tweet and the pictures, if you haven’t had a look at them.
""Still experimenting with my pixel & my iPhone X here in manhattan. Just came out of a broadway show, did a simple point & shoot, same spot, same angle, same time. You be the judge,"" Mahindra tweeted.

One lens is not clean.
Picture in right side is more clear. I judge camera clarity after zooming the picture. One which get less blurred when you zoom the pic is good as per laymen like me. By the way if you love pixel more than iPhone X you can gift iPhone X to someone like me.

124,2019-09-20,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra clicked the same image with Google Pixel and iPhone X, stirring a debate around which phone has a better cameraBoth Google and Apple claim to leverage artificial intelligence to produce the images they do on their smartphones

New Delhi: Industrialist Anand Mahindra has unwittingly sparked a debate around the smart cameras on the Google Pixel and the iPhone X.
Mahindra clicked the same image with the two phones, stirring a debate around which phone has a better camera. While the Twitterati are busy giving opinions, here are some other phones that might impress Mr. Mahindra.
Why are we looking at other smartphone cameras? Well, because while both Google and Apple claim to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to produce the images they do on their smartphones, so do some of their competitors who hold a bigger share of the market in the country.
OnePlus 7 Pro
The leader of India’s premium market, OnePlus’ smartphone cameras may not match up to a Google Pixel 3 or the new iPhones, but they are still quite good. The company enhanced the camera software with an update recently and also claims to use AI algorithms to understand scenes and enhance the final image.
Honor View 20
Huawei was amongst the first to introduce AI algorithms in smartphone cameras. The company extends that to its Honor brand and the Honor View 20 is one of the best cameras it has on the market today.
Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro
Arguable the most value for money flagship-class smartphone today, the Redmi K20 Pro runs on the Snapdragon 855 chipset, Qualcomm’s latest and greatest. However, it also has an AI camera mode that slightly oversaturates image to suit most mainstream user’s tastes in photos.
Huawei Mate 20 Pro
It’s true that Huawei announced an upgrade to this phone yesterday, but that takes nothing away from the company’s current device. Many have said that the Mate 20 Pro has a better camera than the Google Pixel 3, which is saying something in today’s smartphone space. If you can afford this device, it’s certainly one for the camera lovers.
Of course, we would love to know Mr Mahindra's viiews on these smart cameras too."

122,2019-09-20,Mahindra Mahindra,"Move to tax new manufacturing firms set up after 1 Oct at 15% is expected to strengthen the MSME sectorThe move is likely to help the Centre achieve the target of growing India’s exports to $1 trillion in the next five years, as lower taxes will help homegrown firms compete with global peers

The cut in corporate tax rates on Friday will play a major role in reviving economic growth, which slumped to 5% in the June quarter, besides improving the investment climate and pushing private sector capex, said industry leaders.
A slowing economy and consumer demand slump, amid banking sector woes over non-performing assets and the liquidity crunch facing non-bank lenders, had fuelled uncertainties and volatility in the Indian market.
The government announcement to cut basic corporate tax rate for domestic firms from 30% to 22%, and for new manufacturing firms from 25% to 15%, is a “bold move"" that will make Indian firms more competitive on the global stage, said senior leaders and company executives. It will also help attract significant investments from foreign and long-term investors.
“The government’s decisive steps to pump-prime the economy will lead to a big reset and revive animal spirits in corporate India. The reduction in corporate tax rates will not only lead to economic buoyancy, but will also make Indian industry more competitive globally,"" said Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman, Aditya Birla Group. The steps will also lead to a paradigm shift in the mindset, Birla added.
The move is likely to help the Centre achieve the target of growing India’s exports to $1 trillion in the next five years, as lower taxes will help homegrown firms compete with global peers. In 2018-19 India’s exports crossed the half-a-trillion-dollar mark to clock $537 billion. While goods exports were at an all-time high of $331 billion, services exports were at $205 billion. 
Uday Kotak, executive vice-chairman and managing director, Kotak Mahindra Bank, said the government’s decision will level the playing field and allow Indian companies to compete with those in lower-tax jurisdictions.
Industry leaders also expect the move to boost industry sentiment and lead to a revival in capital expenditure. 
Mint reported on 2 July that investments in new projects had plunged to a 15-year low in the June quarter, citing data of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Indian firms, across private and public sectors, announced projects worth  ₹43,400 crore in the June quarter, 81% lower than in the March quarter, and 87% lower than a year ago.
“We are certain that this Big Bang reform will kick-start the economy. Surplus funds available to firms will be invested in capex and talent,"" said Ajay Piramal, chairman, Piramal Group, adding non-banking financial firms will be able to save  ₹250-300 crore, which can potentially be redeployed as loans. The move to tax new manufacturing firms set up after 1 October at 15% will prove to be a significant boost to entrepreneurship and is expected to strengthen the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector, which are key cogs in the industrial supply chains. The move “will unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of new India"", said Vedanta chairman Anil Agarwal. “The revised rate of minimum alternative tax will pave way for new investments from startups and MSMEs; to create a robust ancillary ecosystem,"" he added.
Amit Panday, Tanya Thomas and Kalpana Pathak contributed to this story."
120,2019-09-23,Mahindra Mahindra,"Currently, this as a good opportunity to enter midcap and smallcap segments of the market: Kotak Mutual FundKotak Standard Multicap Fund, the company’s biggest fund, has returned an average of about 11% over the past five years

Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. has loaded up on shares of Indian mid- and small-sized businesses based on its primary investment rule to pick stocks rather than try to time the market. It’s been a volatile year for Indian stocks, however, with the Sensex’s 12% climb through early June nearly wiped out as of Thursday’s close. The benchmark gauge surged 5.3% Friday after the country cut its corporate tax rate, putting it back in the green for the year.
“For investors it’s very difficult to time market phases,"" Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer-equity at India’s sixth-largest fund manager, said in an interview at his office in Mumbai last week. “If you can take a little bit of more risk, you should tilt toward mid- and small-cap as this basket can give higher returns when the market stabilizes.""
India’s smaller stocks have been hit by a slowing economy and a severe dent in consumption. The Nifty Midcap 100 Index has slumped 25% from its peak in January 2018 and now trades 14.3 times its estimated 12-month earnings, lower than the Nifty 50 Index’s 17.5 times.
Kotak sees this as a good opportunity to enter this segment of the market, as it expects Indian lenders to pass interest-rate reductions by the central bank to their customers. “If it happens, it will improve consumer and corporate demand, and that will be one of the bigger triggers,"" Upadhyaya said.
The money manager prefers non-consumer companies and will continue to add shares of businesses such as industrial-equipment suppliers, chemicals, cement and gas utilities. Consumer stocks constitute nearly 12% of its holdings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of Aug. 31.
About 40% of the firm’s holdings are financial stocks. Around 55% of its stock holdings are larger companies, while mid- and small-sized names constitute a total 39%.
Kotak Standard Multicap Fund, the company’s biggest fund with about $3.6 billion of assets, has returned an average of about 11% over the past five years, topping 82% of its rivals, according to Bloomberg data. That compares with a 7.4% annual return generated by the Nifty 200 over the same period.
Here are some more comments from Upadhyaya:
Although interest rates have fallen and are expected to drop further, the initial leg of revival will likely be among companies with strong balance sheets
India has been a beneficiary of abundant global liquidity and low interest rates, and if anything changes with that it will impact local investors
If oil prices rise, that would add to the problems that local investors are already facing

Mumbai: Shares of information technology companies fell on Monday after investors booked profit as analysts see no material impact on tax rates after the government cut tax rates for domestic companies.
Analysts said IT stocks had traded at a premium to other stocks as investors took to defensive plays due to concern over an economic slowdown and liquidity crunch.
On Monday, shares of Infosys Ltd fell 3.2%, Wipro Ltd declined 2.2%, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd 2%, Tech Mahindra Ltd 1.7%, HCL Technologies Ltd 1.3%. Nifty IT Index slumped 2%.
According to a Credit Suisse report, there will be no material impact on tax rates on IT services companies following the tax cuts. The current blended effective tax rates of 22-27% are a combination of higher tax rates paid outside India and much lower tax rates paid in India. IT companies, thus pay lower than 25% tax rates in India and the cuts announced Friday will not lower their overall tax rates.
Brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher said it has increased underweight on the sector to 390 basis points and remains cautious as growth in tech spends in BFS clients in the US and European geography will be muted compared to last year due to trade war concerns, uncertainty on central bank policy and interest rates, Brexit related uncertainty. The rupee advantage will also weaken now.
The new taxation rule will be neutral event for Indian IT companies at the consolidate level. Tax rates will be lower than 25% as US and UK rates are at 21% and 18% respectively, Prabhudas Lilladher report adds."

If that’s not met, creditors can sell shares in the group’s flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. kept as collateral against loans

Indian media giant Essel Group, run by industry mogul Subhash Chandra, is seeking an extension to repay debt in order to avoid creditors liquidating its shares.
The company faces a month-end debt repayment deadline. If that’s not met, creditors can sell shares in the group’s flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. kept as collateral against loans. The case highlights broader risks that borrowings backed by stock pose to the equity market. There’s a lot at stake with share-backed loans currently at about 1.9 trillion rupees ($26.5 billion).
Essel Group’s Chandra is seeking to sell assets ranging from a stake in the nation’s most valuable publicly traded TV network to roads. Shares of his Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. have plummeted to the lowest level in five years.
“We have certainly discussed the point pertaining to the extension as well, purely in the interest of deriving the right value for the precious assets,"" said Punit Goenka, managing director and chief executive officer at Zee Enterprises in an emailed response, “The lenders have noted our view and have been extremely supportive.""
The media tycoon’s challenge is the first of what could be a string of tests this year for beleaguered business titans. They have raised funds to expand their empires by pledging equity stakes in their firms and the clock is ticking as repayment dates loom.
Risks Mount
“Not everybody is going to come out of this alive,"" said Jayanth R Varma, a professor at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad, referring to the founder’s funding predicament. “I can’t imagine that all the groups that are in trouble today will be able to sort out their mess.""
Chandra has already sold $614 million of its Zee Entertainment Stake to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund and has agreed to sell his solar power projects for $182 million to Adani Green Energy Ltd. The Essel Group has begun paying back creditors, including about half of the 3.95 billion rupees ($55.7 million) it owes Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co., Harsha Upadhyay, chief investment officer for the asset management firm said in an interview.
Still, some lenders didn’t agree to extend Essel Group’s repayment deadline beyond September end and has sold the shares of Zee Entertainment kept as loan collateral, a representative for the company said in an email statement on Tuesday. Others have “in-principally agreed to grant more time to"" repay debt, the representative said.
Broader Concerns
Shares of publicly traded firms with a large portion of equity pledged as collateral risk abrupt declines should lenders move to recover their dues. For instance, Chandra’s Zee Entertainment lost $1.6 billion in market capitalization in a single day on fears that creditors would offload shares.
A spokesman for Emami Ltd. declined to comment.
Should Essel group clear its debt hurdles, equity investors will still need to keep a close eye on the progress other conglomerates make in slashing debt, as companies’ credit quality endures the longest streak of deterioration since 2014.
“Stocks are getting decimated on their market capitalization, some company founders have realized their error and are liquidating assets,"" said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice-president at IIFL Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “Prudent risk management is the order of the day.""

117,2019-09-25,Mahindra Mahindra,"The deal keeps Ford in the heavily populated market while letting it share the financial burden with MahindraMahindra will own 51% of the new entity

LONDON :
Ford Motor Co. is set to transfer most of its assets in India to a joint venture with Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. after failing to make meaningful inroads for more than two decades in the world’s fourth-largest automobile market, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Mahindra, one of India’s largest automakers, will own 51% of the new entity, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the confidential plan. Ford will get equal voting rights and board representation, one of the people said. The venture, to be announced as soon as next week, doesn’t include Ford’s global business services division or an export-focused engine plant in Sanand.
Ford’s compensation is likely to be far below the $2 billion it’s poured into India, only to achieve market share of less than 3%. The deal keeps Ford in the heavily populated market while letting it share the financial burden with Mahindra. Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett is leading an $11 billion restructuring and paring money-losing overseas operations.
Ford is “insulating themselves a little bit,"" said Deepesh Rathore, an independent automobile analyst based in Bengaluru. “For Mahindra, it makes sense, because they are increasingly looking at the urban market.""
Global carmakers have had a tough time making inroads into India, which is dominated by Suzuki Motor Corp.’s cheap, fuel efficient vehicles. General Motors Co. scrapped a $1 billion investment in India two years ago and stopped selling Chevrolet models there. The market as a whole faces challenges, with sales contracting for the past 10 months, forcing the industry to cut production and jobs.
A final agreement hasn’t been reached and the discussions could still fall apart, the people said. Reuters reported some elements of the venture in April.
Mahindra shares fell as much as 4.3% to  ₹535 Wednesday in Mumbai. Ford shares closed 0.6% down on Tuesday.
Latest Foray
As envisioned, the new entity will hold most of Ford’s assets in India, including the two car plants it owns in the country. Ford was one of the first automobile companies to enter India when it liberalized the economy in the early 1990s. Ford first entered India in 1926 but shut down that operation in the 1950s.
“Ford remains committed to growing its customer base and product portfolio in the world’s fourth-largest automobile market, and will continue to make in India, for India and the world,"" Lori Arpin, a spokeswoman for the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker, said in a statement while declining to discuss specifics. Mahindra declined to comment.
The deal will allow Mahindra to sell some Ford vehicles in developing markets under its own brand, the people said. Ford and Mahindra also are jointly developing a mid-sized sport-utility vehicle for India.
Back in 2012, Ford had aimed to make the South Asian nation one of its three largest markets by 2020. Most global carmakers have failed to win over buyers in the notoriously price-conscious market led by Suzuki’s local unit, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., with its strong network of dealers and ubiquitous repair shops.

118,2019-09-25,Mahindra Mahindra,"State Bank of India declined following a rating downgrade by brokerage firm Morgan StanleyOther banking stocks such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Axis Bank were down 1-2% each

Banking and financial stocks were under severe selling pressure on Wednesday. The BSE Bankex has declined 1.7% so far today after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) put curbs on Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank. The central bank’s restrictions include limits on cash withdrawals amid a probe into accounting lapses, sparking speculation that the regulator may force a management change at the cooperative bank through a merger, according to a Mint report.
Shares of Housing Development & Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) fell 4% on news report that the RBI’s action on the PMC Bank was the result of a loan of  ₹2,500 crore to the now bankrupt real estate firm.
Among banking stocks, shares of State Bank of India fell the most--down over 4%--following a rating downgrade by brokerage firm Morgan Stanley. Other banking stocks such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Axis Bank were down 1-2% each.
India Ratings and Research has placed ratings of most of the public sector banks (PSBs) on ‘rating watch evolving (RWE)’, maintain a stable outlook for private banks. The rating agency believes banks have been facing the double whammy of absorbing aging provisions on corporate stressed assets and growing their balance sheets, while on-boarding minimum incremental stress.
“Post announcements of amalgamations, the anchor banks may deliver credit growth, although management bandwidth could be diverted towards the amalgamation process. Credit growth and asset recovery may not receive adequate attention in the short term as focus is also diverted towards asset quality harmonisation, human resource integration and other challenges,"" India Ratings and Research said in a report on 24 September.
It added that some of the banks excluded from the amalgamation process are likely to continue to shrink their balance sheets and may also require additional capital in FY20-FY21. It estimates that among its rated banks, the return on assets (RoA) of PSBs and private banks is expected to increase by up to 10 basis points (bps) and 30 bps (10%-15% higher than base case), respectively, as a result of the lowering of the corporate tax rate by government.
It said public sector banks may not see a material impact in FY20, especially given that many of them would be making net losses.
Others concur.
Kotak Institutional Equities expects the revised lower tax rate to have negligible impact on banks with high DTA (deferred tax asset). “We expect a positive impact on loan growth and provisions but offset by lower treasury. We maintain estimates but the long-term impact of return on equity (RoE) improvement is debatable. The impact on non-banks is mixed with lower tax rates (for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), negligible impact on housing finance companies (HFCs) that already enjoy 26-27% tax rates,"" it said in a report on 22 September."

112,2019-10-01,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra and Ford sign agreement to create joint venture to develop,market, distribute Ford brand vehicles in IndiaBy shifting to a joint venture, Ford is changing its India strategy where it has long run an independent operation

NEW DELHI,
		             MUMBAI :
Ford Motor Co. agreed to move most of its assets in India into a joint venture with a local partner after struggling for more than two decades to win over buyers in the world’s fourth-largest auto market.
The deal effectively ends Ford’s independent operations in a country it wanted to become one of its top three markets by 2020. The U.S. carmaker will take an $800 million to $900 million impairment charge related to the value of its India assets in the third quarter, it said Tuesday, after struggling to compete with cheap, fuel-efficient vehicles built by the local units of Suzuki Motor Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co.
Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., an Indian maker of sport utility vehicles, will own 51% of the joint venture and Ford the rest, the two companies said. The JV, which includes Ford’s two car factories in India, will be operationally managed by Mahindra. Governance of the venture is valued at 19.25 billion rupees ($275 million) will be equally shared.
Ford has been “struggling for a long while,"" and Mahindra’s products as well as its sourcing and distribution network will support the American company, said Priya Ranjan, an analyst at Antique Stock Broking in Mumbai. “It is not about giving up on India, it’s about doing better in India.""
The agreement, which includes cooperating on electric cars for emerging markets, comes at a time when sales of cars and SUVs in India are going through the worst-ever slump. A slowing economy, dwindling rural income, and rising popularity of ride-hailing and car-sharing services are weighing on vehicle demand.
Ford and Mahindra plan to introduce three new vehicles under the Ford brand, beginning with a midsize SUV that will share underpinnings with the Indian partner.
The deal keeps Ford in the country of 1.3 billion people while letting it share the financial burden with Mahindra, as Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett leads an $11 billion restructuring effort and pares money-losing overseas operations. U.S. rival General Motors Co. pulled out of India two years ago, scrapping a $1 billion investment and stopping sales of Chevrolet models.
Ford was one of the first global car companies to enter India when the economy opened up in the early 1990s. The company first set up shop in India in 1926 but shut down that operation in the 1950s.
India’s car sales contracted 41% in August, the 10th straight monthly decline. Job losses in the industry, which employs more than 32 million people directly and indirectly, have climbed to more than 580,000 in the past 18 months, according to estimates from labor unions and auto dealers."

MUMBAI :
The Government on Tuesday allowed Kotak Mahindra Bank managing director Uday Kotak to continue as the head of bankrupt infra lender IL&FS for one more year.
Kotak was appointed by the Government as the head of the lender's board which will help the troubled company come out of difficulties, after the state took over the board.
Under the Banking Regulation Act, a bank cannot be managed by any person who is a director of any other company. She can be given a temporary exception for three months or nine months with the concurrence of the RBI.
Accordingly, Kotak was given a go-ahead for three months initially, which was followed up with a nine-month relaxation that ends on Wednesday.
The statutes will ""not apply to Kotak Mahindra Bank in so far as it relates to its Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Uday Kotak being on Board of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited as its Non-executive Director for a period up to the 2nd October, 2020"", a gazette notification from the Government said.
The notification was issued by the Department of Financial Services in the Ministry of Finance on Tuesday and signed by Joint Secretary Amit Agrawal.
It added that the exemption has been granted on the ""recommendation"" of the Reserve Bank of India.
Terming it as a ""historic development"", a source claimed this is the first time RBI is giving approval to Government to give an extension to a bank CEO to continue as chairman of another financial institution.
It can be noted that Kotak Mahindra Bank has dragged RBI to court over the issue of promoter group led by Uday Kotak's holding in the bank. The Bombay High Court has adjourned the matter by over a year to early 2020.
The Uday Kotak-led board has discovered that there was a complex web of over 250 companies which were a part of the overall IL&FS group, which has an outstanding of over  ₹94,000 crore to lenders. Over 90 per cent of the flagship company's assets are classified as dud.
The board is trying to keep the company as a going concern by focusing on asset sales and has appointed a resolution professional to steer the way.

Reflecting on the sales performance, M&M Chief of Sales and Marketing, Automotive Division, Veejay Ram Nakra said, ""We are positive that this festive season, with the onset of Navratra, will augur well for us and the automotive industry.""
This, in addition to factors such as the good monsoon and recently announced positive government initiatives should help revive the industry in the short term, he added.

109,2019-10-01,Mahindra Mahindra,"Ford will transfer its entire business in India, barring an engine plant in Sanand, and its Chennai-based Global Business Services unit, to a new JV firm controlled by M&MThe Mahindra will own 51% in the new entity while the remainder will be held by Ford

Mumbai: Ford Motor Co. will cede control of most of its India operations to Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M), underscoring the US company’s long-drawn struggles to make a bigger dent in the world’s fourth-largest automobile market.
Ford will transfer its entire business in India, barring an engine plant in Sanand, Gujarat, and its Chennai-based Global Business Services unit, to a new joint venture company controlled by M&M. The Indian automaker will own 51% in the new entity while the remainder will be held by Ford.
M&M will invest  ₹657 crore in the JV, which has a likely equity value of  ₹1,289 crore. M&M will induct all of Ford’s India based employees and vehicle plants located in Sanand and Chennai, subject to regulatory approvals.
The transaction is expected to be completed by mid-2020, after which the JV will become operational, according to a joint statement issued by the two companies.
The step highlights Ford’s prolonged battle to effectively compete with new and existing players in India. Despite entering the country more than two decades ago, Ford has struggled to challenge Japanese and South Korean automakers in India. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor India Ltd are the top two carmakers in the country. Ford’s native rival, General Motors, which too entered India about two decades ago, stopped selling vehicles here by 2017-end.
Ford’s move is aligned with its global strategy to mitigate risks by withdrawing from tough markets where it has failed to successfully grow profits over time. In June, Ford said it would restructure its European operations, shutting several production units and laying off about 12,000 people by 2020-end.
“We live in an increasingly complex world. The auto industry is disrupted by several incoming trends, new business models and customer buying patterns are ever changing. I don’t think any one company can address all those areas on its own. We aren’t rushing into partnerships. They have to be the right ones for us,"" said Bill Ford, executive chairman, Ford through video conferencing from Michigan.
The JV, Ardour Automotive Pvt. Ltd, was incorporated on 26 August as a wholly-owned unit of Ford. Prior to the investment in Ardour, M&M will buy the automotive business of Ford India Pvt. Ltd barring the engine plant in Sanand.
In a joint news conference in Mumbai, Ford and M&M said the JV will be operationally managed by M&M and that the board would comprise an equal number of nominees from both companies. The chairman would, however, be nominated by M&M.
While the JV will produce cars for Ford to be sold in the domestic as well as export markets under the Ford brand, existing dealers of Ford and M&M would continue to operate independently. Ford, however, said it would not look at a large expansion of its dealer network in India in the future.
Pawan Goenka, managing director, M&M said the sales and marketing teams of both the companies will remain independent.
Under the new JV, both companies would jointly work on common product platforms with a focus on utility vehicles (UVs), an area of strength for M&M, as well as cooperate on the development of electric vehicles, an area where Ford has access to advanced technologies. The JV expects to introduce three new UVs under the Ford brand starting with a new mid-sized sport-utility vehicle, which will share the vehicle platform and engine with M&M. Ford meanwhile would look to put a check on its costs by capitalizing on M&M’s wide network of local vendors, product development capabilities and economies of large-scale production.
Meanwhile, M&M said the JV with Ford will give it access to its global distribution network in emerging markets, thereby developing them to boost export business from India. “For M&M, export business accounts for about 7-8%,"" said Goenka.
“No matter how large a company is, everyone is looking at partnerships in the world for better future,"" said Anand Mahindra, chairman, Mahindra Group.
Jim Hackett, Ford president and CEO, said India will play a big role in providing computing, software and other key elements involved in technologies such as connectivity and urban mobility to Ford’s global product development.
“While Ford is looking to mitigate risks globally, the joint venture augurs well for M&M as the home-grown company gets access to Ford’s quality and design strengths to make headway into several global markets,"" said Gaurav Vangaal, country lead, LVP forecasting, IHS Markit. “However, in the future, once the Indian market will become stable on suitable powertrain technologies, we expect US-based carmakers such as GM and Ford will relook at India for growth. Expect this to happen in the long run."""
108,2019-10-02,Mahindra Mahindra,"Industry watchers reckon that Mahindra needs to get nimble-footed in product launchesFord has a capacity to roll out around four lakh vehicles from its Indian units

Large companies often take the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) route to expand capacity, garner resources and gain market share. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd’s JV with global auto giant Ford Motor Company underscores this strategy.
On the face of it, the deal looks like a win-win for both the auto firms. Mahindra’s initial investment of  ₹656 crore for a 51% equity stake in the JV, gives it access to Ford’s India production facilities at its Chennai and the Sanand plants.
Mahindra's investment is minuscule considering its annual profit of about  ₹4,800 crore and market capitalisation of about  ₹69,000 crore. Note that Ford has a capacity to roll out around four lakh vehicles from its Indian units.
“In a dynamic and challenging auto market, the joint venture combines the benefits of scale and sourcing. With competition rising from incumbents and new entrants, this is one way to bring down costs and offer new products to customers rapidly,"" says Jigar Shah, CEO, Maybank Kim Eng Securities Ltd.
That said, there are concerns about the success of this JV, despite their long association in India. This is because of several failed associations in the past M&M has had, especially with global auto firms.
Mahindra’s joint venture with French auto firm Renault, almost a decade ago, failed. The latter finally exited. Also, its Korean acquisition Ssangyong Motors continues to bleed (  ₹400 crore in Q1FY20) on the back of weak domestic and export markets. Even France’s Peugeot Motorcycles, in which Mahindra bought a majority stake in 2015, has been through rough terrain. The joint-venture is hopeful of EBITDA break-even by FY21E.
Although, these form a relatively small value of the consolidated business, they weigh on the stock price on the basis of sum-of-the-parts valuation. Also, it makes investors wary of the management’s utilisation of cash reserves. If this JV defies historic trends, it should support revenue and profit growth in the long term.
In the past year, M&M shares have underperformed the Nifty Auto index by a wide margin. While the auto index has fallen 23%, the company’s shares have fallen 34%.
The higher fall in M&M shares is attributed by analysts to weak sales even in the farm segment, which normally shores up profitability of the company.
As things stand, the domestic passenger vehicle market continues to be on a weak footing. Mahindra’s September auto sales continued to slide falling by 22% year-on-year, on the back of a 32% fall in August.
Industry watchers reckon that the JV should help Mahindra get nimble-footed and launch more products to take on competition from Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor India Ltd. Both Ford and Mahindra will tap emerging markets on the strength of their individual brands for now. Recall that Mahindra management has in the recent past voiced its intent to emerge stronger in exports too."

France’s GeoPost in Talks to Acquire up to 25% More in DTDC Express
French government-backed logistics firm GeoPost, which owns 42% of DTDC Express, plans to acquire a majority stake in the Indian courier service provider. It is in initial stages of discussions to buy another 20-25% stake in DTDC, valuing the company at  ₹3,000 crore ($450 million), The Economic Times reported cititwo people aware of the development. In 2013, GeoPost had bought 40% stake in DTDC from investor Reliance Equity Advisors, the private equity arm of Reliance Capital, for $25 million, and subsequently increased its shareholding in the Indian company. The parcel delivery network of GeoPost, DPDgroup, is the second largest in Europe with a revenue of €7.3 billion in 2018. ICICI Securities is advising the DTDC management on the sale process while GeoPost is being advised by BNP Paribas. However, it is not sure if a deal between DTDC and GeoPost will be materialised as the French major has differences over the expected valuation of DTDC. Parallelly, DTDC is also considering an option to launch an initial public offering."
106,2019-10-03,Mahindra Mahindra,"Yes Bank's management addressed investors and analysts over a conference call early on ThursdayThe Economic Offenders Wing of Mumbai Police has filed an FIR against the HDIL’s promoters

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that will likely be in focus on Thursday:
IndiGo: Promoter Rahul Bhatia on Tuesday submitted an arbitration request against co-founder Rakesh Gangwal before the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA). This follows chairman M. Damodaran clarifying in September that the two promoters have called truce over differences on corporate governance and related-party transactions.
Yes Bank: The management addressed investors and analysts over a conference call early on Thursday to allay concerns after shares of the lender tanked 22% on Tuesday following sale of 100 million shares, representing 3.92% of the bank’s equity capital. In a filing to the exchanges on Wednesday, the bank said a large stakeholder invoked shares pledged with it, following which the entire pledge stood extinguished.
DHFL: Shares of the troubled housing financier tanked 20% on Tuesday amid uncertainty over its debt resolution. The company submitted its debt-restructuring plan to lenders on Monday, following which speculation that non-bank companies such as mutual funds may face haircuts of more than 40% fuelled the negative sentiment.
Indiabulls Housing Finance: The company refuted charges of financial irregularities, siphoning of funds and regulatory violations by promoters of the company in a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Prashant Bhushan in the Delhi High Court. Indiabulls claimed that Bhushan, who represents an NGO, did not do basic research before approaching the court.
Mahindra & Mahindra: Major auto companies released their September sales numbers on Tuesday. M&M's auto sales were down 21% on year at 43,343 units in September, while its tractor sales fell 2 % on year to 37,011 units. Mahindra on Tuesday announced forming a joint venture with Ford to develop and distribute the latter’s vehicles in the domestic market.
Zee Entertainment: Shares of the company extended losses for the second day in a row on Tuesday, declining nearly 11%. The stock has been under pressure amid rising concerns over the company’s viability to meet financial obligations.
HDIL: The Economic Offenders Wing of Mumbai Police has filed an FIR against the company’s promoters--Sarang and Rakesh Wadhawan—who allegedly enabled funds diversion for Punjab and Maharashtra Bank. More than two-thirds of the bank’s total loan book has exposure to HDIL. The stock ended down 5% on Tuesday.
Reliance Power: Investors took positive signals from Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) chairman Anil Ambani, who assured that the group was committed to making Reliance Power a “Future Green"" company. Barring Reliance Power shares of all ADAG companies fell sharply on Tuesday due to concerns surrounding the viability of the group to continue operations.
RBL Bank: Shares of the private lender plunged more than 22% on Tuesday due to concern over its exposure to the troubled Indiabulls Housing Finance. Overall negative sentiment surrounding the banking sector also dragged down the stock. However, share prices recovered before market close.
Lakshmi Vilas Bank: Shares remain under pressure, having ended down 5% on Tuesday, after Reserve Bank of India (RBI) placed the bank under the prompt corrective action framework on Saturday. This has raised concerns over its proposed merger with Indiabulls Housing Finance not going through."
105,2019-10-04,Mahindra Mahindra,"Bank stocks came under pressure in the past 10 days owing to renewed concerns over asset qualityMarket cap of HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra now tops that of other 10 banks in Nifty Bank by 10%

Indian banks have faced rough weather in the past two weeks and investors are rediscovering stocks that act as lifeboats in choppy waters.
HDFC Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd have emerged as these lifeboats over the last 10 days. Ergo, while the Nifty Bank index lost over 6% since 23 September, these stocks have weathered the selling pressure.
As the adjoining chart shows, the market capitalization of the two private sector lenders now exceeds that of the other 10 banks in the Nifty banking sector index by about 10%. Just three months ago, the combined value of the two banks was about 10% lower than the other 10 lenders, which include State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank Ltd, Axis Bank Ltd and seven of the remaining largest lenders in the country.
So what transpired in the last 10 days to drive investors away from other banks and towards HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank?
The collapse of Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank Ltd, which had an absurdly high exposure to real estate developers, brought to the fore the vulnerabilities of Indian banks in general.
Investors realized that Indian banks have an uncomfortable exposure to non-banking financial companies (NBFC) that finance real estate developers (HFCs). “Negative news flow around HFCs/NBFCs and banks has overshadowed the recent tax cut tailwind, bringing focus back on sector issues: liquidity issues and contagion risks,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd wrote in a note.
The result was a massive fall in stock prices, and banks such as Yes Bank Ltd and RBL Bank Ltd saw their valuation erode sharply. According to Jefferies India, Yes Bank has an exposure of more than  ₹10,000 crore to troubled companies it terms as “high risk"".
Even the more stronger and larger balance sheets such as SBI and ICICI Bank weren’t spared by investors.
In addition to the resurgence of stress, concerns that the current slowdown would affect the loan growth of banks also weighed in. Analysts at Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said banks are not likely to grow their loans as most companies would use savings from tax cuts to boost profits.
Analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd wrote in note, “We expect overall system credit to see 10-12% growth, but near-term growth trajectory depends on pick-up in consumer sentiment in this festive season.""
Investors flocked to HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank as they showed a track record of pristine asset quality. Moreover, both lenders have negligible exposure to troubled NBFCs. Lower stressed assets would mean lower provisioning for the two lenders and, therefore, the banks would have more free capital to lend. Ergo, their loan growth is likely to be superior to others.
Even so, the consumption slowdown is likely to affect all lenders. Investors know this. While HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank may have been spared in the recent rout in bank shares, investors await the quarterly performance for clarity."
103,2019-10-06,Mahindra Mahindra,"Harsha Upadhyaya of Kotak Mahindra AMC said this is a good time for patient investors to build long-term equity portfolios since market valuations seem to have discounted most of the pain in the economy

Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO, equity, at Kotak Mahindra AMC, told Mint that maintaining investment discipline across market phases and focusing on long-term bets selected after rigorous fundamental analysis helped their equity funds book top spots in their categories. He said this is a good time for patient investors to build long-term equity portfolios since market valuations seem to have discounted most of the pain in the economy.
Many of the Kotak equity funds have been in the top and next quartile in their respective categories over longer tenors. If you did an attribution analysis what would be the biggest contributor to the returns?
Our investment approach is a blend of top-down and bottom-up investing. Both sector allocation and stock selection have contributed equally well for consistent long-term performance. Another key contributor to our performance over the years has been the fact that we hold on to winners for a longer time as compared to the ones which drag our performance. More importantly, we have stuck to investment discipline across market phases and have focussed on long-term bets based on rigorous fundamental analysis.
The Kotak Standard Multicap fund has traditionally had a large-cap focus. But in the recent past, you spoke about the emerging opportunities in the mid- and small-cap space. Will this fund see a shift in focus? Does the large size of the fund impact portfolio construction decisions?
Kotak Standard Multicap has always had a large-cap tilt. Historically, the large-cap allocation has remained 65-75% of its portfolio. Currently, it is towards the upper range. We find valuations in the mid- and small-cap space potentially more rewarding for long-term investors. In line with this, we have been looking to increase allocation to this basket gradually over time. The large-cap tilt and long-term investment style have helped in creating consistent outperformance over the benchmark, with relatively lower volatility. Portfolio churn has always been low. We do not bet on event or tactical plays. Portfolio construction discipline in terms of selection of stocks, sizing of bets, diversification etc. have remained intact despite the increase in portfolio size and change in market conditions. We believe that this disciplined approach will aid performance even going forward.
Which themes and sub-themes look interesting in the Indian markets at this point in time?
We continue to focus on investment-driven domestic economy recovery plays in our portfolios. Recent policy initiatives from the government also focus on investment-driven recovery rather than a consumption-oriented one. We like domestic cyclicals with high operating leverage. We remain overweight on capital goods and cement sectors. In the cement sector, we expect pricing scenario to turn favourable going forward, given continuing strong volume growth. The fortunes of the capital goods sector are also brightening up gradually. In addition, there is not much debt on the books of most capital goods and cement companies. The profitability improvement is going to be much stronger once demand picks up on a sustainable basis. We also expect government spending to continue in infrastructure creation and private capex to pick up gradually, given lower tax rates in future, which augurs well for these sectors.
What has the fund house’s experience been with SIPs? While the industry has seen steady SIP inflows through the difficult market, is the level of discontinued SIPs a matter of concern?
Our SIP book has also been growing in line with industry trends. The MF industry collected over  ₹8,200 crore in SIPs during August 2019. The net monthly SIP flows at the industry level have remained fairly steady despite some discontinuations. Data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India data shows that the MF industry added, on an average, close to 10 lakh SIP accounts each month in FY20.
Managing downside risk is seen as an important activity in an actively managed fund. How do you manage this in equity funds?
We like businesses that have proven business models, which are scalable in nature, where capital efficiency is high and that have reasonable competitive edge in their respective areas of business. We also keenly look at the management track record and its quality. The final filter is valuation in every case. Typically, we look for compounding characteristics of earnings growth at reasonable valuations, and build a portfolio around that strategy. We do not like sectors and stocks that require capital on a regular basis and those with a high degree of leverage. We also tend to avoid companies that have a high level of policy or regulatory risk. We avoid betting on event-based tactical plays. Our focus has always been long-term bets based on analysis. Following these principles over market cycles has enabled us tide over some challenging times.
Will measures such as rate cuts and corporate tax cuts translate into resumption of consumption and spending in the near future or is there some more pain left for the economy?
The decision to lower corporate taxes meaningfully is a key structural measure to support India’s growth outlook. One of the key objectives of the sharp cut in corporate tax rates is to make India globally competitive. This step significantly boosts medium-term investment potential in the economy. The focus of fiscal stimulus is capex-driven rather than consumption-driven and thus poses limited risks to macro stability. Similarly, the current monetary policy is also supportive. However, we believe consumption recovery is going to be more gradual in nature.
Do you see a contagion effect in equity markets of the debt issues troubling companies and causing distress in debt markets?
There has already been a contagion effect over the past year or so. Over the next few months, we expect things to gradually normalize as the focus has shifted to monetary transmission and making liquidity available to deserving and creditworthy businesses. While volatility in equities may continue for some more time, it is also a great time to build a portfolio from the long-term perspective. Broader market valuations seem to have discounted most of the pain already. For patient investors, it is a great time for stock picking.
Given the low inflation and low growth phase in Indian economy, is it time to reset return expectations for equity investors?
The cost of capital for businesses is coming down significantly. Apart from that, domestic inflation band has also got reset downwards. Given these conditions, even low double-digit equity returns over the long term should be viewed as great returns. However, equity returns can never be linear and, hence, during good times the returns could be larger and vice-versa."
104,2019-10-06,Mahindra Mahindra,"Consumers care about EVs, the excitement is there but that stops the moment we tell them the price, FADA vice president Vinkesh Gulati saidThere is a lack of charging infrastructure, a reluctance by banks to finance purchases and an unwillingness among govt departments to use EVs as directed

NEW DELHI :
Hyundai Motor Co. launched India’s first electric SUV this summer with a quirky TV commercial urging millennials to “Drive Into the Future."" A few months later, the automaker finds itself on a lonesome road.
In a nation of about 150 million drivers, only 130 Kona SUVs were sold to dealers through August. That slow pace is emblematic of the difficulties carmakers face in establishing an electric foothold in the fourth-biggest auto market, even with committed government support.
The Kona sells for about $35,000 while the average Indian earns about $2,000 a year — and the best-selling gas guzzler costs $4,000. Yet Kona’s sticker price only kicks off the conversation about why EVs aren’t gaining traction in India —there’s also a lack of charging infrastructure, a reluctance by banks to finance purchases and an unwillingness among government departments to use EVs as directed.
Barely more than 8,000 EVs were sold locally during the past six years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. China sells more than that in two days, according to BloombergNEF projections.
“The affordability of electric cars in India is just not there,"" said R.C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., maker of the sales leader Alto. “I don’t think the government or the car companies expect that in the next two to three years there will be any real buying of electric vehicles.""
The segment still isn’t making meaningful strides more than four years after the government started promoting cleaner vehicles for one of the world’s most-polluted countries. In February, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration committed to spending $1.4 billion on subsidies, infrastructure and publicity.
The potential of India’s EV market can’t be ignored. There are only 27 cars for every 1,000 Indians, compared with 570 for the same number of Germans, giving global automakers an opportunity to challenge the dominance of Maruti –- the unit of Japan’s Suzuki Motor Corp. that sells every other car on local roads.
Maruti’s not introducing its first EV until next year. Tata Motors Ltd. and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. build some base-level electric cars, yet they have a limited range or are exclusively for government use. The Kona gives Hyundai a first-mover advantage in a market where EVs may comprise 28% of new vehicle sales by 2040, according to BNEF.
Not only Hyundai sees opportunity in Asia’s third-largest economy. MG Motor, the iconic British carmaker owned by China’s SAIC Motor Corp., and Japan’s Nissan Motor Co. see EVs as a way to expand in the country.
“Somebody has to take the leadership, and it will trickle down,"" said Rajeev Chaba, managing director of MG Motor India, which plans to launch an electric SUV by December.
The process of scaling up will be slow, and MG Motors would be satisfied selling 100 cars a month initially.
“We have to start somewhere,"" Chaba said.
Right now, though, consumers pass over electric cars for bigger, longer-range and cheaper gas guzzlers, said Vinkesh Gulati, vice president of the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations, which represents more than 80% of automobile dealers in India.
More than half of the passenger vehicles sold in India last year cost $8,000 or less, according to BNEF. Electric cars won’t achieve price parity with gasoline-powered cars until the early 2030s, BNEF said.
“Consumers care about EVs, the excitement is there,"" Gulati said. “But that stops the moment we tell them the price.""
Yet even for those who can afford the Kona, plugging in is problematic. Nidhi Maheshwary, a 40-year-old finance professional working near New Delhi, wanted to buy an EV to show her children an example of environmental responsibility.
So when Hyundai launched the Kona, Maheshwary ordered one. Sounds easy, but it didn’t turn out that way.
Almost immediately, she got into a spat with neighbors about charging the SUV in her apartment building’s basement lot. The residents’ society said it posed a fire risk -– even though Hyundai engineers and the fire department said it was safe.
So Maheshwary charges the car at her office while weighing potential recourse against those neighbors. Hyundai offers two small chargers with the Kona, although it can take as many as 19 hours to fill up the vehicle.
India had an estimated 650 charging stations for cars and SUVs in 2018, according to BNEF. China, the largest market for EVs, has about 456,000 charging points, official data shows.
India’s sparse charging infrastructure stems from locals’ chicken-and-egg approach to the issue.
At a conference in New Delhi last month, government officials and EV-component makers debated whether to create adequate charging infrastructure to promote sales or whether to wait until there are enough EVs on the roads before building it out.
“We are pretty sure that people are going to like our EV, but we would have our challenges like infrastructure,"" Chaba said. “But we have our plans to handle that.""
Those include first requiring that the buyer can install a charger at home, he said.
But there’s another factor besides income that makes it difficult to pay for one of these cars. The unaffordability of EVs also stems from the unavailability of financing, said Pranavant P., a partner at Deloitte India focusing on the future of mobility.
Until there’s an established secondary market for EVs, banks and other institutions are hesitant to extend purchasing loans, he said. A majority of Indian vehicle sales are financed by lenders.
The government, both federal and local, will have to offer help for EVs to be adopted in the mass market, said Puneet Anand, group head of marketing at Hyundai Motor India. Modi’s budget in July included incentives such as reduced taxes, income tax benefits and import duty exemptions for certain EV parts.
The first beneficiaries will be the ubiquitous scooters and motorcycles -- with subsidies meaning to support sales of 1 million two-wheelers, compared with 55,000 electric cars.
Yet the government still needs to practice what it’s preaching. Energy Efficiency Services Ltd., a joint venture of state-run companies responsible for replacing state vehicles with EVs, awarded its first tender in September 2017 for 10,000 cars.
But as of July, agencies had accepted only 1,000 of them. Now EESL is offering the vehicles to taxi companies.
None of that helps Devdas Nair, a 34-year-old advertising professional in New Delhi looking for new wheels. He wants to try an EV and says he’d pay somewhat more to help the environment and for future savings. Yet for him right now, it’s too much of a gamble.
“I was excited about the Kona, but the price tag is just too much,"" he said. “We don’t even know how the charging infrastructure is going to be in India. That makes me rethink -- actually not think about it at all."

New Delhi: Reeling under a prolonged slowdown, Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) reduced its production by 17.48% in September, making it the eighth straight month when the country's largest car maker lowered its output.
The company produced a total of 1,32,199 units in September as against 1,60,219 units in the year-ago month, Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) said in a regulatory filing.
Passenger vehicles' production last month stood at 1,30,264 units as against 1,57,659 units in September 2018, a decline of 17.37%, it added.
Production of mini and compact segment cars, including Alto, New WagonR, Celerio, Ignis, Swift, Baleno and Dzire stood at 98,337 units as against 1,15,576 units in September last year, down 14.91%.
Similarly, production of utility vehicles such as Vitara Brezza, Ertiga and S-Cross declined 17.05% to 18,435 units as compared with 22,226 units a year ago.

100,2019-10-09,Mahindra Mahindra,"After a bumper rally triggered by corp tax cuts on 20 September, markets had turned volatile ahead of Q2 earningsThe Bankex rose 3.67%, with State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank rising 3-5%

Mumbai: Investors on Wednesday cheered the government’s decision to raise dearness allowance (DA) in the middle of the festival season, driving Indian markets up nearly 2% in a rally led by financial sector stocks.
The benchmark 30-share BSE Sensex closed 1.72% or 645.97 points higher at 38,177.95, while the 50-share Nifty closed at 11,313.30, up 186.90 points or 1.68%.
The five percentage point increase in DA to 17% will put more money in the hands of at least 5 million government employees and 6.5 million pensioners. The hike, which will cost the exchequer  ₹16,000 crore, will be effective from July.
Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities Ltd, attributed Wednesday’s rebound to bargain hunting as well, coming after six straight days of losses. “Sentiments also turned positive after the government hiked dearness allowance. Most emerging market stocks were headed lower for a third day on Wednesday as the US and China showed little signs of backing off from their trade dispute ahead of a crucial round of negotiations. However, later, European shares moved sharply higher and the Chinese currency in the offshore market jumped on Wednesday after a Bloomberg report said China was still open to agreeing a partial trade deal with the United States,"" he said.
The Bankex rose 3.67%, with State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank rising 3-5%.
According to Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services, banking stocks rallied on hopes of greater liquidity and consumption, as the plunge in bond yields indicates further room for rate cuts. “Further, the hike in DA will add impetus to festival demand. Going forward, the results season will dictate the market direction and investors are expecting some green shoots on account of festival demand and good monsoon,"" he said. The 10-year bond yield jumped 22 basis points to 6.45% on Wednesday.
After a bumper rally triggered by corporate tax cuts on 20 September, the markets had turned volatile ahead of second quarter earnings. Analysts said the tax cuts are a pro-investment stimulus, but will take time to show results, given the nature of the ongoing economic slowdown.
Rahul Singh, chief investment officer-equities at Tata Mutual Fund, said the 8-9% lift in Nifty earnings per share after the corporate tax cuts will provide support to stock valuations, in addition to the fact that India’s valuation premium to other emerging markets is at a more acceptable level now. “The recent privatization initiative indicates the government’s seriousness in tackling the economic slowdown and we believe that there is more to come in the coming weeks and months,"" he said.
Indian companies are set to report a drop in revenue and profit for the second straight quarter amid a slump in consumer demand that sent the government scrambling to boost investment and consumption through a raft of measures, including tax cuts for companies.
“It has been a year since the IL&FS crisis erupted and the repercussions of the same are still being felt, especially in financials. Besides NBFCs, banks too have started facing asset quality concerns now,"" Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a note.
The brokerage firm said the earnings season will be more of the same—tepid and uneventful. The underlying demand slowdown in the domestic economy and weak global commodities prices are expected to take a toll on earnings with very few bright spots, if any, it said."

99,2019-10-12,Mahindra Mahindra,"MG Motor India has delivered little more than 6,000 units since the Hector’s launch in the last week of JuneIt currently has more than 30,000 pending bookings for the Hector SUV

Grappling with challenges around its supply chain and production ramp up of its first car in the domestic market, the Hector, a sports utility vehicle (SUV), MG Motor India Pvt Ltd said that it is still evaluating the start of production of its BS VI compliant SUV.
Speaking to Mint on the sidelines of the opening of its first flagship showroom in South Mumbai on October 10, Gaurav Gupta, chief commercial officer, MG Motor India said, “We do have customer bookings to cater to and we are continuously reviewing our manufacturing plans. We are still evaluating the production schedules for BSVI compliant Hector as we are yet to take a decision on that.""
The company said for now it is working to streamline its supply chain to be able to start off the second shift at its Halol-based manufacturing unit from November. “The priority is to keep the increasing wait list for customers in check,"" said Gupta.
The SAIC Motor Corp Ltd-owned carmaker claims that its current order book has more than 30,000 pending bookings for the Hector SUV. It has delivered little more than 6,000 units since the Hector’s launch in the last week of June.
Gupta said the second shift would grow the carmaker’s monthly manufacturing capacity from 2,500 units to up to 3,500 units. Although MG Motor says that the average waiting period is 3-4 months, the company-claimed numbers suggest otherwise.
The carmaker, which claims to be working to localize the Hector up to 75%, has been struggling to procure critical components that are imported from its global suppliers. Although MG Motor remains tightlipped on the matter, sources have suggested that the suppliers could not ramp up parts supplies in tandem with the initial booking numbers conveyed by the carmaker, thereby leading to serious supply chain issues.
“We have been talking to the suppliers in the backend because they have to increase their supplies. Some of our suppliers are global as some of them are based in Europe. Even as they expand their operations, this has to be supported with hiring of new workforce on ground for training. Once we got that clarity and assurance that we will be able to expand on time, we reopened bookings again,"" clarified Gupta.
Meanwhile, several carmakers have started preparing for the production of BS VI compliant models. Maruti Suzuki is leading the pack with eight BS VI compliant models already retailing at its showrooms. Other carmakers including Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors have already drawn their respective production schedules for BS VI compliant cars and SUVs.
Gaurav Vangaal, country lead, light vehicle production forecasting, IHS Markit said, “MG Motor India should launch the BS VI compliant Hector by February next year as they are in the best position right now with ample bookings at hand and good demand for the Hector SUV. Most carmakers are moving to BS VI from Dec-Jan period and some of them have already moved lion’s share of their portfolio to BS VI. MG Motor will have to start rolling out BS VI models not later than February.""
MG Motor India also plans to unveil its first electric car eZS in India in December later this year and start retails from January 2020. The MG eZS, a compact SUV, will be imported via completely knocked down (CKD) route and will be assembled at its Halol plant."

The Sensex ended 93 points higher to 38,598 as the benchmark index posted its longest winning streak in more than three months. The broader Nifty settled at 11,471, up 0.38%. Shares of Wipro rose 2% after the IT major reported a better-than-expected September-quarter earnings, driven by higher margins. 
Shares of Bajaj Consumer Care surged 20% to  ₹234 after the personal care firm's promoter group, on Tuesday, sold about 22% stake for around  ₹630 crore in a single block deal. 
IT, pharma and energy stocks led gains today. Bajaj Finance advanced 4% while ONGC and Yes Bank rose around 3% each. HDFC Bank, HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra and TCS advanced between 1% and 2%
Sahaj Agarwal, head of derivatives at Kotak Securities, said that Nifty has support at 11050. ""On the higher side we expect the index to conquer 11700 in the near term. Private banking and IT are expected to outperform while selective buying is suggested in midcap stocks,"" he said. 
Ajit Mishra, vice president for research at Religare Broking, said: ""In a volatile trading session, the Indian markets swung both ways before ending the session with decent gains. The earnings season is likely to gain momentum as some of the front liners would be declaring their results in the next few days. We expect that investors and traders would focus more on the management outlook especially for consumption driven companies. Further, market participants would keep a close watch on trade talk developments between US and China, currency and crude oil price movement.""
The global backdrop for Indian markets remained positive. Asian shares  mostly ended higher today as investors looked to whether Britain can secure a deal to avoid a disorderly exit from the European Union.

96,2019-10-16,Mahindra Mahindra,"Contractors are key customers of heavy trucks (particularly tipper trucks) and construction equipmentHeavy commercial vehicles have declined by over 50% so far this fiscal

Mumbai: Mahindra & Mahindra’s (M&M) commercial vehicle subsidiary, Mahindra Truck and Bus Division, expects heavy commercial vehicles (HCVs) to register around 30% year-on-year decline in sales during FY2020 on increased load capacity from new axle load norms, low freight volumes and overall slowdown in economic activities.
Vinod K Sahay, chief executive officer, Mahindra Truck and Bus Division (MTB), talking to reporters on 14 October, had said, “The HCV industry has declined by over 50% so far this fiscal. I think this industry will end this year at not less than 30-35% YoY. There is no way that the industry can come back to normal this year.""
Earlier, Satyakam Arya, managing director and chief executive officer at Daimler India Commercial Vehicle Pvt Ltd (DICV) had told Mint that he expects the medium and heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) segment to register a YoY decline of 25-30% this fiscal and 10-15% decline in FY2021 on introduction of BSVI emission norms. “MHCVs will return to growth only in 2021 and not before that,"" he had told this publication recently.
However, Sahay anticipates that the market for heavy trucks has bottomed out and will begin to recover in another two to three quarters.
“Many large contractors were in a very bad shape because their outstanding (payment) had gone beyond 120 days and they were staring at a severe working capital crisis. So now for sure the release of payments has started. However, the pace (of release of payments) is slow this year. So this phase has to be cleared first and the impact on demand for HCVs will follow,"" he said.
“HCV industry is not driven on consumer sentiments. Right now, we are not seeing orders.""
Sahay was referring to the contractors engaged with the government’s infrastructure projects such as construction of roads, bridges, ports and others. Contractors are key customers of heavy trucks (particularly tipper trucks) and construction equipment.
Talking about large fleet operators, who carry freight cross-country, Sahay said that the extent of pre-buying of BSIV trucks would be much lower than what was anticipated earlier. “Large fleet operators with 200-300 trucks may look at pre-buying a few units to replace their ageing vehicles. That said, the sentiment for pre-buy of BSIV trucks is not big anymore,"" he apprised.
“Commercial vehicle demand will revive only when the economy revives,"" he said.
The company said it plans to commence retail sales of BSVI compliant trucks only from April next year."

MUMBAI :
Blackstone Group and Indian developer K Raheja Group have selected more banks for an initial public offering of their joint commercial property portfolio, according to people familiar with the matter.
Citigroup Inc., Kotak Mahindra Capital Co. and Axis Capital Ltd. were picked to join Morgan Stanley to arrange the listing of the assets as real estate investment trust in Mumbai, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private.
While the private equity firm and K Raheja are still working on the property composition for the REIT, they aim to finish the share sale by as soon as March, the people said.
A successful debut would mark India’s second REIT after the listing of Embassy Office Parks REIT in April. The country’s cash-starved developers have been seeking ways to monetize their assets as the industry is struggling with sluggish sales and price declines that followed a 2016 crackdown on cash and a lingering crisis in shadow lenders.
A media report last month said Morgan Stanley was roped in for the planned REIT listing, while more banks will be hired soon.
Deliberations are ongoing and more banks can be added to the lineup, the people said. Details of the offering could also be changed, they said. Representatives for Blackstone, Citi and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while representatives for Axis Capital, Kotak Mahindra and K Raheja Group didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment."
94,2019-10-18,Mahindra Mahindra,"Bombay High Court has granted four weeks time for the parties to file repliesThe court also allowed Edelweiss AMC's prayer to disclose all assets and liabilities of the non-bank lender

Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Asset Management and Axis Asset Management on Thursday moved the Bombay High Court seeking a direction to the crippled mortgage lender DHFL to disclose all its assets and liabilities.
The petitioners also prayed for a temporary restraint on DHFL to prevent it from making further payments/disbursements to secured and unsecured creditors, except certain payments made on pro-rata basis to secured creditors.
The court has granted four weeks time for the parties to file replies.
Earlier this month, the court had restrained DHFL from making further payments/disbursements to any unsecured creditors until further orders.
The court granted a plea of Reliance Nippon Asset Management (recently renamed Nippon India Mutual Fund) to restrain lenders from disposing of any assets.
The court also allowed Edelweiss AMC's prayer to disclose all assets and liabilities of the non-bank lender.
A debt resolution plan, approved by the lenders led by Union Bank in August, is awaiting final approval as mutual funds (MF) are yet to sign the inter-creditor agreement.
The beleaguered home financier owes  ₹83,873 crore as of July 6, 2019 to banks, the National Housing Board, MFs and bondholders, including retail bondholders. And as of July 6, DHFL's secured debt was  ₹74,054 crore while the unsecured debt stood at  ₹9,818 crore.
The MFs have to sign the inter-creditor agreement (ICA) if the resolution plan were to get going as according to the Reserve Bank's June 7 NPA resolution framework, for a resolution plan to be passed, 75 per cent of lenders by value and 60 per cent by numbers must approve it and sign the ICA.
Under the draft resolution plan submitted by DHFL, the lenders would pick up 51 per cent in the third largest mortgage lender by converting a part of their debt into equity.
The company has been facing liquidity issues since last September and yet has paid back  ₹41,000 crore of its financial obligations through a combination of securitization of assets and repayment collections since.
The Wadhawan family, who owns a little over 39 per cent in the company, has been looking at various ways to come out of the stress which first came to light late last year following the IL&FS bankruptcy.
These include selling stakes in group entities, including in the flagship to the extent of giving up management control.

93,2019-10-20,Mahindra Mahindra,"As per SIAM data, in the Apr-Sept this fiscal, total domestic CV sales slumped by 22.95% to 3,75,480 units as against 4,87,319 units in the year-ago periodM&HCV segment declined by 35.79% in the same period at 1,22,521 units as compared to 1,90,801 units in the first half of last fiscal

New Delhi: The commercial vehicles industry is bearing the biggest brunt of the slowdown this fiscal but it is expected to grow next year despite increase in prices due to BS-VI emission norms implementation, according to a senior official of Mahindra & Mahindra.
The various stimulus steps taken by the government to spur the economy being ""bit of medium-term measures"", Mahindra & Mahindra CEO, Mahindra Truck and Bus Division Vinod Sahay said the impact will be felt on the ground in the next six to seven months, thereby helping to lift the commercial vehicles (CV) segment next fiscal.
""Overall, the CV industry is facing the biggest brunt of the (current) slowdown. It is not a surprise because we are the barometer of the economy. When the economy doesn't do well there is not way CV industry can do well,"" Sahay told PTI.
""This year is going to be in red and the question is how much in red and it will depend on stimulus for revival, which I don't see coming. Some pre-buying of BS-IV (vehicles) ahead of BS-VI implementation will happen but the industry will end in the red. There is no question of any growth,"" he added.
As per industry body SIAM data, in the April-September period this fiscal, total domestic CV sales slumped by 22.95% to 3,75,480 units as against 4,87,319 units in the year-ago period.
Medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCV) segment declined by 35.79% in the same period at 1,22,521 units as compared to 1,90,801 units in the first half of last fiscal.
When asked about the outlook for the next fiscal and if price hikes due to BS-VI implementation from April 1, 2020 will affect demand, Sahay said, ""Fundamentally, I don't think so."" Recollecting how the transition from BS-III to BS-IV panned out, he said there was heavy pre-buying but despite that there was growth in the first year of BS-IV rollout.
""So it is not necessary that the first year of BS-VI will have to be in red because of the price increase,"" he said.
As per industry estimates, BS-VI compliant commercial vehicles are likely to be costlier by at least 10% than the existing BS-IV models.
Sahay further said, ""The fundamental question here is how does the economy do? If the economy starts improving due to all the steps that the government has taken, which are a bit of medium-term measures, we believe that it will start playing in six-seven months time frame."" So next year if the economy starts reviving, specially if the domestic consumption starts improving, he said, ""We feel that once all that impact starts coming in and and if the economy comes back in shape CV will bounce back. Also because of the base effect of this year, which will be a heavy decline, my bet is that next year will be a good growth. It will not go down."" For the present, however, he said demand for CVs continues to be low. Also, the stimulus of additional depreciation of 15% announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in August, taking it to 30% on all vehicles till March 2020, ""doesn't help CV segment because people will buy CV only when there is business available,"" he added.
Commenting on the company's plans for BS-VI transition, Sahay said, ""We are almost ready for BS-VI like anyone else. We can't launch BS-VI as fuel is not available. We are getting our vehicles homologated. Some vehicles have already got homologated."" Around March next year is when the fuel will be available and Mahindra Truck and Bus Division will be introducing vehicles accordingly, he added.
""We will start production around December for some pilot vehicles. From March onwards we will start selling it to dealers. Once fuel is there we will start retailing from April 1 onwards,"" Sahay said.
In the first year of BS-VI implementation, the company will launch the full range of 22 variants of 'Furio' intermediate commercial vehicle, of which five will be upgrades of existing BS-IV version, he said.
Besides, Sahay said the full-fledged commercial launch of Cruzio range of buses will also happen after the BS-VI norms come into effect. Currently, the company is doing pilot level of sales to gauge customers in the BS-IV version.
Asked about the company's network expansion plans, he said, ""We have reached 430 touch points across the country now from 250 two years back. Largely we have covered tier I and II cities. The target is to reach 520 by mid of next financial year."""

MUMBAI :
The Indian markets may react to British Parliament's vote to delay a decision on Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal next week.
Besides, the way ahead will depend on the portfolio investments, which have been strong during the last 5 sessions.
On Thursday, the Sensex crossed the 39,000 mark with a 453 point gain after news of a Brexit deal between the UK and the EU. Tata Motors jumped 9.82% on the BSE.
""The Indian markets had rallied late last week on hopes of an early Brexit resolution. The latest development can reverse that optimism to some extent. However, doubts prevail about how smoothly the whole process will get completed,"" said Deepak Jasani of HDFC Securities.
""The negative impact of this development could be limited. But companies that were supposed to benefit the most from an early Brexit resolution and which had rallied sharply on Friday may see a larger negative impact,"" Jasani added.
Besides, the investors will await corporate results from Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Auto, HCL Technologies, Hero MotoCorp, Larsen & Toubro, ITC, Maruti Suzuki and State Bank of India.

91,2019-10-20,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra & Mahindra can tap into Ford’s developing global EV ecosystem for supply of critical componentsFirst product from the joint venture will be an electric sedan based on Ford’s Aspire platform

MUMBAI :
The recent partnership with Ford Motor Co. is likely to be a big shot in the arm for Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) in turning around its electric vehicle (EV) business, where M&M was one of the first movers in India and where it has pumped in several hundred crores.
The partnership with Ford is likely to boost Mumbai-based M&M’s chances of succeeding in the EV space, because of the Detroit-based automaker’s scale and access to critical EV supply chain, said industry experts and people aware of the plans.
“Under the strategic alliance with Ford, M&M will jointly develop vehicles including electric cars for India and other emerging markets. That gives the two companies scale on the vehicle side. M&M can also tap into Ford’s developing global EV ecosystem for supply of critical EV parts,"" said a person aware of the company’s plans on condition of anonymity. “M&M had to invest in producing key parts for EVs as suppliers in India have largely stayed away from investing in building EV parts. That explains M&M’s large-scale investments in electric mobility,"" he said.
This is expected to be a big boost for M&M, which has made investments of more than  ₹1,500 crore in electric mobility so far and has reported cumulative losses of  ₹740 crore as of 31 March 2019.
Data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) shows that Mahindra Electric Mobility, the group’s EV business, reported factory dispatches of 850 units, 646 units, and 350 units in FY2017, FY2018 and FY2019 respectively. Earlier this year, the company discontinued its four-door e2O plus electric car because of meagre sales and passenger vehicle safety norms. Besides manufacturing EVs such as the e-Verito and Treo, the company also makes critical EV components such as e-motors, transmissions, power electronics and others in-house.
With its electric four-wheeler efforts having little success, M&M has been focusing on building its presence in the electric three-wheeler segment through its Treo models. Siam data reports wholesale dispatches of 1,341 units of electric three-wheelers by Mahindra Electric in H1 FY20.
Ford, on its part, has chalked up ambitious plans on the electric vehicle front and plans to electrify more than 50% of its passenger vehicle sales by the end of 2022. In 2018, the US auto giant committed to invest around $11 billion in its EV push. Last week, it announced plans to set up the largest public EV charging network in the US.
“Expect M&M to learn from Ford via technology transfer. Meanwhile, Ford, which has not invested in establishing any capabilities around electric mobility in India, would be able to retail locally-made electric cars in the future,"" said a second person, also speaking on the condition of anonymity.
The two companies have already confirmed that the first product from the joint venture will be an electric sedan based on Ford’s Aspire platform, which will be sold in India and other emerging markets under M&M and Ford marquees.
“We feel that Mahindra has a very EV-centric approach and with the collaboration of Ford, they will build electric parts and export them to other parts of the world. They will also be able to take advantage of economies of scale as they may use the same parts in their vehicles also,"" said Puneet Gupta, director, automotive forecast, IHS Markit.
“The extent of alliance in EVs is still work in progress,"" said the M&M spokesperson. Meanwhile, an email sent to Ford Motor Company on Friday remained unanswered."
90,2019-10-21,Mahindra Mahindra,"Preference for Kona is despite its price being almost double that of Tata Motors’ Tigor and M&M’s Verito EVs'Kona’s battery size is almost three times that of Tigor and Verito; running cost is just 40 paisa/km,' says EESL MD Saurabh Kumar

New Delhi: The Union government has placed initial orders with Hyundai Motor Co. for the Kona electric compact sport-utility vehicle.
This comes as the government’s largest electric vehicle (EV) procurement programme, run by state-owned Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL), faces bottlenecks because of issues such as vehicle quality and a lack of demand, according to several government officials.
Power and new and renewable energy minister Raj Kumar Singh, and NTPC chairman and managing director Gurdeep Singh have started using the Kona, which went on sale in July. Top officials at policy think tank NITI Aayog too are keen to use the vehicle.
The preference for the Kona is despite the vehicle’s price tag of  ₹23.71 lakh post government subsidies, which is about double that of Tata Motors Ltd’s Tigor and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd’s e-Verito electric sedans.
The Kona can travel up to 452km on a single charge and has a 39.2 kilowatt hour (kWh) advanced lithium polymer battery. The Tigor and e-Verito have less than 20kWh batteries.
“Kona’s battery size is almost three times that of these other cars (Tigor and e-Verito). The running cost is just 40 paisa/km. It’s a brilliant car in terms of comfort and this is the beauty of EVs anyway,"" said EESL MD Saurabh Kumar.
Only 500 Tigors have been supplied by Tata Motors to EESL so far, while M&M has delivered 1,000 e-Veritos. This was in response to the two companies receiving orders from EESL in September 2017 for 10,000 cars. While 60% of the sedans were to be supplied by Tata Motors, the rest were to come from M&M.
EESL now plans to limit the final order to around 3,000 cars by March 2020 amid an economic slowdown.
Mint reported on 27 June, 2018 that senior government officials were refusing to use EVs made by M&M and Tata Motors, citing poor performance and low mileage.
The problems with the Tigor included issues related to AC cooling, pick-up, sudden battery discharge and inability to charge. These were resolved after a delay, according to EESL.
Miffed with the quality of Tigor cars, EESL in a 10 April 2018 note to the automaker reviewed by Mint said: “It has been observed that Tata Motors is not taking any sincere steps to resolve these issues, causing delay and leading to customer dissatisfaction.""
“The performance of Tata Motors is found to be below par and EESL will not accept delivery of any new vehicle till all the issues with the existing cars have been rectified,"" it said.
Tata Motors has denied that there are quality issues with the EVs. A company spokesperson said in an emailed response: “After getting the LoA (letter of award) from EESL, we have completed the phase 1 deliveries in line with the technical specifications of the tender.""
Queries emailed to spokespersons of EESL, M&M, power ministry and Hyundai Motor India Ltd remained unanswered till press time."

88,2019-10-22,Mahindra Mahindra,"Employees are actively adopting eco-friendly habits inside and outside their workplace, and companies are encouraging them with internal policies, workshops and rewards

It has been a year since Gurugram resident Rohit Dang decided to take the Metro instead of his car to reach office. When his company Stratbeans Consulting, a learning management solutions company, also based in Gurugram, introduced a policy to encourage public transport by offering reimbursements, Dang was unsure whether he would be able to give up the comfort of his own vehicle.
“Using the Metro meant I needed to plan my daily trips ahead to time, change my lifestyle and didn’t have the flexibility of taking a car,"" says Dang, who travels a lot being in the sales department. Within few months, he started living car-free. Office sessions on how to plant trees helped him become more environment-conscious, and he planted some in his locality. He now plans to plant 200 trees around his neighbourhood.
With increasing awareness about global warming and high pollution levels, more people are becoming aware of their responsibilities towards the environment. Companies, too, are realizing the need for a shift in attitude.
“Company policies influence employee behaviour. Leaders who work as advocates for clean energy influence their employees, and rewards, benefits and positive reinforcement in company policies is an effective way of moving employees towards climate action,"" says Jarnail Singh, director of non-profit The Climate Group India that works with business and government leaders to address climate change.
Plan in action
Data from last year in a report by CDP, a non-profit that engages with environmental issues worldwide, lists 24 Indian firms that have reported monetary incentives for reducing emissions, with nine of them using internal carbon price to drive employee behaviour change and energy efficiency. “An internal carbon price helps drive employee behaviour change because you assign a monetary value to the cost of carbon emissions and provide employees an incentive towards low-carbon transition,"" says Damandeep Singh, director, CDP India.
Singh cites examples of how Mahindra Group has adopted LED lights, energy-efficient fans and air-conditioners in their offices, and are running programmes for employees on how to reduce carbon footprint. Wipro supports use of electric vehicles among its employees by setting up charging infrastructure at its campuses.
Bringing change
At Stratbeans, where Dang works, strict policies are followed to protect the environment—use of paper is discouraged, reimbursements are given for use of public transport, employees can work from home for two work-days a month, and overall, the energy usage is controlled. “Employees spend a lot of their time in the office and the right policies, exposure through knowledge sessions, monetary rewards and token gift vouchers can influence their behaviour,"" says Shiv Kumar Nigam, human resources (HR) and administration head, Stratbeans. For the next year, Nigam plans to tie “social responsibility"" with appraisal cycles and hire a dedicated environmental manager to drive the agenda within the company.
Growing popularity of internal environmental policies also reflects in a survey released in September by Indeed, an employment search engine. It shows a rise in demand in India for jobs related to the environment management and specialists who have the ability to develop, implement and monitor strategies that promote environmental sustainability within a company.
When it comes to services companies, employee-facing initiatives are particularly important for businesses. “In these businesses, emissions from electricity use, business travel, employee commuting and waste generation are significant contributors to the company’s carbon footprint,"" says Ulka Kelkar, director, climate program at World Resources Institute India, Bengaluru. Infosys runs an in-house programme called “I, Citizen of Earth"", which encourages a culture of responsible citizenship among its employees.
According to Swiss Re, an insurance company that has offices in Mumbai and Bengaluru, commuting emissions account for almost a fifth of its carbon print. In the spring of 2019, the company conducted a global survey for its major locations to find alternatives to private cars for coming to work. At Bengaluru, their solution was carpooling through an internal app. In another move, the company offered subsidy on e-scooters and hybrid cars. Mumbai’s Arjun Kanduri, 42, who works at Swiss Re as a vice president (finance reinsurance) , bought an Ather electric scooter thanks to the policy for his daily commute. His family had reservations about its durability. “Getting family members and friends on-board of the decision is hard as it’s something outside the established norm,"" he says. A couple of months after trying the e-scooter and finding it more efficient, he tried to convince his colleagues to take up the subsidy and buy the electric scooter. He received a mixed response.
After a point, companies can only encourage climate action, it’s the people who have to change their everyday habits and act. “Not only companies but individuals as well need to move away from personal profit maximization mindset towards a more inclusive view that supports sustainable practices,"" insists Kanduri.
Riding together
“Like governments, companies need to seed the mindset that climate action is our collective responsibility, only then people are impelled into making environmentally-friendly habits,"" says Akhil Ghatiki, 25, a senior consultant at ThoughtWorks, a software consultancy. Ghatiki has been carpooling to work after his company started fuel reimbursement policy, under which 50% of the carpool cost will be paid by the company. ThoughtWorks does not have a regular travel reimbursement.
Reducing carbon footprint not only benefits the environment but also the bottom line because efficient practices reduce operating costs and help increase employee productivity, says Ritu Verma, senior vice president (HR), Brookfield Properties. “We have implemented share-transport services, green buildings, waste segregation, reduce paper usage and no plastic policies and hold regular sessions for awareness,"" she says.
Mukund Krishnan Kumar, 35, a general manager with the company, agrees. He has changed his lifestyle after a session on waste footprint. “I realized how much waste each one of us personally generate daily, its environmental cost and how I could reduce it just by consuming less, wasting less and recycling."" He became mindful not only of everyday waste, but also of purchasing things mindlessly, focusing on need-basis only.
One way to push climate action is by tying professional and personal sustainability goals with annual performance and appraisals. It can be quite motivating, says Kelkar, adding her institute has already added “sustainability competency"".

Net interest income for Q2FY20 increased to  ₹3,350 crore from  ₹2,676 crore in Q2 FY19, up by 25 per cent. Net interest margin, a key indicator of a bank's profitability, rose to 4.61% from 4.19% last year.
However, asset quality weakened in September quarter with gross non-performing assets (as a percentage of gross advances) rising 13 basis points sequentially to 2.32 per cent and net NPA climbing 12 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 0.85 per cent in Q2.

With this branch licence, Kotak can now accept offshore deposits from professional clients based outside the UAE; provide, arrange and advise on offshore credit and offer investment advisory services.
The private sector already has a representative office in Dubai through which it promotes products for non-resident Indians (NRI) both on the liabilities and asset front.

86,2019-10-23,Mahindra Mahindra,"In times of rising risk, beefing provisions is what Kotak Mahindra Bank has been doing in the past quartersWhat should worry investors is that special mention accounts, which are the first signs of stress, have risen for the third straight quarter

Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd’s blockbuster net profit growth of 51% not only beat Street estimates, but seems to have vindicated the near 6% rise in the company’s stock in the past month.
The fact that it came on the back of a 25% increase in core interest income and an expansion in net interest margin should also boost sentiments.
But beyond that, the private sector lender’s performance had little to offer. Its loan growth decelerated year-on-year to 15.3% for the September quarter, a steady fall for the third straight quarter. The strongest growth came from mortgages, while commercial vehicle loans disappointed. Even disbursal to small businesses didn’t perk up much.
What’s more is that Kotak Mahindra Bank saw its delinquencies increase. Optically, its bad loan ratios passed muster, even though they rose from the year-ago period. What should worry investors is that special mention accounts, which are the first signs of stress, have risen for the third straight quarter. These accounts stood at  ₹431 crore as of September end.
Of course, as a percentage of the total loan book, they are still a meagre 0.2%, a level most peer banks cannot boast about. Also, Kotak Mahindra Bank’s bad loan ratios are far superior to its peers.
The commentary from the management on asset quality didn’t offer much clarity. Dipak Gupta, joint managing director of the bank, said that in times of stress, the key is to get the pricing of the risk right. Further, the lender is willing to lend to good credit even in commercial real estate—a sector considered risky by banks and the banking regulator as well. In the September quarter, the exposure to commercial real estate comprised 2% of the bank’s loan book.
In times of rising risk, beefing provisions is what Kotak Mahindra Bank has been doing in the past quarters. The lender continued with the practice in the September quarter as well. But the provision coverage ratio fell from 67% in the June quarter to 64% in Q2 FY20. Clearly, provisioning was not enough in the wake of increase in bad loans.
Analysts say that deposit growth, too, had slowed in the September quarter. But the management has clarified that the bank wants to improve the granularity of deposits, and the increase in current account and savings account deposits should give some comfort.
The Kotak Mahindra Bank stock didn’t move much on Tuesday and trades at a multiple of five times its estimated book value for FY21, making it one of the most expensive private sector bank stocks."

MUMBAI :
Financier Shriram Capital Ltd plans to merge two of its listed units with itself to help investors Piramal Enterprises Ltd and TPG Capital to easily sell their stakes in Shriram Group companies.
The plan entails merging Shriram Transport Finance Co. Ltd and Shriram City Union Finance Ltd with parent Shriram Capital to create a simpler shareholding structure, three people familiar with the plan said.
“We are looking at a few options like merging both the entities to the parent company and thereby listing it. Also we are still looking at an individual investor who can pick up the entire stake of Piramal and TPG. However, this is going to take a few weeks,"" said R. Thyagarajan, founder of Shriram Group.
Kotak Mahindra Capital Co. Ltd has been hired to advise on the planned merger and shortlist buyers for Piramal and TPG’s stakes.
Emails sent to Shriram Capital and Kotak Mahindra Capital went unanswered.
On Friday, Ajay Piramal, chairman of Piramal Group, told Mint in an interview that the group’s planned exit from Shriram Capital was on track. “We are going through many different combinations, we have not yet decided. One thing is clear that we will exit. Which is the best way forward for Shriram, that we are discussing,"" Piramal said.
Piramal bought a 20% stake in Shriram Capital for  ₹2,014 crore in 2014. Piramal also holds 10% in Shriram City Union. Over the past few months, Piramal has been looking for a buyer for these stakes.
TPG Capital holds a 9.4% stake in Shriram Capital, while South Africa-based Sanlam Group owns 26% and Shriram Ownership Trust and Shriwell Trust hold 30.7% and 13.4%, respectively, according to a Crisil ratings report.
“The value of the stake in Shriram being planned to be sold by Piramal is quoted at  ₹4,500-5,000 crore for the prospective buyers, which in turn will value Shriram Capital at around  ₹25,000 crore,"" one of the people familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity.
If the deal goes through, the proceeds from the stake sale will be used by Piramal to infuse capital into its lending businesses, repay debts of Piramal Enterprises’ promoter entities and provide capital for organic growth.
Piramal had a 9.97% stake in Shriram Transport Finance, but in June sold this stake for  ₹2,300 crore to several institutional investors.
The proposed three-way merger will result in the automatic listing of Shriram Capital, as Shriram City Union and Shriram Transport are both listed entities.
“Private equity firms and foreign sovereign funds have shown a lot of interest to buy stakes in Shriram Group from Piramal and TPG,"" said the second person, declining to be named.
Shriram Capital’s businesses include commercial vehicle finance (Shriram Trasport Finance), consumer and enterprise finance (Shriram City Union Finance), retail stock broking (Shriram Insight Share Brokers Ltd), life insurance (Shriram Life Co. Ltd), general insurance (Shriram General Insurance), financial product distribution (Shriram Fortune Solutions Ltd) and wealth advisory (Shriram Wealth Advisors).
On 30 August, a Piramal Group spokesperson said that since January, Piramal has raised over  ₹23,000 crore in long-term funding through banks, financial institutions and external commercial borrowings. “Also, as previously stated, we intend to bring in further equity of  ₹8,000-10,000 crore into the financial services business, of which  ₹2,500 crore has already been allocated. All of this will be more than sufficient to not only address all repayments, but also to augment business growth in this financial year.""
On 8 August, The Economic Times reported that private equity funds Advent International, Blackstone Group, CVC Capital, Carlyle Group and Brookfield placed initial bids to buy around 30% in Shriram Capital as Piramal Enterprises and TPG Capital sought to exit.
Piramal Enterprises and TPG have been looking to exit Shriram Group for two years. Piramal had invested in Shriram Capital with the intent to merge Shriram Capital, the holding company of Shriram Group, with itself. But the merger failed due to the sheer difference in size. Although Piramal had begun taking control of Shriram Group soon after making the investments by replacing key managers across group firms, a merger would have resulted in a large stake dilution in the merged entity for Piramal Group, which was not acceptable.
Shriram Group also tried a merger between Shriram Capital and IDFC Bank Ltd in 2017. But the plan fell through as the two entities failed to agree on an acceptable swap ratio."
80,2019-10-31,Mahindra Mahindra,"Two firms plan to build a $14 mn production facility in Bengaluru through their JV, TEMICO InternationalTEMICO India was set up by Mitsui and TECO in April last year wherein the former holds 40% and the remaining 60% stake is with the latter

MUMBAI :
Mitsui & Company and its joint venture partner from Taiwan, TECO Electric & Machinery Co. Ltd. plan to manufacture motors for electric vehicles (EVs) from next year.
In a formal note today, Mitsui announced that the two companies, through their JV, which is christened as TEMICO India, plan to build a USD 14 million production facility in Bangalore. With an annual capacity to produce 110,000 electric motors, the said unit is expected to commence manufacturing operations by end of next year.
TEMICO India was set up by Mitsui and TECO in April last year wherein the former holds 40% and the remaining 60% stake is with the latter. The official note said that the said investment is being made by the JV to pursue development, manufacturing and sales of EV motors and powertrains for global markets.
People aware of the development told Mint that this can clearly be attributed to the Modi government’s policies to promote the local manufacturing and adoption of EVs in India. Earlier this year, the government allotted incentives of  ₹10,000 crore to fast-forward the localization of key EV parts under Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India, or FAME 2, scheme. Reduced tax rates on new manufacturing units, tax rebates on interest payments on loans for EVs and custom duty exemption on critical EV parts are among other key steps aimed at propelling EV localization in India.
While Japan’s Mitsui is a Tokyo-based global conglomerate with diversified interests including electric mobility and renewable energy, TECO is already known for manufacturing industrial motors and critical parts such as traction motors and controllers for electric vehicles.
Shinichiro Omachi, Managing Director, Mitsui & Co. India said, ""The (new) plant (in Bangalore) creates 200 jobs and will contribute to the growth of India's EV industry, local manufacturing and reducing air pollution. Sustainability and mobility are key growth areas for Mitsui and we are investing more in EV businesses.""
Earlier in July, Mitsui and Co. had invested  ₹100 crore in Delhi NCR-based Treasure Vase Ventures Pvt Ltd, the parent of SmartE, India’s largest electric mobility service provider in the latter’s series B funding. Mint reported that SmartE will use the funds to expand its fleet size (electric three-wheelers) by more than 10 times and add at least five new cities thus capitalizing on the first and last mile mobility requirements.
While early EV adoption in India is seen in the two- and three-wheeler segments, a Morgan Stanley research report quotes that 2020 is expected to become the inflection point for electric two-wheelers, which are estimated to cross cumulative sales of one million units by 2022. The report suggests share of electric two-wheelers to rise to 40% of total two-wheeler market in India by 2030, thereby pointing at the opportunity size of the emerging segment.
Meanwhile, the currently disorganized electric three-wheeler segment is already seeing participation from the organized players such as Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) and Kinetic Green Energy & Power Solutions Ltd. Major automakers such as Bajaj Auto Ltd and TVS Motor Company Ltd already have built electric three-wheeler prototypes and plan to launch these in near future."

There was caution in the market after data released Thursday showed that India’s infrastructure output shrank the most since 2005, highlighting the slowdown in the economy. Core infrastructure contracted 5.2% in September compared with a 4.3% growth in the year-ago period.
On Thursday, Indian equities hit at a record high following better-than-expected earnings by most companies. Fifteen of the 26 Nifty companies that have reported earnings so far this season have surpassed analyst estimates, two have matched, while eight have missed projections, according to Bloomberg data.
""We believe in-line September quarter earnings so far and positive outlook by key auto and banking players have lifted the investor sentiment. On the global front, US Fed rate cut of 25bps and better than expected US GDP numbers for the third quarter seem to have provided some relief to the investors’ concern regarding the economic slowdown. However, going forward consolidation cannot be ruled out given the near-peak level of the markets"", said Ajit Mishra, vice president Research at Religare Broking.

Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) has reported a year-on-year decline of 11% in its domestic wholesale volumes, which stood at 49,193 units for October 2019. The company’s total domestic wholesale volume, which comprises three categories namely passenger and commercial vehicles and three-wheelers, for the year-ago period was 55,350 units.
Its passenger vehicle (PV) wholesales, which include the dispatches from the company’s electric vehicle arm Mahindra Electric Mobility Ltd, stood at 18,460 units for the last month, down from 24,066 units recorded in October 2018. M&M’s PV portfolio includes utility vehicles, cars and vans.

Nevertheless, Veejay Ram Nakra, chief of sales and marketing, automotive division, M&M said that the retail volumes exceeded wholesale by almost 40% last month. “This robust retail performance was contributed by both passenger & commercial vehicles. Further, our billing numbers are in line with what we had planned for the month, since the objective was to significantly correct our channel inventory,"" he added.
Retails in October were highest ever for any month for M&M, said managing director, Pawan Goenka. “I hope the retail momentum in October is an indicator of sentiment turning positive and will continue in coming months,"" he tweeted.

Mumbai: Domestic wholesales at India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, rose 4.5% in October from the year earlier, the company said on Friday as it became the first automobile manufacturer in the country to report growth amid an economic downturn.
Maruti Suzuki’s despatches to dealers stood at 144,277 units in October compared to 138,100 units in the same month last year. Its despatches of passenger vehicles rose 2.3% to 139,121, growing for the first time since March. In September, the car maker had reported a 27% fall in despatches.
This is the first instance in FY20 where the carmaker has reported positive year-on-year (y-o-y) growth, partly triggered by a surge in festive demand and partly on account of a low base from last year.
It was the only carmaker to report wholesale growth on Friday, driven by increased despatches of its compact cars, utility vehicles and its light commercial vehicles, even as its entry-level, or the most affordable category, continued to report a y-o-y decline. Maruti Suzuki sells WagonR, Celerio, Swift, Swift Dzire, Baleno and Ignis models in its compact portfolio. Its UVs comprise Vitara Brezza, S-Cross, Ertiga and the recently launched XL6.
Maruti Suzuki has also supplied 2,727 units of its compact hatchback Baleno to Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd, which sells a rebadged version as Glanza.
“The retail sales were far better than the wholesales and the company delivered close to 48,000 cars on Dhanteras alone. This was the highest single-day deliveries in the past 3-4 years,"" Shashank Srivastava, head, sales and marketing, Maruti Suzuki, said in an interview.
Srivastava added that festive retail sales this year saw double-digit growth over last year. “The newly launched S-Presso model has now accumulated more than 20,000 bookings, averaging about 750-800 units per day,"" he added.
While Maruti Suzuki plans to roll back its discounting initiatives November onwards, Srivastava said certain promotional schemes will continue in order to attract customers to retail showrooms.
Monthly wholesale figures reported by other carmakers on Friday were more muted than Maruti Suzuki’s.
The country’s second-largest carmaker, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, reported total domestic passenger vehicle wholesales of 50,010 units, down 4% y-o-y.
Gaurav Vangaal, country lead, light vehicle production forecasting, IHS Markit, said: “Retail sales are directly linked with the festive demand even as wholesales continue to post y-o-y decline on inventory correction measures by the carmakers. The retail uptick is a clear result of pent up demand for cars as buyers were delaying their purchases on several factors.""
Vangaal suggested that Maruti Suzuki’s early move to cut production and correct its inventory across dealerships resulted in it registering positive wholesales for October.
Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) reported passenger vehicle wholesales of 18,460 units, down 23% y-o-y. However, Veejay Ram Nakra, chief of sales and marketing, automotive division, M&M, said retail volumes exceeded wholesales by almost 40% last month. “Our billing numbers are in line with what we had planned for the month, since the objective was to significantly correct our channel inventory,"" he added.

At 13,169 units, Tata Motors’ passenger vehicle wholesales were down 28% y-o-y. In a statement, Mayank Pareek, president, passenger vehicles business unit, said that retail sales were 36% more than wholesales, and the company has reduced its network stock by 38%.
“In October 2019, retail registration of passenger vehicles is estimated to have increased by 11-16% over a low base, as 24 Sept-8 Oct 2018 was Shradh and had resulted in lower sales last year,"" said Hetal Gandhi, director, Crisil Research."

In response, some users termed the use by wheelchairs by many Indians a ""scam"", others pointed out that the wheelchair assistance is a boon to the parents of children who are settled outside the country.
""Most of these are parents of folks settled in the west and many times are not well versed with navigating airports, their children hence ask for wheelchair assistance so that they don't miss connecting flights. It's opportunity for airlines to make money from what is complementary,"" said one user.
Suggestions on how the misuse of wheelchair assistance can be cut were the point of focus for some tweets.
""Most of the wheel chairs are just scam. They don't really need it but take it as it is free. US airports charge even for a trolley may be charging wheel chairs in India will bring their usage down,"" said one user.

74,2019-11-03,Mahindra Mahindra,"The company said it would take at least few more months to get clarity if the industry is finally on a revival pathThe company's inventory level is now down to 30 days

NEW DELHI :
The country's largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) remains 'cautiously optimistic' over sales prospect going ahead as many of the challenges that led to slowdown in the auto industry still exist, a senior company official has said.
The company, which posted a growth in domestic passenger vehicle sales after seven months in October, said it would take at least few more months to get clarity if the industry is finally on a revival path.
""We are cautiously optimistic. The reason why we are cautious is that we do not have a crystal ball. Many of the factors like high cost of acquisition, confusion related to BS-IV and BS-VI, issues related to finance norms and liquidity etc, continue to be there,"" MSI Executive Director (Marketing & Sales) Shashank Srivastava told PTI.
He was replying to a query whether October sales were an indication of revival of the industry which has been grappling with demand slowdown for almost a year now.
""We are optimistic a little bit because the stock levels are manageable as the dealers money is freed up due to good retail. We need to look at the situation for couple of months before we conclude the real direction of the industry,"" Srivastava said.
The company's inventory level is now down to 30 days which is a positive factor, he added.
MSI made most of the festive season and posted a growth of 4.5 per cent in its domestic wholesales at 1,44,277 units in October as against 1,38,100 units in the same period last year.
Other carmakers like Hyundai, Mahindra & Mahindra and Toyota also managed to perform better over last month.
Tata Motors and Honda Cars India also improved sales in October from preceding months. Passenger vehicle wholesales in India declined for the eleventh consecutive month in September.
The slump in sales has forced various companies to cut production and manpower. Elaborating on the factors impacting sales, Srivastava said high acquisition cost remained a challenge.
""Cost of cars going up due to mandatory emission and safety norms, increase in road tax of up to 7 per cent across nine states and upfront payment of three years third party insurance have all increased the on-road price of a car,"" he noted.
Besides, liquidity crunch has made it difficult for the dealers and customers to get financing for inventory as well as purchase, he added.
Further, confusion in the mind of the customers regarding the transition of vehicles from BS-IV to BS-VI technology, availability of BS-VI fuel and lack of clarity whether a BS-VI compliant vehicle can run on BS-IV fuel have also impacted sales, Srivastava said."

MUMBAI :
Consumer lending firm Bajaj Finance Ltd on Monday said that it will raise funds through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) at a floor price of  ₹4,019.78 per share.
Bajaj Finance did not disclose the size of the fundraise, but one person aware of the lender’s plans said it was looking to raise up to  ₹8,500 crore (about $1.2 billion).
“Our company intends to use the net proceeds of the issue to augment the long-term resources for meeting funding requirements for our company’s business activities and general corporate purposes and other purpose as per our company’s growth strategy and to meet the capital adequacy norms laid down by the Reserve Bank of India,"" Bajaj Finance said in a stock exchange filing.
On Monday, shares of Bajaj Finance closed at  ₹4,115.95, up 1.14% on the BSE.
Investment banks JM Financial, Axis Capital, Kotak Mahindra Capital, Morgan Stanley and Nomura are advising the company on the share sale.
QIP is a capital-raising tool, through which listed companies can sell shares, fully and partly convertible debentures, or any securities, other than warrants that are convertible into stocks, to a qualified institutional buyer.
Bajaj Finance had raised  ₹4,500 crore in 2017 through a QIP. So far this year, eight companies have raised  ₹22,312 crore through the QIP route, data from primary market tracker Prime Database shows.
Between July and September, Bajaj Finance’s net profit rose 63.11% to  ₹1,506.29 crore, compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. Its consolidated assets under management, as of September, grew 38% to  ₹1.35 trillion.
That was despite sluggish consumer demand in India, as rural household consumption slumped to a seven-year low in the September quarter, plagued by falling crop prices and declining income.
Besides, the country’s non-bank lenders have also faced a severe credit crisis owing to rising borrowing costs and weak investor confidence, following the collapse of infrastructure lending behemoth Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) in 2018.
Bajaj Finance’s gross non-performing loans (GNPL), including the IL&FS exposure, stood at 1.61% in July-September, reducing marginally from 1.49% in the corresponding quarter of 2018. Its net interest income rose 48% to  ₹3,999 crore during the period, while it booked 6.47 million new loans, compared to 5.6 million in July-September last year. The retail financier’s total customer franchise stood at 38.7 million as on 30 September, showing a year-on-year growth of 29%."

BORN’s services include consulting, content creation, maintenance and hosting services, digital and social marketing, among others. It has clients such as Google, Tata, Red Bull and TAG Heuer.
BORN has offices in New York City, London, Hong Kong, Singapore and India and employs over 1,100 people.

69,2019-11-05,Mahindra Mahindra,"Tech Mahindra’s profit margins expanded after falling for two consecutive quartersThe company saw record order inflows, and revenues expanded at a better than expected pace

Unlike other information technology companies which are facing a slowdown in growth, the concerns for Tech Mahindra Ltd are largely to do with its profitability.
Robust order inflows notwithstanding, the company’s operating earnings dropped for two consecutive quarters till June this year, leading to cuts in earnings estimates. Profitability was impacted by transition costs pertaining to large projects and investments in human resources.
The September quarter earnings issued after market hours on Tuesday will address some of those concerns. Operating margin improved sequentially, helped by a recovery in revenue and better economies of scale. Consequently, operating earnings grew 13.7% from the June quarter.
The performance will please investors. The 3.2% sequential revenue growth and 1.3 percentage points expansion in operating profit margin to 12.8% is higher than Street estimates, implying traction in project execution. Revenue growth was driven by the enterprise business segment. Utilization levels perked up even as attrition remained elevated.
Deal wins were strong, with the company receiving orders worth $1.49 billion. This comes on the back of strong deal flows in the previous four quarters. In an earnings call, the management said it has a “high degree"" of confidence on the project pipeline. Combine this with low exposure to financial services sector, which is seeing softness, analysts are fairly confident about revenue growth prospects. “We are confident of revenue growth acceleration in FY2021E for Tech Mahindra, even as it is too early to comment on others,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a 3 November note.
The commentary is impressive vis-à-vis the growth concerns aired by other IT majors. But as Tech Mahindra executes the recently won contracts, high transition costs may hit profits in the near term. “We see the impact (transition costs) over the next two quarters,"" the management said in conference call. So, even as the company expects to deliver better revenues in the second half of the current fiscal, expectations on operating earnings are muted. Improvement in last quarter notwithstanding, earnings before interest and tax (ebit) in dollar terms is down 10.6% in the first half of the current fiscal on a year-on-year basis. The management is non-committal if this will reverse in the second half of the fiscal. But it is confident profitability next fiscal (FY21) will improve to FY19 levels. This is in line with Street expectations and should hold the stock in good stead, whose valuations are at a discount to larger peers.
The stock began outperforming NSE IT index from its June quarter earnings announcement. The quantum of outperformance will be determined by the pace of improvement in profitability and net earnings in the coming quarters."

64,2019-11-06,Mahindra Mahindra,"The joint venture will set up the first vehicle dismantling unit in Noida with a capacity to handle 2000 vehicles per monthIt will subsequently have similar scrapyards in different parts of the country

Suzuki Motor Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. will start a vehicle dismantling and recycling joint venture in India as the Japanese automakers expand their alliance in the country.
The joint venture, Maruti Suzuki Toyotsu India Pvt. Ltd (MSTI), will be owned equally by Suzuki’s unit Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Toyota Tsusho India Ltd, a subsidiary of Toyota. It will build its first vehicle dismantling unit in Noida with a capacity to handle 2,000 vehicles per month. Similar facilities will also be opened in other parts of India.
The partnership will allow Suzuki and Toyota to promote recycling and support resource optimisation and conservation, while using environment-friendly systems and processes, said Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director of Maruti Suzuki, India’s largest carmaker by sales. “Scrapping of older vehicles in a scientific and environment-friendly manner will help reduce pollution and also make roads safer. A team of experts at MSTI will dismantle the vehicles using international technology and global standards,"" he said.
The announcement comes at a time when the roads ministry is working on a policy for vehicle scrapping to reduce the number of old vehicles on roads to curb vehicular pollution in major cities. Mumbai-based Mahindra and Mahindra was the first to set up a vehicle recycling unit in India.
MSTI will be responsible for procuring and dismantling end-of-life vehicles (ELV). The process will include complete solid and liquid waste management in accordance with Indian laws and globally approved quality and environment standards, the companies said. They did not disclose the investments that would be made in the venture.
With the Union government working on the vehicle scrappage policy, most of the automakers are expected to set up their respective scrapyards hoping to tap an additional source of revenue in the future. The auto industry has been lobbying with the government for a scrappage policy for the past few years as it is expected to generate more demand for vehicles at a time when growth in vehicle sales are expected to stay modest because of the emergence of shared mobility and new regulations that make vehicles more expensive.
“Toyota Tsusho has started ELV recycling in the 1970s in Japan. We believe that we will be able to contribute to the Indian society through our knowledge and experience of the ELV business. The first vehicle dismantling and recycling unit of MSTI is just the initial step and we are eager to expand to a pan-India base with Maruti Suzuki,"" said Naoji Saito, chief executive, metal division, Toyota Tsusho.
Toyota and Suzuki first announced their partnership in 2017 with the aim of developing affordable electric and hybrid vehicles for the Indian market. They decided to set up a lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant in Gujarat in collaboration with Toshiba Corp., for hybrid and electric vehicles. The companies subsequently expanded their collaboration to vehicle cross-badging, supply of powertrains, joint development of vehicles, and exports.
In August this year, the companies deepened their ties by buying small stakes in each other. Apart from manufacturing electric and hybrid models, Suzuki and Toyota now plan to jointly develop autonomous driving technology.
The two are also expected to venture into the affordable electric vehicle space in India in the next few years.
“We will introduce a compact battery electric vehicle but I can’t divulge anything more right now,"" Shigeki Terashi, executive vice-president and member of the board at Toyota, said ahead of the Tokyo Motor Show."

MUMBAI :
Banker Uday Kotak on Friday pitched for rules to enable exits and consolidation in the financial sector.
Kotak, the head of the private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank, said non-disruptive creative destruction is essential for the financial sector to help in winding up of businesses.
The comments come at a time when the companies in the sector like DHFL are grappling with resolutions and the future of thousands of crore of debt is in doubt. It also comes at a time when cooperative lender PMC Bank is in troubles allegedly because of mismanagement, putting depositors in a difficulty.
According to reports, the government is mulling a re- introduction of the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, which may address such issues.
We are at this point of time at a critical juncture to put down the rules of the game on how we will manage exit in a non-disruptive way in the financial sector. This is crucial for our future, Kotak said, addressing a CII event.
The policy framework needs to have clarity on how we will handle mortality, how we will handle consolidation. We need good rules of the game for entry, but we need good rules for the exit as well, he added.
Kotak said there is a greater need for non-disruptive exits in the financial sector, underlining that the leverage is much higher in such companies as compared to the ones in the real sector.
He urged policy makers to take a holistic approach for the development of the financial sector and embrace the free- market model.
Adopting the free market model may lead to some friction because it may be at loggerheads with the objectives of the nation-state, he conceded.
He, however, advocated to persist with the same free- market model, pointing that it may look as if there are mad animals in the jungle, but those are essential.

59,2019-11-08,Mahindra Mahindra,"The Mumbai-based company witnessed 20.6% decline in sales of automobiles to 119,570 units The revenue during the quarter slipped by 14.5% to  ₹10,935.1 crore

Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) – one of the largest vehicle manufacturers in the country – reported a 24% year on year decline in net profit to  ₹1,354.8 crore, for the quarter ending 30 September, on the back of significant decline in sales of passenger vehicles and tractors, due to prevailing slowdown in the economy. In the corresponding quarter, the company reported a net profit of  ₹1,778.75 crore.
The bottom line though could beat the Bloomberg estimate of  ₹1,292 crore, as result of the lower taxes paid due to the reduction in corporate tax announced by the union government. The Mumbai-based company witnessed 20.6% decline in sales of automobiles to 119,570 units and the sales in the tractor or farm equipment segment fell by 8% to 71,820 units.
Consequently, the revenue during the quarter slipped by 14.5% to  ₹10,935.1 crore as compared to  ₹12,790.2 crore in the corresponding period. Revenue generated from the automobile segment declined significantly by 18.4%, while the same in the tractor business declined by 9.8%, during the period.
During the period, the operating profit or the Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA), declined by 16.7% to  ₹1,540.8 crore, compared to  ₹1,849.3 crore, in the corresponding fiscal and the operating margins contracted by 40 basis points to 14.1%.
Sales of passenger vehicles have remained subdued across the country over the last one year due to changing regulations, overall slowdown in the economy and stringent credit norms introduced by the banks to tackle the menace of rising bad loans. Most passenger vehicle manufacturers including M&M had to reduce wholesales of vehicles to reduce inventory at respective dealerships.
According to Pawan Goenka, managing director, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, sales of tractors have been better than previous quarter, while sales of automobiles declined more in second quarter compared to the preceding quarter. This is for the first time when the industry witnessed decline in sales during two consecutive quarters.
“October was a very good month, however, one need to see if that was a green shoot or reality and that is not well defined. Good thing is that the commodity prices have remained benign. Both in auto and tractor Mahindra has done better than the industry and our market share went up,"" added Goenka.
In the last three months Mahindra and Mahindra has gained market share on the back of its new compact sport utility vehicle, XUV 300.
“Looking ahead, we expect M&M to face tough business situation in near term on account of turbulence in BS-VI transition, competitive environment in domestic SUV space and slow down in tractor industry. We believe that new products would help arresting declining market share and maintain profitability,"" said analysts of Reliance Securities."

Auto major Mahindra and Mahindra’s (M&M) September quarter results weren’t too bad keeping in mind the current slump in demand,
Volumes declined in both the automotive and farm equipment (tractor) segments, but the latter did little better than expectations. The 8% y-o-y decline in tractor volumes is better-than-estimates, analysts said. Sales in the automotive segment fell 21% year-on-year.
Poor volumes took a toll on M&M’s top-line and bottom-line in the September quarter. Net profit after tax was down 24% y-o-y to  ₹1,355 crore and revenues dropped nearly 15% y-o-y to  ₹10,935 crore.
Although M&M’s operating margin fell 40 basis points y-o-y to 14% the contraction was contained by tractor business, said Bharat Gianani, analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. Margin of M&M’s automotive segment slipped to a multi-quarter low in September while tractor margin is maintained. Gianani further added that automotive segment margins dropped sharply due to negative operating leverage and higher discounts.
In a post earnings press conference, M&M’s management said it witnessed market share gains in all sub-segments during the quarter. But in a de-growing industry, increased market share wouldn’t translate into higher volumes. In terms of volume contraction, the second quarter was worse than the first quarter for the automotive industry.
The results didn’t quite impress the Street. M&M shares were flat in Friday’s trading session at  ₹580 on the NSE.
In this calendar year so far, the M&M stock has lost nearly 28%. And its fall much sharper than that of the Nifty Auto index that fell nearly 12% in the same span. Clearly, shares of the company have lot of ground to cover.
The sector as a whole has been a laggard mainly impacted by the board-based consumption slowdown. While one is hopeful that government measures would reverse this slowdown, analysts caution that transition to BS-VI is the next speed bump for the sector."

Indian equity markets on Monday traded mixed, tracking fall in global equities. Investors were cautious due to fresh doubts over the US-China trade deal and ahead of key domestic macro-economic data. The government will release index of industrial production, or IIP, data for September later today.
At 12:00 pm, the benchmark BSE Sensex fell 0.33% to 40,190.59 points, the Nifty 50 index slipped 0.34% to 11,867.40 points.
Asian markets were trading in the red tracking the fall in the US equities after President Donald Trump said on Friday the US government has not agreed with China to roll back all tariffs.
On the domestic front, investors await key macro-economic data. The government will issue IIP data for September after 5 pm today. According to a Bloomberg survey, India’s IIP is expected to contract 2.5% from contraction of 1.1% in August.
The government will also issue India’s headline inflation rate based on consumer price index (CPI) and wholesale price index (WPI) for October on 13 November and 14 November, respectively. According to a Bloomberg survey, CPI will be at 4.34% from 3.99% a month ago, and WPI is expected to be at (-) 0.22% from 0.33% last month.
""Uncertainties over the formation of government in Maharashtra have also spoiled the sentiment in the second half of the trading session. Except for Nifty Reality Index, other sectors failed to hold at higher levels and came under hefty profit-taking pressure from the market participants. The excitement from Q2 performances of Nifty 50 companies is fading away and this would trigger further selling in the near term,"" said Shrikant Chouhan, senior vice-president, equity technical research, Kotak Securities.
Among the gainers, state-owned NTPC Ltd rose 2.3% after the company on Saturday posted a 38% rise in its consolidated net profit to  ₹3,408.92 crore in the quarter to September, driven by higher revenues. Yes Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd also rose 2.5% and 1%, respectively.
Among laggards, Vedanta Ltd fell 1.6% followed by Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, which were down 1.5% each.
Bank of Baroda rose 3% after the company reported a five-fold jump in its net profit to  ₹736.68 crore in the second quarter-ended September.
""We usually see stock reacting sharply lower during the corrective phase of the benchmark index. Thus, we advise booking some profit off the table and focusing more on stock selection. Also, we suggest keeping a close eye on the global developments and earnings announcements for further cues. Since the broader indices are still underperforming, we advise preferring index majors over the others"", said Ajit Mishra, vice president, research, Religare Broking Ltd.
The sentiment in markets was also dented after Moody's Investors Service early on Friday lowered India’s outlook to negative from stable, while retaining the issuer rating at Baa2.
""In our view, this will take time to work on the ground and reflect in numbers. One of the major concerns is on the fiscal front - with lower tax incomes and higher spending - leading to a ballooning deficit. However, it appears that the government would be using the non-traditional routes including disinvestment/privatisation to fill the income gap.

BENGALURU :
IT spending in India is pegged to grow 6.6% to reach $94 billion in 2020 from $88.5 billion in 2019, primarily led by growth in consumer devices, according to the latest forecast by research firm Gartner.
Software and IT services is expected to lead the IT spend growing at 15.2% and 13.4% respectively in 2020, followed by devices (6.3%), data centre systems (2.5%), and communications services (2%).
The uptick in IT spending is expected to aid large IT companies like Accenture, IBM, and HPE. Even Indian IT services companies like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd, Wipro Ltd, and Tech Mahindra Ltd which have a relatively strong domestic focus, are expected to benefit.
For TCS, India accounted for 5.7% of its overall revenue for the second quarter ended September. While Wipro and Tech Mahindra doesn’t share revenue specifically from India, the rest of the world (excluding North America and Europe) contributed 16.9% and 24.9% to their topline in the September quarter.
“2020 will be a rebound year for India’s IT spending as consumers return to purchasing mobile phones after sitting on the sidelines in 2019,"" said John-David Lovelock, research vice president at Gartner. “Additionally, business spending on IT grew 6% in 2019 and is expected to increase 9% in 2020, helping to drive growth across all segments.""
Strong growth in total software spending will be driven by enterprise application software which is forecast to grow 17% in 2020. The expected increase in overall business spending will help drive 16% growth in enterprise mobile phone spending in 2020, pushing growth in the devices segment to 6.3%.
Arup Roy, research vice president at Gartner said that corporate spending in software and services saw an uptick as the Indian government introduced corporate tax cuts, along with policies that were aimed at reviving the economy and bolstering consumer spending in mid-2019.
“In the next two to three years, IT spending will increase as the economy benefits from the goods and service tax (GST) implemented by the Indian government in 2018, and as policies supporting consumer spending come into practice,"" said Roy.
Among technologies, automation-enabled areas such as robotic process automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and chatbots are seeing huge uptick, Roy said. “Cloud still remains quite strong, along with data and analytics."""

Among other gainers, SBI rose 5.5%, Kotak Bank 1.7% while Sun Pharma rose 1.5%.
Telecom stocks rose today amid hopes that the government would step in to help the ailing sector. On a conference call with analysts, Vodafone Idea Ltd Chief Executive Officer Ravinder Takkar said he saw no conflict in the government's ability to provide relief to telecoms companies, sending shares up 26%.
Vodafone Idea on Thursday reported the biggest quarterly loss in India's corporate history after making provisions for outstanding government dues.

53,2019-11-15,Mahindra Mahindra,"The Jawa Perak is powered by a 334cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled, 30 bhp engineThe company has notably revised the existing 293cc, single-cylinder, 27bhp engine that powers the Jawa and the Forty Two models

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M)-backed Classic Legends Pvt Ltd has launched it's third motorcycle, the Perak with a price tag of  ₹1.94 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi) on Friday in Mumbai.
Positioned as an urban cruiser, the Jawa Perak is powered by a 334cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled, 30 bhp engine, which the company said is compliant with the incoming Bharat Stage VI emission norms.
The company has notably revised the existing 293cc, single-cylinder, 27bhp engine that powers the Jawa and the Forty Two models to offer better performance on the new Perak model.
Ashish Singh Joshi, chief executive officer, Classic Legends said that this is done to lend a distinct identity to the Perak, which comes with a single seat as standard option.
The new Perak model, also the longest in terms of wheelbase when compared to the other two models - the Jawa and the Forty Two, will offer double-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS) as the key safety feature. Joshi said that the Perak is intentionally given a long wheelbase with a redesigned swingarm to offer better straight line stability and handling to the riders.
However, Joshi also said that the new model, which is production-ready, would be available only once the BSVI grade petrol is made available.
""Factory dispatches of the Perak to the dealerships will happen in a phased manner. The model will be dispatched to all existing dealerships by mid-December,"" said Anupam Thareja, founder, Classic Legends.
Jawa bikes are currently sold through a network of 110 dealers across 85 cities. The company is already known for struggling with ramping up the production of Jawa bikes as new bookings continued to add on to the long waiting list.
When launched last year in November, Jawa bikes were sold out for about 9 months. The brand continues to have a waiting list of more than 6 months, the company officials said.
""More than 500 dealer principals are willing to put their money. But we are not going for that. We are taking time to ensure parts availability, integration with design, setting up our network, systems and processes properly,"" argued Thareja defending his position.
Nevertheless, the scaling up of production can be done quickly going forward, said Thareja.
The company management refused to share numbers from it's existing order book, monthly production capacity and it's new model roadmap for the near future.
The senior executives reiterated their focus on the need to revive the brand while remaining prudent with the demand-supply requirements. In an attempt to achieve that, the company said that it has revived about 10,000 units of old Jawa bikes lying unused with existing owners across India making available the required spare parts and servicing.
The revival of Jawa motorcycles is also seen in line with surging demand for midsize bikes, a segment where Royal Enfield commands a market share of 97%."

50,2019-11-19,Mahindra Mahindra,"Difference between profit before tax and profit after tax is exaggerated on deferred tax paymentsLacklustre revenue growth reveals lower demand both at biz and consumer levels

Earnings for the latest quarter have ushered mixed news for the corporate sector. While the recent cut in corporate tax rates led to better-than-expected profit and restrained the pace of earnings downgrades, businesses continued to reel under pressure in the three months ended September.
Lower commodity prices and cost cutting initiatives by companies aided in aggregate net profit growth, but lower revenue in the second quarter underscored continued sluggish demand.
A Mint analysis of 1,462 firms showed net sales in the September quarter was the lowest in at least 27 quarters. Net sales decelerated 2.23% year-on-year, much lower than the 5.15% growth in the preceding three months, according to data provider Capitaline. This compares to net sales growth of 21.61% in Q2 FY19. In Q2, profit before tax (PBT) was also lowest in three quarters, with companies surveyed reporting a fall of 7.92% y-o-y compared with a 1.58% drop in Q1 FY20.
In the second quarter of FY19, profit before tax had grown by 16.92%. As reduction in corporate tax rate cuts resulted in several adjustments in last quarter’s tax numbers, we have assumed PBT for our assessment.
Including telecom firms Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, PBT of these companies fell 62% (y-o-y) in Q2FY20, while it had reported growth of 10.79% in Q2FY19. The two telcos incurred a record  ₹50,922 crore loss and  ₹23,045 crore loss, respectively, in the September quarter.
The difference between PBT and profit after tax (PAT) is exaggerated due to the deferred tax adjustments for the quarter. Tax reversals pertaining to higher taxes paid in Q1FY20 has also inflated Q2FY20 net profit. Adjusted net profit of these companies rose 8.76% y-o-y in Q2 compared with growth of 0.87% in Q1 FY20. The review excludes banks, financial services and oil and gas companies, which follow a different revenue model.
“The quarterly results show resilient double-digit growth in aggregate net profit aided by the recent corporate tax cut, lower commodity prices and cost-cutting initiatives. However, lacklustre revenue growth reveals lower demand both at the business and consumer levels. Destocking across the board also contributed to sluggish topline growth. Lower commodity prices resulted in lower topline growth for a whole host of firms , including metals,"" said Deepak Jasani, head, retail research, HDFC Securities Ltd.
Prices of commodities, such as crude oil and metals, underwent a steep correction in the September quarter. Crude prices were down 8.67%, aluminium 4.40% and copper 4.79% lower on the London Metal Exchange in Q2.
Jasani said while some companies gained from providing lower amounts towards tax, some others had to write off the accumulated deferred tax asset to opt for the lower tax regime resulting in higher effective tax provision. He expected the effective tax rate to have fallen on an overall basis and which could decline further in the next fiscal.
Data showed that taxes paid by these companies fell 57% in Q2 to the lowest in at least 27 quarters. In the same quarter last fiscal, tax outgo was 32.84% higher.
Shibani Kurian, head, equity research, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management, said there was no major disappointment in Q2 earnings overall.
“Earnings were mostly in line with expectations. Management commentaries indicate that they are not confident of the continuation of the minor revival growth seen due to festival demand,"" she said. “Number of companies saw good net profit growth due to cut in corporate taxes leading to no further earnings downgrade, which was earlier expected. Companies were able to maintain margins due to low commodity prices, but we will watch how it pans out going forward."""

At a time when housing sales across the major markets saw a drop in the September quarter, listed players have posted increased sales numbers as per report published by Anarock Property Consultants
Nine listed players --Mahindra, Brigade, DLF, Godrej, Oberoi, Kolte Patil, Sobha, Prestige, Purvankara - registered an increase of 9% in sales during July-September quarter as compared to the previous quarter, as per the Anarock. These developers sold around 7.25 million sq ft in September quarter compared to 6.64 million sq ft in the April to June quarter.
Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock Property Consultants said the listed players are benefitting from the consolidation happening in the industry.
“There is massive consolidation happening, with smaller companies selling their projects and land banks to the better-capitalized strong companies. These developers have vastly superior execution capabilities and capitalization, and enjoy much higher credibility with both buyers and lending institutions,"" Puri said.
“We are clearly seeing the emergence of strong, organized developers whose strengths are amplified, rather than diminished, by the newly regulated market environment. Even the most conservative industry estimates indicate a staggering number of developers in the top cities who have been either wiped off the map, or have merged with organized developers after DeMo and RERA,"" he added.

Pankaj Kapoor, managing director, Liases Foras, said “ The ongoing NBFC crisis along with the economic slowdown woes have impacted the sales during the quarter. People are holding back their decision due to weak sentiments regarding job security. People are refraining from getting into a long-term commitment. September quarter also had Pitru Puksha a time during which people don’t prefer making big purchases such as houses.""
Prices also came under pressure as per the report from Liases Foras. “Weighted average price across 35 cities exhibited a marginal drop of a percent as compared to the previous quarter. Prices dropped in 14 cities while increased in only nine cities. Among tier 1 cities, Hyderabad is the only city to show a significant increase in the price of 5%,"" said the report."

The share sale, which is a combination of a fresh issue and offer for sale (OFS), will see Puranik raise  ₹810 crore in fresh capital, of which  ₹700 crore will be used to prepay or repay outstanding debt, and the rest for general corporate purposes. Puranik had a total debt of  ₹1,291 crore as on 30 September, according to the draft prospectus. Its promoters, comprising Puranik Business Private Trust, Puranik Family Private Trust, Ravindra Puranik and Gopal Puranik, will offload 1.86 million shares via the OFS route. “The secondary component of the offer will be about  ₹90 crore,"" the person cited above said. Puranik had filed for an IPO in June last year and had received approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on 5 October 2018. But, the Sebi approval expired as the company postponed its IPO plan. The investment bank arms of Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd and Axis Capital Ltd are advising Puranik on the IPO.
Global PE firms in race to buy Eureka Forbes
Global PE majors Blackstone, KKR, Apax and TPG Capital have joined Advent and Temasek-backed Crompton Greaves Consumer in the race to acquire a controlling stake in Eureka Forbes, the country’s largest maker of water purifiers and vacuum cleaners, The Economic Times reported citing people aware of the development. Preliminary discussions are currently on between the potential suitors and the Shapoorji Pallonji Group for a possible transaction, which may be around sale of control or an outright takeover. What has compounded the urgency for a stake sale is the liquidity troubles of the SP Group and the latter’s need to pay off the debt raised from listed arm Sterling & Wilson. On Tuesday, Forbes & Company — SP Group’s listed unit — informed exchanges that it planned to unlock the value of its 100% holding in Eureka Forbes through an initial public offering, stake dilution/ sale or a combination of the three. It told the exchanges that the company’s board had empowered the management to evaluate “appropriate mechanisms"" for an eventual listing of Eureka Forbes. But an IPO appears difficult in the current environment, especially after the controversy over SP Group’s delay in repaying debt raised from Sterling & Wilson, the conglomerate’s listed solar EPC unit. The Pallonji family — which bought the business from the Tatas almost two decades ago — estimates the value of Eureka Forbes at  ₹5,000-6,000 crore. The final contours of a deal are expected to evolve as the process gains momentum. Standard Chartered Bank and Nomura are believed to be getting ready to launch a formal sale process. Feelers have also gone out to Hindustan Unilever, which has a competing water purifier brand (Pureit), ITC and a few other consumer appliances and water and beverage companies.
Nazara plans 20 startup bets in 2020
Nazara Technologies is planning to invest $20 million in gaming companies in the next year, The Economic Times reported citing its chief executive Manish Agarwal. It plans to shortlist 20 technology-based gaming companies in which it will acquire strategic stake. These companies will primarily be based in India. Gaming has been in focus of late, especially after Mumbai-based fantasy gaming startup Dream11 became a unicorn (achieved a valuation of $1 billion) after it raised a $100 million round led by Steadview Capital. Before that, Bengaluru-based Mobile Premier League (MPL) raised $35.5 million from Sequoia Capital, GoVentures and Times Internet. Nazara has placed its investment strategy into three baskets, with the stage that companies are in driving capital infusion. “Those with an interesting but unproven idea, we will invest  ₹1-2 crore and that will be risk capital,"" said Agarwal. For companies that are in need of growth capital, Nazara will invest about $1 million.
Versace, Cavalli seek new partners in India; Longchamp shuts shop
Trouble looms over the luxury retail sector as consolidations are forcing brands to seek out new partners or close shop here. Iconic luxury brands Versace and Roberto Cavalli are on the lookout for a new partner in India and French bridge-to-luxury brand Longchamp has shut shop, The Economic Times reported. Those in the know also said both luxury brands Versace and Cavalli, which are run by pan masala barons of the Chaurasia Group that owns Infinite Luxury Brands are looking for a new partner. They have one store each in Delhi’s DLF Emporio Mall. Delhi-based Bequest Group that runs Berluti, Tod's and Saint Laurent is said to be in the running for partnership with Cavalli. Longchamp had four outlets which have all wound up. It had originally announced six stores in India under a master franchise agreement with DOIT Retail in 2016. TM Lewin which had two stores, is also in the process of shutting down. The company that runs Longchamp has also decided to shelve plans to bring Alexander McQueen to India this year. McQueen was to have a mono-brand store in DLF's Chanakya Mall in Delhi for which letters of intent had been signed. High operating costs and soaring rentals are the bane of luxury retailers who have also noticed a 20-25% reduction in footfalls."

Mumbai: World Bank Group’s International Finance Corp. (IFC) on Monday said it was leading a $200-million debt financing in Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Ltd as part of its plan to create a dedicated pool of financing for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in low-income states.
The development-focused investor has earmarked at least $100 million for women-owned MSMEs, Mahindra Finance said in a stock exchange filing. The $100 million for women entrepreneurs will be supported through blended finance from the IFC-Goldman Sachs’ Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility, the statement added.
IFC is investing $75 million from its own account and mobilizing another $125 million as parallel loans.
“To expand financial services for MSMEs, IFC has been systematically supporting India’s NBFC sector,"" said Hemalata Mahalingam, manager of financial institutions group, South Asia at IFC.
“Although, the financing needs of rural and women-owned enterprises are not radically different, the level of financial exclusion is higher. The dedicated gender line and focus on unreached segments will contribute to addressing these gaps and demonstrate the commercial viability of investing in women and low-income groups,"" she added.
Mahindra Finance has further committed $225 million to this MSME pool, the statement said.
“Mahindra Finance has been powering inclusive growth in rural communities for over 25 years. Our experience in these markets reveals that to achieve true financial inclusion, access to formal credit for financially under-served segments is a necessity. Availability of credit for income generation, especially to women and low-income households, will further accelerate financial inclusion,"" said Ramesh Iyer, vice chairman and managing director, Mahindra Finance.
This is not the first time that IFC has invested in Mahindra Finance.
In July 2018, IFC had pumped in $100 million in the company to boost growth by extending loans to individuals, including farmers, to buy tractors, vehicles and other equipment, along with financing SMEs.
Mahindra Finance is a non-banking financial company focused on the rural and semi-urban sectors, offering vehicle loans and agricultural equipment financing through its physical network of over 1,300 branches, as well as digitally, and via rural distribution initiatives such as “loan melas"". So far, it has lent to more than 6.4 million customers across over 370,000 villages in India, with $10 billion of assets under management.
It plans to use the fresh funding to further enhance credit in rural and semi-urban regions, with customized solutions for women borrowers in low-income states.
The news comes amid IFC’s push towards supporting women leading businesses in low-income and rural areas. As of last year, IFC had provided 386,000 SME loans worth $11.2 billion to women-owned enterprises across the world.
IFC has emerged as one of the significant providers of debt capital for NBFCs at a time when the sector is struggling with a liquidity crunch.
In May, IFC led a $222 million debt investment round in Chennai-based Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company Ltd, which mainly provides commercial vehicle financing and loans against property. In the same month, gold loan NBFC Manappuram Finance Ltd said IFC planned to invest $35 million in the company to help low-income households and small enterprises avail of loans against their gold assets. In July, PNB Housing Finance Ltd raised $100 million from IFC to expand its affordable housing loan portfolio."

Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) on Tuesday launched its first Bharat Stage VI compliant passenger car, the XUV300.
The Mahindra XUV300 will come with an upgraded BS VI-compliant 1.2 liter turbo petrol engine, priced at a premium of  ₹20,000 over its BS IV-compliant base variant. The company said the BS VI-compliant car will have a starting price of  ₹8.30 lakhs (for base W4 variant) compared with  ₹8.10 lakh for the BS IV variant (base W4 model).
The new emission norm-compliant XUV300 can cost as much as  ₹11.99 lakhs for its top-end W8 dual tone variant, the company said in a statement today.
Meanwhile, XUV300’s diesel variants will continue to sell in its old avatar as the company plans to roll out BS VI-compliant diesel variants closer to the availability of the BSVI grade fuel across India. The stringent emission norms will be effective 1 April, 2020, for all vehicle categories ranging from two-wheelers to heavy commercial trucks.
“We will progressively upgrade our entire range with cleaner emissions technology,"" said Rajan Wadhera, president automotive sector, M&M.
The XUV300 is a sub-4 meter compact sports utility vehicle (SUV) launched by M&M in February 2019. The model puts M&M in direct competition with Maruti Suzuki’s Vitara Brezza, Tata Motors’ Nexon and Ford’s EcoSport compact SUVs.
Analysts estimate that the company has sold about 40,000 units of the XUV300 since its launch in February, thus averaging around 4,000 units per month. “The XUV300 has been garnering decent monthly volumes for M&M despite the ongoing demand slowdown this year. While the BSVI-compliant diesel XUV300 will come later, the focus currently is to liquidate the inventory of diesel variants,"" said an analyst, requesting anonymity.
Gaurav Vangaal, country lead, light vehicle forecasting, IHS Markit said, “It will be interesting to see how M&M would price the BSVI diesel variant of the XUV300 going ahead as several Indian vehicle manufacturers had earlier cited substantial pricing difference between the BSVI petrol and diesel variants of the same model. However, Kia, with its aggressive pricing of petrol and diesel Seltos SUV, negated this notion."""
35,2019-12-04,Mahindra Mahindra,"Mahindra, the biggest electric car seller in the country, terms its eVerito as India's first electric sedanMahindra Electric was the first to bring in lithium-ion powered auto with the launch of Treo

LAS VEGAS :
With India planning to replace a significant portion of its conventional internal combustion engine fleet by electric vehicles (EV) in the next decade and target 30 per cent of all cars on the road to be EVs by 2030, the segment leader Mahindra Electric is witnessing a robust uptick for its vehicles not just in metro cities but also tier-1 and tier-2 cities, its CEO Mahesh Babu told IANS on Wednesday.
Mahindra, the biggest electric car seller in the country, terms its eVerito ""India's first electric sedan"".
Its electric 3-wheeler range Treo and Treo Yaari -- India's first lithium-ion electric 3-wheelers -- is also witnessing a great adoption.
As the company sees the future of the mobility as both electric and digital, the daunting task of handling data and maintaining an agile, scalable and secure workflow -- anticipating millions of connected electric vehicles soon on the Indian roads -- is what concerns Mahindra Electric the most.
Amazon's Cloud arm Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is organising its annual flagship conference ""AWS re: Invent"" here this week, fits the bill for them.
""Electric vehicles are bringing in best of the technologies together. The rapid progress demands us to be agile, secured and quick. AWS has empowered us better with handling data,"" Babu said.
""We are using load balancers and services that can auto scale as the load increases. Agility comes from their serverless architecture that helps us to innovate faster. AWS Managed Services are compliant and have built-in security measures that include security updates and patching, etc,"" he elaborated.
Driven by an urge to cut pollution in the cities, enhance national fuel security and make it a major global manufacturing hub for electric vehicles, India has announced several incentives this year to boost the EV sector, ranging from tax cut to allow sale of electricity as ""service"" for charging of electric vehicles in a bid to attract investments into charging infrastructure.
The government has introduced an outlay of  ₹10,000 crore for Phase 2 of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME 2) scheme to boost electric mobility.
According to Babu, With FAME 2 and other benefits, they have seen an uptake in the sales of electric three-wheelers and electric cars in the fleet segment.
""We expect the demand to come from the mass mobility segment first (3-wheelers, 2-wheelers, buses and fleet cars) followed by personal segment. Mahindra's electric vehicles are witnessing demand not only in metro cities but also tier-1 and tier-2 cities have shown strong acceptance to our electric three-wheeler Treo,"" Babu told IANS.
Close on the heels of the Union Budget providing tax relief for buying EVs, the GST Council in its 36th meeting in July cut the tax on EVs from 12 per cent to 5 per cent. The Council also slashed rate for EV chargers from 18 per cent to 5 per cent making electric vehicles affordable for the buyers.
Road transport accounts for around 90 per cent of the total emissions in the transport sector in India. Given the large import dependence of the country for petroleum products, it is imperative that there should be a shift of focus to alternative fuels to support our mobility in a sustainable manner, according to the Economic Survey 2018-19.
The lithium-ion powered three-wheelers are set to be a natural progression for the industry and Mahindra Electric is looking to ramp up its efforts in the li-ion battery space.
""Mahindra Electric was the first to bring in lithium-ion powered auto with the launch of Treo. We have an experience of our 170 million electric kilometres in this technology in India that has helped us to understand the economics around EVs,"" informed Babu.
In 2018, the company announced collaboration with LG Chem to bring in global Li-ion technology to India.
""The company is further investing in a new EV manufacturing plant in Chakan (Pune) and a global R&D centre in Bengaluru that will enable us to achieve scalability and agility to roll out new products quickly,"" the Mahindra Electric CEO added.
Mahindra Electric, he said, is now better equipped and flexible to quickly scale up its EV and connected mobility goals.

Saab AB wants control of local manufacturing in India if it beats the likes of Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. in the race for the world’s biggest warplane contract.
The Swedish manufacturer is in the running to supply 114 Gripen fighters in a deal valued at more than $15 billion as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to modernize armed forces reliant on mostly Soviet-era equipment in the face of threats from China and Pakistan. At the same time, Saab faces a requirement that at least 85% of the planes be built locally in partnership with Indian firms.
“If a company needs to take responsibility for quality, time, cost and capability that’s required by the Indian customer, I want to have some sort of control of that,"" Saab Chief Executive Officer Micael Johansson said in an interview in New Delhi. It’s also important that Saab be able to export India-built Gripens to fulfill global demand, he said.
Saab has teamed up with Indian billionaire Gautam Adani on its bid, while Boeing has pitched its F/A-18 in partnership with state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. and MahindraDefence Systems Ltd. Lockheed has offered the F-21, specifically designed for the Indian bid and a close relation of the F-16, with conglomerate Tata Group, while the Eurofighter Typhoon and France’s Dassault Aviation SA Rafale are also in the mix.
“We just need to find a mechanism and the sort of balance between investing and having some sort of control, and not to be liable for things that we cannot control in the Indian market,"" said Johansson, who was took over as CEO in October and was in India as part of a Swedish royal delegation.
India allows up to 49% of foreign direct investment in defense, though it could be possible to hold more with government approval and if the venture provides “access to modern technology."" The final details of the latest bid documents haven’t been published.
“Normally we would say if we have a majority in a company, we have some sort of a reasonable control,"" Johansson said. “I don’t have a number between 51 and 100 today.""
Saab, which sealed a deal for 36 Gripen jets from Brazil in 2013, is in the running for 64 fighters from Finland, as well as a Canadian tender for 88 jets, where Eurofighter and Dassault have pulled out. It’s also looking at Croatia’s reopened pitch to replace outdated Mikoyan MiG-21s, and an order in Colombia. The company’s shares rose 1.4% Wednesday and are little changed this year.
Under the Indian tender, the winner needs to deliver the first jet within three years of securing the contract. The country scrapped a long-awaited order with Dassault for 126 Rafales worth $11 billion in 2015, but has since bought 36 of the planes to speed replacement of older aircraft.
Saab is looking at Indian partners in addition to Adani as it prepares to fight for the deal, Johansson said in the interview Tuesday. Tieups will be looked at on all levels, from the main company making the jets to suppliers, but Saab wants to control the entire system, he said.

33,2019-12-05,Mahindra Mahindra,"The actual price increase in the price of the vehicles on the ground is usually quite negligible, said a Maruti Suzuki dealerCompetitors like Hyundai Motor India, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and others are also likely to follow suit

India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki announced this week that it would increase prices of its vehicles in January, a practice that has almost become ritualistic for other car manufacturers as well. But analysts and industry watchers say that the annual exercise is a tactic aimed at enticing customers to buy before the year-end and clear piled up inventories before the start of the next year, when the value would typically suffer from a sharp depreciation.
The actual price increase in the price of the vehicles on the ground is usually quite negligible, a leading Maruti Suzuki dealer said.
“Next year prices will increase anyway if companies will launch vehicles complying with the BS 6 norm then there will be some increase. Otherwise, for Maruti the increase will not be substantial considering the market situation,"" added the dealer mentioned above.
Maruti has not disclosed from which date prices will increase for its offerings next year.
“Over the past year, the cost of company's vehicles has been impacted adversely due to increase in various input costs. Hence, it has become imperative for the company to pass on some impact of the above additional cost to customers through a price increase across various models in January 2020. This price increase shall vary for different models,"" Maruti said in a press statement.
Competitors like Hyundai Motor India, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and others are also likely to follow suit.
Over the years, this practice has led consumers to believe that December is the best month for buying vehicles because of wide-ranging discounts offered to customers, not to mention price increases touted for January.
According to Mitul Shah, analyst, Reliance Securities, December is usually a good month for retail sales and this year manufacturers will increase their offers to reduce inventory..
Amid slowing sales, this year automobile manufacturers almost went overboard in offering discounts to attract customers during the festive season that started from September-october. Maruti Suzuki offered almost  ₹1 lakh discount on their diesel vehicles like Vitara Brezza to get rid of the BS 4 vehicle inventory.
“In the early 2000s, companies used to take the same strategy before the budget and now it is in December. The price hikes in January are usually negligible unless someone is graduating to BS6 which is not a factor in Maruti’s case,"" added a former Maruti executive. “Hence, they didn’t mention the date of implementation and the quantum of discounts. It’s a ploy to attract as many customers as possible during the month,"" added a former executive of the company."

Bank of America Corp. and Kotak Mahindra Capital Co. are among banks Indian billionaire Radhakishan Damani picked for another planned stake sale in Avenue Supermarts Ltd., owner of the DMart brand, said people with knowledge of the matter.
Damani selected the banks as he prepares to pare his stake in India’s largest listed retail chain by selling about 5.2% next year, the people said, asking not to be identified as the discussions are private. Damani, who sold about 1% earlier this year, has to sell more shares before the end of March to meet a minimum requirement for public float, one of the people said.
A 5.2% stake in Avenue Supermarts would be valued at around  ₹5,870 crore, based on the closing price in Mumbai on Friday. The founders hold about 80.2% of Avenue Supermarts, including about 37.4% by Damani, according to exchange data. The public shareholding is below the minimum 25% threshold.
The share sale could come at a time when companies in India are battling weaker consumer demand as Asia’s third-largest economy slows. Avenue Supermarts, which operates food and grocery retail stores under the DMart brand, is among the few players that could sail against the wind. Its shares have gained about 12% this year.
A final decision hasn’t yet been taken on the size of the sale and more banks could be added, the people said. Representatives for Bank of America and Avenue Supermarts declined to comment, while Kotak couldn’t immediately comment."

Lithium Urban Technologies Pvt. Ltd is set to acquire electric buses and sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) to expand its fleet and enter new segments, said the co-founder and chief executive of the electric vehicle fleet operator.
The company plans to add 20 electric buses from China’s BYD and 100 units of the ZS long-range electric SUV from MG Motor India, Sanjay Krishan said in an interview on 3 December. MG Motor India will be introducing the ZS in January, which, the company claims, can run up to 340km on a single charge.
“We are looking at an initial lot of 20 electric buses of 7 and 9m categories from BYD. We plan to roll out our e-bus services from mid-January 2020 starting from Pune, Bengaluru and Delhi, respectively,"" said Krishnan.
Bengaluru-based Lithium Urban is a B2B transportation service provider with a fleet of 1,000 EVs. Currently, EVs from Tata Motors Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd comprise the bulk of its fleet.
“The long-range electric SUVs would be deployed for inter-city corporate transportation services or for senior company officials across clients. We are considering routes such as Mumbai-Pune, Delhi-Jaipur, Delhi-Agra and others,"" he said.
The company, along with Tata Motors, recently announced the induction of 500 electric cars—400 units of electric Tigor and 100 units of electric Nexon compact SUV. The electric Nexon is yet to be launched.
“When we started, there was only one EV available in the market, the two-door Mahindra e2O. However, we now have electric four-door hatchbacks, sedans and SUVs. While initially EVs did 80km on a single charge, we deployed them for intra-city applications. Now that we can do 200-300km on a single charge, I can deploy such cars for inter-city applications,"" said Krishnan, elaborating on the plans to deploy electric SUVs from Tata and MG Motor India.
As part of its segment expansion strategy, Lithium Urban plans to enter the freight segment with sub-one ton EVs to be used for last-mile deliveries. It's also weighing an entry into the public transportation system through a public-private partnership model.
“For the battery-powered freight carrier, we are working only with Tata Motors currently. For electric buses, we are working with BYD as well as Tata. It’s a question of who has the best electric vehicle,"" said Krishnan.
On the EV charging infrastructure side, Lithium Urban has partnered with a company operating in the renewable energy domain and has incorporated a joint venture to set up EV charging hubs from early next year. It already has a network of over 1,200 charging points across seven cities for its existing fleets. Krishnan did not offer details on the partner and the joint venture.
“We will set up 8-10 charging hubs with the facility to charge e-buses and electric cars. It would be able to charge 25 electric cars and 5 e-buses concurrently,"" he said. “The electrical load per such hub would be at least one megawatt and all of that would be powered through solar energy."" It plans to launch its first EV charging hub in Gurugram next month.
To fund its expansion plans, Lithium, which runs on 100% vehicle ownership model, is looking at a Series B funding round of up to $50 million."

22,2019-12-11,Mahindra Mahindra,"Anand Mahindra said the learning from the commuter bike episode, which was a 'product failure' led to the learning and entry into the premium two-wheeler segment where he claimed the group has been successful

MUMBAI :
Anand Mahindra, the chairman of the homegrown auto group Mahindra & Mahindra, on Wednesday admitted that entering the commuter bike segment more than a decade ago was a failure on the part of the group.
The group entered two-wheelers after buying out Kinetic Motors in July 2008 and relaunched the 'Freedom' bikes under the label of 'Mojo' but has not been able to make a mark in the vastly entry-model driven two-wheeler space in the country even after a decade.
The market is dominated by Hero Motorcorp and Japanese major Honda which together control close to two-thirds of the over 21-million units per annum market.
Of this, Mahindra sold a paltry 4,004 units in FY19, down 73% from FY18. The only player in an over a dozen OEM market behind Mahindra is Kawasaki Motor which sold 3,115 units in the year, according to Siam data.
In the year to March 2019, according to the Saim data, the domestic two-wheeler domestic market stood at 21.2 million units, up 4.86% from FY18.
Terming failure as ""capital"", just like financial and human capital, Mahindra said the learning from the commuter bike episode, which was a ""product failure"" led to the learning and entry into the premium two-wheeler segment where he claimed the group has been successful.
Mahindra said they entered the two-wheeler market with the confidence to ""win"", on the back of having a strong understanding of the ecosystem, distribution, R&D and also brand positioning.
""We knew our dream well and we had the right things, but how to win is where we went wrong. We should have never gone to the commuter bike side,"" Mahindra said, speaking at an event organised by British carrier Virgin Atlantic on looking at 'business as an adventure'.
Sharing the stage with the Virgin group founder Richard Brandson, Mahindra said they brought the premium Java brand to the country a year-ago and seemed to suggest that it has been a success, stating that there continues to be a five-month wait for the cult bikes.
He also said they will soon be launching the BSA bikes, which was acquired earlier.
Meanwhile, amid widespread slowdown in the auto sector, Mahindra claimed that ""the most optimistic"" people in his group today are those in the auto and farm equipment segments, as they expect sunny days to come back from April.
""...the most optimistic people in our group today are our automotive people. They've seen a good close in calendar year and they are hopeful of next year,"" he said, adding new emission norms from April will be the biggest demand driver for the company.
Similarly, in the farm equipment sector, Mahindra said the reservoir levels are good, winter crop harvest will be bountiful and hence, it expects a pick up in the tractor sales from April.
""Ironically, the two areas (auto and farm) where people think there is doom, but our people are beginning to smile again,"" he said, adding October sales were good on the back of festive demand.
However, the official numbers shared by the company for November 2019 are different with Mahindra's volumes falling over 9% at 41,235 units.
Of this, commercial vehicles sales were down 12% at 17,384 units, PV sales fell 10% to 14,637 units and farm equipment volume plunged to 20,414 units from 25,159 units in November 2018.
Asked about the economy, where growth has slipped to a six-year low and pessimistic headlines galore, Mahindra advised everyone to have faith in their inner selves.
""Failure is hard to swallow. You have to go inside, and begin investing again. 'dar ke aage jeet hai', beyond the fear lies victory. That is just not a slogan. If we really go inside internally, and we as a nation have a great tradition to understand how to go inside, we find strength,"" he said.
He declined to answer specific questions on industry doyen Rahul Bajaj's comments on fear among corporate leaders, and also one on his opinion of bankers.
Mahindra said an entrepreneur has to take risks and termed the same as ""fun"", and that time has come for us to look beyond bottom-lines and into multi-stakeholder capitalism."

20,2019-12-12,Mahindra Mahindra,"PCMC project will be implemented over a period of one year, with operations and maintenance taking another 5 yearsThis is the sixth smart city project involving Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra will provide ICT (Information and Communication Technology) solutions for the  ₹500 crore smart city project in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) located in Pune, Maharashtra. The project will be budgeted under Prime Minister's Smart Cities Mission. Launched in 2015, the mission strives to set up 100 smart cities in the country with a total investment of  ₹50,802 crore during the first five-year phase ending in 2019. Half of the funding for the project will be from the state government.
The PCMC project will be implemented over a period of one year, with operations and maintenance taking another 5 years.
The ICT solutions by Tech Mahindra will have a wide range of applications and will help improve the management of water supply, traffic, parking, sewerage, and CCTV network of the city.
The solutions also include real time data management alerts and assistance in the processing of information for the city administration.
""As part of our citizen and civil welfare service mandate, we are committed to offer much improved services through ICT led transformation which will boost the overall infrastructure in the city and also help in establishing a digital ecosystem in the city for rendering a smart city experience,"" said Shravan Hardikar, municipal commissioner, PCMC.
This is the sixth smart city project involving Tech Mahindra, which is already working on similar projects in Kanpur, Nasik, Jaipur, Jabalpur and Gandhinagar. Some of these projects will go live in the next few months.
Sujit Baksi, head, APAC Business and President Corporate Affairs, Tech Mahindra points out, the size of the city makes it one of the biggest smart city projects in India, adding, ""It extends our vision of supporting government's smart cities agenda to strengthen nation building initiatives that will go a long way in building a robust 5 trillion dollar Indian economy.""
Pimpri Chinchwad is one of the leading industrial belts of Maharashtra with a population of over 15 lakh citizens."
19,2019-12-13,Mahindra Mahindra,"Disparity in sales decline may be due to the different inventory holding strategiesThe 7-9% FY20 sales decline estimated for tractors is better than earlier forecasts of a double-digit drop

A good monsoon, albeit delayed, has improved rabi or winter crop estimates for FY20. This bodes well for tractor sales.
A delayed monsoon and erratic spatial distribution had impacted the kharif or summer crop after a gloomy 4-5% decline in rabi crop acreage in FY19. This led to a sudden reversal in the two-year strong upward cycle in tractor sales seen till March 2019.
Between April and August, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd’s (M&M’s) monthly tractor sales fell 12-18% year-on-year on the back of weak farm income. Even Escorts Ltd showed a similar decline during the period. Both companies make up about two-thirds of overall tractor sales in India. M&M is the market leader with a 40% market share.
However, there is hope in the horizon. “Sales recovery seen from September is likely to continue as water reservoir levels have risen and sufficient soil moisture on the back of adequate monsoon makes way for a bumper rabi crop,"" says Bharat Gianani, analyst at Sharekhan Ltd.
Still, after two months of sales increase in September and October, the trend was mixed in November. M&M’s sales fell 18% and that of Escorts dipped by 5% year-on-year.
“The disparity in the two firms’ sales decline could also be partially attributed to different inventory holding strategies being followed by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs),"" says Rohan Gupta, assistant vice president (corporate ratings) at Icra Ltd.
To be sure, there was a 12% year-on-year drop in total tractor sales in the first half of FY20. However, the structural factors support tractor demand.
“Irrigation penetration has reduced the risk of demand collapse with monsoon’s failure. Infrastructure spending also leads to an increase in tractor demand as about 30% usage of tractors is non-agriculture based,"" says a Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Ltd report.
That apart, tractor financing has been relatively easier in the last few years. So, tractor manufacturers are hopeful of demand recovery from January, which implies a good Q4. Icra says the year-on-year decline in sales is estimated at 7-9% in FY20, lower than the drop in the first half.
Analysts forecast a more gradual U-shaped recovery in the months ahead. “A double-digit decline would indicate weak farm cash flows from the recently harvested kharif crop,"" says Icra’s Gupta, who adds that the three-four weeks’ inventory on the back of production cuts brings comfort to OEMs. Meanwhile, softer commodity prices should alleviate, at least partially, any margin pressure on companies.
Be that as it may, near-term concerns have risen from rumours in the market of a hike in the goods and services tax (GST) rate in some auto segments including tractors. Industry heads say that coming in the wake of price hikes that typically happen in January, the additional GST burden would be a blow to the already wobbly tractor segment."

13,2019-12-17,Mahindra Mahindra,"The strong deal pipeline assures revenue visibility for Tech MahindraHigh transition costs and patchy performance in H1 are making analysts wary

Mumbai: Shares of Tech Mahindra Ltd saw a remarkable recovery in the last four months, in part fuelled by a sequential rebound in revenue growth in the September quarter.
At an analysts meeting on Monday, the company sounded confident about growth prospects. But currency volatility and transition costs related to recent large deals indicate that the management is less certain about profitability in the second half of the fiscal year.
Indeed, analysts have flagged concerns over the above-mentioned factors. “In FY20, margins are likely to be affected by transitional cost from the large telecom deal and sector specific challenges such as auto in manufacturing,"" Nomura Research said in a note.
Tech Mahindra’s Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin dropped to 12.1% in the fiscal first half from 15% in FY19. This suppressed the company’s earnings growth during the first half. The management expects profit margins to recover to previous year’s (FY19) level in FY21 on better operating efficiencies and revenue flow from execution of large deal wins.
To be sure, profit margins did improve slightly in the September quarter to 12.8% from 11.5% in the three months ended June. According to SBICAP Securities Ltd, Tech Mahindra’s management expects FY20’s margins at around 13%, implying an improvement in the fiscal second half. Even so, caution persists and not everyone shares the enthusiasm on margin trajectory.
Profitability improvement is contingent on consistent execution, warn analysts at Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd.
“Continued delivery excellence, the absence of transition cost, and portfolio synergy could be key tailwinds for YoY improvement in margin in FY21. However, we trim our assumptions and model in 14.1% Ebit margin for FY21E,"" the brokerage firm said in a note.
Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd kept their estimates unchanged for FY20 and FY21.
The concerns are not unfounded. Employee attrition remains elevated. This may warrant an increase in expenditure on human resources. The deal pipeline continues to remain strong. Pipeline in the enterprise vertical is 20% more than the year-ago level. Moreover, the large deal pipeline in this business segment has doubled compared with the beginning of FY20.
The strong deal pipeline assures revenue visibility for Tech Mahindra. But there is no denying that high transition costs and patchy performance in the first half of FY20 are making analysts wary.
“Valuations are not demanding, but acceleration in revenue growth trajectory with margin improvement and consistency in performance would be key to drive further rerating, in our view,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities wrote in a note."
15,2019-12-17,Mahindra Mahindra,"'I think Uday (Kotak) is the best candidate to acquire Yes bank. You need deep pockets, Uday has that,' SBI chairman saidIn the past, both Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank have been discussed as potential suitors for Yes Bank

Mumbai: Two of India's top bankers on Tuesday opined that Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) is best suited to acquire smaller and capital-starved rival Yes Bank.
Yes Bank's capital buffers have dipped on accelerated non-performing assets recognition under new chief executive Ravneet Gill earlier this year.
The private sector lender's capital raising plan is also passing through uncertainties and there are speculations on whether Yes Bank is an acquisition target, which has been denied by its management.
""I think Uday (Kotak) is the best candidate to acquire Yes Bank. You need deep pockets, Uday has that,"" SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said at Times Network's India Economic Conclave here.
When the same question was posed to third-largest lender Axis Bank's Managing Director and CEO Amitabh Chaudhry, it was answered with the same suggestion.
""We (Axis Bank) are a smaller bank. We are trying to ensure that we grow big so that at some stage we can acquire others. So, yes Mr Kotak, they are best suited rather than us,"" he said.
When contacted, Kotak Mahindra Group Chief Communication Officer Rohit Rao said, ""these are comments made by other bankers and reflect their views, and not ours"".
In the past, both Axis Bank and KMB have been discussed as potential suitors for Yes Bank.
According to some watchers, acquiring a bank can help Uday Kotak reduce the promoter stake in KMB, and help him get closer to the levels mandated by the RBI.
The regulator has been dragged to the court by KMB for not accepting an earlier attempt at stake dilution and the same petition is slated to be heard early next year.
Meanwhile, speaking at the same event, Kotak said there is a need to resist a ""colonialisation"" of Indian finance, hinting at share sales to foreign investors.
""I'm looking forward to best in class quality but strong Indian-owned and controlled financial sector and while we must attract foreign capital, we must ensure that there is no colonialisation of Indian finance,"" Kotak said.
Yes Bank had to cut its book size by 7 per cent in the September quarter because of the capital constraints and has been looking to finish the capital raising exercise at the earliest.
The lender had first announced it has interest from investors of USD 3 billion, and a few days later disclosed offers of USD 2 billion. It wanted to finalise the same at the last board meet on December 10 but was not able to take a decision.
Yes Bank's share price plummeted to  ₹32 apiece in October as against a high of  ₹400 just a year ago and has been one of the most volatile scrips on the bourses

Mumbai: Noted banker Uday Kotak on Tuesday said the country's financial system is currently in a Darwinian mode as only the fittest lenders are able to survive.
The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Kotak Mahindra Bank also that historically, whenever there has been a problem with a private sector lender, it has been merged with a state-run bank. ""India is in massive Darwinian mode of what I call as the survival of the fittest.
""Sector after sector has seen that it is going to be more consolidated than ever before. Consolidation in the Indian economy is happening more out of mortality and less out of combinations,"" Kotak said.
He also noted that historically, whenever there has been a problem with a private sector lender, it has been merged with a state-run bank. According to him, the government has to ""rework"" the Financial Resolution Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill since an exit route is essential for troubled lenders.
FRDI Bill, which had raised concerns over protection for depositors, has lapsed and the government is yet to introduce a new bill.
""As you are allowing entry in banking, we should be thinking more about exit policy. And one of the earlier bill that was planned earlier was the FRDI Bill. We need to rework on that,"" Kotak said, speaking at the Times Network organised India Economic Conclave here.
The comments come at a time when multiple lenders, especially non-banks and also cooperatives like PMC Bank are sailing through choppy waters, which has highlighted the need for a legislation to take care of exits by financial sector participants.
Kotak also welcomed rules introduced under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) wherein troubled DHFL has been referred for resolution.
Regarding infra-lender IL&FS, whose over RS 94,600-crore debt resolution process he heads, Kotak reiterated the company is confident of recovering over 50 per cent of its dues.
He said the biggest challenge in the IL&FS resolution was the distribution mechanism, which has been overcome after the Supreme Court judgement in the Essar Steel case.
Kotak said there has been a complex web of over 340 companies in the IL&FS group created over two decades which resulted in a lot of time taken by its new board.
He said the time has come to ""dramatically increase"" the flow of domestic savings going into risk averse assets like fixed deposits and gold, into risk capital which can help the economy better.
Further, Kotak said the government should choose a set of six core state-run lenders, and mark out three others where its stake would go down below 50 per cent through sales in the market and have the remaining three run as ""public private partnerships"".

Information technology (IT) and communications service provider Tech Mahindra Ltd has been instrumental in the digital transformation of several large and small organizations. Ranked 15 in the world’s top 30 digital companies list by Spectator Index, published in March, the company has been more active in India than before. In an interview, Sujit Baksi, president corporate affairs and business head, APAC, and Puneet Gupta, head, India Sales, Tech Mahindra spoke on the company’s renewed interest in India, key projects and emphasis on reskilling. Edited excerpts:
What is the size of Tech Mahindra’s overseas business, and what is the share of India market in that?
Baksi: While we do not share geo-specific number, we would like to add that India is definitely a key market for Tech Mahindra. The Indian market accounts for about 5% of the total revenue. The company’s total revenue is about $4.9 billion, and it aims to double its Indian revenue in the next few years on the back of growing IT spend by customers. This year, H1 has been specifically at a historic high for India business with 12 new logos being added. Our India business grew YoY (year-on-year) by 29% and our QoQ (quarter-on-quarter) growth in India for Q2 is 4% roughly.
What is Tech Mahindra’s strategy for India going forward?
Baksi: According to a Gartner study, the India IT market opportunity stands in excess of $85 billion, growing at 9%, which is nearly three times the global average. We believe the total pie will increase and digitization will accelerate the growth. Rapid digitization across all verticals in recent times has paved way for better business opportunities and facilitated our renewed focus in the Indian market. Tech Mahindra has set up a strategic business unit to specifically cater to the deals coming from India. We have seen great success in the past two years in India after the formation of this new business unit. While we have taken up/accomplished large government projects for modernization, opportunities for improving customer experience in the e-commerce space and IT transformation projects involving enterprise customers such as banks and telecom players, we continue to remain very selective about the projects that we work on.
In which sectors, Tech Mahindra is most active in India?
Gupta: We are working with various organizations and the government in India. With Coal India Ltd, we are working on a digital transformation project at the backdrop of an ERP (enterprise resource planning) implementation. We are also working with the government on a modernization project involving six ports and with the Indian Navy on an access control system. We have also helped in the transformation of India’s largest banks.
E-commerce is another area where we are focused and have nine major e-commerce companies as our customers. As part of our TechMNxt charter, we are also focused on leveraging emerging technology. Tech Mahindra is among the first to implement blockchain in one of the largest banks in India for money transfer and also for a telecom operator.
At the start of digital transformation, the industry found a huge gulf between the available skill sets and their needs. How much of that gulf has been addressed, and how is Tech Mahindra addressing this?
Baksi: At Tech Mahindra, our continued focus is on skill-based hiring, especially in new-age digital technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), robotic process automation, blockchain, 5G, internet of things, and cybersecurity. As part of our TechMNxt charter, we are dedicated to create a future-ready workforce to solve real business problems of our customers by leveraging these emerging technologies. We are also investing heavily in reskilling employees in next generation technologies like blockchain, cybersecurity, AI, machine learning, robotics, and automation, and 5G."

10,2019-12-20,Mahindra Mahindra,"Born in 1955, Anand Mahindra is a third generation scion and the son of late industrialist Harish MahindraAnand Mahindra’s business acumen and vision was reflected in his foray into electric vehicles nearly a decade ago

Anand Mahindra, a doyen of corporate India, leaves behind a rich legacy of strong governance, as he eases into the role of a non-executive chairman of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, the company he helped transform from a vehicle-maker to a diversified conglomerate.
Though he will not be steering the group actively, Mahindra is likely to continue to gently oversee affairs amid testing times for the automobiles industry and for most businesses in general—a transition that was in the works for a long time.
Subodh Bhargava, former chairman of Eicher Motors and Tata Communications, said the foundation of corporate governance built by Mahindra should ensure that the “empowered professionals should be able to face the challenge"" of steering the group, though none of his family members will be on the board.
Bhargava, who worked with Mahindra at the Confederation of Indian Industry, and where both have served as president, described him as ‘very thorough and dynamic with a futuristic vision"" and with an ability to articulate thoughts in an appropriate manner with policy makers.
Born in 1955, Anand Mahindra is a third-generation scion and the son of late industrialist Harish Mahindra and Indra Mahindra, the daughter of the late industrialist K.C. Mahindra.
In 1981, Anand Mahindra returned to India after completing his MBA from Harvard, and joined Mahindra Ugine Steel Co. Ltd as an executive assistant to the executive director. Eight years later, he took over the position of president of the same company, leading the group’s diversification into real estate development and hospitality management.
He took over as the chairman of the board and managing director of the Mahindra group from his uncle Keshub Mahindra in 2012. Four years later, he was re-designated as executive chairman of M&M and continued to be the chairman of Mahindra Group.
Mahindra saw through a number of significant acquisitions, including that of Satyam Computer Services in 2009, further consolidating the group’s diversification. But he also strengthened the company’s core vehicles business with the group taking over South Korea’s Ssangyong Motor Co. and Reva Electric Co. in 2010. Reva was one of the country’s first electric vehicles.
At a time when the group’s fortunes were running low, Mahindra’s decision to launch the Scorpio Sports Utility Vehicle in 2002 gave a major boost to the business, and the model remains popular.
Today, the company is no longer the mere truck and jeep maker that it was when Anand Mahindra took over. The Mahindra group has stamped its growing presence across utility vehicles, information technology, tractors, vacation ownership and financial services.
Mahindra’s business acumen and vision was reflected in his foray into electric vehicles nearly a decade ago.
Now, despite the group’s enormous clout, Mahindra’s decision to step down is bound to pose stiff challenges as the bread-and-butter automobile business faces growing competition and low demand.
Once the country’s largest utility vehicle manufacturer, it has not only ceded ground to Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co., but new entrants, such as Kia Motors and MG Motor, are also nipping away at its traditional market.
M&M has also found it tough to make a mark with new products in the compact and mid-size sports utility vehicle segment, the most sought after in the domestic market. Products such as the Scorpio and Bolero remain the mainstay, but are more than a decade old.
Sangeeta Reddy, joint managing director, Apollo Hospitals group, described Mahindra as a person with “the most amazing combination of a fine mind, a fine administrator and a good human being""."
9,2019-12-20,Mahindra Mahindra,"Changes imminent in over 214 firms as chairpersons can’t be related to MD or CEOOf the top 500 firms, 162 have the same person as the chairperson, MD and CEO

MUMBAI :
Anand Mahindra’s decision to be non-executive chairman of Mahindra and Mahindra, effective 1 April 2020, is also a culmination of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) regulations, which mandate that the chairperson of the top 500 companies need to be non-executive.
To comply with Sebi norms, such changes are imminent in over 214 companies, including banks, public sector enterprises and large corporates, including Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Bharti Airtel Ltd, Wipro Ltd, Bajaj Auto Ltd and Adani Ports Ltd.
The likes of Mukesh Ambani of RIL, Sunil Bharti Mittal of Bharti Airtel, Sanjiv Mehta of Hindustan Unilever and Sanjiv Puri of ITC will have to either become a non-executive chairperson, or take the executive role of managing director and chief executive officer.
According to data compiled by nseinfobase.com (run by Prime Database) of the top 500 companies, 162 have the same person as the chairperson, MD and CEO. In another 52 companies, the chairperson and MD/CEO are related.
Sebi norms under the Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirement (LODR) also mandate that chairperson cannot be related to the MD or CEO. Sebi relies on the definition of a relative as per the Companies Act, 2013.
“Promoter assuming a non-executive chairperson role is and would be rare. In my view, in most cases, you would find the promoter shall continue with the role of MD/CEO while appointing an existing independent director as the non-executive chairperson. There is still a long way to go. As with other regulations, especially relating to the composition of board, the true test will lie in its implementation -- would there be simple checkbox compliance as we have seen in the past or would the implementation be in spirit as well,"" said Pranav Haldea, managing director, Prime Database, a primary market tracker.
Most of India Inc. is currently consulting lawyers and family office specialists on restructuring their management and board chairmanship.
“Corporates do not want a situation where they are saddled with someone, either at the board level or management level, who does not understand the thinking of promoters. Many Indian companies for years have been promoter-driven with control over management and board. So, the restriction that MD/CEO and chairman cannot be related is another big concern. The succession planning is acutely being relooked at,"" said a senior lawyer, who is consulting with some of the Nifty 50 companies on navigating the new Sebi requirements.
But, there are also some corporates who are resisting the change and urging Sebi to revisit the norms. So far, Sebi has refused to consider representations from India Inc. on this issue.
According to a joint report published by International Finance Corp. (IFC), the BSE and Institutional Investor Advisory Services India (IiAS) on corporate governance practice in Indian boardrooms, there is a pushback on Sebi regulations seeking separation of chairperson and CEO roles.
“We find that 57 companies in the BSE 100 and 23 of the 50 IPO companies have separated the roles of the chairperson and CEO, with the chairperson being non-executive. However, some companies have a chairperson and CEO from the same promoter group,"" said the report."

“As non-executive chairman, Anand Mahindra will serve as a mentor and sounding board for the managing director on issues to be presented to the board, especially in the areas of strategic planning, risk mitigation and external interface. He will retire on 1 April 2021. Goenka will continue to retain direct responsibility of Ssangyong Motors as chairman of its board until his retirement date,"" the company said.
Shah is currently responsible for developing strategy and building capabilities, such as digitization, data sciences and enabling synergies across group companies. He also leads the risk management and performance review functions at M&M.
Before joining the company, Shah had a 14-year stint at GE Capital, where he held several leadership positions in both the US and global units before becoming president and CEO of the India unit.

1,2019-12-27,Mahindra Mahindra,"Move aimed at shielding lenders from non-bank risks, steering focus to boost credit growthBanks have asked the regulator for five years to implement the rule but they may get just three years

MUMBAI :
The Reserve Bank of India has asked lenders to cut their stakes in insurers to 30%, as the banking regulator attempts to shield banks from risks arising out of their non-banking businesses and steer focus to boosting credit growth in a slowing economy, four people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
RBI informed the bankers in a meeting last week that it will soon introduce rules to cap their holdings in an insurance company to 30%, the people said, requesting anonymity as the matter is confidential. The holding limit will be 50% for non-banking financial companies such as Housing Development Finance Corp. that have insurance units, they said. Banks have been told to await RBI’s official communication on the new rules.
The move is likely to have far-reaching impact not only on banks, which derive significant income from their insurance units, but also on the insurers themselves as their parent banks are major capital providers and distributors of insurance products. State Bank of India, ICICI Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank will be among the lenders to be affected by the decision.
“The 30% capping rule is meant to safeguard banks from capital risks arising from non-core businesses. But the new RBI rule, which is likely to come into effect some time in fiscal 2021, will create a huge supply of equities in the market when the banks slash their stakes. It is to be seen if the market has an appetite to absorb such large amount of liquidity,"" said the first of the four people. The rule is likely to be implemented in a phased manner, the person added.
“RBI is asking us to rather use the money for credit growth. RBI is suggesting banks to increase Tier 1 networth,"" said the second person. “There should not be much of a problem as some of the insurance firms are listed. We (as a bank) have to give a roadmap to RBI as in when we will bring down stake to 30%. We have asked for five years but they (RBI) will not give five years. They may say three.""
Current regulatory norms mandate that a bank can hold a maximum of 50% in an insurance venture but the regulator may allow them to hold more on a case-to-case basis.
In the life insurance space, ICICI Bank owns 52.87% in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd; Kotak Mahindra Bank holds a 77% stake in Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance Co. Ltd; and State Bank of India owns 57.6% in SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd. Home financier HDFC holds 51.47% in HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd.
Among general insurers, HDFC holds 50.49% in HDFC Ergo General Insurance Co.; ICICI Bank holds a 55.86% stake in ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd; Kotak Mahindra Bank holds 100% in Kotak Mahindra General Insurance; and State Bank of India holds 57.13% in SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd.
“Banks are the major distributors of financial products especially life insurance. Any reduction of stake by sponsor banks in these institutions may have negative impact on the distribution capabilities as well as general public perception about these institutions they enjoy because of parentage. This issue may impact the prospective investor sentiment also,"" said Ashutosh Mishra, head of research, Ashika Stock Broking.
In any insurance business, whenever capital infusion takes place, all promoters need to put in money as per the proportion of their shareholding. If even one of the promoters is unable to put in money as per their shareholding, the capital infusion process fails. This can stifle the growth of the insurer.
“RBI is concerned that such capital contributions commitments may hurt the bank and exposes it to higher risks. This is why RBI wants to cap bank’s holding in insurance firms,"" said the first person.
The second person said RBI doesn’t want banks to own insurance, asset management and NBFC businesses.
“Over a period of time, RBI wants to reduce the holding cap to 30% or below 10%,"" said the second person.
Insurance is a capital-guzzling business, which needs regular capital infusions as it grows. Mutual fund businesses also have been growing steadily but new norms related to penetration of AMCs into locations beyond top-15 cities, require additional growth capital.
The NBFC business has been shrinking after the IL&FS debacle last September and a subsequent liquidity crisis. Any turnaround in the NBFC business or even to keep the NBFC afloat, albeit with losses until the credit situation improves, will require a lot of capital.
In all these businesses, wherever banks are parent companies, capital outflow will be from the bank’s books, which will weaken the bank’s own core business.
While RBI plans to limit the holding of banks in insurance at 30%, in order to ensure that insurance companies do not face growth constraint due to the ceiling on bank’s holding, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, or Irdai, last week proposed an increase in FDI in insurance from 49% to 74%. If this proposal is enacted in the Parliament, foreign joint venture partners in insurance will be able to infuse more capital in the company whenever growth plans are drafted.
To be sure, RBI has been attempting to recalibrate banks’ holding norms to safeguard them from external risks for some time. In May 2011, an RBI working group recommended a holding company structure for banks. It said all new banks and insurance companies will mandatorily need to operate under the financial holding company (FHC) framework and intermediate holding companies within the FHC should not be permitted.
Under the holdco norms, a bank had to unwind its shareholding in subsidiaries, and the existing shareholding of the bank in its units were to be transferred to the holdco.
According to the working group, the holdco was supposed to be regulated either by RBI itself or by a new regulator. The group had said it was necessary to put in place some limit on the expansion of non-banking businesses after the existing financial groups, dominated by banks, migrate to the holding company structure. However, the holdco proposal has now been scrapped due to its complexities, according to the three people cited above."

While the most searched personality was Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter pilot Abhinanadan Varthaman, who was held captive by Pakistan for 60 hours after an aerial dogfight in June, the list of most searched business personalities was led by the 81-year-old Tata patriarch.

The industrialist, who joined Instagram earlier this year, has been awarded with two of India's highest civilian awards – Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan.
2) Azim Premji: The 74-year-old czar of the Indian IT industry who turned Wipro from a cooking oil company into a $8.5 billion IT behemoth retired this July as the conglomerate's chairman and managing director.

In 2017, Lakshmi Mittal was named in Forbes’ special list of the world’s '100 Greatest Living Business Minds'.

Mukesh Ambani's name is also missing from the list. Ambani, whose net worth is estimated to be more than $60 billion in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, is Asia's richest man."
