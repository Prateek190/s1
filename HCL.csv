107,2018-01-17,HCL,"Four biggest IT stocks listed on NSE Infosys, TCS, Wipro, HCL Technologies rose between 4.1% and 5.9% on Tuesday, although part of that could be due to weakness in rupee

A rising tide may lift all boats, but to expect higher IT spending to benefit all Indian IT companies is clearly taking things too far. Morgan Stanley said in a 15 January note that “an improving global macro could spur tech spending, which could re-rate stocks"". The four biggest IT stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange rose between 4.1% and 5.9%, although part of that could be due to the weakness in the rupee, after the trade deficit for December came in at a three-year high.  
A rising tide may lift all boats, but to expect higher IT spending to benefit all Indian IT companies is clearly taking things too far. Morgan Stanley said in a 15 January note that “an improving global macro could spur tech spending, which could re-rate stocks"". The four biggest IT stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange rose between 4.1% and 5.9%, although part of that could be due to the weakness in the rupee, after the trade deficit for December came in at a three-year high. 
Ironically, the biggest gainer was the Wipro Ltd stock, on which Morgan Stanley still has an underweight rating with a target price of Rs290. Wipro shares rose to Rs334 apiece on Tuesday. Investors are taking the rising tide argument far too literally.
For that matter, even Morgan Stanley’s thesis is predicated upon the assumption that a turnaround in global IT spending will result in better times for the Indian IT sector. 
This isn’t necessarily the case. In recent years, multinational firms such as Accenture Plc and some small companies such as EPAM Systems Inc. and Globant SA have done far better than Indian IT firms, with spending patterns shifting towards new technologies at the expense of traditional services. 
Data collated by ISG, the world’s largest third-party outsourcing deal adviser, shows that Indian IT companies have lagged by a huge margin in the Americas region, despite high growth in overall deal flow. Growth in total deal flow tracked by ISG rose as much as 37% in Americas in the second half of 2017. 
“While the deal flow momentum in Americas was positive, the perplexing factor remains that for the top-4 Indian IT companies, growth in Americas has decelerated to 5% y-o-y in 2QFY18 (versus its near-term peak of 14% y-o-y)"", analysts at Nomura Research wrote in a note to clients. Results of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd for the December quarter show that the weakness in growth continues—the former reported growth of less than 3% year-on-year in the Americas region. In short, the tide was rising in America, but it didn’t really lift Indian IT companies with it. 
A 2018 outlook report by ISG suggests this trend might continue in 2018. “Traditional sourcing will continue to face pricing pressure (as clients look to do more with less)... Traditional sourcing momentum remains slow... deal flow grew 3% y-y in 2017 (and is estimated to grow 4% in 2018),"" Nomura’s analysts said in the note citing the ISG report. What ISG classifies as traditional sourcing is the bread and butter segment for Indian IT companies. 
The other category of deals ISG tracks is classified as “as-a-service sourcing"", which includes Software as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service. This can be used as a rough proxy for digital spending, a segment where Indian IT companies have been lagging. Even here, ISG has indicated that deal flow is expected to fall to 20% in 2018, compared to 36% in the previous year."

New Delhi: Shares of information technology (IT) companies surged in the morning trade even as the broader market was trading with marginal gains.
The BSE IT index was trading with gains of 1.54% at 12,213.70. It touched a high of 12,272.23 points. The BSE Teck index also surged to a high of 6,820.44, registering a jump of 1.61% in morning trade. The index was quoted at 6,784.92, up 1.08% at 10.52am. Meanwhile, the 30-share benchmark index Sensex was trading with gains of 0.35% at 34,891.41 points.
The leading IT companies like Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra registered gains of as much as 3% on the BSE.
Infosys surged 3.30% to touch a 52-week high of  ₹ 1,160, registering a surge in its shares price for the eighth consecutive session. TCS also hit a new high of  ₹ 2925.00. Similar was the case HCL Technologies also which touched its 52-week high of  ₹ 962.70. Meanwhile, shares of Tech Mahindra touched a high of  ₹ 64, up 1.11% over its previous closing price.
Morgan Stanley in a research note has said that the Indian IT services stocks are set for a turnaround in 2018 as recovery in spending is “imminent"". According to the global financial services major, a turnaround in IT spending could quickly turn sentiment on these stocks. Though the sector faces risks from automation and a slower pace of market share gains from global vendors, a cyclical rally could be in the offing, it added."
105,2018-01-19,HCL,"HCL Technologies posted a marginal 0.3% increase quarter-on-quarter  in consolidated net profit at Rs2,194 crore for the quarter ending December

New Delhi: Noida-based IT major HCL Technologies Ltd on Thursday posted a marginal 0.3% increase quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) in consolidated net profit at Rs2,194 crore for the quarter ending December. This translated into 6% year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in net profit. For the same quarter, HCL Tech’s revenues grew 3% q-o-q and 8.4% y-o-y to Rs12,808 crore. 
New Delhi: Noida-based IT major HCL Technologies Ltd on Thursday posted a marginal 0.3% increase quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) in consolidated net profit at Rs2,194 crore for the quarter ending December. This translated into 6% year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in net profit. For the same quarter, HCL Tech’s revenues grew 3% q-o-q and 8.4% y-o-y to Rs12,808 crore.
HCL signed 20 transformational deals this quarter across Mode 1–2–3 services, with several of them representing next generation offerings of autonomics and artificial intelligence, digital and analytics, internet of things, cloud native services and cybersecurity.
“We finished last quarter on a strong note, with a growth of 3.3% sequentially and 11.2% year on year in constant currency terms. Our Mode 1–2–3 strategy and success of our client partner program for top accounts, continued to drive industry leading growth. Over 25% of our revenues this quarter came from Mode 2 and Mode 3 services, which strongly validates the success of our next-gen offerings in the market. This was a strong quarter in terms of deal signings where we signed 20 transformational deals across services,"" said C. Vijayakumar, president and chief executive officer, HCL Technologies.
In a statement, the company said that revenue grew by 14.1% in constant currency terms in the last 12 months. There was broad-based growth across all revenue segments and this was largely driven by engineering and R&D services at 37.7%, infrastructure services at 11.5% and application services at 7.3%. Vertical growth was led by manufacturing at 23.1%, financial services at 16.8%, retail and consumer packaged goods at 11.2%, public services at 10.1%, and lifesciences and healthcare at 7.6%, according to the company. With respect to markets, Americas, Europe and rest of the world (RoW) grew by 15.6%, 11.1% and 13.4%, respectively.
The IT major expects FY18 revenues to grow between 10.5% and 12.5% in constant currency terms. The revenue guidance is based on FY17 (April to March) average exchange rates. The above constant currency guidance translates to 12.1% to 14.1% in dollar terms based on 31 December 2017 rates. 
Nitin Padmanabhan, an analyst with Investec Capital Services, said, “HCLT’s Q3FY18 results currently appear to be a non-event. Revenue growth of 3.1% QoQ (0.8% ahead of expectations) was largely driven by the Engineering & R&D services business which accounted for 95% of incremental revenues. It’s important to understand incremental revenues from new IP acquisitions that could have contributed to this growth. Revenue and EBIT guidance remains unchanged."""
104,2018-01-22,HCL,"Wipro, HCL Technologies and other IT firms said that they expect growth to pick up in the coming quarters, but it makes sense to wait and see if this materializes

Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, the third and fourth largest information technology (IT) services companies listed in India, reported results that were in line with Street estimates. Of course, HCL Technologies has been ahead of its peers and reported sequential growth of 3.3% in the December quarter, but as much as 1.5 percentage points of this might have come from inorganic contributions, according to an analyst at a multinational brokerage.  
Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, the third and fourth largest information technology (IT) services companies listed in India, reported results that were in line with Street estimates. Of course, HCL Technologies has been ahead of its peers and reported sequential growth of 3.3% in the December quarter, but as much as 1.5 percentage points of this might have come from inorganic contributions, according to an analyst at a multinational brokerage. 
Besides, it appears to have stepped up its strategy of buying growth by entering into intellectual property-related deals with International Business Machines Corp. (IBM). In fiscal 2016-17, the company reported cash outflows of $387 million on this count. In the first three quarters of this fiscal, outflows rose to $583 million. 
Adjusted for revenues from these deals and other acquisitions, year-on-year growth of the company wouldn’t be very different from the mid single-digit growth reported by peers Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd. In reported terms, HCL’s revenue growth looks far more impressive at 13.9%. 
Growth at Wipro remains pedestrian at 0.9% in constant currency terms sequentially for the December quarter. The company expects growth to pick up to between 1% and 3% in the March quarter, which it says will bring it to industry-level growth rates. But a moot point is that growth in the seasonally strong June and September quarters matters far more. It remains to be seen if the company will grow in line with peers during those quarters. 
Both companies reported better growth compared to TCS and Infosys in the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) segment; although that has been the case for the past few quarters. For the industry as a whole, this segment continues to be lacklustre and is the primary reason overall growth has remained subdued. In HCL’s case, growth in infrastructure services remained subdued, although the company said it expects a pick-up in the coming quarters. This segment used to drive growth for the company until not too long ago.
All told, Wipro and HCL’s results give the impression, like TCS and Infosys’s, that growth remains sluggish for Indian IT firms. While most of these companies said they expect growth to pick up in the coming quarters, it makes sense to wait and see if this materializes. After all, even FY18 was expected to be a better year compared to FY17, although things haven’t turned out that way."
103,2018-02-18,HCL,"HCL Technologies has spent $1.1 billion to acquire a bunch of intellectual properties from heavyweights such as IBM and DXC Technology Co. This, HCL claims, will future-proof its business. Will the gamble pay off?

Bengaluru: To the casual eye, it will appear HCL Technologies Ltd has been doing all the right things while making all the right noises about transforming its business amid a disruptive technological landscape. 
Bengaluru: To the casual eye, it will appear HCL Technologies Ltd has been doing all the right things while making all the right noises about transforming its business amid a disruptive technological landscape.
For the discerning analysts, India’s fourth largest software company could be riding a tiger.
HCL’s strategy is underpinned on investments of $1.1 billion in licensing intellectual properties (IPs) from companies and then building products around them for clients.
The trouble is some of the acquired IPs are decades-old and are ceding share to rival offerings. A case in point is HCL’s acquisition of International Business Machines Corp.’s (IBM’s) Lotus Notes, a product that is fast losing relevance in today’s world.
“It’s okay to invest in legacy technologies as part of a company’s overall investment portfolio—but it’s not the future. Smart companies harvest cash flow from established legacy offerings while simultaneously investing assertively in the future,"" said Robert C. Wolcott, professor of innovation at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “Too much legacy means a long slide to oblivion, especially in technology markets."" 
The issue with the investments being made by HCL as part of its IP licensing deals is that it appears the company is looking to play more a role at the bottom, said two company executives on the condition of anonymity.
Since IBM first allowed HCL engineers to work on its products about 15 months ago, the US company has received close to $1 billion in payments, or about 90% of HCL’s total investment.
While the benefit to IBM is manifest, the financial rewards accruing to HCL has been rather slow to come.
HCL has, however, gone ahead and inked a total of 10 such IP partnerships (see chart), across technology domains such as core banking platform and a few automation platforms.
The company expects to generate as much as $255 million in revenue in the first year from the date of stitching each of these IP partnerships.
That’s the good part. 
While this may prove financially lucrative in the short term, analysts doubt whether the cash flows will be sustainable, given their declining usage worldwide. 
“From a service provider perspective, these deals convert balance sheet into P&L (profit and loss) contributing to revenue growth, margin accretion and possibly even EPS (earnings per share) accretion in the first year,"" Kotak Institutional Equities analysts Kawaljeet Saluja and Jaykumar Doshi wrote in a 1 January note. “However, we believe these deals bring little in terms of strategic benefit for the service provider either in terms of client access or building out new IP competency.""
HCL’s investments in legacy technology areas is strikingly different from the ones followed by bigger rivals Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd, which are aggressively investing in cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence platforms.
In another such partnership, HCL has invested $50 million in IP owned by DXC Technology Co. to develop its core banking platform Hogan, whose roots date back to 1970s.
MintAsia’s reporting since the start of the year, based on interactions with half a dozen company executives and former employees, HCL’s balance sheets and quarterly post-earnings transcripts over the past six years, finds that HCL Technologies’s transformation story has some glaring holes, contrary to the management’s narrative of making the company future-ready.
Another sore point with investors is the firm’s approach of recognising amortization and depreciation costs based on the revenue it generates, rather than accounting these costs at a fixed rate over time.
One analyst estimates that the company is not generating enough business from these IP assets, and for this reason, HCL Technologies could possibly have to write down the value of some of these assets in the future.
The accounting norm boosts the company’s profitability in the near term, analysts say. Although MintAsia could not independently establish the impact on profitability, as the IP partnerships have been signed over seven quarters, some analysts have noted that the company is pushing back its expenses to the latter part of the life of the contract. 
“A significant portion of amortization has been scheduled beyond FY22,"" Madhu Babu, an analyst at domestic brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher Ltd, wrote in a 25 October note to clients. See Table. 
In August 2016, HCL Technologies first disclosed that the company had decided to spend $40 million on an IP licence arrangement with IBM. 
Subsequently, the company promised to spend $1.1 billion in similar IP partnerships with three companies, including IBM, DXC and an unnamed US-based company. 
Under each of these IP partnerships, HCL made an upfront payment, with the remaining amount to be paid over a period of time. These IP partnerships, claims the management, will help HCL Technologies build solutions or customize the core IP technology, and then jointly sell along with the IP-owner of the technology the new solution.
What has gone unnoticed is that these investments in buying IP rights, many of which are mature technologies, may weigh on the company’s balance sheet. 
Goodwill and intangibles, which are essentially a premium a company pays in lieu of a brand or unique technology when buying an asset or a firm, now total about 32% or $2.25 billion of HCL Technologies’ $7.24 billion in total assets at the end of December 2017, the highest among its peers.
A detailed questionnaire, seeking comment, sent to HCL Technologies on 31 January, and repeated follow-ups, were unanswered.
Sceptics say that HCL Technologies is merely buying revenue in the near term by getting assured business tied to these products.
“A lot of large enterprises still use Lotus Notes and many of the regional banks in the US run on Hogan core banking platform. This brings good money for any company which can offer these clients that they have expertise to help them maintain these platforms,"" said a former executive at HCL Technologies, who was earlier involved in one of the IP partnerships with DXC. “However, no new company wants to get Lotus Notes. No top-tier bank wants to have Hogan core banking platform either. So where is the business model?""
Over the past few years, India’s $154 billion IT outsourcing sector has seen revenue growth slow even as it has taken a hit on profitability. This is because the companies aren’t able to charge higher prices because of intense competition. At the same time, companies, across industries want their technology vendors to offer solutions which use data analytics, artificial intelligence and automation platforms. This has forced companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd, to either build technology platforms or buy some of these technologies. 
From investing in their own IP platforms to partnering with start-ups, each of these companies are battling hard to stave off this existential threat posed by the newer technologies to the traditional model of deploying armies of engineers to complete a project. 
HCL Technologies, long known for its dominance in maintaining computers and data centres (or infrastructure management services), has seen growth decline from its core business over the past two years.
To be sure, slow revenue growth in its core business is the primary reason behind the company looking to move away from a people-led model to a company focused on offering solutions using IP platforms. 
Beginning October-December period of 2012 and until April-June of 2015, the management claimed to have won over $11 billion worth of new deals, across 11 straight quarters. Still, HCL Technologies’ incremental revenue during this time was only $1.8 billion. Since these deal wins were not translating into enough incremental revenue growth, Mint in a story dated 2 October 2015 found that one possible reason behind this dichotomy in new deal wins and growth was the company losing existing clients. 
Incidentally, HCL Technologies stopped quantifying its large deal wins from October-December of 2015.
Mint, in another story dated 1 July 2016, reported that HCL’s old infrastructure maintenance contracts were getting squeezed as clients shifted to cloud computing offered by Microsoft Azure and Amazon’s AWS."

Padmanabhan adds, “The growth in revenues was largely driven by Infrastructure management and engineering and R&D business which contributed 61% and 20% to the incremental revenues respectively. It’s important to understand incremental revenues from new IP acquisitions that could have contributed to this growth. HCLT invested $46.5 million in IPs for the 8th straight quarter."""

97,2018-05-02,HCL,"HCL expects its dollar revenue to grow by as much as 12.5% in the current fiscal, implying it will race past Wipro

Bengaluru: HCL Technologies Ltd is set to surpass Wipro Ltd to become India’s third biggest software services provider in the three months to 30 June, marking the first change in the pecking order of the country’s $167 billion information technology outsourcing industry in six years. 
Bengaluru: HCL Technologies Ltd is set to surpass Wipro Ltd to become India’s third biggest software services provider in the three months to 30 June, marking the first change in the pecking order of the country’s $167 billion information technology outsourcing industry in six years.
Billionaire Shiv Nadar-led HCL Technologies expects its dollar revenue to grow by as much as 12.5% in the current financial year, implying that the company will race past Azim Premji-led Wipro. 
HCL Technologies’s rise has come on the back of years of underperformance by Wipro. Until a few years ago, both companies used to generate significant business from managing data centres or offering infrastructure services to their clients. That revenue disappeared with the rise of cloud computing or offerings of computing power by the hour by firms such as Amazon Web Services.
To mitigate this, HCL Technologies has invested over $1.3 billion over the past two years in licensing intellectual properties (IPs) from companies and then building products around them for clients. This has proved financially lucrative for the company in the short run.
Noida-based HCL Technologies reported 2.5% sequential dollar revenue growth in the quarter ended March to end with $2.038 billion in revenue, a mere $24 million less than Wipro’s $2.062 billion.
Wipro does not provide full-year revenue forecast but expects its quarterly revenue to be between a decline of 2% and growth of 0.2% in constant currency terms in the April-June period from the preceding quarter. If Wipro manages to retain its revenue in constant currency terms and gains from favourable currency movements, it will mean reporting at best 1% dollar revenue growth, according to Mint’s calculations.
HCL Technologies does not provide a quarterly revenue outlook but the management expects dollar revenue to grow between 10.5% and 12.5% in 2018-19. Based on its full-year forecast, HCL Technologies expects its dollar revenue to grow between 2.4% and 3.2% in the April-June period, according to Mint’s calculations. HCL Technologies’s revenue in the June quarter will total $2.087 billion if the company grows at the lower end, or 2.4%, sequentially, which will be more than Wipro’s $2.082 billion in revenue at the end of the June quarter. 
Mint reported on 11 January that HCL Technologies may overtake Wipro in 2018-19. 
In 2012, Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. edged past Infosys Ltd in quarterly revenue. The Teaneck, New Jersey-based company, which has most of its employees in India, finally ended that year with more revenue than Bengaluru-based Infosys."
96,2018-05-05,HCL,"HCL Technologies, for FY19, has guided for 10.5% growth at the mid-end of its guidance range, and has said that about half of this will come from acquisitions and other inorganic activity

Information technology stocks have outperformed the markets this year on the expectation that fiscal year 2019 (FY19) will be far better for the sector compared to the preceding year.  
Information technology stocks have outperformed the markets this year on the expectation that fiscal year 2019 (FY19) will be far better for the sector compared to the preceding year. 
And thanks to the “a rising tide lifts all boats"" principle, even shares of HCL Technologies joined the party. But the company’s March quarter performance and its guidance for FY19 suggests none of this is true in its case.
HCL Technologies had guided for growth of between 10.5% and 12.5% in constant currency terms for the year till March 2018. It managed to reach the lower end of its guidance “huffing and puffing"", as an analyst puts it, “with the help of acquisitions"". In FY19, it has guided for 10.5% growth at the mid-end of its guidance range, and has said that about half of this will come from acquisitions and other inorganic activity. In other words, the organic business will grow by just 5-7%.
It’s little wonder HCL Technologies’ shares fell 4.5% on Wednesday. The company’s guidance somewhat resembles Infosys Ltd’s subdued growth forecast as well.
Even in FY18, a large part of growth came from acquisitions. The core infrastructure management services and application services business, which accounts for around 72% of revenues, reported a sharp drop in growth. 
Anil Chanana, chief financial officer at HCL Technologies, says that the company is helping customers transition to cloud and digital services, which have an initial negative impact on revenues, but result in long-term gains in terms of customer stickiness. 
An analyst at a multinational brokerage firm says that the sluggishness rather reflects underinvestments in digital services. “Companies that were ahead-of-the-curve with investments in new technologies are leading in terms of growth,"" he adds. 
HCL Technologies’ digital, analytics, cloud and cybersecurity practices grew 29.4% last year, higher than the company average. But at less than 15% of overall revenues, it is considerably small to move the needle. The platforms business grew at a rapid pace aided by acquisitions.
According to Chanana, the infrastructure business is placed better than the year earlier. Business and deal momentum is better, although deal sizes have become smaller.
Still, as the proverbial saying goes, the proof of the pudding lies in the eating; investors would do well to wait for concrete signs of a recovery in HCL Technologies’ organic business."
95,2018-05-06,HCL,"Since the start of the year until 12 April, TCS shares gained 16.2%, Infosys 11.8% and HCL 13.5%, while Wipro lost 8.5%

Mumbai/Bengaluru: A less-than bullish commentary by managements of Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, and fewer analyst recommendations for buying their shares, have made many wonder if the current financial year will be better for the industry than the last one.  
Mumbai/Bengaluru: A less-than bullish commentary by managements of Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, and fewer analyst recommendations for buying their shares, have made many wonder if the current financial year will be better for the industry than the last one. 
In January, executives at India’s largest information technology (IT) outsourcing companies had exuded optimism that 2018-19 was going to be a better year. Investors bought into the story as shares of the four largest IT companies outperformed the Sensex until 12 April.
Since the start of the year until 12 April, a day before Infosys declared earnings, TCS shares gained 16.2%, Infosys 11.8% and HCL 13.5%, while Wipro lost 8.5%. During this time, BSE Sensex hardly posted any return, gaining 0.13%. 
However, two months into the current financial year, it appears many of these companies are grappling with unique challenges and that all of them will struggle to improve the growth reported in the last two years.
India’s largest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services Ltd has bucked this trend so far. The Mumbai-based company has been an outlier—its management reaffirmed that it should clock double-digit growth in the current year, leading to more brokerages putting a buy recommendation on the shares after it declared earnings on 19 April.
But fewer analysts are now bullish on Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies (See adjoining table) after the companies declared earnings than at the start of the year.
“Save for TCS, the question to be asked to IT companies is, where is the recovery,"" said the former CEO of one the largest IT firms. “Certainly, the growth outlook is not much better than last year. Even the management commentary is not cheerful as it sounded in January. So, what has really changed in the last four months?""
Infosys reported a 7.2% dollar revenue growth at 24.3% operating margin in the year ended March 2018. For the current year, the company expects to grow its dollar revenue between 7% and 9%, but at a lower operating margins band of between 22% and 24%, prompting some analysts to change their bullish outlook. 
Ditto for Wipro and HCL. 
Two client-related bankruptcies and the company’s planned restructuring in the Middle East and India is taking longer than chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala had anticipated dashed any hopes that Wipro will turn the corner soon. 
Wipro does not give a full-year revenue guidance but expects quarterly revenue to be between a decline of 2% and growth of 0.2% in constant currency terms in the April-June period from the preceding quarter.
HCL Technologies, which reported a 12.4% growth last year, expects to grow its dollar revenue between 10.5% and 12.5% in the current fiscal. However, management expects more than half of this incremental growth to come from acquisitions and because of business brought from the company’s many intellectual property (IP) partnerships.
Worryingly for investors, all these companies are not struggling for revenue growth alone as a few analysts like Keith Bachman of BMO Capital Markets have expressed scepticism on the profitability outlook for them."

Bengaluru: HCL Technologies Ltd’s investors remain nonplussed. Since 1 April till date, shares of HCL Technologies are down 5.21% even as BSE IT index has gained 14.34% while benchmark BSE Sensex has returned 6.82%.
This despite Noida-based HCL Technologies poised to surpass Wipro Ltd to become India’s third-biggest software services provider in the three months to 30 June, marking the first change in the pecking order of the country’s $167 billion information technology (IT) outsourcing industry in six years.
Again, shareholders of billionaire Shiv Nadar-led HCL Technologies appear to have ignored its management’s industry-leading growth outlook. HCL expects to grow its dollar revenue between 10.5% and 12.5% in 2018-19, higher than Infosys’s at-best 9% in the current year. 
Why?
Three reasons explain the disenchantment among HCL’s shareholders.
Firstly, HCL Technologies, which ended with $7.84 billion in revenue last year, is buying growth even as growth in its traditional solution offering business is slowing.
On Wednesday, HCL Technologies said it will spend $35 million to buy a German IT and engineering services provider, H&D International Group, making it the third acquisition in as many months. 
Since April, HCL has spent $359 million to buy three companies which together will bring $392.35 million in incremental revenue or 5% additional growth, according to a Mint analysis. These include $60 million to buy US-based C3i Solutions and $264 million to buy Actian Corp., a Palo Alto-based data analytics firm.
HCL’s management has acknowledged that organic growth will be 6.25% or half of its at-best 12.5% dollar revenue growth in 2018-19. This is lower than the 7.45% organic growth last year when it grew 11.9%. 
“Management has guided for 9.5-11.5% constant currency growth for FY19E (10.5-12.5% in dollar terms). However, inorganic growth accounts for nearly half of this, implying organic growth of only 4.25-6.25%...We factor 5% in FY19E due to concerns on infrastructure services,"" Jefferies analysts Arya Sen and Ranjeet Jaiswal wrote in a note, dated 19 June.
HCL’s acquisition strategy appears to be an extension of the company’s questionable approach of spending $1.1 billion in licensing intellectual properties (IPs) from companies and then building products around them for clients. Mint at the start of the year first did an analysis of HCL’s risky bets in acquiring some of decade-old IPs, such as International Business Machines Corp.’s (IBM’s) Lotus Notes.
Secondly, all the three companies bought by HCL in the last three months have seen revenue remain stagnant or decline in the last three years, making many analysts question the management’s strategy. 
“Does anyone, other than HCL, see any logic in buying H&D or C3i Solutions? It is not that Indian companies are noting investing in digital—Infosys bought Brilliant Basics and Wongdoody and Wipro bought Appirio and Designit,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage, on the condition of anonymity.
Finally, analysts continue to remain unimpressed with the management’s approach to make the company future-proof. HCL claims it is investing in digital, the fuzzy umbrella term which each company uses to classify revenue generated from areas generally classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud computing and Internet of Things.
H&D International is a product engineering firm, offering services to car makers. C3i Solutions is a customer engagement services provider HCL bought from German pharma giant, Merck and Co."

85,2018-07-30,HCL,"For the first time, business growth from managing technology infrastructure of customers was less than half of the overall revenue at both HCL Technologies and Wipro in the past two years

Bengaluru: The rise in cloud computing in the early years of this decade has started hurting the growth of some of the largest software services companies in India, as for the first time, business growth from managing technology infrastructure of customers was less than half of the overall revenue at both HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd in the past two years. 
Bengaluru: The rise in cloud computing in the early years of this decade has started hurting the growth of some of the largest software services companies in India, as for the first time, business growth from managing technology infrastructure of customers was less than half of the overall revenue at both HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd in the past two years.
This development portends an ominous sign for the country’s third and fourth largest software services companies and is in contrast to the performance of market leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), which maintains that it has not seen any cannibalization in revenue as more companies look to migrate workloads to the cloud.
India’s $167 billion software services outsourcing industry generates much of the revenue from deploying software engineers for infrastructure maintenance services, or IMS, or to write and maintain code for applications (application development and maintenance) or even offer customer support (BPO).
Since the turn of the century, the IMS business for most companies has grown on a par with or faster than the company’s overall growth in revenue.
Still, a bigger challenge for some companies such as HCL Technologies is that at least half of the total IMS revenue still comes from legacy work of establishing data centre business, even as most Fortune 1000 companies are looking to replace their own data centres with public cloud services.
HCL Technologies, India’s third-largest software services provider, saw its IMS business grow 10.5% between April-June 2016 and April-June 2018, less than half of the pace of its overall growth, according to an analysis by Mint.
Ditto for Wipro. The Bengaluru-based firm saw its IMS business grow 3%, against overall revenue growth of 6.4% in the same period.
“As most clients embrace cloud, we are seeing some softness in the infra business. About half of our total IMS business is data centre business,"" HCL president and chief executive C. Vijayakumar said in an interview last week.
Both TCS and Infosys, the No. 1 and No. 2 IT services firms, respectively, have stopped disclosing revenue from service offerings, but Mumbai-based TCS maintains that it has historically stayed away from setting up data centres and maintaining only infrastructure needs of its clients.
“If you are in the business of setting up data centres and leveraging your balance sheet, then yes, when customers move to cloud, you’ll be affected,"" TCS’s chief operating officer N. Ganapathy Subramaniam said earlier this month.
“As long as you are not in the capex-driven business of data centres, it is actually a huge uptick and not cannibalization,"" said Subramaniam. TCS, he said, has “generally stayed away from capital-intensive data centre business and our business through this is very, very small"". 
“We don’t go and leverage our balance sheet to set up huge data centres. So when you are moving applications into the cloud, that whole application transformation, migration, building applications around it, is an add-on business,"" said Subramaniam.
An analyst at a Mumbai-based brokerage said “cloud is clearly impacting overall growth and this can be seen from weak organic growth for these companies"".
“There is more pain for the companies as overall digital revenue is still less than a third, while the business from data centres remains vulnerable,"" said the analyst, who declined to be named.
The rise of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud computing unit of Amazon.com Inc., and Microsoft Azure has led to most Fortune 1000 companies looking to move applications from servers stationed traditionally in their offices to a cloud computing platform. This has made most Indian firms stitch partnerships with these public cloud computing firms, but at the expense of letting go of money earned by offering thousands of engineers to work from a central facility that houses thousands of computers, which in turn was set up by software services companies.
Consequently, cloud computing firms are witnessing scorching growth: 12 years after it was founded in 2006, AWS is already bigger than India’s largest software services company, TCS, as AWS’s revenue totalled $21 billion (on trailing 12 months basis)."

The company is also carrying out a mega recruitment drive at its Noida campus on 4-5 August under the programme. This will be open to Delhi-NCR residents only.
Under the programme, HCL Technologies will offer employment opportunities to engineering and non-engineering graduates as well Class XII passouts.
“Fresher candidates who meet the eligibility criteria will undergo fee-based training (ranging between Rs1-2.5 lakhs) on technical skills and post completion of training, they will be absorbed in HCL Technologies,"" Gupta said.
This training will be provided by HCL Training and Staffing Services (HCL TSS), a subsidiary of HCL Technologies. Selected candidates will work across application development, testing, IT maintenance and support."

New Delhi: Hindustan Copper Ltd (HCL) will spend Rs5,500 crore over 6 years to expand its production capacity by six times to up to 20 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), a top official of the company said on Thursday. 
New Delhi: Hindustan Copper Ltd (HCL) will spend Rs5,500 crore over 6 years to expand its production capacity by six times to up to 20 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), a top official of the company said on Thursday.
HCL has “very ambitious"" expansion plans, the company’s CMD Santosh Sharma told reporters here. “We have been working till date with a target of expanding to 12.4 million tonnes of copper ore production per annum. Now we have set our revised target at 20 million tonnes (MT),"" he said.
The Cabinet had yesterday approved a fresh equity issue of 15% by HCL which will help the state-run company raise over Rs900 crore. Sharma said the company is aiming to enhance its capacity six times from present 3.6 MTPA to 20 MT by 2023-24. 
“The Capex requirement for the mine expansion plan is Rs5,500 crore which is spread over next six years,"" he said. 
Last year, HCL’s capex was close to  ₹ 600 crore. Right now the company is catering to around five per cent of domestic copper demand and aspires to take it to the level of 30% and it has reviewed its expansion plan, Sharma said.
“We have come to conclusion that we can grow up to 20 million tonne by 2023-2024 and for that we have already chalked out action plan and we will be working on that action plan. This will be supported by our exploration activities also,"" he added.
The company has a very ambitious target, the CMD said, adding that funding was not an issue for the expansion. It will fund the capital expenditure through internal accruals, equity (QIP), and debt in a phased manner. 
Giving the break up, he said that funds from the internal accrual may be to the tune of  ₹ 300-500 crore per year within the span of six years. With regard to equity he said it will depend on its requirement.
“Debt also (will be) 1:2. The debt equity ratio in the mining company is 1:2 so in that ratio we will relate,"" he added. 
Besides, the company said that it will also spend Rs175 crore for exploration activities spread over three years. It will issue 13.87 crore fresh equity shares, to the extent of 15%, which will bring down government stake in the PSU to 66.13%, an official statement had said.
The government holds 76.05% stake in the PSU at present. At the current market price, issuance of 15% fresh equity would garner Rs900.6 crore to the company.
“HCL will use the proceeds of Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) to meet its expansion/capex plan which would create employment opportunities for 9,300 persons approximately,"" the statement had said.
Expansion projects of HCL are located in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jharkhand. Hindustan Copper, a vertically integrated copper producer, is primarily engaged in business of mining and processing of copper ore to produce refined copper metal."

81,2018-09-12,HCL,"The turnaround in the pace of hiring at TCS, Infosys, Cognizant, Wipro and HCL Technologies in the June quarter follows a year of tepid employee additions

New Delhi: The top five software services providers operating in India added 24,047 people in the first quarter of this fiscal, compared with the 13,772 net additions in the previous fiscal, leading many experts to believe that the industry is set to record the fastest growth in three years. The turnaround in the pace of hiring at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd in the June quarter follows a year of tepid employee additions, the slowest pace since the offshore outsourcing boom started at the turn of the century. 
New Delhi: The top five software services providers operating in India added 24,047 people in the first quarter of this fiscal, compared with the 13,772 net additions in the previous fiscal, leading many experts to believe that the industry is set to record the fastest growth in three years. The turnaround in the pace of hiring at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd in the June quarter follows a year of tepid employee additions, the slowest pace since the offshore outsourcing boom started at the turn of the century.
Analysts attribute the reversal of fortunes for the sector to three reasons. First, companies are looking to spend more on outsourcing technology work. Second, Fortune 1000 companies are using data analytics platforms offered by information technology (IT) vendors to run their business better. This, in turn, is translating into more work for the outsourcing companies, for now. And third, companies are increasing their spending on digital technologies. The increased spending has led to more contracts valued at over $1 billion.
For instance, Mumbai-based TCS has won three mega deals since December, bringing in a combined $5.6 billion in revenue. Last week, Bengaluru-based Wipro won its largest contract valued at $1.6 billion.
“The early legs of any transformation are always challenging, and this we have seen in the last two years when all companies struggled for growth,"" an executive at Cognizant said on condition of anonymity. “For all the five companies, digital is now a fourth of total revenue. So, without getting into the debate of digital definition, the heartening thing is that quality of revenue is only improving.""
Although all IT firms are moving away from a people-led model to a platform-based business approach, hiring by the largest IT firms continues to be a dominant indicator of their prospects. The five firms together employed 1.17 million at the end of the June quarter.
“Growth is back,"" a senior executive at TCS said on condition of anonymity. “Companies were always spending more on digital in the past. But now, what we are seeing is that if the traditional business can be done efficiently and if you have solution offerings like data analytics and AI (artificial intelligence) platforms, you will be able to differentiate from others.""
“To us (TCS), the question of digital offsetting the loss in traditional is not relevant because there is enough and more work available and hiring is just one indicator,"" said the executive cited above.
The June quarter net additions of the five firms is the highest in at least two years. They added 26,565 people to their workforce in the three months ended 30 June 2016. 
Although TCS does not provide a growth outlook, it is expected to cross 10% growth this fiscal. It managed an 8.6% dollar revenue growth to end last year with $19.09 billion in revenue. Ditto for Wipro, which ended last year with $8.06 billion in revenue. It expects to get at least $80 million or 1% growth this fiscal from the $1.6 billion contract.
“I’m not sure with this ‘little upswing’ we are seeing but the mood is definitely more bullish over the last couple of months,"" said Phil Fersht, chief executive officer of US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing research firm. His caution finds support from some industry executives.
“The biggest downside risk to this growth story is the uncertainty in the many of the first-of-its kind of projects,"" said the Cognizant executive cited before. “The work in areas like IP (intellectual property) platforms runs the risk of IP infringement cases. You are offering data analytics solutions when debate on data privacy is gaining traction. The promised benefits from automation will be tested. So, any incidental issue and this can blow up, making many clients hold back on spending in these areas."""
80,2018-09-14,HCL,"Among IT stocks, TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra are up 20-53%, while Wipro is up 3%

Technology stocks have raced ahead of benchmark indices in 2018 after lagging them last year, as the Indian rupee weakens and the economic engines in the West roar back to life. An economic boom in developed nations implies greater outsourcing business for India’s information technology (IT) companies. Also, since these companies earn mostly in dollars, a weak rupee means greater revenues. The US economy grew 4.2% in the second quarter, while jobless claims hit a 49-year-low last week. Meanwhile, the rupee has slipped 11.51% against the dollar in 2018, touching a record low of 72.92 on Wednesday. 
Technology stocks have raced ahead of benchmark indices in 2018 after lagging them last year, as the Indian rupee weakens and the economic engines in the West roar back to life. An economic boom in developed nations implies greater outsourcing business for India’s information technology (IT) companies. Also, since these companies earn mostly in dollars, a weak rupee means greater revenues. The US economy grew 4.2% in the second quarter, while jobless claims hit a 49-year-low last week. Meanwhile, the rupee has slipped 11.51% against the dollar in 2018, touching a record low of 72.92 on Wednesday.
In the year so far, the BSE IT index has gained nearly 40%, outpacing gains in the benchmark Sensex index which has gained around 10%. In 2017, even as the Sensex rose 27.91%, the BSE IT index gained only 10.83%, as revenues grew slower at large IT services companies. This is the best performance of the BSE IT index in the last five years. In 2016, it had slipped 8%, gained 4.26% in 2015, was up 17.6% in 2014 and jumped 55.24% in 2013.
According to Arun Thukral, MD & CEO of Axis Securities, the improving US economy has changed sentiments toward IT sector, which draws a large chunk of its business from the US. “Better profitability of US companies (a part of which could come from tax cuts) would mean better business prospects for Indian IT services. Similarly, Europe is also limping back to stability following the economic revival of the financial crisis-hit peripheral economies. This improvement in the business prospects of Indian IT companies has led to the re-rating of the IT sector in general,"" he added.
Among IT stocks, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd are up 20-53% while Wipro Ltd is up 3%. 
Thukral believes Indian IT firms have witnessed a revival of growth on the back of increased technology investments from clients in the US and Europe. “But these investments are in newer areas such as digital and cloud at the cost of traditional outsourcing, where budgets are shrinking. Hence, we like Indian IT companies who are increasing their revenue share from digital and cloud business,"" he added.
According to a Kotak Institutional Equities note dated 10 September, a 1% rupee depreciation aids earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin of IT firms by 20-30 basis points (bps) and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) by 2-3%. It has upgraded FY2019-21 earnings per share (EPS) by 0-7% but slashed its US dollar revenue growth assumptions due to cross-currency headwinds, stating FY2019 EPS will be influenced by hedges, and all companies will receive an earnings boost in the subsequent year. 
According to Kotak, even though the rupee has weakened, its impact on immediate earnings will be decided by hedging. Kotak said Infosys has minuscule cash flow hedges of $300 million; TCS hedges but through options, meaning it will realize the benefit of rupee depreciation unless the company has entered into range barrier options with the rupee depreciating beyond the range; Mindtree hedges only the monetary assets and does not have any cash flow hedges; and Tech Mahindra has hedged 70-90% of net cash inflow over the next 12-months. Wipro, HCL Technologies, Mphasis and Hexaware, it said, have hedged aggressively. “Infosys, TCS and Mindtree do not have meaningful cash flow hedges and will benefit immediately from Indian rupee depreciation,"" the Kotak note said. 
According to a Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd report, a weak rupee boosts net profits and operating margins of the entire IT sector; however, the impact on individual company earnings will be determined by three aspects -- the share of dollar revenue among all currencies; the extent of onsite-offshore revenue mix that will determine the net exposure after natural hedge; and the hedging policy in terms of duration and proportion of the net exposures hedged.
However, it added that had the rupee weakened similarly against all currencies, the impact would have been felt on the majority of the revenues. In the calendar year so far, the rupee has fallen 11.51% against the dollar, 8.03% against the pound and only 8.27% against the euro. 
“Bottoming cyclical pressures and improved capital allocation are factors that will feed into the valuation multiples favourably. Currency keeps earnings growth ticking further,"" Motilal said in its note on 10 September. 
However, Nomura said Indian Tier 1 IT valuations are at a 20% premium to that of multinational corporations (MNCs) and 15-25% discount to Tier 2 IT and challengers. “Indian Tier-1 IT, after progressively showing lower market share gains over the past three years, has lost market share to MNCs. Also, FY19 guidance suggests a weaker year, with Cognizant and HCL Tech guiding for slower organic growth in FY19 versus FY18, Infosys likely to grow near the lower end of guidance (similar to FY18) and Wipro expected to grow low-single digits for FY19, on our estimates. The only exception is TCS, where we expect growth to accelerate in FY19,"" it said in a note on 6 September."
79,2018-10-09,HCL,"Accenture added $4.72 billion in incremental revenue in the financial year ended August 2018, a shade lower than the combined $4.78 billion new revenue of TCS, Cognizant, Infosys, Wipro and HCL Tech

New Delhi: Accenture Plc reported 13.5% growth and added $4.72 billion in incremental revenue in the financial year ended August 2018, a shade lower than the combined $4.78 billion new revenue of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp, Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd. 
New Delhi: Accenture Plc reported 13.5% growth and added $4.72 billion in incremental revenue in the financial year ended August 2018, a shade lower than the combined $4.78 billion new revenue of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp, Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd.
Accenture’s scorching growth pace was underpinned by the firm’s aggressive acquisition strategy and the firm generating more business from technology areas that are seeing faster growth: digital, the fuzzy umbrella term which each company uses to classify revenue generated from areas generally classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud computing and Internet of Things.
Accenture claims that its new business, which comprises digital, cloud computing and cyber security, totalled $23 billion, or about 60% of its full-year revenue. Along with its strong consulting practice, Accenture managed to end the year with $39.57 billion in revenue.
Homegrown IT firms, for now, say that digital accounts for between 22% and 25% of their business.
Last year, Accenture spent $660 million in buying companies, less than the $1.8 billion it spent to buy companies in 2016-17. However, Accenture has again upped its acquisition spend in 2018-19.
“This year, we would expect to spend up to $1.5 billion, consistent with our capital allocation strategy. As always, given the right opportunities and the right circumstances, we could certainly spend more than that,"" Accenture’s Chief Financial Officer David Rowland told analysts after the company declared its earnings.
Accenture added 34,309 employees last year to take its total workforce to 459,178 people. Cognizant and the four big Indian IT firms added only 13,772 employees in 2017-18.
“We believe Accenture’s execution is best in class among IT service providers in our coverage. We think digital will continue to help drive strong revenue growth with slow and steady margin expansion over time,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 27 September.
Accenture firm follows a September-August financial year. Indian IT firms follow an April-March financial year while Nasdaq-listed Cognizant follows a January-December financial year.
Over the past three years, Accenture has spent $3.4 billion to buy 70 companies, considerably more than the $1.58 billion spent by TCS, Infosys and Wipro put together, since 1 April 2014.
Only twice earlier have two companies added more than $2 billion in new business in a year, according to a Mint analysis. In 2015, Cognizant had added $2.15 billion in incremental revenue, while Mumbai-based TCS added $2 billion in new business in the year ended March 2015.
In July, Mint reported that Accenture was on its way to script history by adding incremental revenue that would be about the new revenue generated by the five firms together. Save for Noida-based HCL Technologies, all IT companies reported single-digit growth in the year ended March 2018.
Still, homegrown IT firms expect better growth in the current financial year. TCS does not issue annual or quarterly guidance, but the management expects to report double-digit growth in the current financial year. Hiring for all the firms has also seen encouraging signs, as the top five software services providers operating in India added 24,047 people in the first quarter of this financial year, compared with the 13,772 net additions in the previous year, leading many experts to believe that the industry is set to record its fastest growth in three years."

77,2018-10-24,HCL,"HCL Technologies is exuding optimism about revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal, but it remains to be seen how much that helps in narrowing the valuation gap with TCS and Infosys

One reason why HCL Technologies Ltd remained on the investor radar, despite delivering subdued quarterly performances in the recent past, is its valuation discount vis-à-vis larger peers Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd. At around 13 times current fiscal earnings estimates, the stock is trading at a considerable discount to the 23 times earnings of TCS and Infosys’s 18 times earnings. The valuation discount reflects subdued expectations and the Q2 results may not alter this in a major way. 
One reason why HCL Technologies Ltd remained on the investor radar, despite delivering subdued quarterly performances in the recent past, is its valuation discount vis-à-vis larger peers Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd. At around 13 times current fiscal earnings estimates, the stock is trading at a considerable discount to the 23 times earnings of TCS and Infosys’s 18 times earnings. The valuation discount reflects subdued expectations and the Q2 results may not alter this in a major way.
The results do show an improvement in growth but only incrementally. From a year ago, revenues in constant currency terms increased 10.5% compared to 8-8.5% in the earlier two quarters. On a sequential basis, they are up 3%, largely in line with Street expectations. Profitability has improved.
Importantly, the management expects revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year to be better than what the company delivered in the first half, helping it achieve the mid-point of its objective of 10.5% constant currency growth for the full year. Deal momentum remains healthy.
The commentary is encouraging. The question, however is, will it help narrow the valuation gap with its larger peers? There is some scepticism about that.
What set TCS apart, accelerating gains in its stock, is a broad-based recovery. HCL Tech has seen incremental improvement in growth rates at key service segments. But much of the growth came from the engineering and R&D and business services, which generate less than 30% of revenues.
Growth at the application and infrastructure services businesses, which generate 70% of HCL Tech’s revenues, remains sub-par. Revenues at the application services business (which generates more than a third of revenues) are up just 1.8%. The management attributed the subdued growth to client-specific issues.
That said, HCL Tech’s Q2 results shows a notable improvement in the infrastructure services business—it grew 4.4% compared to 2% in the first quarter. The management sees a healthy outlook for this segment, which adds credence to a better second half vis-à-vis the first half of the fiscal year. It also expects the momentum in the engineering and R&D and business services continuing, which should aid growth.
The question is how much growth acceleration the company can see in the second half of the year. The Q2 results show incremental improvement in growth rates, widely expected by the market. But it is not yet clear if growth will exceed the previous year’s level, which is crucial for the stock re-rating. The third quarter results should provide more cues."

New Delhi: The planned rollout of 5G or fifth-generation wireless technology by telecom companies globally offers at least $10 billion business over the next six years for India’s information technology (IT) services companies, according to a Mumbai-based brokerage firm. This new technology spend by telecom firms on software and services could bring over $1.1 billion in incremental revenue over the next three years for country’s five largest companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd. 
New Delhi: The planned rollout of 5G or fifth-generation wireless technology by telecom companies globally offers at least $10 billion business over the next six years for India’s information technology (IT) services companies, according to a Mumbai-based brokerage firm. This new technology spend by telecom firms on software and services could bring over $1.1 billion in incremental revenue over the next three years for country’s five largest companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd.
This development is significant as telecom firms over the last two years had held back their spend on technology, leading to tepid growth at telecom verticals for all IT firms. A new gusher of money should further boost growth for the five largest IT firms, which share among themselves about 30% of homegrown IT companies’ business from telecom companies. 
“The impending rollout of 5G networks by telecom service providers (TSPs) globally could translate to a USD 10bn incremental market opportunity – implying a 1 ppt addition to the overall industry CAGR – over 2019-25 for the Indian IT companies, on our conservative estimates,"" Pankaj Kapoor, director of India IT services and software equity research at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, wrote in a note dated 29 October.
Homegrown IT firms got $5.4 in business during 2014-16 when telecom companies set up the 4G infrastructure and Kapoor of JM Financial estimates a higher spend of over $10 billion, although over a much longer period of six years.
The world’s largest telecom firms are looking to give a face-lift to the current 4G infrastructure as newer technologies allow them to send billions of bits of data a second, higher than the current hundreds of millions of bits of data. This, in addition to letting a consumer download a movie in seconds, also allows autonomous cars and industrial equipment to work better as they need this network of ultra-fast speeds for relaying data sets.
For now, executives at some of the largest IT firms remain optimistic on the new technology spend and maintain that much of the incremental revenue will come in from the second half of the next financial year. 
A big reason behind the optimism of Indian IT companies from this rollout of 5G infrastructure by telecom firms are some of the recent mega-IT contracts awarded to set up hardware. In July, US-based T-Mobile awarded a $3.5 billion contract to Nokia to supply 5G network gear. This was followed by T-Mobile awarding another $3.5 billion contract to Ericsson in September, under which Ericsson will offer both hardware and software to the US telecom major.
“All telecom firms first set up the hardware and software and then work for the services needed to run them. Now the contracts may not be this large but then with newer technologies needed for 5G, many of us (Indian IT firms) have the chance to offer IoT (Internet of Things) platforms, data analytics solutions and other work as part of managing the network,"" said an executive at Mumbai-based TCS. The executive did not want to be named as he is not authorized to talk to the media. 
“Recent commentaries by major operators indicate selective commercial launches could start as early as 2019, though a wider global coverage is likely to be spread over 2020-22… The biggest commercial use-case of 5G is likely to be around narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) that could open an additional market for Indian ER&D/IT services players. While the timing of project flows is difficult to predict, conservatively, we see a meaningful financial impact of 5G on Indian IT companies only from 2HFY20,"" wrote Kapoor in the note."

Managers of BSE’s Sensex are reversing a portfolio decision they made 15 years ago. Back in November 2003, HCL Technologies Ltd was excluded from the index and replaced by Wipro Ltd. The positions are now being swapped, with Wipro getting the boot, and HCL Tech being welcomed into the index of 30 large-cap stocks. 
Managers of BSE’s Sensex are reversing a portfolio decision they made 15 years ago. Back in November 2003, HCL Technologies Ltd was excluded from the index and replaced by Wipro Ltd. The positions are now being swapped, with Wipro getting the boot, and HCL Tech being welcomed into the index of 30 large-cap stocks.
How has the long Wipro short HCL Tech position done in the past 15 years? Terribly, considering that HCL Tech shares have rallied by 17 times during this period, while those of Wipro have risen only four times. Even without considering a short position on HCL Tech, a decision to buy Wipro would have resulted in huge losses on a relative basis.
This column has pointed out earlier that stocks that are discarded from Sensex and Nifty deliver far greater returns compared to those that are added to the index. That’s because managers of these indices follow a so-called momentum style of investing, where stocks that have done well in the recent past are included in the index, while laggards are dropped. As a result, the additions are coming in at relatively higher valuations, while the discards may well be good value picks.
Undoubtedly, this contrarian investment strategy would have resulted in huge gains, in the case of a long HCL Tech short Wipro position 15 years ago. By that logic, does it make sense to now buy Wipro and sell HCL Tech? Hardly anyone is betting on that—Wipro continues to struggle for growth, and brokerage firms such as Kotak and Nomura continue to prefer HCL Tech over Wipro even now. But given how the above-mentioned contrarian indicator has done in the past, who knows what lies ahead in the next 15 years."

Mumbai: Investors in the Shiv Nadar-controlled fourth-largest Indian IT services provider, HCL Technologies Ltd, were not enthused with its Friday announcement that HCL Tech will buy select IBM software products for $1.8 billion. HCL Tech shares fell as much as 7.60%, on a day the BSE IT Index traded lower and Sensex was higher. 
Mumbai: Investors in the Shiv Nadar-controlled fourth-largest Indian IT services provider, HCL Technologies Ltd, were not enthused with its Friday announcement that HCL Tech will buy select IBM software products for $1.8 billion. HCL Tech shares fell as much as 7.60%, on a day the BSE IT Index traded lower and Sensex was higher.
The HCL-IBM deal, which accounts for nearly 22% of HCL Tech’s annualized revenue, is expected to close by mid-2019, subject to completion of applicable regulatory reviews. It is also the largest acquisition by any Indian IT services provider till date. Tech Mahindra Ltd acquired Satyam Computer Services for $1.23 billion in March 2012 while HCL Technologies bought the Axon Group for $731 million (Infosys was in the race but had made a lower bid at $678 million).
Both companies appear to have struck this deal in a bid to focus on their core strategies. On its part, HCL wants to sharpen its focus on its “products and platforms"" business, which accounted for $250 million of its revenue in the September quarter, in a bid to grow its intellectual property (IP) business.
On the other hand, the deal follows International Business Machines Corp.’s (IBM’s) attempt to make a dent in the open source hybrid cloud market. It was only a couple of months back that the Big Blue agreed to buy open source cloud services provider Red Hat Inc. for $33 billion.
ALSO READ | Why does Big Blue really want a Red Hat?
HCL and IBM have an ongoing intellectual property (IP) partnership for five of the products in the deal announced on Friday. The software cumulatively represent a total addressable market of more than $50 billion.
According to HCL Technologies CEO C. Vijayakumar, HCL is acquiring these products that are in “large growing market areas like security, marketing and commerce, which are strategic segments for HCL... In addition, we see tremendous potential for creating compelling ‘as-a-service’ offerings by combining these products with our Mode-1 and Mode-2 services"".
HCL’s so-called Mode 1 refers to its application, development and maintenance (ADM) and infrastructure services. Mode 2 refers to its growth businesses that are oriented towards digital technology, such as mobility, Internet of Things (IoT), automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
DRYiCE, for instance, is a division of HCL Technologies that is focused on building AI-powered “products and platforms"" for the digital world. HCL Tech’s Mode 3 refers to the “products and platforms"" business, which has more IP-based solutions that provide higher margins, are better for business and provide longer-term engagements.
However, HCL Tech’s decision to acquire software from IBM as part of its attempt to be IP-driven and drive growth on back of it may be “good in theory, and the bold move is a step in the right direction, but the ground reality is that these products come with a ton of baggage that can potentially throw a spanner in the works"", according to Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst, founder and CEO of Greyhound Research, a market research and analysis firm.
Gogia argues that most of the products in the HCL-IBM deal have been sold “as part of a large Strategic Outsourcing or a Managed Services deal and not as independent products"". This implies that so far these products “have been sold on back of the solid relationship with IBM, existing services contracts and most importantly, the ability to covert CAPEX (capital expenditure) to OPEX (operating expenditure) thanks to IBM’s financing arm"".
“When sold independently, HCL Technologies will need to add ammunition in terms of integrations with other key third-party providers, soft licensing measures, the ability for these products to work across multiple cloud providers and most of all, the arms and legs to allow for easy deployment and ongoing management,"" says Gogia. He believes “HCL Tech can turn the deal in its favour if it offers concrete guidance on its commitment to code and R&D overall"".
HCL Technologies, on its part, believes that the addition of a customer base of about 5,000 clients to its existing repertoire will help it make the deal enhance its existing business. The company is also expecting that the deal will add $650 million annually to its existing business ($625 million in the first year of completion).

HCL Technologies Ltd’s $1.8-billion acquisition of some software products from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), touted to be its biggest ever, met with much scepticism. The stock has lost 5% since it announced the acquisition last week. 
HCL Technologies Ltd’s $1.8-billion acquisition of some software products from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), touted to be its biggest ever, met with much scepticism. The stock has lost 5% since it announced the acquisition last week.
The firm’s argument is that the acquisition will give a leg-up to its products and platforms business, and the share of this segment will rise from 12% of revenues to 17%. HCL Tech aims to leverage the market access provided by these products to cross-sell its existing services, benefiting in the process. Still, everybody is not convinced.
Some of the products being acquired are seen to be mature technologies with a declining market share. “The company has not provided individual product revenue contribution. Concentration of revenues in favour of legacy products could be a risk to overall growth of the portfolio,"" analysts at Nomura said in a note.
Investors also have questions about HCL Tech’s ability to scale up the products business. Being a software services company, it has limited capability in product sales. True, the IBM deal gives it headway. But HCL Tech will have to market the product and build a sales team, which is easier said than done. “(HCL’s) the capabilities for product sales are untested and HCL will be handicapped in tapping new clientele in competition with entrenched software vendors,"" add analysts at Nomura Research.
HCL Tech may step up investments in sales and brand development. But this can raise costs and weigh on profitability. Further, post the large payout for the acquisition, cash levels at the company will reduce considerably, limiting the scope for tactical investments in future. Maintaining its dividend payout ratio could also become a challenge if operating cash flows decrease or capex rises from current levels.
While the concerns are expected to weigh on stock performance, much depends on execution. If HCL Tech succeeds in product platform investments, then the company can emerge as end-to-end solutions provider, point out analysts at Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd. The reaction of the stock, however, shows that not everyone agrees."

69,2019-01-21,HCL,"The first elephant is the turmoil in the US equity markets, which indicates the end of a long expansion 

Information technology (IT) analysts are largely a happy bunch. Their primary arguments for an overall rosy macro outlook include comments that there appear to be no headwinds seen on clients’ IT budgets because of the deal renewal cycles as well as the fact that digital spending is now becoming “non-discretionary"". The latter supposedly means that IT departments at client firms that outsource to service providers have no choice but to spend large amounts on digital projects.
Early last year in this column, I predicted that IT services firms would have a good 2018, primarily because of large deals being recycled out into the market, and because of early “digital"" efforts made by clients now moving into the mainstream. The first phenomenon is a cyclical one, and it appears as if the effect of the expansion caused by deal renewals will continue into 2019.
As the spending on digital goes from the ideation stage (where Indian IT services firms have a lacklustre presence) to the execution stage, which allows them to compete on a level playing field with others, Indian players are seen benefiting from clients’ budgets. The other macro shift that worked in favour of Indian service providers in 2018 was the fall in the value of the rupee vis-à-vis the dollar.
While the positive impacts are clear, each enterprise has had firm-specific factors affecting performance. And so, much of the commentary this quarter has started to focus on the relative differences among firms. Analysts seem to favour stocks such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd and Infosys Ltd, while being lukewarm towards others.
There is also speculation about probable consolidation among mid-cap providers, especially where existing investors, such as private equity firms or large single investors, look to monetize their stake through exits and forced mergers. The promoter equity at these firms is now dwarfed by the private equity stake, and investors will have to look to moves by private equity firms as a leading indicator of stock price performance.
Last week, Mint carried an article about moves by Baring PE Asia, KKR and Café Coffee Day’s V.G. Siddhartha, which could massively impact at least a couple of mid-cap providers that are already billion-dollar revenue bracket firms.
The rest of the analysis seems to focus on the expected spending from the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector, the largest sector from a revenue perspective for almost all Indian IT services firms. This analysis focuses on two vectors.
The first vector is on the interplay between insourcing of work through the BFSI sector’s India-based in-house delivery centres and outsourcing of work to IT services firms.
The second vector is on the apparent spending pattern within BFSI, which is seeing cautious expansion into digital running alongside continued spending on older systems.
Such fine splitting of hairs while analysing recent results and near-term forecasts is but to be expected in a sector that has grown mature, and by some accounts, past its “use by"" date. In my opinion, however, most analysts seem to have completely missed three elephants in the room.
The first elephant is the turmoil in the US equity markets, which indicates the end of a long expansion and the possible start of economic contraction in that market. This contraction is based on fears of a “bull in a China shop"" (quite literally) attitude toward US trade with China, increasing rhetoric around US trade wars and slowing growth in both China and Europe.
After a decade of growth, many investors are worried that a contraction is near, and December’s jitters on the heels of a threatened fifth raise of interest rates by America’s Federal Reserve was only a preview. Markets in the US have calmed over the past few days and US stocks have seen a rebound, but only because another interest rate action by the Fed now seems less likely, after the Federal Reserve officials repeatedly assured investors that they were sensitive to concerns about the economy and would be flexible and patient with further interest rate hikes. However, many factors behind last year’s alarming and precipitous drop loom in the shadows.
IT analysts also seem blind to two other pachyderms: political upheaval in both the US and in the UK, still two of the largest markets for Indian IT. The first is the ongoing battle between US President Donald Trump and those who oppose his border wall proposal and the latter is the complete chaos on Brexit.
The US is now well into its longest government shutdown, with Trump and opposition Democrats casting blame for the deadlock on each other. Whoever is to blame, there is no doubt at all that the shutdown will exact a massive price on the US economy; the shutdown’s total costs will far outweigh the $5.7 billion for the wall that Trump and the Democrats are quarrelling about. According to Standard & Poor’s, the last time the US government shut down for 16 days in 2013, the economy took a $24 billion hit. This shutdown is 31 days old and counting.

HCL Technologies Ltd on Tuesday reported a 4.9% sequential increase in its dollar revenue for the October-December quarter, the fastest among the large companies in India’s $167 billion information technology (IT) outsourcing sector.
HCL Tech’s dollar revenue improved sequentially to $2.2 billion in the quarter, while revenue grew 10.8% year-on-year (y-o-y).
In constant currency terms, the company’s revenue rose 5.6% on a sequential basis.
Net profit was at $364 million in the December quarter when compared with $357 million in the September quarter.
However, its operating margin fell 30 basis points from 19.9% to 19.6% in the quarter under consideration, on account of rising wages. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
A Bloomberg survey of 29 analysts had forecast revenue of $2.18 billion, or  ₹15,514.1 crore, besides profit of $357.54 million, or  ₹2,541 crore, for the December quarter.
Noida-based HCL Tech’s performance in the October-December quarter was better than its Bengaluru-based rivals, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd, which reported 2.2% and 1.8% sequential dollar revenue growth, respectively. Mumbai-based Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, which does more business than Infosys and Wipro put together, reported 0.67% growth.
For now, HCL Tech’s growth continues to be driven by higher business from its infrastructure management services unit, besides revenue from its acquisition strategy.
HCL Tech expects its full-year revenue for 2018-19 to grow at the upper-end of its guidance of 9.5-11.5%. Mumbai-based TCS, which does not provide a growth outlook, is expected to grow over 11%, while Infosys expects at-best 9% growth.
Industry body Nasscom expects revenue for the industry to grow between 7% and 9% in constant currency terms.
“I’m very happy with the outstanding performance delivered by us during this quarter,"" said HCL Technologies chief executive officer C. Vijayakumar.
“For now, we see healthy demand and we don’t see any impact on our client spends from either the continued shutdown in the US or any macroeconomic slowdown.""

Shares of HCL Technologies Ltd have underperformed the Nifty IT index by more than 17% in the past year. However, the December quarter results released after the market hours should help the stock gain some momentum.
Revenues in constant currency terms increased 5.6% on a sequential basis. Organic growth or revenues excluding the contribution from acquisitions stood at 4.4%, notably higher than the Street’s estimates.
But on the flip side, HCL Tech reported a 30 basis point contraction in profit margins to 19.6%. While analysts were expecting an improvement, it must be noted that most large IT companies saw moderation of profitability in the December quarter, reflecting the general rise in employee costs.
Importantly, the company now says it is confident of growing at the higher end of its 9.5-11.5% revenue growth guidance in constant currency terms. Earlier, it was expecting to meet the mid-point of the growth guidance. The upward revision in growth expectations reflects strong execution and order bookings.
Revenue contribution from top five clients increased from 15.8% in the year-ago quarter to 17.4% last quarter, reflecting revenue accretion from recent large order wins.
The infrastructure services vertical, which generates 36% of HCL Tech’s revenues, grew 16.5% from a year ago. In the earlier two quarters, the segment clocked a growth rate of 2-4%. Growth at the application services business, which generates one-third of total revenues, improved, though the rates were below the company averages.
Among the business verticals, the financial services and manufacturing segments continue to lag. But the management expects the performance to improve this calendar year on the back of strong deal wins. The company did not share the quantum of deal wins in value terms, stating instead that it had another quarter of “record"" order bookings.
Prateek Aggarwal, chief financial officer, said the company has seen strong double-digit growth in order bookings. This should not only help HCL Tech register healthy performance in the current quarter (Q4), but places it well for FY20 as well.
The performance and the commentary should aid the HCL Tech stock, which is trading at a notable discount to larger peers. Over the last year, the stock underperformed the Nifty IT index as the company embarked on intellectual property (IP)-driven investments.
Concerns about the efficacy of IP-related investments and their possible impact on margins contributed to the stock’s underperformance. HCL Tech now plans to focus on execution and is not aggressively looking at such investments. While the commentary and the performance should aid the stock, investors should also keep an eye on the margin trajectory."

63,2019-01-31,HCL,"HCL Tech expects to garner $625 mn in incremental revenue in 12 months after completion of the dealThe Indian IT firm will now recognize amortization and depreciation costs at a fixed rate over time

NEW DELHI :
HCL Technologies Ltd has clarified that its $1.8 billion acquisition to buy eight software products from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) announced last month will have an operating margin of 30%, higher than the 19.6% profitability in the services business at India’s third-largest information technology (IT) services company.
Noida-based HCL Technologies will also recognize amortization and depreciation costs at a fixed rate over time, rather than its earlier approach of booking such expenses based on the revenue it generated.
“Directionally, we believe it’s (amortization costs) still not final. (And) we are still working through some details. But it will be like any other software acquisition. Our expectation is that amortization will be around 20% of the revenue,"" HCL Tech chief executive officer (CEO) C. Vijayakumar said in an interview on Tuesday.
An amortization of 20% of revenue implies that HCL Tech, which in December had outlined an annual 50% EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin from the acquisition, will operate its product business at a 30% operating margin. It expects to close the acquisition by June 2019.
“It (amortization costs) is most likely to be a straight-line method,"" said Vijayakumar, who took over as CEO in October 2016. HCL Tech expects the eight software products, such as IBM Notes, Domino and Appscan, to help it garner $625 million in incremental revenue in the 12 months after the completion of the deal.
Vijayakumar did not share the revenue numbers from each of the eight products, few of which are considered by analysts as matured and legacy products not seeing much growth.
“(IBM) Lotus Notes has got two components. There is Domino, which is a development platform, the adoption of which is very high. Traditionally, IBM didn’t spend time to modernize it. In the last one year, we have modernized the whole Domino platform. So the adoption rate of Domino is very high. Notes adoption may not be very high and may decline. (But) the whole strategy is around Domino,"" said Vijayakumar.
HCL Tech’s explanation is significant for it assuages some of the concerns of the analysts who, until now, were not certain about the profitability of these products. The company’s earlier approach of recognizing amortization and depreciation costs based on the revenue it generated had made a few analysts queasy.
They were unhappy because HCL Tech appeared to be boosting profitability in the near-term as it was pushing back expenses to the latter part of the life of the contract.
However, there are two unanswered questions with regards to its purchase of software products from IBM, in the single-largest acquisition by an Indian IT firm.
First, there is a mismatch in revenue, as HCL Tech expects to get $650 million from the products, while IBM last week told analysts that the products generated $1.3 billion in revenue in 2018.
On Tuesday in a post-earnings call with analysts, HCL Tech chose not to comment when Ankur Rudra, an analyst at brokerage CLSA, asked the management about the reason behind the difference in revenue numbers.
Analysts also await some clarity from the company on the tenure of amortization and whether there will be any change in profitability after the company changed the way it recognizes amortization expenses. Nonetheless, a few analysts believe that it is too early to conclude on HCL Tech’s approach of scaling up business from its software business, which accounted for 11.9%, or $263 million, of the company’s $2.2 billion in revenue in the third quarter.
“Above all, what matters most is how the company executes and scales up business from products it has bought. Until now, HCL (Tech) has a good track-record and so it is only fair to wait for some time (to find out) how the company fares in the coming months,"" said an analyst at a foreign brokerage, requesting anonymity.

61,2019-02-11,HCL,"The top five IT firms added 99,010 employees last year to take their workforce to about 1.23 millionAnalysts say that there is no structural change to conclude that the pace of hiring will continue

New Delhi: India’s top 10 information technology (IT) companies added 114,390 engineers to their workforce in 2018, a more than four-fold increase from the previous year. While the numbers are the best in five years, few are predicting a similar showing in 2019.
Much of the jobs added in 2018 may have been because of increased hiring in the US under pressure from the Donald Trump administration and customers outsourcing large contracts on the condition that the vendors absorb some of their employees, two human resources (HR) executives said.
Although none of the companies disclosed details of hiring in the US or the number of employees absorbed from clients, the HR executives claimed that at least half of the net hiring made by companies in 2018 is on account of one of these two reasons.
The top five IT firms—Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Cognizant Technology Services Corp., Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd—added 99,010 employees last year to take their workforce to about 1.23 million as against an addition of 19,360 people in 2017, according to an analysis by Mint.
The rest of the top 10—Tech Mahindra Ltd, Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd, Mindtree Ltd, Cyient Ltd and Zensar Ltd—added just 15,380 engineers compared with 2,796 in the previous year.
India’s $167 billion software services industry employed 3.7 million people at the end of December and the 10 largest companies accounted for 38% of them.
Some experts say last year’s jump looks more like a temporary recovery as the industry undergoes a structural change from a people-led model to a platform-based approach.
“I see the global economy slowing this year, and IT hiring will slow with it. Plus, the emerging IT services models will ultimately require fewer people to support it with smarter automation and the use of platforms,"" said Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing-research firm.
For now, stable macroeconomic growth in both the US and Europe has made more companies across industries spend more on outsourcing technology work, resulting in higher demand for services offered by IT outsourcing companies.
Unsurprisingly, a few analysts expect the sector to grow at faster pace in 2019 than in the recent past.
“(A)nnual growth rates in CC (constant currency) slowed in CY (calender year) 2017 by ~250bps (basis points) y/y across the Indian IT services industry, and improved in CY18 by ~90bps across the industry. Based on current Street estimates, we expect the Indian IT services industry revenue growth rates to continue to re-accelerate in CY19 at 9.3% y/y growth,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 6 February.
Mumbai-based TCS is expected to grow its revenue by more than 11% in constant currency terms while Infosys expects full-year revenue to grow, at best, 9% in the year ending 31 March.
A large number of big IT outsourcing contracts have seen some employees of clients join the workforce of technology vendors.
For instance, 9,000 of the 13,514 people added by Wipro in 2018 joined from Alight Solutions as part of an outsourcing contract. Wipro won a $1.6 billion deal from Alight Solutions LLC, the former benefits administration and human-resources outsourcing business of Aon Plc in September last year.
Infosys’s contract with Verizon and TCS’s two mega contracts—the over $2 billion, 10-year contract from Transamerica Life Insurance Co. and $1.36 billion over 10 years from a unit of British insurer Prudential Plc—also saw the two IT firms absorb employees from their clients. The Transamerica contract alone added 2,200 employees to TCS’s workforce, which totalled 417,929 at the end of December.
Not many expect IT firms to add as many people in 2019 as they added last year.
“There is no structural change to conclude that the pace of hiring will continue. The industry is going through a change and faces the same pressure from automation. Of course, we will continue to hire in the US. But overall hiring depends on client budgets, which in turn is tied to macroeconomic growth,"" an executive at Wipro said on the condition of anonymity.
“Talent in areas such as algorithm development and automation is increasingly scarce and expensive, which will stifle resources and put increased pressure on services firms to train junior or mid-level staff at a faster pace than ever. I predict hiring will slow in the second half of 2019 and not pick up aggressively until early 2021,"" said Fersht of HfS Research."

New Delhi: At a time when the US move to limit H1-B visas has left major tech companies perturbed as it will seriously affect their ability to get and retain talented staff, Indian company HCL has secured 5,085 foreign labour certification for the H-1B work visas.
HCL America had 2.9% share of all foreign labour certification for the H-1B work visas for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2019 that ended December 31, revealed latest H-1B visa statistics by the US Department of Labour.
Deloitte Consulting topped the list with 18,306 H-1B specialist occupation labour certifications, followed by Apple with 16,426 H-1B speciality occupations.
Professional staffing agency KForce was third with 10,292 visa certifications and Amazon.com Services was listed fourth with 5,485 certifications.
Social media giant Facebook was seventh, receiving 4,133 H-1B visa certifications for the quarter.
Others in the top 10 list were Cognizant Technology Solutions, Qualcomm Technologies, Intel Corporation and Oracle America.
Indians are the biggest beneficiaries of the temporary H1-B visas, 76% of which went to professionals from India last year, according to government statistics.
In November, the Trump administration announced changes to the H1-B visa system to give preferences to applicants with advanced degrees.
A total of 85,000 H1-B visas are available each year under regulations imposed by the Congress. Of these, 20,000 are reserved for those graduating with advance degrees from US universities.
Immigration authorities have reportedly intensified their crackdown on H1-B visa fraud and some Indians as well as Indian companies have been caught in it.
One of the immediate concerns for H1-B visa-holders is the Trump administration's plan to end permission for their spouses - who are on H-4 visas - to work, which had been granted by the administration of former President Barack Obama.

59,2019-02-19,HCL,"Reliance Industries, HCL Technologies, Wipro and JSW Steel are among the firms that haven't yet split the CMD postA third of the firms that have not complied with the rule so far are public sector enterprises or state-run banks

New Delhi: More than two-thirds of India’s top publicly-traded companies have separated the positions of chairman and managing director (CMD), although the deadline to comply with the rules is more than 13 months away.
That leaves just 156 of the BSE 500 companies to still untangle the role of CMD as of 15 February, compared with 291 in July last year, according to Prime Database, a primary market research tracking firm.
The idea behind the separation of the two positions is to bolster corporate governance. The separation of powers, according to some experts, increases the effectiveness of the board’s oversight role.
A third of the companies that have not complied with the rule so far are public sector enterprises or state-run banks. Although companies still have time to meet the April 2020 deadline, most firms, save for some family-run and government-controlled firms, have started the process of splitting the two positions.
India’s most valuable company, Reliance Industries Ltd, the country’s third and fourth largest information technology services firms, HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd, respectively, and JSW Steel Ltd are among the companies that need to comply with the new rules.
The four, along with 90 of India’s largest publicly traded companies, have members of the promoter group holding both the chairman and MD titles.
“Promoters still appear to be looking at how else they can retain maximum power over their firms and so a perceived reluctance on their part to split the titles,"" said the head of a proxy advisory firm, on condition of anonymity.
But most companies have initiated efforts to comply with the rules. One of the most recent examples is Persistent Systems Ltd, a software services company based in Pune. Chairman and MD Anand Deshpande last week decided to relinquish his role as MD. Christopher O’Connor will take over as chief executive on 26 February. “The transition will take at least six months. So we decided to start the process a year in advance,"" said Deshpande. At Persistent, Deshpande will transfer his CEO responsibilities to O’Connor, who joins the company on 25 February, over the next three quarters.
Persistent and Tata Coffee Ltd are some of the 135 companies that have, over the past seven months, separated the CMD role. This was after the Securities and Exchange Board of India approved many of the recommendations made by a 25-member panel led by Uday Kotak, chief executive of Kotak Mahindra Bank.
One of these recommendations was the contentious issue of a company splitting the role of CMD.
More companies of the remaining 156 in the list could split the CMD roles during the annual general meetings later this year. “I expect that during the July-August period when most companies hold their AGMs (annual general meetings), more companies will put this proposal of splitting the role of chairman and managing director before their shareholders,"" said Shriram Subramanian, founder and MD of proxy advisory firm InGovern Research."
58,2019-02-19,HCL,"Next-gen family members are now keen to start independent entities, and not carry forward past legaciesWith fewer members from next generation showing interest in the family business, a host of other issues also arise

Mumbai/New Delhi: So what? Kavin Bharti Mittal, co-founder of Hike messenger and son of Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman of Bharti Airtel, shot back when he was asked about carrying forward his father’s name and legacy. Kavin has chosen not to join his family business and ventured out on his own to set up Hike, a messaging platform, and in doing so, he is trying to create a name and legacy for himself distinct from his father’s. Yet, there is an element of risk—the risk of Hike’s failure, the risk of his own failure and the risk of letting down the family name, if at all.
“These thoughts cross my mind once in a while,"" Kavin said, adding that he reminds himself everyday about his reasons for not joining Airtel. “I really believed that the world is changing so fast that I would like to understand the world with my two eyes and not through the eyes of others or some pre-defined lens and I am happy to work a million hours a day to have that freedom."" Kavin is firm that he does not see himself being a part of his father’s business in the foreseeable future. He does not think it is in the DNA of telecom operators to disrupt the ecosystem the way disruptions are caused by the tech firms.
In Bengaluru, 2,150 kilometres away from Kavin’s office in Delhi, Rohan Murty has set up a firm called Soroco that is busy disrupting a business that his father N.R. Narayana Murthy created at Infosys.
How?
While Infosys deploys engineers to work on technology requirements for companies, across industries, globally, Rohan’s firm, Soroco offers the same companies products or software platforms which can do away with human intervention. This is by using algorithms, Big Data, artificial intelligence to make enterprises and people and processes far more productive.
There are many stories like those of Kavin and Rohan’s, which put out a narrative that is as much about new generation family members pursuing new areas of growth to seek an independent identity as they are about bringing new dimension to business families in the country.
Family rules the roost
Rahul and Abhimanyu, sons of late Raman Munjal who co-founded the then Hero Honda Motors Ltd along with his father late Brijmohan Lall Munjal, have diversified into renewable energy and financial services. Anuvrat, the only son of Hero MotoCorp’s current chairman and managing director Pawan Munjal, wants to build something of his own in the tech space even as he is finishing his studies. Akash and Isha Ambani, the children of India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, have disrupted the telecom market with their venture Jio and now plan to amalgamate Reliance Industries Ltd’s technology and retail platforms to build what their father calls “new commerce"". The children of Kumar Mangalam Birla, Ananya and Aryaman, are pursuing their interests in microfinance and cricket respectively.
These are just a few examples in a corporate India, which for now is largely controlled by families running their business. An overwhelming 69 of the BSE-100 companies are family-run businesses. Almost all of them still have a family member on the board, either as fruits of ownership or by playing a role in the operational decisions of a firm.
Yet, there are examples like Noida-based HCL Technologies Ltd. India’s third-largest information technology (IT) services firm was founded by Shiv Nadar in 1976. Nadar’s only child, Roshni Nadar, has said in the past that she does not see herself running the business and she would work in philanthropy through Shiv Nadar Foundation. Although Roshni was appointed as vice-chairman of the company last year, HCL clarified that she will not play a role in the operational decisions of the company.
In doing what they want to do, these next-gen family members are in a way also shaping up the new outlook for Indian family businesses. Such businesses are increasingly looking for ways to redefine how business is conducted, are seeking better solutions to address disputes and enforce governance, and, of course, smarter ways to divide family wealth.
With fewer members from next generation showing interest in the family business, a host of other issues also arise. Whose bloodline takes over? Who is the next chairman? Who is the next leader in the business? Will women from the family be involved? If yes, should they just share the wealth or also have a say in business affairs.
A matter of bloodlines
In earlier times, it was given that the next generation will come into the business. What has changed now? “Second generation or third generation of a family no longer interested in running their family’s business just reinforces what I’ve said for sometime: Haveli ki umar saath saal (which means the life of a business house is 60 years),"" said Gurcharan Das, author and former chief executive officer of Procter & Gamble India.
“Deep down, critics of capitalism have got it terribly wrong when they say capitalism is driven by greed. Of course, money is an incentive. But when you see the second generation examples like Rohan (Murty) or Kavin (Mittal), you’ll realize that they want something which is more than just money. The motivation is for recognition.""
Sunil Munjal, chairman of Hero Enterprise, and former joint managing director of Hero MotoCorp Ltd has a slightly contrarian view. “This is not unusual. This is the way how things have worked. What is happening in family businesses is that you are trying not to get too many people focused on one business and energy of the rest can be used to tap other opportunities. Sometime they branch out on their own and sometime they are funded by the family itself,"" said Munjal, who first branched out of his family business in the 1980s to set up a spinning mill only to encounter the Great Bombay textile strike called by unionist Datta Samant in its first week of production. Munjal’s mill situated in Malerkotla near Ludhiana was subsequently shut due to the prolonged strike.
In the past, India did not allow accumulation of wealth as it levied as much as 85% state duty on the wealth generated in family businesses. After liberalization, these norms were relaxed and that resulted in rapid creation of wealth in late 1990s and early 2000s as the Indian economy opened up to new businesses.
“As families became wealthier and more prosperous, they encouraged their next generation to take up new challenges to keep spirit of entrepreneurship alive. The startup culture has just given a new dimension to the whole thing,"" Munjal said, adding that the other advantage of branching out early is that the next generation family members get a chance to learn tricks of the trade in a business environment that requires less investments and low risks.
Das, however, thinks that it is the technology (that drives the entire startup culture) that has a far-reaching impact on more business, across industries and the trend of next generation family members looking out for opportunities will only continue. “You should compare it with history. Pre-liberalized India was a time when there were not many opportunities. So a son of a trader or merchant would have at-best gone to some new location and done business. Now, because of technology, most businesses are also facing disruptions. So technology is again a big driving factor behind this change. And this trend is seen globally,"" Das said.
Munjal somewhat agrees with this view. “Next generation not being interested is completely possible because the prospect of doing things on your own gives you a different kick. No matter what you plan, it is hard to predict it beforehand. That you can make a choice that you don’t want to do your family business is a great luxury. It is a success of the system,"" Munjal said.
No stigma attached to failure
Most of the new ventures have had limited success but because of the family wealth the pressure to make profits isn’t so intense. Also, many from the next generation family members are branching out early because they have the comfort of knowing they can always fall back on the family business in the event of a failure. To that extent, there is no stigma attached to failure.
It is a story that’s being played out even more vividly in the small and medium segment where traditional businesses are anyway under pressure. “So, we have seen a lot of this trend in Gujarati-Marwari businesses, where the children may want to do something else and they come back if it fails. Now we are seeing women also being involved in these things,"" said Rishabh Shroff, partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.
These changes are redefining how business families across the country are now viewing strategic and succession issues. Mint on 16 January reported that Rahul Bajaj and his three cousins—Shekhar, Madhur and Niraj—have signed an agreement that outlines how the family will jointly own group companies and establishes formal processes to deal with issues related to succession, ownership and conflict resolution.
The move confers on the Bajaj group the rare distinction of being India’s only large business family that has stuck together for four generations while ensuring a smooth transition for the fifth generation family members. The whole process at Bajaj is driven by a long-term logic. “We don’t know what happens to our children and grandchildren. But, we know we want to be together. We are trying to see how we can strengthen our relationship,"" Shekhar Bajaj, chairman of Bajaj Electricals, had said.
Similarly, the TVS Group has initiated consultations aimed at a possible restructuring of ownership among the various members of the family that runs the $8 billion conglomerate.
At the New Delhi-based Bharti Enterprises, which owns Airtel, a system has been devised where a family member will have to choose between two different hats—one of a promoter another of a professional. “There is nothing against family members coming into the businesses as long as they choose between two hats—a separate hat for ownership and another as a professional. If they are coming as professional, there is no harm,"" said a person close to the family.
In Sunil Munjal’s case, his move to cash out of Hero Group’s flagship company Hero MotoCorp is seen as a step to keep intact the ethos of the group founded by his father as well as making sure his own personality does not get compromised under the shadow of his brother Pawan Munjal who is running the motorcycle company.
In Conclusion
The earlier generation had few role models. Today, thanks to global exposure, the role models are men like Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg. In many cases, entrepreneurs want one of their children to start a different business for other reasons: either to create a hedge against the main business floundering or as a way to divide the family capital among two sons. In the latter case, one offspring gets to run the existing business and another is entrusted with the family’s seed capital. In this too, the family council’s decision is guided by their assessment of who is good at what task.
This has been a time-tested formula and has been the driving force behind the asset divisions in numerous families, said Shroff of Cyril Amarchand. “It is a great way to address a lot of issues that crop up in a family business. If you manage to create a new business, it gives you room to accommodate other family members,"" Shroff said.
Family businesses often face tough challenges during the transition phase, when the founders attempt to retire and hand over the reins of the business to their successors. The senior generations usually fail to realize the need to prepare their offspring to succeed them. Thus conflicts arise. Further, as families grow, this results in fragmentation of ownership of the business across family members and generations. “So, the reluctance of families to talk about (succession) is slowly fading away, which is a very good sign,"" said Shroff added.
Kavin, Rohan and an increasing number of next-gen businesspeople can take some credit for this change."
57,2019-03-05,HCL,"Many IT firms say that clients will continue to spend on newer technologies, irrespective of overall growth India’s largest IT services firm, TCS, sees this trend only in some industry segments

NEW DELHI :
As fast-paced changes reshape global retailers, carmakers and banks, these companies are spending more time and money on digital technologies to ensure that they don’t face annihilation because of disruptive innovation.
The increased spending has led to windfall business opportunities for information technology (IT) companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Capgemini SE, which say that such structural changes in client industries are gradually leading to decoupling of technology spending from economic growth.
While France’s Capgemini and HCL Technologies Ltd, India’s third-largest IT services company, claim that tech spending has more or less completely delinked from economic growth, TCS maintains that tech spending has decoupled only in some industries.
For over two decades, IT companies’ growth has taken cues from the economic growth in the US and Europe, the two markets that account for the bulk of their revenue. This is because historically, companies, across industries, have spent more on technology in times of good growth and tightened tech spending when growth slowed.
As digital technologies are structurally disrupting most businesses, companies from Citigroup to Walmart are looking at their IT vendors to help them run their business better.
Many IT companies say that clients will continue to spend on these newer technologies, irrespective of overall growth.
“Broadly speaking, companies will continue to spend because if they don’t transform their own business models, they will be exposed to a much bigger threat,"" Thierry Delaporte, chief operating officer of Capgemini, said in an interview.
Capgemini claims that digital revenue accounted for 45% of its €13.19 billion in revenue in 2018.
At Indian IT firms, including TCS, Infosys and Wipro, digital accounted for 30.1%, 31.5% and 33%, respectively, of revenue in the October-December 2018 period.
“Clearly, we are seeing client spending getting delinked from macroeconomic growth,"" said C. Vijayakumar, chief executive officer (CEO) of HCL Technologies.
However, India’s largest IT services firm, TCS, sees this trend only in some industry segments.
“At one end, you have an example like retail, where because the industry is in a difficult situation, the technology spend has been definitely decoupled from economic growth,"" said Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO of TCS. “Then there are other industries like utilities. Here, because of the inherent resilience in their business models, because of their natural monopolies, although the regulators have been trying to break these monopolies, the tech spending is still tied to economic growth.""
There are some, like India’s IT lobby group, Nasscom, and Infosys Ltd, which say that tech spending is still tied to global growth.
“For now, tech spend (of clients) is still very much linked to economic growth,"" said U.B. Pravin Rao, chief operating officer of Infosys. “This is because any slowdown in economic growth will impact a company’s growth and consequently the tech budgets of a client.""
Infosys’s view is mirrored by Nasscom.
“If the question is ‘if economies of the world are not doing well, will corporations continue to spend on digital?’, I would submit no. So, for now, there’s no decoupling (between economic growth and performance of IT firms),"" Nasscom chairman Rishad Premji said in an interview last year.
Most analysts agree, and say that is why IT stocks can still not be viewed in the same league as consumer staples such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) or ITC Ltd.
“There is a reason why consumer staples enjoy a premium over IT stocks, because, irrespective of economic growth, people will continue to buy the products of a company like HUL,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage on condition of anonymity. “Enterprise IT spend is still a function of macroeconomic growth and for this reason, it will be incorrect to assume that IT stocks should be viewed as consumer staples."""

The Reserve Bank of India said in December that the ratio for banks fell for the first time since 2015, though it’s still “high for comfort."" A $190 billion pile of soured and stressed debt has cast the future of some lenders in doubt and curbed investments.

55,2019-03-21,HCL,"HCL Tech expects to generate $1.3 billion in revenue over the next seven years from its contract with XeroxThe deal marks the renewal of HCL Tech’s engagement with Xerox, which had first awarded a ten-year contract in 2009

New Delhi: HCL Technologies Ltd expects to generate $1.3 billion in revenue over the next seven years from its contract with Xerox Corp., the US printer and photocopier giant. Noida-based HCL Tech, which last year surpassed Wipro Ltd to become India’s third largest IT company, said on Tuesday that the deal marks the renewal of the company’s engagement with Xerox, which had first awarded a 10-year contract in 2009. HCL Tech did not, however, disclose the financial details of the earlier contract.
“This expanded partnership is a testament to the strong Xerox-HCL relationship that has grown through multiple collaborations over the past 10 years,"" said C. Vijayakumar, chief executive officer of HCL Technologies.
Under the terms of the contract, HCL Tech will help Xerox in administrative and support functions, according to a statement released by the company.
As part of this contract, HCL will absorb some employees from Xerox.
HCL Tech’s latest deal win is the second mega deal win for the company in the last four years. It had bagged $1.6 billion, five-year contract, from Swedish auto maker Volvo AB in October 2015.
Significantly, HCL Tech’s contract with Xerox is the fifth multi-year mega deal won by Indian IT firms in the last 15 months. The other four contracts have brought in at least $7.2 billion in revenue.
In December 2017, India’s largest IT firm Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) signed a $2.25 billion, eight-year contract with Nielsen, a TV ratings measurement firm, and followed it up with an over $2 billion, 10-year contract with a unit of Dutch insurer Aegon NV in January 2018. Last June, TCS won a third mega deal worth $1.36 billion, for over 10 years, from a unit of British insurer Prudential Plc.
In September, Wipro won its largest contract, valued at $1.6 billion over 10 years from Alight Solutions Llc, the former benefits administration and HR outsourcing business of Aon Plc.
HCL Tech, which ended with $7.84 billion in revenue last year, expects at-best 9.9% dollar revenue growth in the current financial year, implying that it expects to end FY19 with $8.6 billion in revenue.
On Wednesday, HCL Tech shares rose 0.45% to  ₹1,039.25 apiece on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex ended the dayflat at 38,386.75 points.

54,2019-04-09,HCL,"Companies in the IT and banking sectors are expected to report decent numbersConsumption slowdown, especially in rural India, may weigh on automobile and FMCG earnings

Corporate earnings have been a constant source of disappointment for many quarters now. However, the tide seems to be turning. Bloomberg’s one-year forward consensus estimates for the Nifty’s earnings per share (EPS) are heading north (see chart).
The optimism is driven by the improving health of banks and expanding liquidity conditions. However, the ongoing consumption slowdown and subdued global growth cannot be ignored. In such a scenario, apart from the revenue and profit figures, investors should focus on cues about whether these estimates will sustain.
Automobiles: Tepid demand leading to high inventories can hit the earnings of auto companies. A watch on the demand outlook is, thus, essential. Investors will want to know the production strategies given that BS VI emission norms will be implemented from 1 April 2020. Concerns related to Brexit continue to haunt Tata Motors. Hence, investors would want to keep a watch on the commentary on Jaguar Land Rover.
Aviation: Financial woes at Jet Airways (India) Ltd pushed up airfares for metro routes during the quarter. IndiGo (InterGlobe Aviation Ltd) and SpiceJet Ltd are expected to gain. However, higher yields can be counter-balanced by a decline in the passenger load factor. In February, domestic passenger growth registered its slowest monthly gain in over five years.
Banks, NBFCs: Public sector banks’ recapitalization ratios will be watched. Commentary on unrecognized stresses in corporate loans, and the pace of bad loan resolution through the insolvency framework are crucial. Market share gain for banks from NBFCs is another important indicator. For NBFCs, the key parameters are asset-liability management, the liquidity outlook and the cost of funds.
Cement: March is a strong quarter for the sector. However, government-driven demand could have been impacted by the forthcoming general election. Choppy price trends make commentary on overall pricing important. As input costs ease, the outlook on margins is key. 
FMCG: Commentary on volume growth of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms is crucial after worries of a consumption slowdown have surfaced. Easing input costs make the outlook regarding margin growth important. Investors will be keen to know if ad spend will be trimmed.
Information technology: Usually, the March quarter is weak for the IT sector as customers are into their budgeting term. This time, however, the execution of recently-won deals would aid performance. Revenue guidance for fiscal year 2020 along with deal pipeline will be closely watched. Also, the outlook on the banking and financial services vertical, considering weak global macro conditions, is important. The impact of new stringent US H-1B visa norms on sub-contracting costs and hiring plans too will be crucial.
Real estate: Investors will want to know how the transition to new accounting standards and the new goods and services tax regime have impacted the sector. Buyers may have delayed purchases because of the latter. Launch pipelines and inventory data should be watched. Other vital cues will come from real estate pricing strategies and how debt levels are moving."

Indian markets recovered to end flat today, led by gains in IT stocks and select financials like HDFC and Kotak Mahindra Bank.

Among the IT companies, HCL Tech rose 4% while Infosys and TCS gained 2% and 1% respectively. Kotak Mahindra Bank rose 0.50% after the lender posted a 25% jump in net profit for the March quarter. 
Jayant Manglik, president of Religare Broking, expects Indian markets to remain volatile in the near term given the earnings outcome and election progress.
""On the global front, movement in crude oil prices and currency would be closely monitored by the market participants. Further, the auto sales numbers for the month of April and outcome of FOMC meet (on May 1) will remain on market radar,"" he added.
The US central bank’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will announce its policy decision on Wednesday. The US Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates until at least the end of next year, predicted economists polled by Reuters.
""Nifty continues to consolidate in the range of 11,550 and 11,860. We expect this consolidation to continue for few more trading sessions before a breakout is witnessed on the higher side. Any meaningful dip remains an opportunity to add to long positions. A breakout above 11860 can push the index towards 12,300-12,500,"" said Sahaj Agrawal, head of derivatives at Kotak Securities.

Indian markets are expected to stay subdued today due to lack of positive triggers while global peers are on a downtrend. Asian shares hit six-week lows in early trade on Thursday as increased tensions ahead of key Sino-US trade negotiations fanned fresh concerns about global economy outlook.

48,2019-05-09,HCL,"Noida-based HCL Tech expects to grow at 16% in constant currency terms in 2019-2020At the heart of HCL’s industry-leading growth is the revenue from products it bought from IBM over the last year

NEW DELHI :
HCL Technologies Ltd on Thursday announced a 3.5% sequential increase in its dollar revenue for the January-March quarter, the highest among large companies in India’s $167 billion information technology (IT) outsourcing sector.
Noida-based HCL Tech expects to grow at 16% in constant currency terms in 2019-2020, faster than Infosys Ltd and Cognizant, which expect to grow 9.5% and 5.1%, respectively. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd does not provide a growth outlook while Wipro Ltd only offers a quarterly revenue growth outlook.
At the heart of HCL’s industry-leading growth is the revenue from products it bought from IBM over the last year. As much as $300 million, or 38% of the $794 million, in incremental revenue added by HCL last year was from these products.
The company also bought seven more products from IBM in the March quarter, details of which it has chosen not to share.
HCL Tech’s dollar revenue improved 3.5% sequentially to $2.28 billion in the quarter, while in constant currency terms, the company’s revenue rose 3.3% on a sequential basis.
Net profit was at $364 million in the March quarter, as it did at the end of December quarter.
A Bloomberg poll of 27 analysts expected HCL Technologies to report a net profit of $368.04 million (Rs2,552.7 crore) on revenue of $2.3 billion (Rs15,926.6 crore).
“I’m very happy with the outstanding performance delivered by us during this quarter,"" said C. Vijayakumar, chief executive officer, HCL Technologies. “We are in a very good spot and I believe this year will be a good year for us and for the industry""
“While revenue in 4Q along with FY20E revenue guidance was healthy, the higher-than-expected 4Q margin decline and 100 bps lower margin guidance for FY20E are negatives and reflect major cost pressures ahead, which necessitate sustained revenue growth in order to offset,"" Harit Shah, analyst with brokerage Reliance Securities, wrote in a note, post company declaring its earnings.
Billionaire Shiv Nadar-led HCL Tech’s performance in the March quarter was better than its larger rival, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp, which saw its revenue decline from the preceding quarter. HCL’s show was also better than its Bengaluru-based rivals, Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and TCS, which reported 2.4%, 1.4% and 2.8% sequential dollar revenue growth, respectively.
In the year ended March 2019, HCL grew 10.1% to end with $8.63 billion in revenue, faster than Cognizant, Infosys, Wipro and TCS.
HCL’s products and services division, which has been set up after the company spent $3.02 billion in building up its software product business since the firm stitched its first intellectual property partnership in August 2016, now accounts for 11.4% of company’s revenue or $982 million at the end of March 2019."
47,2019-05-09,HCL,"Volume growth has come at the expense of realizations, as seen by its lower-than-estimated revenue growthConsolidated net profit at  ₹473 crore fell 1.6% year-on-year, lower than Bloomberg’s consensus estimate of  ₹587 crore

Shares of Asian Paints Ltd fell 2.3% on Thursday after the company reported a dull performance in the March quarter. The leader in the decorative paints segment missed expectations on most key parameters. Consolidated net profit at  ₹473 crore fell 1.6% year-on-year, lower than Bloomberg’s consensus estimate of  ₹587 crore. Revenue of  ₹5,018 crore was also disappointing, falling short of the consensus estimate of  ₹5,223 crore.
“While the company has taken price hikes amounting to 6% during fiscal year 2019, the price growth of around 2% for the quarter was disappointing. The product mix is more likely to be skewed towards low-end products such as Putty, which would have led to lower price growth. This has resulted in lower than expected revenue growth for the quarter,"" Naveen Kulkarni, senior head of research at Reliance Securities Ltd, said in a note.
Operating margin also narrowed, impacted by high raw material costs and advertisement spends. Further, the management said that challenging business conditions affected operations in some of its key overseas markets, especially in Egypt, Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
The only bright spot in the results was a double-digit volume growth in its decorative paints business. But investors shouldn’t get carried away by this.
After all, the much-talked about India consumption story has hit a rough patch. March quarter earnings of Hindustan Unilever Ltd showed that fast-moving consumer goods firms were feeling the heat. So, for consumer discretionary products, such as paints, an extended consumption slowdown could translate into subdued demand going ahead.
Analysts also point out that this volume growth for Asian Paints has come at the expense of realizations, as indicated by its below-than-estimated revenue growth. And considering the current volatility in crude oil prices, it is difficult to gauge if raw material pressure is completely out of the way. Since most of the raw materials are imported, a further depreciation in the rupee could add to the pain. Also, in the absence of robust demand, taking further price hikes to protect margins would be tough.
Asian Paints’ shares have declined about 12% from their highs in April this year. But as for valuations, akin to most firms in the consumption basket, its price-to-earnings (P-E) multiple remains high. As the alongside chart shows, the stock trades at a one-year forward P-E of 46 times and is the most expensive listed Indian paint stock. No doubt these valuations are expensive and what makes them look even more unjustified is this lacklustre earnings performance."
46,2019-05-09,HCL,"HCL Tech beat the Street with a sequential growth of 3.3% in the March quarterIts FY20 guidance suggests organic growth is likely to pick up on the back of large order wins

HCL Technologies Ltd maintained its growth momentum of recent quarters, reporting 3.3% sequential revenue growth in constant currency terms for the March quarter.
It also guided for 14-16% in constant currency growth for FY20. This is higher than 11.8% constant currency growth the company saw in FY19.
But note: Close to half of the estimated growth will come from past acquisitions. Even then, the organic business is getting along well. The management expects organic growth to be 7-9% in FY20, which is higher than the 6-6.5% expansion the company reported in FY19.
Growth is expected to improve on the back of a ramp-up of large deals HCL Technologies won in the past one year.
The management said it had another quarter of record order bookings, adding that its order pipeline is strong and is better than what the company saw at the end of the December quarter. The share of new businesses, such as digital, increased to 28.4% of the total revenue. The management expects it to rise further.
But this momentum is coming at a cost. Operating profit margins softened 70 basis points to 18.9% last quarter, below Street estimates. The margin compression reflects the elevated cost of doing business in new technologies. The management guided for an operating margin of 18.5-19.5% in FY20. The midpoint of this range will mean a 50 basis points fall in FY20 over FY19.
Needless to say, a contraction in margins will mean earnings growth lags revenue growth. Prateek Aggarwal, chief financial officer of HCL Technologies, maintains that the upper end of the margin guidance implies stable profitability.
But investors need to factor in risks emerging from currency volatility, tight talent supply in new technology businesses and rising visa costs. Of course, these cost challenges are not confined to the company alone.
The HCL Technologies stock, meanwhile, outperformed the Nifty IT index this year, rising by about 20%, against an 11.2% rise in the index. Even so, it is still trading at a valuation discount to its larger peers.
A rerating will depend on how well the company navigates profitability challenges and builds its organic business. Much of the positive news on the organic growth is due to the inflow and ramp-up of two large deals HCL Technologies had won in FY19.
Investec Capital Services (India) Pvt. Ltd warns about the sustainability of such large deal wins. There are fears that deal momentum may slow this calendar year.
“Non-recurrence of a large deal like Xerox alone would imply a 2% headwind on revenue growth for FY21E,"" analysts at Investec said in a note. How well HCL Technologies addresses this will determine the stock returns."

Indian markets may be marginally higher on global peers support. Asian shares inched up from two-month lows on Friday just hours ahead of the US President Donald Trump administration's plan to raise tariffs on Chinese imports as investors looked to whether negotiators from the two countries can clinch a deal to avert the hike. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.2% while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.4%.
Trump said on Thursday he had received a ""beautiful letter"" from Chinese President Xi Jinping, stoking hopes that Washington may suspend its plan to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%. That provided some support for stocks in early Asian trade though sentiment remains cautious. Trump also said on Thursday he was taking steps to authorise new tariffs on $325 billion in Chinese imports.
Wall Street’s main indexes fell on Thursday ahead of critical trade negotiations between the United States and China, though they pared losses significantly after US President Donald Trump said reaching a deal this week was possible.
Back home, major companies that will announce March quarter results today are State Bank of India (SBI), L&T, Allahabad Bank, Canara Bank, Syndicate Bank, Eicher Motors, Glaxosmithkline Consumer Healthcare and IDFC First Bank among others.
HCL Technologies Ltd is likely to be in focus today after it announced a 3.5% sequential increase in its dollar revenue for the January-March quarter, the highest among large companies in India’s $167 billion information technology (IT) outsourcing sector.
Meanwhile, concerns about renewed escalation in the trade tensions supported safe-haven assets. The 10-year US Treasuries yield stood at 2.453%, near its lowest levels since late March.
In the currency market, the yen is favoured, with the dollar changing hands at 109.71 yen, having hit a three-month low of 109.47 on Thursday. The euro firmed to $1.12 while the Chinese yuan perked at 6.838 per dollar having hit a four-month low of 6.8638 to the dollar the previous day.
Oil prices held firm after Trump's comments on Xi's letter raised hopes for a deal for now. Brent rose 0.7% to $70.86 a barrel while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 0.9% to $62.24 per barrel.

Indian markets fell today, extending losses to the eighth day, led by losses in metal and IT stocks. The US today hiked tariffs on more than $200 billion in goods from China, deepening a conflict that has roiled financial markets and cast a shadow over the global economy. However, global markets showed some signs of recovery on hopes that the two countries can still reach an agreement.

NEW DELHI :
India’s second-largest information technology (IT) services company, Infosys, believes things are back to normal under chief executive Salil Parekh, and it has achieved stability after it was thrown in chaos following the resignation of former boss Vishal Sikka in August 2017.
Infosys has rewarded Parekh by awarding him the right to sell his performance-based shares, a maximum of  ₹13 crore in value, every year, rather than the earlier stricture of selling these shares only after three years.
Bengaluru-based Infosys has sought approval from shareholders after the board put its stamp on cutting the vesting period of performance-based shares awarded to Parekh.
“The company has delivered a strong performance over the past fiscal year, creating significant shareholder value. There is now a clear strategic direction to drive competitive growth through a resilient business model. Additionally, the company has (i) delivered strong total shareholder value, (ii) increased total revenue and share of digital revenue and (iii) achieved organizational stability,"" Infosys said in a filing to the exchange over the weekend.
“In recognition of the above, and Salil’s contribution to the same as the CEO and managing director, the board of directors of the company has recommended a revision in the vesting schedule of the annual performance equity grant (as defined in the Original Resolution),"" said a spokeswoman for Infosys.
“Amending paragraph 3 (b) of the Original Resolution by changing the vesting period of the annual performance equity grant from the current three years to one year,"" it added.
“The number of shares that will vest under each annual performance equity grant shall be calculated upon the successful completion of each of his three (3) full fiscal years with the company, the first of which shall conclude on March 31, 2021,"" reads a statement from CEO Parekh’s old employment contract with the company.
“The board believes that things are back to normal at Infosys,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage, on the condition of anonymity. “Typically, once the shares are vested, CEOs don’t have any lock-in period. With the board removing the lock-in period or what can be called as additional handcuffs, Parekh will now have to only focus on growth.""
Infosys clarified that it has not tweaked anything other than removing the lock-in clause of performance-based shares under Parekh’s employment agreement with the company. “This change applies to the grants made in FY19 and prospective grants,"" said an Infosys spokeswoman.
Infosys reported 7.86% dollar revenue growth, or added $860 million in incremental revenue, to end with revenues of $11.8 billion in the year ended March 2019. Infosys grew faster than the 7.16% and 7.4% growth recorded in FY18 and FY17, respectively. However, Infosys’s growth last year was slower than its larger rival, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, and the third largest IT firm, HCL Technologies Ltd, which grew 9.6% and 10.1%, respectively.
However, at least one other analyst was skeptical. “Infosys has not disclosed the metrics based on which these performance-based shares will be awarded. Since the vesting time has been cut to every year from the earlier three years, it appears that the CEO has got a sweet deal,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a foreign brokerage.
“Revenue growth is only one parameter. The company has not done well on profitability.""
Infosys’s operating margin fell 150 basis points from 24.3% at the end of March 2018 to 22.8% at the end of March 2019. During this time, Mumbai-based TCS expanded its profitability by 80 basis points from 24.8% to 25.6%, while HCL Technologies’ profitability declined 20 basis points from 19.7% to 19.5%.
Infosys shares were the second-best performing scrip among large IT firm with the stock returning 31% in the period between 1 April, 2018, and 31 March, 2019. TCS shares returned 40.4%, higher than the broader BSE-IT Index and BSE-Sensex, which were up 26.3% and 17.3%, respectively."

Hyderabad: HCL Technologies is all set to roll out ""Tech Bee"", a company initiative under which it trains and hires students who have completed Plus Two, across several states, a senior official of the tech giant said here Thursday.
HCL Technologies executive vice-president Srimathi Shivashankar said the pilot programme of ""Tech Bee"", which was taken up two years ago in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu yielded good results.
As many as 700 students have now become employees of the company while some of them are pursuing higher studies as part of the initiative, she added.
""We have not fixed a number for recruiting students. This is first time we are actually going into many states to assess the quality and the aspirations of the students,"" she said at a press conference.
The company was looking at Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra PradeshandKarnataka in the south, Srimathi Shivashnark said adding in the North they were looking at Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Maharashtra.
""The reason for selecting these states is that HCL is operating in these places. We have development centres across these locations or states. That is the reason we are focusing at these States to start with,"" she said.
Tech Bee, HCL's early career programme provides students an opportunity to start early, become financially independent and trendsetters.
Students who wish to join this program should have scored a minimum of 60 per cent marks in their class 12 examination with mathematics as a compulsory subject.
Students who wish to enrol in the program undergo an entrance test.
Enrolled students are paid stipend of  ₹10,000 per month, she explained.
While working at HCL, students can enrol in higher education programmes offered by reputed institutions like BITS Pilani and SASTRA University, she added.
The students after completion of required training will be recruited with salary range of  ₹two lakh to  ₹2.5 lakh depending on what work stream they are taken into.
They also would have to execute a service agreement of three years with HCL, she said.

37,2019-06-29,HCL,"College graduates employed by HCL Technologies designed Boeing's software, said a former Boeing software engineerHowever, HCL said in a statement that the company is not associated with any ongoing issues with 737 Max  

It remains the mystery at the heart of Boeing Co.’s 737 Max crisis: how a company renowned for meticulous design made seemingly basic software mistakes leading to a pair of deadly crashes. Longtime Boeing engineers say the effort was complicated by a push to outsource work to lower-paid contractors.
The Max software — plagued by issues that could keep the planes grounded months longer after US regulators this week revealed a new flaw — was developed at a time Boeing was laying off experienced engineers and pressing suppliers to cut costs.
Increasingly, the iconic American planemaker and its subcontractors have relied on temporary workers making as little as $9 an hour to develop and test software, often from countries lacking a deep background in aerospace -- notably India.
In offices across from Seattle’s Boeing Field, recent college graduates employed by the Indian software developer HCL Technologies Ltd. occupied several rows of desks, said Mark Rabin, a former Boeing software engineer who worked in a flight-test group that supported the Max.
The coders from HCL were typically designing to specifications set by Boeing. Still, “it was controversial because it was far less efficient than Boeing engineers just writing the code,"" Rabin said. Frequently, he recalled, “it took many rounds going back and forth because the code was not done correctly.""
Boeing’s cultivation of Indian companies appeared to pay other dividends. In recent years, it has won several orders for Indian military and commercial aircraft, such as a $22 billion one in January 2017 to supply SpiceJet Ltd. That order included 100 737-Max 8 jets and represented Boeing’s largest order ever from an Indian airline, a coup in a country dominated by Airbus.
Based on resumes posted on social media, HCL engineers helped develop and test the Max’s flight-display software, while employees from another Indian company, Cyient Ltd., handled software for flight-test equipment.
Costly Delay
In one post, an HCL employee summarized his duties with a reference to the now-infamous model, which started flight tests in January 2016: “Provided quick workaround to resolve production issue which resulted in not delaying flight test of 737-Max (delay in each flight test will cost very big amount for Boeing).""
Boeing said the company did not rely on engineers from HCL and Cyient for the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which has been linked to the Lion Air crash last October and the Ethiopian Airlines disaster in March. The Chicago-based planemaker also said it didn’t rely on either firm for another software issue disclosed after the crashes: a cockpit warning light that wasn’t working for most buyers.
“Boeing has many decades of experience working with supplier/partners around the world,"" a company spokesman said. “Our primary focus is on always ensuring that our products and services are safe, of the highest quality and comply with all applicable regulations.""
In a statement, HCL said it “has a strong and long-standing business relationship with The Boeing Company, and we take pride in the work we do for all our customers. However, HCL does not comment on specific work we do for our customers. HCL is not associated with any ongoing issues with 737 Max.""
Recent simulator tests by the Federal Aviation Administration suggest the software issues on Boeing’s best-selling model run deeper. The company’s shares fell this week after the regulator found a further problem with a computer chip that experienced a lag in emergency response when it was overwhelmed with data.
Engineers who worked on the Max, which Boeing began developing eight years ago to match a rival Airbus SE plane, have complained of pressure from managers to limit changes that might introduce extra time or cost.
“Boeing was doing all kinds of things, everything you can imagine, to reduce cost, including moving work from Puget Sound, because we’d become very expensive here,"" said Rick Ludtke, a former Boeing flight controls engineer laid off in 2017. “All that’s very understandable if you think of it from a business perspective. Slowly over time it appears that’s eroded the ability for Puget Sound designers to design.""
Rabin, the former software engineer, recalled one manager saying at an all-hands meeting that Boeing didn’t need senior engineers because its products were mature. “I was shocked that in a room full of a couple hundred mostly senior engineers we were being told that we weren’t needed,"" said Rabin, who was laid off in 2015.
The typical jetliner has millions of parts — and millions of lines of code — and Boeing has long turned over large portions of the work to suppliers who follow its detailed design blueprints.
Starting with the 787 Dreamliner, launched in 2004, it sought to increase profits by instead providing high-level specifications and then asking suppliers to design more parts themselves. The thinking was “they’re the experts, you see, and they will take care of all of this stuff for us,"" said Frank McCormick, a former Boeing flight-controls software engineer who later worked as a consultant to regulators and manufacturers. “This was just nonsense.""
Sales are another reason to send the work overseas. In exchange for an $11 billion order in 2005 from Air India, Boeing promised to invest $1.7 billion in Indian companies. That was a boon for HCL and other software developers from India, such as Cyient, whose engineers were widely used in computer-services industries but not yet prominent in aerospace.
Rockwell Collins, which makes cockpit electronics, had been among the first aerospace companies to source significant work in India in 2000, when HCL began testing software there for the Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based company. By 2010, HCL employed more than 400 people at design, development and verification centers for Rockwell Collins in Chennai and Bangalore.
That same year, Boeing opened what it called a “center of excellence"" with HCL in Chennai, saying the companies would partner “to create software critical for flight test."" In 2011, Boeing named Cyient, then known as Infotech, to a list of its “suppliers of the year"" for design, stress analysis and software engineering on the 787 and the 747-8 at another center in Hyderabad.
The Boeing rival also relies in part on offshore engineers. In addition to supporting sales, the planemakers say global design teams add efficiency as they work around the clock. But outsourcing has long been a sore point for some Boeing engineers, who, in addition to fearing job losses say it has led to communications issues and mistakes.
Moscow Mistakes
Boeing has also expanded a design center in Moscow. At a meeting with a chief 787 engineer in 2008, one staffer complained about sending drawings back to a team in Russia 18 times before they understood that the smoke detectors needed to be connected to the electrical system, said Cynthia Cole, a former Boeing engineer who headed the engineers’ union from 2006 to 2010.
“Engineering started becoming a commodity,"" said Vance Hilderman, who co-founded a company called TekSci that supplied aerospace contract engineers and began losing work to overseas competitors in the early 2000s.
US-based avionics companies in particular moved aggressively, shifting more than 30% of their software engineering offshore versus 10% for European-based firms in recent years, said Hilderman, an avionics safety consultant with three decades of experience whose recent clients include most of the major Boeing suppliers.
With a strong dollar, a big part of the attraction was price. Engineers in India made around $5 an hour; it’s now $9 or $10, compared with $35 to $40 for those in the US on an H1B visa, he said. But he’d tell clients the cheaper hourly wage equated to more like $80 because of the need for supervision, and he said his firm won back some business to fix mistakes.
HCL, once known as Hindustan Computers, was founded in 1976 by billionaire Shiv Nadar and now has more than $8.6 billion in annual sales. With 18,000 employees in the US and 15,000 in Europe, HCL is a global company and has deep expertise in computing, said Sukamal Banerjee, a vice president. It has won business from Boeing on that basis, not on price, he said: “We came from a strong R&D background.""
Still, for the 787, HCL gave Boeing a remarkable price – free, according to Sam Swaro, an associate vice president who pitched HCL’s services at a San Diego conference sponsored by Avionics International magazine in June. He said the company took no up-front payments on the 787 and only started collecting payments based on sales years later, an “innovative business model"" he offered to extend to others in the industry.
The 787 entered service three years late and billions of dollars over budget in 2011, in part because of confusion introduced by the outsourcing strategy. Under Dennis Muilenburg, a longtime Boeing engineer who became chief executive in 2015, the company has said that it planned to bring more work back in-house for its newest planes.
Engineer Backwater
The Max became Boeing’s top seller soon after it was offered in 2011. But for ambitious engineers, it was something of a “backwater,"" said Peter Lemme, who designed the 767’s automated flight controls and is now a consultant. The Max was an update of a 50-year-old design, and the changes needed to be limited enough that Boeing could produce the new planes like cookie cutters, with few changes for either the assembly line or airlines. “As an engineer that’s not the greatest job,"" he said.
Rockwell Collins, now a unit of United Technologies Corp., won the Max contract for cockpit displays, and it has relied in part on HCL engineers in India, Iowa and the Seattle area. A United Technologies spokeswoman didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Contract engineers from Cyient helped test flight test equipment. Charles LoveJoy, a former flight-test instrumentation design engineer at the company, said engineers in the U.S. would review drawings done overnight in India every morning at 7:30 a.m. “We did have our challenges with the India team,"" he said. “They met the requirements, per se, but you could do it better.""
Multiple investigations – including a Justice Department criminal probe – are trying to unravel how and when critical decisions were made about the Max’s software. During the crashes of Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines planes that killed 346 people, investigators suspect, the MCAS system pushed the planes into uncontrollable dives because of bad data from a single sensor.
That design violated basic principles of redundancy for generations of Boeing engineers, and the company apparently never tested to see how the software would respond, Lemme said. “It was a stunning fail,"" he said. “A lot of people should have thought of this problem – not one person – and asked about it.""
Boeing also has disclosed that it learned soon after Max deliveries began in 2017 that a warning light that might have alerted crews to the issue with the sensor wasn’t installed correctly in the flight-display software. A Boeing statement in May, explaining why the company didn’t inform regulators at the time, said engineers had determined it wasn’t a safety issue.
“Senior company leadership,"" the statement added, “was not involved in the review.""

Mumbai: Extending losses for the fifth consecutive session, equity benchmark BSE Sensex lost 135 points while the NSE Nifty fell below the 11,300 mark on Wednesday after the IMF cut India's growth outlook.
After swinging 394 points, the 30-share Sensex ended 135.09 points or 0.36% lower at 37,847.65. It hit an intra-day low of 37,708.41 and a high of 38,102.84.
The broader NSE Nifty slipped 59.75 points or 0.53% to close at 11,271.30. During the day, the index hit a low of 11,229.80 and a high of 11,359.75.
Top losers in the Sensex pack included IndusInd Bank, Bajaj Finance, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Hero MotoCorp, Axis Bank, M&M, Vedanta and Maruti, falling up to 3.50%.
On the other hand, Asian Paints was the biggest gainer, rallying 3.42%, after the company reported an 18% increase in consolidated net profit for the June quarter.

The IMF on Tuesday projected a slower growth rate for India in 2019 and 2020, a downward revision of 0.3% for both the years, saying its GDP will now grow at 7% and 7.2% respectively, reflecting a weaker-than expected outlook for domestic demand.

NEW DELHI :
Indian IT majors like TCS, HCL and Infosys have raised concerns regarding market access issues and non-tariff barriers in China with Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal, as they are creating hurdles for them to set up business in that country.
During the discussions, the representatives of the companies informed the minister that India's investments and business have not been able to grow in China due to various non-tariff barriers and challenges faced by Indian companies to set up their entity in China, said an official statement.
One of the major focus area of the discussion was market access issues as it creates hurdles for Indian companies to open their business in China.
Chinese IT services market is the third largest in the world.
The meeting held here on Wednesday was attended by senior managers of TCS, Satyam Venture Engineering, HCL, NIIT Tech, Infosys, Invento Robotics, Tech Mahindra and Wipro.
Goyal asked the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) and the senior managers of the companies to share specific data regarding non-tariff barriers being faced by them in China and other East Asian markets.
""Government of India will give all support for the global growth of India's flagship industry and will make all efforts to facilitate the IT service industry and for that it is ready to engage with China and also Japan and Korea"", Goyal said during the meeting.
Sangeeta Godbole, DG of Services Export Promotion Council (SEPC) and President of NASSCOM, Debjani Ghosh, were also present during the discussions with Goyal.
The focus of the meeting was also on exploring opportunities for IT companies to invest and grow their business in new markets like the Nordic countries, Eastern and Central Europe, Canada, Australia and Africa.
India's IT industry contributed 7.7 per cent to the country's GDP in financial year 2016-17 and is expected to contribute 10 per cent of India's GDP by 2025.
According to IT industry body NASSCOM, the aggregated revenues of the sector stood at USD 160 billion in 2017. The United States account for two-third of India's IT services exports.
India's IT and ITeS industry grew to USD 181 billion in 2018-19. Exports from the industry increased to USD 137 billion in fiscal year 2018-19 while domestic revenues (including hardware) advanced to USD 44 billion.
The minister also asked the IT services companies to explore other markets and not be inhibited in operating in countries that are non-English speaking.
He urged the top five Indian IT firms to create a corpus that will be spent on training manpower in languages like Mandarin, Japanese and Korean for accessing the markets in these countries.
India is the largest exporter of IT services in the world and exports dominate the Indian IT industry and constitutes about 79 per cent of the total revenue of the industry."
31,2019-08-04,HCL,"The key trigger this week is likely to be the Reserve Bank's three-day policy meeting, beginning MondayThe ongoing results season will continue to determine the market trend

New Delhi: The RBI's interest rate decision, US-China trade conflict and quarterly earnings would influence trading in the equity markets this week, say analysts.
Participants will also keep an eye on taxation issues following reports that the Prime Minister's Office and the finance ministry have held talks regarding tax surcharge on FPIs announced in the Budget.
However, the key trigger this week is likely to be the Reserve Bank's three-day policy meeting, beginning Monday (5 August).
The central bank is expected to cut the benchmark interest rate for the fourth time in a row to boost the economy at time when key indicators are pointing towards a slowdown, experts said.
""The market is now awaiting the RBI meet which is scheduled this week,"" said Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research.
PMI data for the services sector is due on Monday, which would also influence trading sentiment, according to marketmen.
According to Arun Thukral, MD and CEO, Axis Securities, ""The recent correction has been driven by various factors — global weakness, selling by FPIs along with signs of a slowdown in domestic economy. Having breached the psychologically crucial levels, markets are expected to be volatile in the near term.""
Also, the ongoing results season will continue to determine the market trend.
Cipla, HCL Technologies Limited, Lupin, M&M, Tata Steel, Hexaware Technologies and GAIL India are among the major corporates scheduled to announce their results this week.
""The BSE-30 share index declined 2.1% this week led by weak domestic and global cues. Commentary of the US Federal Reserve on the future rate cut, weak underlying trends in quarterly results, slump in automobile sales dented investor sentiments,"" said Sanjeev Zarbade, VP PCG Research, Kotak Securities.
Global markets were rattled last week after US President Donald Trump announced fresh tariffs on Chinese imports, which Beijing vowed to retaliate.
Over the last week, the Sensex lost 764.57 points or 2.01%.

Noida-based HCL Technologies on Wednesday reported a 13.5% quarter-on-quarter decline in net profit for the April-June quarter. The net profit stood at  ₹2,220 crore as compared to  ₹2,568 in the previous quarter.
In terms of revenue growth, the IT major posted a revenue growth of 4.2% quarter-on-quarter and 17.0% year-on-year in constant currency terms, which according to C. Vijayakumar, President & CEO, HCL Technologies is a historic peak performance. ""With our current momentum, we aspire to register an industry leading organic growth in FY20. While our margins this quarter were muted in line with our investment strategy to leverage future growth opportunities, I am confident that our time-tested operating model will deliver margins within our guided range this year,"" he said in a press statement.
The company said the 17% Y-o-Y growth was led by double digit growth across its three segments: IT and business services grew 18.1%, products & platforms 15.2%, engineering and R&D services 13.3% (on Y-o-Y constant currency basis).
In terms of future guidance, the management expects HCL Tech to grow between 14.0% to 16.0% in constant currency for financial year 2019-20. The revenue guidance is based on FY19 (April to March) average exchange rates. The above constant currency guidance translates to 13.3% to 15.3% in dollar terms based on June 30, 2019 rates.
In December 2018, HCL Technologies announced the decision to acquire IBM software products for a total of $1.8 billion that was closed only at the end of the June quarter.
Sanchit Vir Gogia, CEO of Greyhound Research, said: ""The decision by HCL Technologies to acquire software from IBM is part of the company’s attempt to be IP driven and drive growth on the back of it. While in theory this bold move is a step in the right direction and supposed to act as a shot-in-the-arm for HCL, but the ground reality is that these IBM products come with a ton of baggage that can potentially throw a spanner in the works."" He added that developing and scaling standalone SaaS (software as a service) products will require a net-new approach from HCL Technologies and the one key change that HCL Technologies must bring in, is to appoint country and vertical specific resellers for this new software to ensure it continues to add on the customer base and add to the revenue stream.
In other highlights, HCL launched ‘HCL Software’, a new business unit that will providemodernized software products to businesses to help them transform their environment and completed the acquisition of digital transformation consulting firm Strong-Bridge Envision (SBE). According to brokerage firm Reliance Securities, these investments will bear fruit over the next few quarters, driving revenue/profit growth.
In terms of hiring, the company added 16,332 people (gross) and 5,935 staff (net) during the quarter to take its total head count to 1,43,900 at the end of the June 2019 quarter while attrition in the IT services business on the past 12-month basis stood at 17.3% which the company expects to come down in the coming quarters."
29,2019-08-08,HCL,"Benefit of  revenue acceleration was negated by a steep fall in profitability to 17.1%, down 1.8 percentage pointsApart from IBM product acquisition related costs, a significant part of the incremental growth last quarter is on-site dependent, which has low margin

Shares of HCL Technologies Ltd lost about 10% since its March quarter results, underperforming the Nifty IT index, due to concerns over growth and profitability. The June quarter results will reassure investors to some extent.
Constant currency revenues grew 4.2% from the March quarter, better than the most optimistic estimate on the Street. From a year ago, they are up 17%, the highest in recent years. Excluding the benefit of a recent acquisition, sequential revenue growth stood at 3.8%, which is healthy.
However, the benefit of revenue acceleration was negated by a steep fall in profitability to 17.1%. It is down a good 1.8 percentage points from the March quarter. As a consequence, operating earnings (earnings before interest and tax ) in dollar terms fell 6.3% sequentially. “Management already guided that Q1 margins will be weak owing to IBM products acquisition led transition costs while revenues would be absent and flow only from Q2. However, quantum of margin drop is steep,"" said an analyst on condition of anonymity.
Apart from IBM product acquisition related costs, a significant part of the incremental growth last quarter is on-site dependent, which has low margin.
Even so, the company retained the 18.5-19.5% margin guidance for the full year. “I know that there is a bit of a climb from 17.1%; but we have an action plan,"" said C. Vijayakumar, president and chief executive officer of HCL Technologies.
The plan involves cost rationalization and revenue generation from recent investments. The IBM products acquisition will begin generating revenues from the current quarter, covering the costs of this investment. Investments and spends in the engineering division are projected to moderate. Further, the management plans to optimize the on-site-offshore mix and rationalize several other costs.
The steps will aid HCL Technologies’ profitability. But how well the management will succeed in eking out the gains will be known only when it delivers the September quarter results. Otherwise, it is confident of delivering 14-16% constant currency revenue growth it had guided for FY20.
Deal bookings moderated a bit last quarter, but the pipeline is strong. This should help the HCL Technologies stock, especially given its undemanding valuations and recent underperformance. “Potential acceleration in revenue growth, encouraging investments in applications business and momentum of large deals have been completely ignored,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note. “To be clear, we do not like the products strategy of HCL, but find valuations at 12 times FY2021 estimated earnings difficult to ignore."""
28,2019-08-08,HCL,"NSE auto index surged over 3% while many banking stocks also posted strong gainsHigher tax on FPIs has adversely impacted market sentiments: Analysts

Indian markets surged today after news agency Reuters, citing sources, reported that the government is likely to exempt foreign portfolio investors from an increase in taxes that was part of the budget. The budget announcement on taxation has adversely impacted investor sentiments and is reflected in the FPI outflows from the equity markets. Since budget, Indian markets have fallen nearly 8%.
At day's high, the Sensex surged over 700 points before closing 636 points higher at 37,327. The Nifty regained 11,000 mark, settling 1.6% higher at 11,032.
Investors sentiment were also boosted after Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday cut 35 basis points repo rate and promised liquidity support to financial sector.
""Markets today started to sense some relief coming in for the capital markets and clarification or rollback of surcharge on FPIs. The recent round of market correction was led by FII selloff post the budget,"" said Devang Mehta, head of equity advisory at Centrum Wealth Management.
""Some confidence boosting measure for the economy is expected as finance ministry seems to be engaging in extensive discussions with industry participants. However, its too early to speculate on policy decisions, but a bounceback after such a huge fall was not entirely unexpected.""
Banking and auto stocks led the gains today. The NSE auto index rose 3%, with Tata Motors surging 5.6%, Apollo Tyres 5% and TVS Motor 4%. Other top gainers in the auto pack included Bajaj Auto, M&M and Ashok Leyland, up between 3% and 5%.
Among banking stocks, HDFC Bank rose 2.5% while ICICI Bank and SBI gained nearly 2% each.
""(Larger than expected rate cut) clearly shows RBI's concern about the growth performance and urgency to take measures to revive growth,"" said Sujan Hajra, chief economist and executive director at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.
HCL Technologies Ltd gained 6.5% after the company said its revenue in constant currency terms grew 17% year on year and 7.7% on sequential basis.
Among losers, Tata Steel Ltd fell 4% after the company reported a 63% slump in its net profit for June quarter to  ₹702 crore from  ₹1934 crore a year ago."

26,2019-08-12,HCL,"Profitability softened at large companies as well, with HCL Tech suffering a significant hitExcept Infosys Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, revenue growth at most front-line IT firms lagged Street estimates

Global headwinds and the resultant weakness in financial services, a large business vertical, weighed on the growth rates of IT firms in June quarter. However, order wins and deal pipelines remain strong to keep growth hopes alive.
Except Infosys Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, revenue growth at most front-line IT firms lagged Street estimates. Growth at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), the largest company, moderated from the March quarter. Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd reported lacklustre performance.
The slowdown is more pronounced at second-rung firms. High client concentration and slowdown in revenues adversely impacted the profitability of these firms compared to their larger peers. “Mid-tier companies witnessed slowdown in revenue growth on year-on-year comparison to low teens from high teens earlier. Slowdown in growth from large clients and a few client-specific challenges contributed to weak results,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note. “Mid-tier companies have a strong leverage to growth; slowdown in the same has resulted in margin contraction across all companies.""
Profitability softened at large companies as well, with HCL Tech suffering a significant hit. Talent crunch, high subcontracting, deal transition and visa costs impacted profitability. Without the support of currency, profitability can remain under pressure for FY20, said the Kotak analysts.
Even so, as one analyst at a domestic broking firm pointed out some time back, relative to other sectors IT companies’ earnings have been less volatile.
Further order bookings and pipeline across the firms remain strong, providing good visibility. “Total contract value (TCV) of deal wins has been strong across all companies, reflecting a demand environment that is still reasonably good,"" analysts at Kotak said. “We appreciate that TCV may not be a reliable indicator for growth due to lack of clarity on renewals of existing business. On the other hand, it is a good indicator for momentum in wins, something that has been comforting up to now.""
Tracking the strong deal momentum, Infosys raised its lower end of the revenue growth guidance for FY20 by one percentage point. HCL Tech is confident of meeting its revenue growth guidance for the full year. TCS, despite pinning growth momentum hopes on the second quarter, is confident about prospects and is stepping-up hiring. Similarly, Tech Mahindra reported strong deal wins for the June quarter.
In comparison, Wipro announced tepid sequential revenue growth guidance of 0-2%. Similarly, company-specific troubles mean growth at Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. is expected to remain subdued in the near term. The variation in performance and growth profiles explain the valuation gap between Wipro, Tech Mahindra and others. But valuations of other front-line companies at one-year forward earnings estimates are not cheap either."

Here are the five probable implications:Economic Slowdown: Most analysts expect the GDP growth rate in June quarter to be less than 5.8% secured in the March quarter of 2018-19 which was a five year low. If the GDP print comes below 5.8%, then it will be confirmed that the deceleration in economic activity is still ongoing and a recovery may not happen anytime soon.

If the GDP print comes below 5.8%, then it will be confirmed that the deceleration in economic activity is still ongoing and a recovery may not happen anytime soon. On the contrary, if the GDP print comes above 5.8%, it may lead to conclusion that the process of economy recovery has begun.

Mumbai: Shares of information technology companies fell on Monday after investors booked profit as analysts see no material impact on tax rates after the government cut tax rates for domestic companies.
Analysts said IT stocks had traded at a premium to other stocks as investors took to defensive plays due to concern over an economic slowdown and liquidity crunch.
On Monday, shares of Infosys Ltd fell 3.2%, Wipro Ltd declined 2.2%, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd 2%, Tech Mahindra Ltd 1.7%, HCL Technologies Ltd 1.3%. Nifty IT Index slumped 2%.
According to a Credit Suisse report, there will be no material impact on tax rates on IT services companies following the tax cuts. The current blended effective tax rates of 22-27% are a combination of higher tax rates paid outside India and much lower tax rates paid in India. IT companies, thus pay lower than 25% tax rates in India and the cuts announced Friday will not lower their overall tax rates.
Brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher said it has increased underweight on the sector to 390 basis points and remains cautious as growth in tech spends in BFS clients in the US and European geography will be muted compared to last year due to trade war concerns, uncertainty on central bank policy and interest rates, Brexit related uncertainty. The rupee advantage will also weaken now.

Melbourne: The State Bank of India opened its Melbourne office on Monday, becoming the first Indian bank to have a branch in the Australian state of Victoria.
The Melbourne office will assist the growing trade and investment relations between Victoria and India and is the outcome of the state's 10-year India Strategy – our shared future, according to a press release.
Speaking at the inauguration here, Victoria's parliamentary secretary to the treasurer, Steve Dimopoulos, said, ""We are delighted to welcome the State Bank of India to Victoria – the first Indian bank to set up operations in our state.""
""This investment by India's largest commercial bank is a testament to our thriving financial services sector and our highly skilled workforce,"" he said.
According to official figures, the two-way merchandise trade between Victoria and India was to the tune of 1.76 billion Australian dollars in 2018.
SBI Managing Director Dinesh Kumar Khara said ""It is a great privilege to have our presence in the vibrant and business-friendly city of Melbourne. I am confident that our footprint in Melbourne will further strengthen the relationship between the two countries""

20,2019-10-10,HCL,"Organic growth is estimated at 2.4% sequentially for top four IT firms, almost same as growth in Q1Growth at TCS is likely to fall to single digits, after four straight quarters of double-digit growth

The July-September quarter has historically been the strongest one for Indian IT services companies. But in this fiscal year, there is unlikely to be any show of strength when companies announce second quarter (Q2) results.
“Organic growth is estimated at 2.4% sequentially for the top four IT firms— TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Wipro—in the September quarter, barely higher than the 2.3% growth reported in each of the preceding two quarters,"" says an IT sector analyst at a domestic institutional firm, who declined to be named.
What’s more, year-on-year revenue growth at industry leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) is expected to fall to single-digit levels, after four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth.
“We see risks to double-digit growth guidance at TCS,"" analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a results preview note to clients. Analysts expect the company to report 9-9.5% growth, down from 10.6% in Q1. While TCS doesn’t give guidance, its management had earlier sounded confident of achieving double-digit growth in FY20.
If the company’s growth falls to single-digit levels in what is meant to be the strongest quarter in the year, it’s fair to conclude that investors would need to settle for lower-than-anticipated growth for the whole year.
Indian IT companies have been sounding cautious about tech spending in the banking and financial services (BFS) vertical, pointing to weakness in areas such as capital markets, European banks and some US regional banks that are going through mergers and acquisitions.
This was attested to when Accenture Plc. reported results for the quarter ended August late last month. Revenues from its financial services vertical grew 4%, far lower than the 7.2% company-wide growth. This was mainly owing to a continued decline in revenues from European banks.
Since the BFS vertical is a mainstay for most Indian IT services firms, it isn’t surprising that overall growth rates are under pressure. “We believe that IT spending will moderate in financial services in 2019 after a strong year in 2018. IT services companies face pressure from higher squeeze on run spends (i.e. traditional services), while spending in new areas remains steady,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients last month.
While revenue growth is coming under pressure, profit margins, too, have been falling. Increasing protectionism has resulted in a higher cost structure in these companies’ US on-site operations.
To be sure, the impact of these headwinds will be felt differently across different companies. In TCS’s case, a high-base last year will also impact growth. Infosys, on the other hand, had a relatively lower base; besides, it has a set of BFS clients that are reportedly increasing tech spend. It’s little wonder shares of the latter have outperformed TCS by a wide margin in the past three months."

NEW DELHI :
Noida-based HCL Technologies on Wednesday beat industry estimates by announcing a 19.4% quarter-on-quarter jump in net profit for the July-September quarter. The net profit stood at  ₹2,651 crore as compared to  ₹2,220 crore in the previous quarter.
In terms of revenue growth, the IT major posted a revenue growth of 6.0% quarter-on-quarter and 20.5% year-on-year (y-o-y) in constant currency terms, translating to more than 14% industry leading organic growth according to C. Vijayakumar, President & CEO, HCL Technologies.
""Our sharp focus on pricing and cost levers over the last 6 months have helped deliver a solid EBIT of 20%. I am also very excited about the progress we have made in our newly formed, HCL Software business. I am confident that this momentum combined with our diversified portfolio of services and software will deliver great value to our clients, our shareholders and most importantly, our employees."" said C Vijayakumar, President & CEO, HCL Technologies, in a press statement.
The company said the 20.5% y-o-y growth was led by double digit growth across its three segments: IT and Business Services grew by 17.4%, products & platforms 57.9%, Engineering and R&D Services 15.0% (on y-o-y Constant Currency basis).
The robust growth in Engineering and R&D Services was driven by large deals and all round traction for engineering services in major industries that HCL operates in while leveraging investments in leading technologies like 5G and I4.0.
The company said that HCL Software, a new business unit of HCL Products & Platforms that became operational in Q2 helped enhance the revenue contribution from Financial Services 22.4% (up from 20.3% in Q1), Retail & CPG 10% (up from 9.5% in Q1) and Telecommunications, Media, Publishing & Entertainment 8.4% (up from 8.0% in Q1).
HCL also signed 15 transformational deals in Q2 led by IT and Business Services, in the key industry verticals of Financial Services, Life Sciences & Healthcare, Manufacturing, Retail and CPG.
In terms of future guidance, the management raised the revenue guidance to 15.0% to 17.0% in constant currency for financial year ending 2020 from 14-16%. The revenue guidance is based on FY’19 (April to March) average exchange rates. The above constant currency guidance translates to 13.2% to 15.2% in dollar terms based on September 30, 2019 rates.. It, however, maintained its margin guidance at 18.5-19.5% for the year.
According to analysts, HCL's numbers look a lot better than its peers because the company has integrated the IBM acquisition or intellectual property (IP) deals that it took over from the American giant. Stockbroking firm Prabhudas Lilladher said that HCLT’s margins in the next quarter will be aided by contribution from IBM products acquisition, which has higher margins.
HCLT has strong differentiated offerings in its Mode 2 business and reported that large digital engagements has increased. For instance, HCL has been selected by a Canadian bank for all key digital operations and a British multinational oil and gas major to provide for workplace management.

The September quarter earnings reinforced investors’ faith in the HCL Technologies Ltd stock. The stock gained 2.2% on Thursday, widening its recent outperformance against larger peers Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd.
Constant currency revenues jumped 20.5% as HCL Tech began integrating acquisition of select IBM products. On a sequential basis, revenue grew 6%. Much of the sequential growth was driven by the integration of IBM products. Even so, a 14% expansion in organic revenue from a year ago is nothing to sneeze at.
More importantly, the upgrade in annual revenue growth guidance underscores the improvement in its core business. The company now expects its organic business to grow in double digits, at 10-11%, against 8-10% estimated earlier.
In constant currency terms, the full-year revenue growth guidance has been raised by one percentage point. “This revision in guidance comes on the back of acceleration in organic growth momentum in H1, robust deal wins, and order book,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note.
Deal flows have improved significantly compared with the June quarter. The company signed 15 transformational deals. Overall caution in the financial services industry notwithstanding, HCL Tech has a good deal pipeline in Europe. Four of the seven business verticals clocked double-digit revenue growth in Q2.
The newly formed products and platforms division (HCL Software) had a good start, clocking $100 million in revenue. Created after integrating IBM products, it has access to 20,000 customers across the globe. The management expects the enhanced reach to aid business momentum.
Operating profit margin jumped to a multi-quarter high of 20% in Q2. Margins were boosted by lower amortization expenses and full recognition of revenues from IBM products, expenses of which were partly booked in earlier quarters.
Predictably, investors cheered the results. How well HCL Tech is able to narrow the valuation gap with peers depends on its ability to scale up the products business and revenue momentum. “HCL Software’s (products unit) ability to successfully convert IBM customers into its own fold over the next few quarters will be the key for further re-rating,"" said analysts at Centrum Institutional Research."

Last fiscal, constant currency revenue grew 11.8%. “This revision in guidance comes on the back of acceleration in organic growth momentum in H1, robust deal wins, and order book, even as the company faces renewal pressure in the IMS (infrastructure management services) business,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note.
The revenue guidance upgrade will please investors. Also, the company has been witnessing a good deal-winning momentum.
Deal flows have improved significantly compared with the June quarter. The company signed 15 transformational deals and added a $100 million client in July-September. Overall caution about banking and financial services business vertical notwithstanding, the company has a good deal pipeline in Europe. Four of the seven business verticals clocked double digit revenue growth last quarter.
The newly formed products and platforms (HCL Software) also got to a good start clocking $100 million of revenues. The platform created after integrating IBM products gives access to 20,000 customers across the globe. The management expects the enhanced reach to aid business momentum.
Operating profit margins jumped to multi-quarter high of 20% in July-September. Margins were boosted by lower amortization expenses and full recognition of revenues from IBM products, expenses of which are partly booked in earlier quarters. Margins may moderate as revenue flow from acquisitions normalize. The management expects full-year profit margins in a range of 18.5-19.5%.
The performance will add heft to HCL’s valuations. How well the company will be able to narrow the valuation gap with larger peers depends on its ability to scale up the products business and maintain revenue momentum. “HCL Software (Products unit) ability to successfully convert IBM customers into its own fold over the next few quarters would be the key for further re-rating,"" analysts at Centrum Institutional Research said in a note."

Corporate earnings have been muted throughout the year and is expected to be tepid in the near-to-medium term as well.

""Thus, for 2QFY20, we expect Nifty sales/EBITDA/PAT to decline by 2%/2%/8%. The reduction in the corporate tax rate has brought some cheer to earnings, but for FY20, it will largely limit the earnings downgrades rather than drive big upgrades. The silver lining to this somber backdrop is that the festive season demand has begun on a positive note. Thus while we are expecting 12% EPS growth in FY20 for Nifty, we are estimating strong revival of 28% growth in FY21,"" according to the report."

0,2019-12-30,HCL,"Performance over the past year shows IT companies are withstanding the market changes betterOutperformance of the NSE IT index waned since September, partly because the govt’s tax cuts did not benefit IT firms

The outperformance of the NSE IT index waned in 2019 since September, partly because the government’s tax cuts did not benefit software services companies. But investors are also concerned about the moderation in revenue growth during the year. The NSE IT index had gained 24% in 2018, while the Nifty had risen 4%. So far in 2019, the NSE IT index has risen 9%, whereas the Nifty gained 12%.
The year-on-year constant currency revenue growth of industry leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd dropped to single-digits in the September quarter. Growth at Wipro Ltd remained sluggish. Infosys Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd kept up the momentum during the quarter. But many doubt if the one-off large deals that have powered Indian IT in the past year will be replicated in 2020.
The reasons are partly cyclical. Uncertainty on government spending, taxation and regulation ahead of the US presidential elections in November 2020 can delay decision-making at clients’ end, some fear.
“Besides inherent immigration rhetoric, we find that slow, delayed decision-making by clients in election years (FY09, FY13, FY17) has translated into cyclical growth moderation for the IT services industry,"" BOB Capital Markets Ltd said in a note.
There are structural headwinds as well. Sluggish economic activity and low bond yields in Europe are hurting spends in the key banking and financial services segment. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities warned that if spends of clients facing disruption in their respective industries can take a hit.
“While maturity of digital spends augurs well for medium-term growth delays/decline in spends of challenged clients can create near-term headwinds. Tier 1 IT has provided cautious outlook on near-term growth in spends from the (retail) vertical,"" analysts at Kotak said in a note.
Separately, an analysis of the client financials by Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd shows a steady state at the US banking, financial services, insurance and consumer verticals. But troubles in retail, softness in oil and gas, manufacturing, in Europe means a large part of the IT companies’ target market is facing growth headwinds.
Of course, it is not all gloom and doom. Performance over the past year shows IT companies are withstanding the market challenges better. Digital and new-age services, which are seeing strong client spends, now constitute a large part of the IT companies’ revenues. In the September quarter, more than 38% of Infosys’s revenue came from digital. For TCS, the share stood at 33%.
With deal sizes also increasing, digital has become a key growth driver for Indian IT. However, the rapid expansion of this business has caught companies off-guard on the human resources side. Companies rushing to recruit employees with required skillsets is driving up costs, and hurting profitability. The trajectory of margins is another aspect investors will keenly track in 2020."
