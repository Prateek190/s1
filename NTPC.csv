New Delhi: India’s largest power generation utility NTPC Ltd recorded its highest ever quarterly generation in the three months ended 31 December, indicating a recovery in electricity demand. 
New Delhi: India’s largest power generation utility NTPC Ltd recorded its highest ever quarterly generation in the three months ended 31 December, indicating a recovery in electricity demand.
“NTPC, the largest power generator of India, with installed capacity of 51,383MW (megawatt), has recorded its highest ever quarterly generation of 67,781MUs (million units) during Q3 of FY 2017-18 which is 10.39% more than the generation of 61,400MUs recorded during the corresponding period of last year,"" the state-run utility said in a statement on Tuesday. The development assumes significance given that India’s largest power generator accounts for 16% or 51,635MW of the country’s installed power generation capacity of 331,117.58MW.
“There was an uptick in demand due to the cold weather and this is also an indicator that the economic pace is picking up,"" said an NTPC executive, requesting anonymity.
This comes in the backdrop of an uncertain outlook for the power sector and the National Democratic Alliance government trying to revive electricity demand in the country.
Any fresh demand for electricity, the lack of which is weighing down the entire power sector, will also help in resolving the stressed assets conundrum and improve their financial viability.
“NTPC has also achieved commercial declaration of 4,415MW capacity during the first nine months of current year itself,"" the statement added. 
Power minister Raj Kumar Singh is of the view that the recently launched Rs16,320 crore Saubhagya scheme to provide electricity connections to over 40 million families in rural and urban areas by December 2018 will help improve India’s per capita power consumption of around 1,200 kilowatt hour (kWh), which is among the lowest in the world. According to the government, the Saubhagya scheme will require an additional 28,000MW of power, considering an average load of 1 kilowatt (kW) per household for eight hours a day.
The other power sector reforms in the works include a plan to implement the direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme in the electricity sector for better targeting of subsidies and the proposed tariff slabs rationalization. 
Also, to make discoms more responsive, any disruption in electricity supplies post March 2019 will be penalized and the cross-subsidy will be limited to 20% to help usher in efficiency."

Gadarwara (MP): State-run NTPC Ltd said on Wednesday that it has fulfilled all its commitments for the acquisition of land for its 1,600 MW Gadarwara power project. The public sector power utility said it will continue to work towards the local area development and betterment of the affected people even after the project goes on stream.  
Gadarwara (MP): State-run NTPC Ltd said on Wednesday that it has fulfilled all its commitments for the acquisition of land for its 1,600 MW Gadarwara power project. The public sector power utility said it will continue to work towards the local area development and betterment of the affected people even after the project goes on stream. 
“We have fulfilled all our commitments, in line with the order of the Madhya Pradesh government’s rehabilitation department and the tripartite agreement signed with the land owners and administration,"" a spokesperson of the NTPC said. 
“We appeal to the local people to support the project of national importance from which half of the electricity generated will be for the state of Madhya Pradesh,"" he said. The project-affected farmers have been agitating at Gadarwara in Narsinghpur district, demanding jobs in the central PSU. 
Former Union minister and senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha also took part in the agitation in support of the demands of the project-affected people last week. The spokesperson clarified that the payment for the land is as per the rate decided by the government. 
As per the agreement, NTPC paid Rs14.5 lakh per acre for the irrigated land and Rs10.5 lakh for the non-irrigated land as a package, he said. The corporation also paid Rs3.5 lakh per acre (minimum Rs3 lakh) as one-time payment in lieu of employment as rehabilitation grant and the agreement made it clear that any additional money or employment will neither be demanded nor accepted, he further said. 
However, the agitation by the local villagers affected the project work as about 3,000 specialised workers left the site and the work came to a standstill from 22 December. “This is likely to adversely impact the project commissioning schedule which is targeted by the end of the current financial year,"" the spokesperson said. 
The project management has approached the district and the state administration for safety of the project site and workers for resuming the work as heavy machines and equipment at the site are lying idle."

With 187 generation units, the company’s operations are spread across the country, helping meet the base load for India’s power demand. 
It operates across diverse fuel sources such as coal, gas and hydro, and has taken the lead in helping the country reach its ambitious clean energy target of 175 gigawatts by 2022, as part of India’s commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in December 2015. (One gigawatt equals 1000MW). The utility wants to supply electricity from 10,000MW of solar power capacity that it is setting up on its own and buy 15,000MW on behalf of the ministry of new and renewable energy.
Created with a strategic intent to help India’s energy security goals, the Maharatna has been working on setting up power projects in the neighbourhood. Of its 22,124 employees, around 13,600 are in the executive cadre. The firm registered a net profit of Rs9,385.26 crore on a turnover of Rs79,342.30 crore in fiscal year 2017. It generated 250.3 billion units of electricity in FY17 clocking a plant load factor—a measure of average capacity utilization—of 78.59% against the national average of 59.8%. With 20,976MW under construction, NTPC has an asset base of Rs2.36 trillion with a debt of Rs1.03 trillion on its books.
To keep pace with the fast-changing power sector, the company is looking to diversify. It plans to be present across the electricity value chain and has 10 coal mining blocks with 7.3 billion tonnes of reserves. Apart from inviting companies for setting up cement units near its plants, NTPC is exploring new businesses such as setting up charging stations for electric vehicles. It is also entering the fertilizer production space through a joint venture and is scouting for opportunities to market its technology for producing quality drinking water from sea by utilizing heat generated from its plants.
The utility is slated to play a key role in helping meet the demand generated by Saubhagya scheme (Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana), launched to provide electricity connections to more than 40 million families in rural and urban areas by December 2018. This in turn will help improve India’s per capita power consumption of around 1,200 kilowatt hour, which is among the lowest in the world."

Ahmedabad: India’s largest power producer NTPC Ltd has listed its $6 billion (about Rs38,000 crore) medium term note (MTN) programme on India International Exchange (India INX) at International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) located at Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City) in Gandhinagar.  
Ahmedabad: India’s largest power producer NTPC Ltd has listed its $6 billion (about Rs38,000 crore) medium term note (MTN) programme on India International Exchange (India INX) at International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) located at Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City) in Gandhinagar. 
NTPC became India’s first quasi-sovereign company to list at India INX, GIFT City Co. Ltd said in a media statement. The listing was done on 24 January, on the Global Securities Market of India INX, India’s first international exchange, it said.
GIFT City Co., which is implementing the GIFT City project in Gandhinagar, is an equal joint venture between Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd and state government-owned Gujarat Urban Development Co. Ltd. Of the 880 acres allotted to GIFT City, about 250 acres is earmarked for the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC).
The listing will help NTPC raise funds at lower costs from international investors and also allow foreign investors to access good quality Indian debt paper.
“This is NTPC’s first listing at India International Exchange and we are very happy to be part of India INX at IFSC, GIFT City. Now, for the first time in India, we have the opportunity to reach out to international investors to raise funds using a wide variety of products and currencies, in a similar manner, as available in other international markets. We are excited with this new development and look forward to partnering with India INX in years to come,"" Gurdeep Singh, chairman and managing director, NTPC Ltd said in the statement.
India INX was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in January 2017, setting forth a vision that the International Exchange at GIFT City should become a listing destination for issuers from India and the region. It claims to be one of the world’s most advanced technology platforms with a turn-around time of 4 micro seconds and operates for 22 hours a day to allow international investors and non-residents Indians to trade from anywhere in the world. 
The exchange being located in IFSC, GIFT City provides competitive advantage in terms of tax structure and supportive regulatory framework. The Global Securities Market (GSM) of India INX went live on 8 December, 2017 with publication of its debt listing framework by India INX.
In a media statement issued on 25 January, V. Balasubramaniam, managing director and chief executive officer at India INX said that India’s IFSC mission suffers from several disadvantages which make it a less preferred option than New York, London, Singapore and Hong Kong.
On the expectations from the upcoming Union Budget, Balasubramaniam said that short term capital gains tax needs to be done away with for any transaction that is done through IFSC in both derivatives and debt.
“We have seen the impact of this already in the way in terms of the cost of doing a derivative transaction today at IFSC vs Singapore or London. We have also seen the impact of this in terms of volume erosion in India market once Dubai introduced single stock futures and now we are expecting Singapore to introduce them from February. The key reason why investors prefer to trade on Indian securities from global venues like London, Singapore and Dubai is because of less capital gains tax friction,"" he said in the 25 January statement. 
Among other things, he said that Long Term Capital Gains Tax should also be done away with for bonds traded at IFSC in the upcoming budget. This is a pre-requisite to develop a vibrant corporate bond market at IFSC, according to Balasubramaniam."

NTPC Ltd may have clocked record electricity generation in the December quarter. That robust operational performance, however, is not to be seen in its financial results. Tracking the 10% rise in generation, gross sales increased 7% from a year ago. But net profit declined 4%. 
NTPC Ltd may have clocked record electricity generation in the December quarter. That robust operational performance, however, is not to be seen in its financial results. Tracking the 10% rise in generation, gross sales increased 7% from a year ago. But net profit declined 4%.
Earnings were hit by three factors. One of them is pay revision. The second is the unusual rise in leave encashment by employees. The third and the biggest hit came from fixed cost under-recoveries at three power plants. As a consequence of the shortage of coal at these plants, the company was unable to recover fixed costs fully, hurting earnings. Excluding this impact and other adjustments, the net profit would have grown by 8%, the management told analysts.
Even then, the results may not please investors. Despite healthy generation, NTPC’s reported profits fell for the second consecutive quarter. Adding to the concern is continuing tightness in fuel availability at the affected plants. The government has set up a study group to address the problem. But it is not expected to be resolved quickly, given the complexities of the situation, which is dependent on the availability of rail transport and quick ramp-up of coal production.
That said, investors have reasons to be optimistic. Power demand has seen noticeable improvement in recent months, the management told analysts. This improvement in demand (partly caused by the unexpected drop in wind energy generation) led to unusual usage of thermal power, leading to coal shortages towards the end of 2017.
This sudden change of events did hurt NTPC in the December quarter. But the demand recovery, if it holds, should benefit the company in the long run.
NTPC is in the midst of capacity additions. By March 2019 it plans to add about 6,900 megawatts. With very few fresh capacities under construction in the industry, the company can see noticeable earnings benefits if demand sees a sustainable improvement. 
“Traditionally, NTPC has been among the foremost beneficiaries of rising PLFs given that it has some of the most efficient and low-cost plants. While the core trigger for NTPC remains its pace of capacity addition, which will double its regulated equity base, we believe current market price does not factor most of the above triggers,"" JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd said in a note. PLF is plant load factor, a gauge of utilization levels.
The future indeed holds promise. But the challenge for NTPC investors is to overcome the intermediate earnings disappointments."

New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Wednesday directed the Centre to file its reply and affidavits in a public interest litigation seeking a court-monitored criminal investigation by a Special Investigative Team into the alleged malpractice of ‘artificial over-invoicing’ of imports allegedly being carried out by various power generating companies in India.  
New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Wednesday directed the Centre to file its reply and affidavits in a public interest litigation seeking a court-monitored criminal investigation by a Special Investigative Team into the alleged malpractice of ‘artificial over-invoicing’ of imports allegedly being carried out by various power generating companies in India. 
The case has been filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL). Counsel for the CPIL, Prashant Bhushan argued that scope of the petition was beyond the matters of customs and taxes, which essentially came under the domain of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI).
“We are seeking a court monitored criminal investigation. We are seeking something larger than the scope of power of the DRI,"" Bhushan told the bench comprising justices S. Ravindra Bhat and A.K. Chawla.
Bhushan informed the court that in March 2016, 40 power companies were identified by the DRI, that over-priced coal imported from Indonesia. These companies included NTPC, Adani Group and Essar Group. He also brought to the notice of the court two instances when DRI issued show causes to the Adani Group in 2014 and Essar Group in 2015 for over-pricing their imports. 
The case of the petitioner is that the coal and equipment required for power generation in India are bought from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) through a foreign intermediary company which is a wholly controlled/ owned subsidiary of Indian power companies. While the invoices generated by OEMs reflect actual price of the product, the invoices generated by the intermediary companies on the Indian power companies are inflated ‘almost to the extent of 400%’, the petition alleges. Subsequently, the illegally inflated cost borne by the Indian power companies is passed on to the consumers who pay higher tariffs on electricity consumption. 
The matter will be heard next on 4 April."

New Delhi: NTPC, India’s biggest electricity producer, on Tuesday said it has won a tender to supply 300 megawatts (MW) of electricity to Bangladesh for 15 years. 
Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) had invited tenders for supply of 500 MW power from India for short term (1 June, 2018 to 31 December, 2019) and long term (1 January, 2020 to 31 May, 2033). NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam (NVVN), Adani Group, PTC and Singapore-bases Sembcorp submitted bids by the scheduled date of 11 January.

New Delhi: India is exploring selling “cheap power"" to its South Asian neighbours and Myanmar on a long-term basis and wants state utility NTPC to expand overseas, its power minister said on Tuesday.
Indian companies such as Reliance Power Ltd and Adani Power Ltd have already signed agreements to supply power to Bangladesh, where New Delhi is fighting for influence with China. India also sells some electricity to Nepal and Myanmar, but power minister R.K. Singh said it could sell more.
“Neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Nepal and Bangladesh are viable markets ... where the per-unit cost of electricity is very high,"" Singh said in a statement released by the power ministry.
“There is huge opportunity to export cheap power to neighbouring countries which will be beneficial for the entire region,"" he said.
The ministry would look at sending teams to those countries to assess demand for power imports, he said.
Singh urged India’s top utility NTPC to set up power plants in other countries and “become the world’s largest power producer"", but did not say where it should expand.
India became a net exporter of electricity in 2016, although it also imports from neighbouring Bhutan.
Singh, however, said its power surplus would start to decline once all households are connected. Currently around 300 million of India’s 1.3 billion people are without electricity.
“If you look at the entire power sector, the demand has been suppressed because not everyone is connected,"" Singh said. “We have just started taking off and are going to enter double digit growth. What we see as excess capacity today may not turn out to be enough if we unlock that demand.""
Many Indian power companies have struggled to repay loans in the past three years after expanding aggressively at the beginning of this decade, as a combination of tepid demand and uneven coal supplies hit their operations. Reuters"

Unit NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd (NVVN) will supply power to Bangladesh Power Development Board, said India’s largest power generation utility in a statement on Tuesday. Of India’s current supplies of 660MW to Bangladesh, NTPC has been supplying 410MW.
India’s playbook ranges from cross-border electricity trade to supplying petroleum products. 
“Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) invited tender for supply of 500MW power from India under short term (1st June 2018 to 31st December 2019) and long term (1st January 2020 to 31st May 2033). The bid for this tender was submitted on 11th January 2018 and four bidders namely NVVN, Adani, PTC and Sembcorp submitted their bid. Financial bid was opened on 11th February 2018,"" the statement said.
This comes against the backdrop of an uncertain outlook for the Indian power sector with the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government trying to revive electricity demand in the country. NTPC’s projects account for 16% or 51,635MW of India’s installed power generation capacity of 331,117.58MW.
“NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd, wholly owned subsidiary of NTPC Ltd emerged as successful bidder (L1) both in short term and long term for 300MW power. The supply of power is likely to be commenced from June 2018 after commissioning of 500MW HVDC (high-voltage direct current) inter connection between India and Bangladesh,"" the statement added without disclosing the price at which the electricity will be supplied.
India, last year, signed two lines of credit worth $5 billion during Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s visit to India. During the visit Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted energy security as an important dimension of India-Bangladesh ties and promised to add another 500MW under an existing transmission link.
While a spokesperson for Sembcorp India declined comment, Deepak Amitabh, chairman and managing director, PTC India said, “PTC has participated in the bid and it is for BPDB to take a holistic view."" 
An Adani Group spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to queries emailed on Tuesday afternoon.
The supply of 300MW of power will help NTPC earn Rs900 crore in annual revenue, according to the company. India’s largest power generation utility has been trying to keep pace with the fast-changing power sector wherein the absence of fresh demand for electricity is weighing down the entire power sector. 
Fostering cross-border energy trade is an important part of Modi’s South Asia-focused neighbourhood-first policy and has also been articulated in federal think tank NITI Aayog’s draft national energy policy.
India already has power grid links with Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh, and is building power projects in the three countries. It also plans to develop power transmission links with Myanmar and Sri Lanka.
India has also been pursuing closer ties in the energy sector with Bangladesh, helping the markets to integrate. State-run Indian Oil Corp. is exploring long-term deals with Bangladeshi companies for supplying liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and other petroleum products. Also on the drawing board is a plan to set up a large LPG import terminal in partnership with local companies, allowing large vessels to arrive in the Chittagong port. 
Road connectivity is another important part of this engagement with India pulling out all the stops to try and expedite the South Asian Sub-Regional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) road connectivity program. SASEC aims to increase economic growth by building cross-border connectivity between India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. India has also been instrumental in the Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal Motor Vehicles Agreement."

New Delhi: State-owned power giant NTPC is in talks for buying out equity of state utilities in some joint venture projects apart from taking over some of their stressed businesses as part of its drive to augment capacity. 
“We are in talks to acquire some non-performing and under-performing assets of state utilities. The capacity of some of these may not be very high but these projects have potential to expand,"" NTPC HR Director Saptrishi Roy, who holds additional charge of Director Finance, told PTI. “In some cases we wish to buy out our joint venture partner in specific projects with state utilities in a North Indian state. In another state we have made significant progress to acquire one performing project,"" Roy added. 
He declined, however, to give the names of the states or projects citing confidentiality clauses. Resources, he said, will not be an issue. Sources meanwhile indicated that NTPC could be in talks with Bihar utilities for two joint venture projects at Kanti and Nabinagar but it could not be ascertained from the company. 
This is part of the NTPC plan for inorganic growth as the corporation is eyeing the plants that are close to coal sources and running with an eye on cost of generation from these plants. The company had recently floated tenders inviting bids for acquiring stressed power projects from the private sector and is believed to have been approached by some big ticket assets including from JP group’s Nigrie thermal project. 
“There are 34,000 MW of stressed assets in the power sector. NTPC is looking to acquire operational coal-based power plants which have lower generation costs,"" Roy said. NTPC is currently working on new thermal projects totalling 21,000 mw for capacity addition in the next the 3-4 years, he said, adding that going by the projection of 7-8% economic growth on an annualised basis, the demand for electricity is expected to grow up significantly, The company, which produces about one fourth of the total power in the country despite having only 16% capacity, would expand to meet its role as the leading power supplier to the nation, Roy said, adding that nation may require additional power capacity to the extent off 4-5 GW annually to meet the growing demand."

“The energy space in India is changing with a new focus on solar, wind etc., and then there is talk of a huge shift towards electric vehicles...where will you get the manpower from,"" said Sunil Kumar Maheshwari, a professor at IIM-A, referring to the need of such a specialised school and why IIM-A joined hands with NTPC.
Maheshwari, who will head a group of professors from IIM-A to help NTPC achieve its goal said the energy sector has a good potential for creating demand for talents and unless manpower is trained, it will be tough to achieve scale.
India’s renewable energy sector is expected to generate more than 330,000 new jobs over the next five years (2017-2022), according to a report by World Resources Institute (WRI) released in November. India is aiming to install 175 gigawatt (GW) of renewable power by 2022. “Energy sector offers huge opportunity - both in terms of research and consultancy - and going forward, we would explore to work with organisations like NITI Aayog and other ministries both in the centre and states,"" said G.C. Tripathi, deputy director general (academics) at NTPC. 
He said some 20 acres have been identified in Noida for the school. 
“We wish to create a strong research and policy centre. To create manpower for this centre, the NTPC school shall be the ideal institute to take lead and this will become a centre of excellence for policy research and policy documentation,"" Maheshwari said.
Maheshwari said IIM-A will help in designing the course, teaching, helping in faculty recruitment and working on joint projects. IIM-A will not offer its MBA degrees to the new school. 
Authorities said NTPC has obtained required approval from All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) to offer two-year post graduate courses. Both NTPC’s school and IIM-A will share intellectual property rights (IPR) over new products developed as part of the joint research.
“When IIM-A was established in early 1960s, we got handholding from Harvard. Now, we want to handhold the NTPC school to become a reputed school like IIM-A,"" Maheshwari added."

New Delhi: GE Power India on Tuesday said it has been awarded a contract worth Rs309 crore by NTPC to install its flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) system at Phase-I (2X800 MW) of its super thermal power project (STPP) in Telangana. 
New Delhi: GE Power India on Tuesday said it has been awarded a contract worth Rs309 crore by NTPC to install its flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) system at Phase-I (2X800 MW) of its super thermal power project (STPP) in Telangana.
This is the first standalone FGD order for GE in the country since the notification of new emission norms for thermal power plants by the ministry of environment, forests & climate change (MoEFCC) in December 2015, a GE Power statement said.
The wet FGD system will have a wet limestone-based open spray tower type design, comprising of an absorber system, slurry preparation and dewatering system. The FGD package will be installed in a period of 30 months for unit-1 and 36 months for unit-2 from the date of contract, it added. 
“Technologies such as FGD can play a significant role in controlling emissions from coal-based plants by reducing the SOx content in exit flue gas to the lowest levels anywhere in the world,"" said Andrew H. DeLeone, managing director, GE Power India in a statement. 
Following the emission norms for SOx (sulphur oxides) control issued by environment ministry in December 2015, it is mandatory for all thermal power plants in India to install FGD technology. An installed base of around 165GW of thermal plant has been identified by CEA for implementation of FGD, over and above the power plants presently under execution, it added. 
With this new award, GE will further strengthen its position in the FGD market. This builds on GE’s previous standalone FGD project in India for NTPC’s phase V, unit- XIII (1 X 500MW) Vindyachal thermal power plant. In addition, GE is also executing turbine island package for Telangana phase-I (2X800MW) STPP, it said."

New Delhi: India’s biggest power producer NTPC Ltd has decided to exit the joint venture with Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL), saying it is not a manufacturer of equipment and would rather concentrate on setting up and operating power plants.  
New Delhi: India’s biggest power producer NTPC Ltd has decided to exit the joint venture with Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL), saying it is not a manufacturer of equipment and would rather concentrate on setting up and operating power plants. 
NTPC-BHEL Power Projects Pvt. Ltd was set up in December 2007 as a 50:50 joint venture for manufacturing power equipment. 
The joint venture’s first manufacturing facility at Mannavaram in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh started operations in 2016 but had very little orders. Top NTPC sources said the company has decided to exit the venture and has informed the power ministry about its intentions. 
NTPC wants BHEL to buy its equity in the joint venture, they said. The two companies had invested Rs50 crore each as equity in the joint venture. The power producer wants BHEL to acquire its 50% stake in the JV as also all the assets and liabilities and absorb all the employees, they said. 
The joint venture had little revenue visibility and needed a fresh injection of new orders or a new blueprint to sustain itself. Also, a drying market for thermal power equipment has had a toll on the joint venture company. 
Fund crunch, land acquisition and environmental issues, general lack of demand for coal-based power and government’s emphasis on renewable sources of power have left little to fight for in the thermal power equipment market. 
Originally, NTPC had lobbied with the government to force BHEL to form a joint venture company. This because NTPC thought BHEL was slow in supplying equipment, leading to delays in commissioning of its plants. 
The joint venture was to carry out engineering, procurement and construction activities in the power sector. Its life largely depended on orders from NTPC, managing to secure only four orders in over a decade-long existence – the largest being of  ₹ 2,219 crore for the 500 MW Feroze Gandhi Unchahar thermal power project out of total orders worth  ₹ 2,717 crore. 
Industry sources said the two state-owned companies had come together with the understanding that part of the work of projects that BHEL bagged from NTPC would be given to the joint venture company. 
The role of the equal joint venture was initially confined to balance of plant equipment such as coal-handling, ash-handling and water treatment facility."

New Delhi: State-run power giant NTPC has deferred auction of 2,000 MW solar capacities to the first week of June as developers have sought resolution of inter-state connectivity issue before going ahead with the sale, people familiar with the matter said. 
Besides, the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) is likely to extend the bid submission for 2,000 MW solar capacities scheduled for the first week of June, industry people with knowledge of the matter said. The people said that the NTPC’s 2,000 MW solar bid submissions scheduled on 21 May 2018, has been deferred to June first week after considering concerns expressed by developers about difficulties being faced for getting power evacuation connectivity through the inter-state transmission system. 
The Solar Power Developers Association had written to the Ministry of New and Renewable (MNRE) to extend solar auctions till the issue related to grant of connectivity through inter-state transmission system is not resolved. 
Developers had also raised the issue in the pre-bid meeting with MNRE and SECI officials last week. Power regulator Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) approved the procedure for grant of connectivity through inter-state transmission system in its order on 15 May 2018. 
However, the people said that the industry feedback is awaited on the approved guidelines whether all concerns raised on the draft procedures have been resolved in the final order. The government has planned to auction 60 GW solar capacities in 2018-19 and 2019-20 in view of its ambitious target of having 100 GW solar energy capacity by 2022. 
The auction of 60 GW solar capacity by March 2020 is important because it takes about 15 months to implement solar project after signing power purchase agreement. India has already achieved 22GW of solar capacity."

103,2018-05-30,NTPC,"NTPC's under-recovery of fixed costs during FY18 stood at Rs1,433 crore, of which Rs800 crore was due to non-availability of coal

NTPC Ltd’s double-digit growth in revenue and profit for the March quarter (Q4) may have been impressive but investors were not enthused. Its shares gained after the Q4 results announcement on Monday but declined on Tuesday. 
NTPC Ltd’s double-digit growth in revenue and profit for the March quarter (Q4) may have been impressive but investors were not enthused. Its shares gained after the Q4 results announcement on Monday but declined on Tuesday.
The core of the company’s woes lies in fuel supply constraints. Limited availability of coal at some of its plants is crimping plant availability, thereby leading to an under-recovery of fixed costs. Under-recovery of fixed costs during fiscal year 2018 (FY18) stood at Rs1,433 crore, of which Rs800 crore was due to non-availability of coal. Other contributors include lack of clearance to operate a plant and closure of a plant due to an accident.
The company is working with Coal India Ltd and Indian Railways to find a resolution, but it can be a time-consuming process. According to the management, fuel situation at two plants has improved but not entirely resolved.
The cost under-recovery and the subsequent financial impact on NTPC’s performance are weighing on its stock. Consolidated profit for FY18 is down 2%. 
Even the March quarter profits would have risen in single digits, if one adjusts for one-time items, points out Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. “Profit after tax is adjusted for Rs430 crore under-recovery of fixed charge and many prior-period items,"" the brokerage firm said in a note. “Calculated core adj. profit grew ~6% YoY.""
The subdued performance on its earnings front has been a dampener despite the company seeing robust capacity additions. The stock has trailed the benchmark index over the last year. At the group level, NTPC added 4,098 megawatts (MW) of commercial capacity in FY18. It plans to add almost 5,000MW in FY19 and a similar amount of capacity next year, which should help maintain growth trajectory over the long run due to the regulated nature of the business—the firm earns fixed return on equity (RoE).
But as underperformance of its shares show, not everybody is subscribing to this. An analyst with a domestic broking firm pointed out that one concern is the challenge on the fuel availability front. Secondly, there is a risk of higher interest rates pushing up project costs. Thirdly, there is an impending change in the regulations on regulated returns.
The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission has published its draft consultation paper for regulated tariffs for FY20-FY24. According to Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd, the paper suggests a three-part tariff of fixed charges to recover the assured returns against the existing two-part tariff. 
Most analysts do not expect the regulator to change the regulated RoE for existing plants but fear RoE revision for new plants. While nothing is close to finalization, the new regulations are being seen as potential risk. 
Overall, while capacity additions and the regulatory business model places NTPC on a firm footing, cost under-recovery and potential regulatory changes pose challenges in the near term."

The utility also posted its highest quarterly electricity generation, suggesting a recovery in the country’s electricity demand.
“The generation during Q1 FY 2018-19, is the highest quarterly generation, surpassing previous highest quarterly generation of 68.56 Billion Units during Q4 FY 2017-18,"" the utility said in a statement while announcing the standalone unaudited financial results for the first quarter of financial year 2018-19. 
Power minister Raj Kumar Singh said last month that growing demand for electricity is an indicator of India’s economic growth, and with the 10% rise in billed energy, the gap between the average cost of supply and average revenue realised is also narrowing.
NTPC, which has an installed capacity of 53651 mega watt (MW) posted a 11.18% increase in total income to  ₹ 22,839.98 crore for the first quarter as compared to  ₹ 20,541.93 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.
India’s economy accelerated to 7.7% in the three months ended 31 March, the fastest in seven quarters, signalling a turnaround that could augur well for the election prospects of the Narendra Modi government.
“NTPC Coal stations achieved PLF (plant load factor) of 77.98% in Q1 FY 2018-19 as against National Average of 63.38%,"" the statement added.
PLF is a measure of output of a power plant, with a higher PLF indicating more output at a lower cost.
The utility is slated to play a key role in helping meet the demand generated by Saubhagya scheme (Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana), launched to provide electricity connections to more than 40 million families in rural and urban areas by December 2018. This in turn will help improve India’s per capita power consumption of around 1,200 kilowatt hour."
97,2018-07-30,NTPC,"Placing NHPC in the NTPC fold may help the government shore up its revenues, but it can take the sheen out of NTPC's long awaited capacity-addition-led earnings growth envisaged by the Street

A larger capacity base and higher generation helped NTPC Ltd report double digit-growth in revenues during the June quarter. Earnings, however, remain suppressed with the profit seeing a slight fall from the year ago, as the chart shows. The management is meeting analysts on 1 August, when more clarity on prior period adjustments, if any, should emerge. 
A larger capacity base and higher generation helped NTPC Ltd report double digit-growth in revenues during the June quarter. Earnings, however, remain suppressed with the profit seeing a slight fall from the year ago, as the chart shows. The management is meeting analysts on 1 August, when more clarity on prior period adjustments, if any, should emerge.
The reported numbers indicate a mixed performance.
Coal power plant utilization levels continue to trend lower against expansion at the thermal sector level in Q1. This can be due to slow ramp-up of the newly added plants. But as interest and depreciation costs rose sharply tracking the new capacity additions, profit dropped. This indicates insufficient revenue accretion.
Apart from prior period adjustments, investors will also be keen to know the fuel availability situation. NTPC’s performance in earlier quarters was weighed down by cost under-recoveries due to insufficient fuel supplies.
June quarter numbers show an improved situation. Coal supplies saw a notable improvement. The drop in plant availability factor (on which the incentives are based) also reduced considerably from March quarter.
Nevertheless, it has to be seen how much succour it can provide to investors. The stock has been underperforming the broader markets, even as the company embarked on a strong capacity addition plan that assures growth and revenue visibility.
Tepid earnings reflected in subdued quarterly results have been a reason. Fuel availability challenges and the resultant cost under-recoveries added to the concerns. Even so, the strong capacity addition pipeline has been a major selling point for sell side analysts. This assumption came under threat last week.
The stock slumped last week after reports said that the NTPC may be asked to purchase hydro power producer NHPC Ltd. Both companies work on regulated business model, earning fixed return on equity. But NHPC, due to its nature of projects—hydropower plants in hill stations—has been a laggard, facing huge cost overruns and execution delays. Placing NHPC in the NTPC fold may help the government shore up its revenues, but it can take the sheen out of NTPC’s long awaited capacity-addition-led earnings growth envisaged by the Street.
While no firm plans have been announced yet and earnings are yet to see a meaningful acceleration, wary investors may as well wait on the sidelines."

New Delhi: State-run NTPC Ltd on Monday deferred a tender for 2,000 megawatts (MW) solar power by a week as local companies started to feel the effect of a safeguard duty on solar cell and module imports from China and Malaysia, said two people aware of the development.
The postponement of reverse auction by India’s largest power generation utility was triggered by concerns among pre-qualified bidders on the impact of the safeguard duty on their financial models. 
The solar developers had submitted technical bids to participate in the reverse auction ahead of the imposition of the safeguard duty on 30 July.
To be sure, this is the second time that the auction has been deferred.
“This is the first interstate transmission system (ISTS)-connected solar auction by NTPC that has now been deferred to 14 August over safeguard duty concerns which will impact tariff to the tune of around 35-40 paise per unit,"" said one of the two people cited above, requesting anonymity.
India achieved a record low solar power tariff of  ₹ 2.44 per unit in May 2017. Earlier last month, tariffs again touched  ₹ 2.44 per unit in an auction conducted by state-run Solar Energy Corp. of India.
“Representation was made to NTPC to defer the auction given the uncertainty introduced by the safeguard duty,"" said the chief executive officer of a New Delhi-based company that prequalified to bid for the auction, who requested anonymity.
With modules making up nearly 60% of a solar power project’s total cost, a majority of Indian developers have placed orders with Chinese manufacturers because of their competitive pricing.
When contacted, an NTPC spokesperson declined comment.
For China’s solar module manufacturing capacity, estimated to be around 70 gigawatts (GW) per year, the major markets are the US, India and China itself.
“We have given one-week extension because certain formalities need to be completed internally. It was earlier deferred as well when there was no issue of safeguard duty,"" said a senior NTPC executive, seeking anonymity."

New Delhi: Tariffs for solar power touched Rs2.59 per unit in a tender called by state-run NTPC Ltd for 2,000 megawatts (MW) on Tuesday.
Acme Solar Holdings, Shapoorji Pallonji Infrastructure Capital Co. Ltd and Azure Power bid  ₹ 2.59 per kilo-watt hour (kWh) to win contracts to build plants of 600 MW, 500 MW and 300 MW each respectively, according to two people aware of the development.
SoftBank-owned SB Energy bid  ₹ 2.60 per kWh at which it will sell solar power, to win contracts to develop 600 MW. This was the first interstate transmission system (ISTS)-connected solar auction conducted by NTPC Ltd, India’s largest power generation utility, with these plants to be commissioned two years after signing of the power purchase agreement.
India achieved a record low solar power tariff of  ₹ 2.44 per unit in May 2017. Earlier last month, tariffs again touched  ₹ 2.44 per unit in an auction conducted by state-run Solar Energy Corp. of India.
India’s finance ministry imposed safeguard duty on 30 July on the recommendations of Directorate General of Trade Remedies. A safeguard duty of 25% has been imposed for the first year, followed by a 5% reduction for the first six months of the second year to 20%. A duty of 15% has been levied for the last six months of the second year.
The Tuesday bids came in the backdrop of the government temporarily suspending the 25% safeguard duty on solar cells and modules imported from China and Malaysia. In a letter to the Chief Commissioner of Customs dated 13 August, the government asked customs officials “not to insist on payment of safeguard duty, for the time being"". The latest notification recognizes the stay till 20 August on the duty that the Odisha high court had ordered on 25 July.
When contacted, an NTPC spokesperson declined comment. The winning bidders couldn’t be immediately reached for their comments.

India is confident of achieving its ambitious target of 100 GW solar power by 2022 despite the imposition of a safeguard duty on imported solar components, Anand Kumar, secretary in the ministry of new and renewable energy had earlier told Mint.
Kumar said that the safeguard duty won’t hit India’s solar plans as developers will factor the higher cost in their bids. India had 21.65 GW of solar capacity as of end-March.
India, the world’s third-largest energy consumer after the US and China, is running the world’s largest clean energy programme with an aim of having 175 GW of clean energy capacity by 2022 as part of its global climate change commitments. Its plan to add 100 GW of solar capacity by 2022 includes 40 GW from rooftop projects."

India’s largest power producer is seeking bids to import coal after a gap of about four years, highlighting a supply crunch users of the fuel are facing as shipments in the country fall short of demand.
State-run NTPC Ltd. is seeking a total of 2.5 million metric tons of imported coal, according to two separate tenders on its website. The company said in an email it last issued tenders for imported coal in 2014. It is looking to boost supplies as plants accounting for more than half its total capacity had less than seven days of coal stock as on 13 August, data from the Central Electricity Authority shows.
Production at Coal India Ltd., which produces more than 80% of the country’s coal, has failed to keep pace with rising demand, driven mainly by higher electricity generation. A congested railway network and a shortage of railway carriers to ship the coal add to the problem, forcing consumers from power plants to aluminum smelters to purchase the fuel from overseas or reduce plant utilisation.
“NTPC has faced coal shortages at some of its plants and imports can help plug the gap,"" said Anuj Upadhyay, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. “It shows the company’s preparedness for the coming months, when electricity demand is expected to grow even further after the end of the rainy season and the start of the festive season."" India’s electricity demand rose 5.6% from a year earlier in the four months ended 30 July, according to CEA data.
NTPC has sought coal with gross calorific value of not less than 4,700 kilo calorie a kilogram and has specified that the ash content should be a maximum of 20%, the bid documents show. The overseas shipments it’s seeking equal 4.4% of total imports by India’s power stations in the year ended 31 March, according to Bloomberg calculations based on CEA data. The last date for submission of bids for both tenders is 11 September."

New Delhi: State-run power giant NTPC’s board has approved an investment of  ₹ 9,785 crore for the 1,320 MW Stage-III expansion of its Talcher thermal power plant in Odisha, a source said.
The Talcher plant, one of the oldest and top performing power stations in the country, is situated in Angul district of Odisha. The 1,320 MW expansion is a brownfield project. The plant has four units of 60 MW and two units of 110 MW. The existing capacity is operational.
“The board has approved the 2x660 MW — Stage III expansion of Talcher Thermal Power Station of NTPC at an investment of  ₹ 9,785 crore,"" the source said.
The company has a multi-pronged growth strategy, including capacity addition through greenfield projects, expansion of existing stations, joint ventures and acquisition of stressed assets.
During 2017-18, the NTPC Group contributed 23% of the total electricity generated in India with 16% share of the country’s total installed capacity. The company has added 3,478 MW capacity in 2017-18. NTPC’s long term corporate plan envisages becoming a 130 GW company by 2032.
The NTPC Group has total capacity of 53,651 MW from 21 coal-based, seven gas-based, 11 solar PV, one hydro, one small hydro, one wind and nine subsidiaries / joint venture power stations. It has 20,000 MW capacity coming up at multiple locations across the country."

Writing for Mint last year, Prashant Jain, executive director and chief investment officer of HDFC Mutual Fund, said it was not easy to remain invested in equities for long periods. “Those who can simply sit still know its immense benefits,"" wrote Jain. NTPC Ltd seems to be practising this precept, albeit in a slightly different way. 
Writing for Mint last year, Prashant Jain, executive director and chief investment officer of HDFC Mutual Fund, said it was not easy to remain invested in equities for long periods. “Those who can simply sit still know its immense benefits,"" wrote Jain. NTPC Ltd seems to be practising this precept, albeit in a slightly different way.
India’s largest electricity generator has remained silent on the opportunities in stressed power plants, despite having sound financials and a balance sheet to stomach acquisitions. The company may well be waiting for the stressed assets to enter the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for the proceedings to acquire legal sanctity, which can help it avoid undue scrutiny.
The caution is appreciated. The NTPC stock has gained 6.8% in the past month compared to 1.9% rise of the Sensex. “(NTPC) has been most prudent in its acquisition and turnaround of inefficient state plants that came with assured return on equity (RoE), power purchasing agreement (PPA) and coal,"" JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd said in a note, adding: “Alternatively, NTPC has already proposed a partnership with banks, wherein banks may take over the ownership of the asset, while NTPC is roped in as the technical partner to operate these plants for a fixed fee. This will benefit NTPC as it could earn higher revenues without incurring commensurate costs and infusing any equity capital.""
Even if the company has to bid for and acquire a stressed plant, NTPC has to be careful that it does not dilute its returns. Despite inexpensive valuations and a strong capacity addition pipeline assuring long-term earnings growth trajectory, the stock has not done too well in the long run. Its returns have been 13.9% per annum over the last three years, slightly lower than the 14.9% of the Sensex.
One reason is the cost under-recoveries the company has witnessed of late. The other is the uncertainty over impending tariff regulations. 
Even so, many believe the current low valuations—NTPC trades at 11 times its FY20 price to earnings (P/E) estimates—reflect the market’s concerns.
But low valuations alone cannot guarantee returns.
As Nomura Research pointed out in a recent report, relative to its regional peers in Asia (Asean and Hong Kong), NTPC’s P/B (price-to-book value) and P/E multiples are fairly benign, but not compelling if one views them in conjunction with expected return on equity (see chart). NTPC hopes that it will not see adverse regulatory changes, which will help improve its return ratio. 
A returns dilutive acquisition now will, however, upset the assumption. “Deployment of cash to acquire assets in non-core business lines with low visibility on returns and/or leveraged buyout of generation assets entailing returns, which are inferior to those in its in core business, would delay the improvement in reported RoE,"" warns Nomura Research."

New Delhi: A day ahead of Odisha Investors Meet, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Tuesday raised the issue of delay in approvals for state-run NTPC Ltd’s  ₹ 9,785 crore Talcher expansion project with state’s chief minister Naveen Patnaik.
This comes in the backdrop of ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) government trying to drum up investments for the state in the countdown to the state assembly elections next year. Enthused by its success in panchayat polls last year, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has also sharpened its focus on Odisha, a state that is among a handful not ruled by it.
Pradhan, who is being seen as the BJP’s face in Odisha has sought Naveen Patnaik’s personal intervention over delay in approval for setting up of NTPC’s 1,320-megawatts (MW) Talcher expansion project at an investment of  ₹ 9,785 crore and “send the right signals about ease of doing business in the state.""

In association with industry lobby group Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). Odisha government will apprise investors and business houses about opportunity in the state. Patnaik has already held investors meet in Kolkata, Mumbai and Ahmedabad.
“The NTPC board on 10th Septemeber, 2018 has approved  ₹ 9,785 crores investment for the project. The project has obtained land, water, environmental and other statutory clearances. But, being a large project it requires project clearance by High Levl Committee (HLC) of the state government. Unfortunately, NTPC is still awaiting approval of the HLC despite applying online for single window clearance on 19.04.2017,"" Pradhan said in the letter, a copy of which has been reviewed by Mint.
“Lack of requisite clearance for such big-ticket investments even after a lapse of more than 15 months will dampen the investment climate in Odisha and send a wrong signal to the investor community,"" the letter added. In the panchayat polls, the BJP won 297 zilla parishad seats, up from 36 in 2012 and was a close second to the BJD.
“The proposed power project by NTPC is expected to make power available to the people of Odisha at a cheaper rate because of easy availability of coal and use of latest technology,"" the letter added.
With an average power demand of 4,000-MW, Odisha’s rural electricity consumption is expected to grow in the backdrop of electricity reaching its villages and setting the stage for universal household electrification.

90,2018-09-12,NTPC,"Recent news of the government's in-principle approval for stock buy-backs in PSUs could be a boon to the share prices of Bharat Heavy Electricals (Bhel), NBCC India and NTPC

Investors can hope for some action in PSU (public sector unit) stocks, after a long and disappointing period of underperformance. The BSE PSU index has fallen 13% since January while the Sensex rose by 18%, but that may be about to change. Recent news of the government’s in-principle approval for stock buy-backs in PSUs could be a boon to the share prices of Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel), NBCC (India) Ltd and NTPC Ltd. Most PSU stocks have been languishing as a result of lacklustre performance and buy-backs could be the pick-me-up the doctor ordered. 
Investors can hope for some action in PSU (public sector unit) stocks, after a long and disappointing period of underperformance. The BSE PSU index has fallen 13% since January while the Sensex rose by 18%, but that may be about to change. Recent news of the government’s in-principle approval for stock buy-backs in PSUs could be a boon to the share prices of Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel), NBCC (India) Ltd and NTPC Ltd. Most PSU stocks have been languishing as a result of lacklustre performance and buy-backs could be the pick-me-up the doctor ordered.
If the buy-back is at a premium to the prevailing market price, which is normally the case, it may trigger a short-term rally. The Bhel stock, believed to be the most promising candidate among the PSUs for a buy-back, shot up 9% on 7 September, when the news hit the Street.
Another reason adding to the attraction of a stock buy-back is that the idle cash lying with the firm is used to reward shareholders. A buy-back up to 10% of the net worth can be done without shareholder approval. PSUs such as NBCC, Bhel, Coal India Ltd and the recently listed Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd have enough cash on their books and a 10% buy-back is unlikely to disturb cash flow for these firms. 
On the other hand, a buy-back is also likely to help the government in many ways. It will extinguish equity permanently to the extent of shares bought back. This will boost earnings per share and consequently improve the valuation of the firm. Return on equity (ROE) will go up too. This may support PSU stock prices. Note that most of these shares have turned north only in the last one month, as news of buy-backs started doing the rounds on the Street. 
A report by Nomura Research underlines the benefits: “For years, PSUs have suffered from poor capital allocation practices in India, with accumulated cash which is used either for unproductive or poorly planned capex. As such, cash distribution through any form is a welcome change, in our view, and boosts ROE near-term and makes a case for a structural re-rating.""
The government will, of course, kill two birds with one stone. One, stock buy-backs can pull up valuations. Two, the government will get money into its kitty—the need of the hour, given the pressures on the fiscal deficit and the pressures a higher fiscal deficit will have on the external account, especially in these turbulent times in the market.
Also, the other route of garnering funds through disinvestment of equity may not be appropriate at the moment, as markets are in poor shape, with macroeconomic pressures weighing on sentiment. Buy-backs would then probably be the best way to raise money for the government. 
Of course, the fact remains that even if buy-backs lift the stocks of these PSUs temporarily, the performance of these companies needs to improve before the Street takes a sustained interest in them."

New Delhi: NTPC has invited expression of interest (EoI) for construction of fly ash-based geopolymer concrete roads at its plants to demonstrate use of this technology, a company official said. 
New Delhi: NTPC has invited expression of interest (EoI) for construction of fly ash-based geopolymer concrete roads at its plants to demonstrate use of this technology, a company official said.
“NTPC has invited players to construct fly ash-based geopolymer concrete roads. About 1,100 tonne of fly ash is used per km of geopolymer road,"" the official told PTI.
Earlier, the company has successfully completed a similar project at Dadri station as per Indian Roads Congress (IRC) specifications & accreditation. Moreover, 1.2-km double lane stretch are being constructed at Ramagundam and Farakka stations. These projects are being developed by NETRA, the R&D wing of NTPC. NETRA has also developed geopolymer concrete spun / hume pipes, tetra pods, tiles and is working on other applications as well.
Geopolymer concrete, an eco-friendly construction material, is a 100% replacement of cement and has a great potential as a binder as it sets to a material and gains strength more rapidly than Portland cement.
Geopolymer concrete has emerged as an important engineering material in recent times because of its utility in developing ecologically sound and sustainable construction materials. Concrete demand is expected to grow to 18 billion tonne per year globally by 2050. Portland cement is not only energy intensive but also responsible for large scale emission of CO2, the official added. During 2017-18, 32.23 million tonne of ash, which is 53.45% of the ash generated, was utilised for various productive purposes by the company.
Other important areas of ash utilisation are cement & asbestos industry, Ready Mix Concrete plants (RMC), road embankment, brick making, mine filling, ash dyke raising & land development.
The new initiatives for use of fly ash, like geopolymer road, transportation of ash from pithead power stations to fly ash consumption centres, setting up ash-based light weight aggregate plant etc, are being explored by NTPC, the official said.

New Delhi: NTPC Ltd., India’s largest electricity producer, is considering buying power plants run by indebted RattanIndia Power Ltd. and Jaiprakash Power Ventures Ltd., according to people familiar with the matter. 
New Delhi: NTPC Ltd., India’s largest electricity producer, is considering buying power plants run by indebted RattanIndia Power Ltd. and Jaiprakash Power Ventures Ltd., according to people familiar with the matter.
NTPC is doing an internal assessment of RattanIndia’s plants at Nasik and Amravati in the western state of Maharashtra and Jaiprakash’s Nigrie plant in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh state, the people said, asking not to be identified as the talks are private. The state-run generator will consider bidding if the creditors to the two companies decide to take these assets to bankruptcy court after failing to resolve debt issues.
Several projects could end up in bankruptcy courts if India’s Supreme Court decides at a scheduled hearing on Nov. 28 to lift an ongoing moratorium barring lenders from pursuing bankruptcy action against power producers. The power industry accounted for 5.65 trillion rupees ($78 billion) of loan exposure as of March, including debt that would be considered delinquent under the new rules, according to a report by a lawmakers’ panel.
An acquisition would allow New Delhi-based NTPC to expand at a lower cost, compared with building a new plant. These projects match the utility’s needs as they have working plants and machinery, railway connectivity, availability of water and regulatory approvals. It would also mark a shift in strategy for the company as it has mostly stayed away from competitive bids to boost capacity.
Raising funds for an acquisition will not be difficult for NTPC, the people said. The company had a cash balance of about 44 billion rupees ($616 million) as of March 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
NTPC and Jaiprakash didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment, while RattanIndia Power’s Managing Director Jayant Shriniwas Kawale declined to comment.
The producers have argued that delayed payments from electricity buyers, fuel shortages and late compensation for costs impacted their cash flows and constrained them from complying with rules that required banks to start debt resolution after a single day’s default.
RattanIndia’s two plants have a combined installed capacity of 2,700 megawatts, while Nigrie has a capacity of 1,320 megawatts. NTPC could add more plants to its list of targets, the people said, adding a bid will be made only after the projects are listed in bankruptcy court."
81,2018-12-18,NTPC,"Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has suggested continuation of the 15.5% regulated return on equity (RoE) for power companies

Shares of NTPC Ltd and Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd gained 1.7% and 3.7% on Monday after the sector regulator proposed continuation of current incentives. In a positive surprise, the draft note from the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) suggests continuation of the 15.5% regulated return on equity (RoE) for generation and transmission companies. 
Shares of NTPC Ltd and Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd gained 1.7% and 3.7% on Monday after the sector regulator proposed continuation of current incentives. In a positive surprise, the draft note from the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) suggests continuation of the 15.5% regulated return on equity (RoE) for generation and transmission companies.
The regulated RoE has been maintained despite a noticeable reduction in interest rates. Tariff regulations are set every five years. When they were announced in early 2014, the benchmark 10-year government bond yield was at 8.8%. It’s now at 7.4%. Tracking this, most analysts were pencilling a cut in RoE. Despite the rise in bond yields in the past year, nobody was expecting continuation of the RoE at the current level.
With more than 90% of Power Grid’s profits driven by the regulated RoE, it benefits the most, said analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. Once commissioned, transmission projects have limited operating risks. So yield and profitability is more intertwined to finance costs and the regulated rate of return. So, while their interest costs have fallen, stable returns means margins will increase.
The scenario is slightly different for NTPC. Apart from the regulated RoE, utilization levels, operating efficiency and scope of cost recovery also influence NTPC’s earnings. Here, the regulator proposed tighter norms for fixed cost recovery on parameters such as fuel inventories and working capital finance cost.
On the other hand, the regulator did propose relief on the loss of the calorific value of coal during storage. Consequently, NTPC’s earnings are estimated to see only an incremental rise. “Our earnings per share estimates could rise 1% for FY20E-21E if this draft is finalized,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note on NTPC.
Even so, continuation of the current RoE and the lack of major earnings dilutive measures bring relief for investors. The last tariff regulation changed the basis for incentive calculation from plant availability to utilization levels, making a significant dent to NTPC’s earnings. From this perspective, the proposals are less detrimental and remove a major overhang for the stocks.
But they alone cannot aid the stocks for long. As earnings lagged estimates, the stocks underperformed the benchmark index Nifty over the past year. The key reasons for the underperformance persist, with NTPC continuing to face fuel constraints. The outlook for Power Grid is weighed down by reducing opportunities in the transmission & distribution segment. The promise of stable RoE notwithstanding, what is crucial is how these companies overcome these challenges."

Coal India and Power Grid Corporation occupied the fourth and fifth spot in the list of top 10 profit making CPSEs (Central Public Sector Enterprises) in the 2017-18 fiscal.
The three worst performing PSUs, including BSNL, Air India and MTNL, contributed 52.15 per cent of the total loss incurred by CPSEs in 2017-18.

New Delhi: Half-a-dozen investors, including ReNew Power Ventures Pvt.

New Delhi: Half-a-dozen investors, including ReNew Power Ventures Pvt. Ltd and Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets , are interested in acquiring the  ₹ 5,000- crore clean energy business of debt-laden Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS), said one person aware of the development.
The transaction for one of India’s largest wind energy platforms will rank among the marque deals in the space, given that IL&FS has operational plants aggregating 873.5 megawatts (MW) and 104MW under construction. This is part of the asset monetization programme being undertaken by IL&FS to reduce its debt burden of  ₹ 91,000 crore. 
“There is considerable interest in IL&FS’s wind energy assets with around half-a-dozen firms looking at it,"" said the person cited above, requesting anonymity. 
The other investors may include India’s largest power generation utility NTPC Ltd, GAIL (India) Pvt. Ltd and Solar Energy Corp. of India Ltd. According to a Bloomberg report on Tuesday, these companies have expressed interest in buying some of the renewable energy assets of IL&FS.
This follows the collapse of a plan to merge Orient Green Power Co. Ltd’s (OGPL’s) wind power business with IL&FS Wind Energy Ltd in 2017. The proposed sale also comes at a time when the wind energy sector has transitioned from a feed-in tariff regime, which ensures a fixed price for wind power producers, to tariff-based competitive auctions. In such a scenario, obtaining finance at the lowest cost has become key.
“The firms have been aggregating capacities through acquisition as part of their strategy,"" said another person who didn’t want to be named.
The asset monetization programme of IL&FS includes the sale of its securities business, green energy assets and road and EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) capabilities. All asset sales will be subject to approvals (including from the National Company Law Tribunal). The board has appointed Arpwood Capital Pvt. Ltd and JM Financial Ltd as financial and transaction advisers.
Mint reported on 22 November that Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and the Edelweiss Group, among others had been approached for the road assets of IL&FS Transportation Networks (ITNL), a unit of IL&FS.
ReNew Power counts Goldman Sachs, sovereign wealth fund Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Canadian pension fund CPPIB, Japan’s Jera Co. Inc. and Global Environment Fund among its investors.
IL&FS also has asset management services for wind energy and a business division conducting project development and implementation for the sector. It is also looking to sell solar power projects under development totalling 300MW capacity.
Spokespersons for Macquarie and ReNew Power declined to comment.
Queries emailed to the spokespersons of IL&FS, Arpwood Capital Pvt. Ltd and JM Financial Ltd on Sunday evening remained unanswered at press time.
The stake sale may be executed as a basket, or individually, or in any combination thereof. Serial debt defaults at IL&FS and its subsidiaries that triggered a liquidity squeeze in the non-banking financial sector prompted the government to supersede the board of the infrastructure lender on 1 October.
The news comes amid growing consolidation in India’s emerging green economy. Recently, Greenko Group—one of India’s largest renewable energy platforms—acquired Orange Renewable from Singapore’s AT Capital Group at an enterprise value of under $1 billion and another 385MW of renewable assets from Skeiron Renewable Energy. 
Other deals in the works as reported by Mint include Morgan Stanley looking to exit its stake in Continuum Wind Energy; Fotowatio Renewable Ventures is planning to exit its only investment in the Indian solar power space, and Edelweiss Infrastructure Yield Plus Fund is in talks with Engie SA to pick up a significant stake in the French energy firm’s Indian solar business.
Also, the country’s largest electricity trader, PTC India Ltd, plans to exit its wind power business; Actis Llp has agreed to buy Essel Infraprojects Ltd’s solar power projects and Goldman Sachs-backed ReNew Power Ventures Pvt. Ltd acquired Actis’ Ostro Energy Pvt. Ltd."

77,2019-01-31,NTPC,"Though cost under-recoveries are falling, they remain sizeable. Last quarter, the firm was unable to recover  ₹160 crore NTPC’s working capital is getting stretched, adding to finance costs

Shares of NTPC Ltd have lost 19% over the past year as tight fuel supplies impacted utilization levels at its power plants, weighing on earnings. The December quarter has been relatively better on the operations front. Compared to a fall in the past three quarters, both availability and utilization levels of the coal plants improved year-on- year.
The improvement drove up generation, helping the company clock a 15% rise in revenue. But as was the case in earlier quarters, this growth yielded limited earnings benefits. Reported profit was up just 1%. Perhaps to assuage investors’ concerns, the NTPCboard recommended a 1:5 bonus issue of equity shares.
Further the company’s efforts to resolve fuel issues are bearing fruit. It issued an import tender and began lifting additional coal from Coal India Ltd.
The measures will almost halve the cost under-recoveries due to fuel constraints in the current fiscal year (vis-à-vis the previous one), the management told analysts.
But how much of a boost these measures and the bonus issue can provide to investor sentiment has to be seen. Though cost under-recoveries due to fuel constraints are falling, they remain sizeable. Last quarter the company was unable to recover as much a  ₹160 crore.
With NTPC planning to add 4,000 megawatts (MW) in the rest of the fiscal year and an estimated 5,000MW in FY20, some wonder if the company will be able to find the required fuel at affordable rates.
Adding to the concerns is payment delays from several state utilities. The delays are attributed to weak financial position of the concerned states. Also the company is making advance payments to Indian Railways, a major vendor.
As a consequence, NTPC’s working capital is getting stretched, adding to finance costs.
The company does have a redressal mechanism in place. For instance, it levies a surcharge on delayed payments. But the net impact of all this— cost under-recoveries, large advances to Indian Railways and delay in payments—is a huge impact on NTPC’s earnings. The reported profit in the first nine months of FY19 was flat from year-ago levels.
So while NTPC may continue to have an enviable capacity addition pipeline assuring growth trajectory, other concerns are weighing on investor sentiment. This can limit the much awaited expansion in stock valuations."

NTPC :
NTPC Ltd, the country's largest electricity generator, Friday said it has paid an interim dividend of  ₹2,951.88 crore for the financial year ending March 31, 2019.
The dividend is 35.8 per cent of the paid-up equity share capital of the company, NTPC said in a statement.
The Government of India, which owns 58.93 per cent stake in NTPC, received  ₹1,739.61 crore as its share in the interim dividend.

71,2019-03-06,NTPC,"NTPC, despite its fool-proof agreements with state utilities, may feel the heat as wellThe aggregate technical and commercial losses (AT&C) stood at 19.72% of electricity purchases

While the government may have succeeded in improving the availability of electricity in India, the lack of focus on other areas, such as distribution losses and timely payments, can delay the revival of the power sector.
The aggregate technical and commercial losses (AT&C), which reflects transmission and collection efficiency, stood at 19.72% of electricity purchases, according to the latest government data for 26 states. The Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana, a scheme targeted to turn around the moribund power distribution companies (discoms), had targeted to reduce these losses to 15% by the end of 2018-19.
The scheme did yield some benefits. All India AT&C losses before the introduction of the scheme amounted to 22% in FY14. Transfer of debt from discoms to state governments reduced their financial burden, and facilitated electricity purchases. But with high losses continuing, discoms are hitting a financial logjam again.
Signs of trouble emerged in 2018, when companies, such as NTPC Ltd, started witnessing payment delays. But now the situation seems to have scaled to such high levels that the industry body (Association of Power Producers) is seeking government intervention.
From  ₹14,864 crore at the end of FY18, the total outstanding amount receivable from discoms jumped 75% to  ₹26,267 crore by 31 December 2018, shows data from a government portal on payments. While producers will be allowed to charge extra for payment delays, the bigger worry is the underlying stress. If unaddressed, then discoms can eventually temper electricity purchases, warns Dhruv Muchhal, an analyst at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. Of course, state governments may not let the situation deteriorate ahead of the general election. But unless the government gives more financial support and beefs up payment collection methods, the nascent recovery in the power sector can be undermined. The impact will be more pronounced on independent power producers, who are already complaining through their industry association.
NTPC, despite its fool-proof agreements with state utilities, may feel the heat as well. The payment delays are stretching its working capital, and increasing expenses. While improving domestic coal supplies will help address some investor concerns, the earnings benefits can be undermined by the rise in financial costs.
“NTPC coal stock at power plants have been improving since January and is currently at 20 days vs 9 days in November, 2018, while generation lost due to coal/operations and maintenance are down by around 70% QoQ,"" JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd said in a 28 February note. “However the working capital-related interest cost under-recovery on railways advance and delayed payments from discoms may continue to impact 4Q FY19 earnings."""
70,2019-03-07,NTPC,"The government is expected to garner around  ₹15,000 crore from this mergerHe was replying to a question on whether such a consolidation can happen in the power sector to improve efficiency

NEW DELHI :
Power Minister R K Singh Thursday ruled out consolidating all state-owned power sector firms like NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL and PFC into a single entity, saying it would be the biggest company of the world but will not be manageable.
However, the minister said discussions are on regarding merger of some companies under the Power Ministry.
The issue of consolidation in the power sector gained prominence after the government recently approved REC's takeover by the Power Finance Corporation (PFC).
""If it (consolidation of all power sector PSUs) does happen, (then) it will be the biggest company of the world.
""But we have to think about whether it will manageable in the sense that you need managerial focus also and if it become too big and too diverse, it is matter of management control,"" Singh said at a press conference.
He was replying to a question on whether such a consolidation can happen in the power sector to improve efficiency.
When asked about mergers of some power sector PSUs, he said, ""Discussions are happening of and on.""
In December 2018, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved the sale of the government's 52.63 per cent stake in REC to PFC. The two state-owned firms are non-banking finance companies which fund power sector projects.
The government is expected to garner around  ₹15,000 crore from this merger.
Another proposal for SJVNL's takeover by state-run power giant NTPC is also under consideration of the government.
Industry experts said consolidation of firms in the same sector brings efficiency but one has to see that whether it leads to monopoly and also whether the mega entities would be manageable.
Earlier last year, the government had approved dilution of its 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) in favour of ONGC in the oil and gas sector.

69,2019-03-08,NTPC,"The makeover will cost the exchequer  ₹343 croreThe 884-acre forest will be provided with unique herbivore and carnivore safari

New Delhi: Citizens of the national capital will be able to enjoy wildlife safari from some time in 2021 as the government gets down to convert the site of the NTPC’s defunct Badarpur power plant into an eco park. The makeover will cost the exchequer  ₹343 crore.
Minister of state (independent charge) in the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri said on Thursday the 884-acre forest in the south west part of the city will be provided with unique herbivore and carnivore safari.
The 705-megawatt (MW) Badarpur plant, which began operations in 1973, came in NTPC’s fold in 2003, but as pollution concerns gripped the capital in the last decade, it was forced to shut down one unit after another.
The state-owned power generator shut the last two units — fourth and fifth — of 210 MW each in October last year under a Supreme Court order over environmental worries from the burning of the coal. The first three units of the plant were of 95 MW each."
68,2019-03-12,NTPC,"Power sector regulator CERC adopts a conciliatory tone on tariffs, removing an overhang for NTPCGovt approves an investment of  ₹31,000 crore in 4 power plants, announces sops for hydropower units

The power sector has benefitted from major policy changes that were announced last week. The policy changes can not only address pending investor concerns, but can also fast-track the recovery of the industry process. However, all of this depends on the policies being implemented well.
The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has adopted a conciliatory tone on tariffs, allowing compensation for the loss of coal heating value during storage and retained the current regulated return on equity. The regulations remove a key overhang for NTPC Ltd, which owns the highest number of regulated power plants.
“The final regulations addressed favourably key concerns on (1) lowering of regulated equity for assets beyond useful life, (2) compensation of gross calorific value loss during storage, (3) compensation for investment on pollution control equipment at 15.5%,"" analysts at Kotak institutional equities research said in a note.
The new regulations triggered a rise in the shares of NTPC and Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd, which hold a large number of regulated assets in the power transmission sector.
The second set of approvals came from the government. They involve sops for hydropower and measures to ease stress in thermal power plants.
The government approved an investment of  ₹31,000 crore in four power plants, which could in turn also improve project flow for capital goods companies. Another significant approval from the government was to allow greater flexibility for thermal power plants. Companies will now be allowed to seek coal linkage for selling power through short-term contracts.
Government entities will facilitate power purchase agreements (PPAs) through demand aggregation. These measures improve operational flexibility and can aid power plants that are facing financial stress.
Similarly, the proposal to term large hydropower projects (above 25 megawatts) as renewable energy and create a separate hydropower purchase obligation can give an impetus to hydro power usage.
The measures were much needed. Despite immense potential, the hydro sector is underdeveloped. Only 35% of the sector’s potential is developed till now, say analysts, pointing out that merely 11% of India’s electricity needs are met by hydropower plants. Even so, investors are not enthused. Shares of NHPC Ltd, the large developer of hydropower projects in India, have gained only around 2% in the last two trading sessions.
The subdued response reflects investors’ scepticism about implementation of the policies as the challenge in the hydropower sector is execution. Several NHPC projects have seen inordinate delays and have exceeded budgeted costs. This has pushed up tariffs and burdened users. As such, unless execution in the sector gathers pace, the latest push from the government will be of little help. 
“While it is a long term positive for the hydro sector, actual execution pace/support from government will determine pace of investments in this space,"" JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd said in a note.
Similarly, flexibility in fuel linkage will mean little for the thermal sector if actual coal production in India does not pick up.
Also, flexibility to renounce PPAs with defaulting power distribution companies can only worsen the generators’ situation, given the scarcity of large electricity contracts. The final tariff regulations remove a key overhang over the power sector. However, for the government’s policy push to yield noticeable benefits, much depends on execution."
67,2019-03-12,NTPC,"The new public sector unit will focus on aggregating electricity demand in the country and cater to it It is being set up at a time when the state owned discoms are struggling with their finances on account of losses and borrowings

New Delhi: State run NTPC Ltd and Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd (PGCIL) may shortly set up the National Electricity Distribution Company (NCDC)—a pan-India power distribution firm in an equal joint venture, said government officials aware of the development.
The new public sector unit will focus on aggregating electricity demand in the country and cater to it and may also take over weak electricity distribution utilities. It will comprise of cadre on deputation from other public sector units and is being set up at a time when the state owned distribution companies (discoms) are struggling with their finances on account of losses and borrowings. In such a situation, a national electricity distribution company can procure electricity at competitive rates and help address the issue of stressed assets in power generation.
“The contours of NCDC have been discussed upon and it will be set up by NTPC and PGCIL as a 50:50 JV,"" said a government official cited above requesting anonymity.
The distribution utilities have been beleaguered by issues such as low collection, increase in power purchase cost, inadequate electricity tariff hike, inadequate subsidy disbursement, and increasing government department dues. In turn, the poor payment records of discoms have not only adversely affected power generation companies, but has contributed in causing stress in the banking sector as well.
“Setting up the NCDC doesn’t require a cabinet approval,"" said the first government official cited above.
The plan is to set NCDC up along the lines of Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL), which is under the administrative control of the power ministry. EESL is an energy services company, jointly operated by four state run firms—NTPC Ltd, Power Finance Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation and Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd.
Bloomberg news wire agency on 26 February reported about NTPC and PGCIL being roped in for setting up the National Electricity Distribution Company (NCDC).
The government has also been working on a radical plan to separate the so-called carriage and content operations of existing power distribution companies, which was earlier proposed by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. Carriage refers to the distribution aspect and content to electricity. In industry parlance, these are known as “wire"" and “supply"". The separation will allow people and companies in India buy electricity from a power company of their choice, and have it supplied to them by the distribution network that services the neighbourhood in which they live.
The distribution sector holds the key to the long-term fortunes of the power sector. However, distribution companies have so far been the weakest link in the electricity value chain. Government data showed in the first half of FY19, losses rose to Rs15,080 crore from Rs11,071 crore a year earlier. This despite the discoms’ financial losses narrowing from Rs51,480 crore in FY16 to Rs15,049 crore in FY18. Consequentially discoms have not been making timely payments to generation firms and owe Rs36,134 crore to generation companies as of 31 January.
“The distribution sector is in a mess and hence the need for a National Electricity Distribution Company,"" said a second government official aware of the development cited above who also didn’t want to be named.
Also, rising non-performing assets (NPAs) in the power sector has been a major concern. The NPAs account for around 5.9% of the banking sector’s total outstanding advances of  ₹4.73 trillion, according to the Economic Survey 2016-17 released in August. However, there has been a recent upturn in power demand due to the spread of household electrification, increased supply to agricultural consumers, low hydropower generation and extended summers. Requisitioning of additional power by discoms has also led to a short-term hike in electricity prices.
Queries emailed to spokespersons of NTPC, PGCIL and power ministry on Friday evening remained unanswered.
As on September 2015, the total debt of all state owned discoms was estimated to be around Rs2.45 trillion, with Rs0.8 lakh crore serviced by the states. Also, the annual discom losses in FY16, FY17 and FY18 were funded through borrowings."
66,2019-03-15,NTPC,"The CPSE ETF was launched in 2014 and has seen three tranches since then. The current offering is the fourth trancheThe CPSE ETF has 11 PSUs, but just 4 companies—ONGC, NTPC, Coal India and Indian Oil—make up as much as 77% of the ETF

Mumbai: The government will launch a further fund offer (FFO) in the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSE) ETF next week. The exchange traded fund is managed by Reliance Nippon AMC. Investors are being offered a 4% discount on the ""reference market price"" of the underlying ETF shares.
The reference market price is the average of the full day volume weighted average price of the constituents of the Nifty CPSE Index on the NSE over 20 and 22 March. The offer will open and close for anchor investors on 19 March 2019. It will open for non anchor investors (including retail investors) on 20 March 2019 and close on 22 March 2019.
The CPSE ETF was launched in 2014 and has seen three additional offerings (tranches) since then. The current offering is the fourth tranche.
Investors who bought the CPSE ETF at its initial launch were offered a 5% discount and bonus units if they held the ETF for more than one year. Investors in the subsequent three offers were also offered discounts of 5%, 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively.
The CPSE ETF has 11 public sector companies, but just 4 companies—Oil and Natural Gas Corp. of India Ltd (ONGC), NTPC Ltd, Coal India Ltd and India Oil Ltd—make up as much as 77% of the ETF. 
These are not the same PSUs as the original composition of the CPSE ETF in 2014. A few PSUs such as GAIL (India) India, NTPC, Container Corporation of India (Concor) and Engineers India Ltd have been dropped while others like Neyveli Lignite Corp. Ltd (NLC), SJVN and NBCC India have been added to the ETF.
""The CPSE ETF is trading at very attractive valuations. As of 28 February, the dividend yield of the index was as high as 5.52% compared to 1.25% for the Nifty 50. The PE ratio was 8.43 compared to 26.32 on the Nifty. In addition, the government is also giving a 4% discount to investors,"" said Vishal Jain, head (ETFs) and fund manager at Reliance Nippon AMC.
Should you invest?
Experts are divided on this question. Shyam Sekhar, founder and ideator at financial consultancy iThought, came out in support of ETF on valuation and macroeconomic grounds.
“PSUs are extremely under-owned and have a lot of short-term negatives priced in. Overall economic growth has been muted in the last five years because there was no investment cycle revival. This is likely to change in the next 5 years regardless of who wins the election. CPSEs in the energy sector will benefit from this revival and an ETF is a good way to access them,"" said Sekhar.
Mumbai-based wealth manager Deepak Khemani recommended the CPSE ETF only as a short-term play due to the discount. “Ideally people should invest in ETFs for the long term. However in PSU-dominated ETFs like CPSE, investors usually enter only for the discount and exit soon after listing. I would not recommend this ETF as a long term investment. However someone who wants to capture the discount can do so,"" he said.
Mint take
The CPSE ETF consists wholly of government-owned companies and this comes with certain risks. Government companies are often managed from a welfare or political point of view rather than the profit motive and this can eat into investor returns.
For example, in January 2018, ONGC, a relatively profitable PSU oil company was forced to buy Hindsutan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) from the central government to help meet the government’s disinvestment target.
The CPSE ETF has also delivered poor returns in the past.
Its five-year returns stand at just 5.88% (as on 12 March 2019). Valuations of the ETF are indeed attractive compared to the broader market but this may just be a reflection of the poor performance of the ETF constituents and the lack of market confidence in them. The discount can offer short-term gains to investors who exit immediately after listing. However, short term market plays are not a tactic recommended by this pubication."

64,2019-03-20,NTPC,"A discount of 4% in the CPSE ETF can offer short term gains to investors who exit immediately after the listingThe CPSE ETF has 11 PSUs. Just four companies in the power, coal and oil sectors make up as much as 77% of the ETF—ONGC, NTPC, Coal India and IOC

The government’s further fund offer (FFO) of CPSE ETF will open to retail investors today and will be open till 22 March. The FFO was opened to anchor investors on 19 March and seeks to raise  ₹3,500 crore with an option to retain up to  ₹5,000 crore in case of oversubscription. The exchange-traded fund (ETF) is managed by Reliance Nippon AMC. Investors are being offered a 4% discount on the ‘reference market price’ of the underlying ETF shares. The reference market price is the average of the full day volume weighted average price of the constituents of the Nifty CPSE Index on the NSE over 20 and 22 March.
The CPSE ETF was launched in 2014 and has seen three FFOs since then. The current offering is the fourth FFO. Investors who bought the ETF at its initial launch were offered a 5% discount and bonus units if they held the ETF for more than one year. Investors in the subsequent three offers were also offered discounts of 5%, 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively. The CPSE ETF has 11 public sector companies. Just four companies in the power, coal and oil sectors make up as much as 77% of the ETF—ONGC, NTPC, Coal India and IOC. These are not the same PSUs as the original composition of the CPSE ETF in 2014. A few PSUs such as GAIL India, NTPC, Container Corporation of India and Engineers India have been dropped while others like NLC India, SJVN and NBCC India have been added. “The CPSE ETF is trading at very attractive valuations. As of 28 February, the dividend yield of the index was as high as 5.52% compared to 1.25% for the Nifty 50. The PE ratio was 8.43 compared to 26.32 on the Nifty. In addition, the government is also giving a 4% discount to investors,"" said Vishal Jain, head, ETFs, and fund manager, Reliance Nippon AMC.
Should you invest?
Experts are divided on this question. Shyam Sekhar, chief ideator and founder, iThought, came out in support of the ETF on valuation and macroeconomic grounds. “PSUs are extremely under-owned and have a lot of short-term negatives priced in. Overall, the economic growth has been muted in the last five years as there was no investment cycle revival. This is likely to change in the next five years regardless of who wins the election. CPSEs in the energy sector will benefit from this revival and an ETF is a good way to access them,"" he said.
Samant Sikka, founder, Sqrrl, an online mutual fund platform, also favoured the investment due to its ability to give low-cost exposure to multiple public sector firms. “Investors in the CPSE ETF are well served by the basket of companies, which spares them the time and effort needed to buy individual companies. The product is also highly transparent, liquid and low-cost,"" he said.
However, some believe that the CPSE ETF may not be a good idea from a long-term perspective. Deepak Khemani, a Mumbai-based wealth manager recommends the ETF only as a short-term play due to the discount. “Ideally, people should invest in ETFs for the long term. However, in PSU-dominated ETFs like CPSE, investors usually enter only for the discount and exit soon after listing. I would not recommend it as a long-term investment. However, someone who wants to capture the discount can do so,"" he said.
Mint’s take
The CPSE ETF consists wholly of the government-owned companies and this comes with certain risks. Government companies are often managed from a welfare or political point of view rather than the profit motive. For example, in January 2018, ONGC was forced to buy HPCL from the central government to help meet the government’s disinvestment target. The CPSE ETF has also delivered poor returns in the past. Its returns since launch stand at 6.62% CAGR (as on 19 March 2019). Valuations of the ETF are indeed attractive compared to the broader market but this may just be a reflection of the poor performance of the ETF constituents and the lack of market confidence in them. The discount can offer short-term gains to investors who exit immediately after listing. However, short-term market plays are not a tactic that we recommend."
63,2019-03-25,NTPC,"As much as  ₹3 trillion of investment in a dozen private power plants is at risk of turning into NPAs as per RBI normsMore than 80% of the outstanding is accounted for by India's most industrialized states, such as Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu

New Delhi: As much as  ₹3 trillion of investment in a dozen private power plants is at risk of turning into NPA as state discoms buying power have not been making payment for months, official data and sources said.
According to data available on the PRAAPTI portal of the power ministry, 12 power plants of private firms such as GMR and Adani Group and public sector generators like NTPC Ltd have about  ₹41,730 crore outstanding from state distribution companies (discoms) as of December 2018.
Dues as on date run into an estimated  ₹60,000 crore, half of it being towards independent power producers in the power sector.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled Uttar Pradesh has the most outstanding dues of  ₹6,497 crore, followed by Maharashtra at  ₹6,179 crore. Other states not paying power generating companies on time include Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab.
According to the PRAAPTI portal, Uttar Pradesh takes 544 days to clear its dues while Maharashtra takes 580 days.
More than 80% of the outstanding is accounted for by India's most industrialized states, such as Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, which are biggest consumers of electricity. The Top-10 states take an average of 562 days for payments.
According to people familiar with the matter, the delay in payments is posing severe working capital issues at the private power plants.
Delay in realization of receivables from state power discoms weakens the ability of project developers to service debt in a timely manner and leads to exhaustion of working capital in some cases, the people said, adding that delayed payments risk projects being termed NPAs under Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) norms.
In some cases, the discoms continue to press for renegotiating terms of power purchase agreement (PPA). This coupled with non-payment of penalties/late payment surcharges is causing financial stress for such projects, sources said.
Bajaj Group-owned Lalitput Power Generation Co. Ltd reportedly is unable to clear salaries of nearly 3,000 staff because of pending dues of over  ₹2,185 crore from discoms of Uttar Pradesh. So acute is the situation that the company is unable to maintain requisite coal stocks.
A recent World Bank study reviewing the power sector's performance points to issues such as outstanding payments to power generating companies.
The people said 37,823 megawatt (MW) capacity in the private sector, which was built at an investment of over  ₹3 trillion, is at risk due to delayed payments and run the possibility of being declared NPAs if timely repayment of bank debt is not made.
Out of the  ₹41,730 crore outstanding as on December 2018, Adani Group has to get  ₹7,433.47 crore and GMR another  ₹1,788.18 crore. Sembcorp has an outstanding payment of  ₹1,497.07 crore. State-owned NTPC has unpaid bills of  ₹17,187 crore."

NEW DELHI :
State-run power giant NTPC Wednesday said it has raised $450 million (about  ₹3,105 crore) through five-year bond offering in the international market under its $ 6 billion (about  ₹41,400 crore) medium term notes (MTN) programme.
NTPC had opened the issue of $ 450 million five-year bond offering in the international market on Tuesday, the company said in a statement.
In terms of geographical distribution, Asia took the bulk of the subscription at 90 % (of the $ 450 million MTN), with supplemental demand of 10 % from Europe, Middle East & Africa and offshore US accounts, the statement said.
The distribution of investors was well diversified as fund managers took 69 % of the subscription of the MTN issue, followed by banks with 22 %, insurance/pension with 8 % and PB (private banks)/others (wealth manager) with 1 %, it said.
The company intends to use the proceeds of the issue to finance its ongoing and new power projects, coal mining projects, acquisition of power plants and renovation and modernisation of power stations, it added.
The issue was to close on April 3. The notes carry a coupon (rate) of 3.75 % per annum payable semi-annually. The notes will mature on April 3, 2024 and all the principal and interest payments will be made in US Dollars.
The notes represent direct, unconditional and unsecured obligations of NTPC and will rank pari passu among themselves and all other unsecured obligations of NTPC, it said.
The notes will be listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Ltd, India International Exchange (IFSC) Ltd and NSE IFSC Ltd.
The company expects to list the notes in the first week of April after receiving the funds.
NTPC’s $ 6 billion MTN Programme was set up in 2006 and this issuance was the tenth offering under the programme, taking the cumulative amount raised under the MTN Programme to $ 4.30 billion (about  ₹29,600 crore).
According to the statement, the offering was met with a strong demand from the investors and the order book reached $ 1 billion within the first hour of deal announcement and further increased to $ 2 billion by noon. However, the company raised only $ 450 million.
The order book attained a peak of $ 3 billion. The final order book was over $ 1.80 billion, an oversubscription of nearly four times, with orders from more than 100 accounts.

60,2019-03-31,NTPC,"The company plans to fuel the new plants through a mix of imports and domestic coalThere has also been a notable improvement in fuel availability in recent months

NTPC Ltd has ended FY19 on a high note. The company commercialized capacity of 910 megawatts (MW) last week and, according to JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, is in the process of commercializing two more units with a combined capacity of 1,600MW.
Of course, project commissioning is still behind schedule. Requests by power distribution companies to align their schedule with demand delayed commercialization of capacities, NTPC told analysts.
Even then, the new plants will add to the regulated business, where the company is assured of fixed return on equity. JM Financial estimates the new plants to add 10% to NTPC’s regulated equity base.
There has also been a notable improvement in fuel availability in recent months. Part of the company’s incentive income is contingent on the availability of power. A tight domestic coal situation impacted availability of certain plants in FY18. This resulted in fixed cost under-recovery. The situation has improved in the March quarter.
From a mere three days equivalent of coal stock in November 2018, fuel levels at NTPC’s non-pithead plants improved to 26 days in March, points out JM Financial. The improved supplies can reduce the losses related to insufficient fuel availability (fixed cost under-recovery).
“After a rapid depletion of coal stocks in September-October 2018 driven by a) spike in power demand and b) muted coal supply, NTPC’s coal stocks have gradually recovered as power demand remained low at around 1.2% in January-February 2019 (vs. 5-6% average), while coal supply improved,"" analysts at JM Financial said. “Generation loss from coal shortage is down by 70% quarter-on-quarter, which implies lower fixed cost under-recoveries from 4QFY19.""
The new capacities and improved fuel supplies will ensure a good start to FY20 for NTPC. The moot question, however, is how well the new and the existing plants would be utilized. Earnings in a regulated business model, which the company follows, can be optimized both by new capacity additions and by optimal utilization of operating assets. While NTPC has quite a strong capacity addition pipeline, fuel supplies have been a challenge and have impacted asset utilization last year.
The company plans to fuel the new plants through a mix of imports and domestic coal. Imported coal offers better calorific value, but domestic coal production is key, too, as it helps keep pace with changes in demand.
However, there have been challenges in domestic coal availability, with transport constraints and problems in availability of railway rakes. How well NTPC manages this will determine returns from new plants."

57,2019-04-09,NTPC,"According to PRAAPTI portal, discoms owed a total of  ₹33,848 crore to power generation companies in January 2018The portal was launched in May 2018 to bring transparency in power purchase transactions between generators and discoms

NEW DELHI :
Outstanding dues of power producers on electricity distribution utilities have increased by more than 20% to  ₹40,804 crore in January 2019 compared to the year-ago month, adding to the woes of the stressed sector.
According to PRAAPTI portal, discoms owed a total of  ₹33,848 crore to power generation companies in January 2018.
The portal was launched in May 2018 to bring transparency in power purchase transactions between generators and discoms.
In January this year, total overdue amount, which was not cleared even after 60 days of grace period offered by generators, stood at  ₹26,052 crore against  ₹20,264 crore in same month in 2018.
Power producers give 60 days time to discoms for paying bills for the supply of electricity. After that the outstanding becomes overdue and generators charge penal interest on that in most of the cases.
The data on the portal indicates that the outstanding as well as overdue amount has also increased over the preceding month. In December 2018, the total outstanding on discoms was  ₹39,400 crore while the total overdue amount was  ₹24,262 crore.
Discoms in Uttar Pradesh (UP), Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Tamil Nadu and Delhi account for the major portion of dues to power generating companies, taking longer duration of up to 610 days to make payments, the portal showed.
Maharasthra tops the list with 610 days to make payments, followed by Rajasthan (608 days), Tamil Nadu (606 days), Madhya Pradesh (593 days), Karnataka (580 days), Uttar Pradesh (575 days) and Delhi (575 days) in that order.
Overdues of public sector thermal power companies amount to over 52 per cent of the total overdue of  ₹26,052 crore on discoms. NTPC alone has overdue amount of  ₹8,200 crore on discoms, while NHPC has  ₹1,596 crore and Damodar Valley Corporation at  ₹1,131 crore.
Discoms owe the highest overdue of  ₹5,790 crore to Adani Power followed by Bajaj Group-owned Lalitpur Power Generation Company Ltd at  ₹1,805 crore and GMR at  ₹1,788 crore among private generators.
To address delayed payments by discoms, a high-level committee headed by Cabinet Secretary P K Sinha had recommended that public finance institutions (PFIs), such as REC and PFC, may discount the receivables from discoms and make an upfront payment to the generators. Against that, the PFIs will realise their dues from discoms in due course of time and charge interest for the period of delay in payment by discoms.
In the case of a default by discoms, the PFIs be covered with a tripartite agreement with the Reserve Bank of India and the states, where the RBI can deduct the money directly from the accounts of a state and pay the financial institution.
NTPC has a similar mechanism with the states and the RBI against default by discoms.
The government had constituted a Group of Ministers headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to vet the recommendations of the Sinha Committee.
However, the GoM accepted all recommendations of the panel except related to discounting of discoms bills and reviving gas based stranded power plants."
56,2019-04-11,NTPC,"CESC Ltd is making progress on its strategy to stay away from the capital-intensive power generation businessBut scope of earnings accretion from power distribution business is low, given that CESC does not own assets in distribution

Mumbai: CESC Ltd is making progress on its strategy to stay away from the capital-intensive power generation business. It won distribution franchises for three cities in Rajasthan (Kota, Bikaner, Bharatpur in FY17 and FY18) and is about to secure another one in Maharashtra (Malegaon).
Returns from the distribution franchise are linked to loss reduction in transmission and distribution (T&D). Channel checks by IIFL Institutional Equities show a notable reduction in T&D losses in the distribution franchises that the company won in Rajasthan. The broking firm estimates the three distribution franchises in Rajasthan to break even at the Ebitda level in the current fiscal year (FY20) and generate profit in FY21. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Compared to the traditional power generation business, the scope of earnings accretion from the distribution franchise is low, given that CESC does not own assets in distribution. It only gets incentives for efficiency improvement, say, in reducing T&D losses.
However, as IIFL points out, the business does give good returns on capital, because of low investments. “While the share of profit is a low 3.3%, the FY21 return on equity and on invested capital are attractive at 17% and 32%, respectively,"" said analysts at IIFL in a note referring to CESC’s distribution franchises in Rajasthan.
The experience should set the company well on the way to securing more distribution franchises and reassure investors, who otherwise are perturbed by the continuing losses at the 600 megawatts thermal power plant at Chandrapur in Maharashtra. The plant does not have sufficient power offtake agreements, leading to underutilization of the asset. In FY18, it had suffered losses of  ₹199 crore.
Till recently, CESC has been providing growth capital to group firm, Spencer’s Retail Ltd. With the retail business now a separate entity and no major capital investments in the pipeline, it has to be seen how the company plans to deploy earnings from its core business.
In FY19, CESC stepped up payouts, declaring an interim dividend of  ₹17.50 a share, up from  ₹12 in FY18.
“With limited capex and the plans to expand into an asset-light distribution model, we believe the pay-out ratio will improve YoY,"" SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note.
A clear articulation of its cash-deployment strategy will provide the much required support to the CESC stock, whose valuation is underperforming some of its peers at 0.9 times of FY20 estimated book value. It seems that investors may have to wait for an electrifying performance."

Mumbai: ReNew Power Ltd, India’s largest clean energy company, and state-run power utility NTPC Ltd have shown interest in the ongoing sale process of PTC India Ltd’s wind power business, said two people aware of the development, requesting anonymity.
“ReNew Power and NTPC have been involved in talks with the company for the last few weeks and the two are expected to soon submit binding bids for acquiring the assets. One or two other financial investors could also put a binding bid for the assets,"" said the first person cited above.
The sale could fetch a valuation of around  ₹2,000 crore, he said. The investment banking arm of KPMG is managing the sale process, the person added.
The process had also seen interest from other buyers such as the local arm of CLP Holdings Ltd, Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA) and Hero Future Energies, Mint reported on 11 January.
Spokespersons for KPMG and ReNew Power declined to comment. 
Emailed queries sent to NTPC on Wednesday remained unanswered.
“PTC India Ltd is considering various options for funding growth of its subsidiary PTC Energy Ltd (PEL), including getting a suitable strategic investor on board. KPMG is advising PTC in this matter,"" a PTC India spokesperson said in an emailed response.
Mint first reported the sale process on 7 January. 
PTC India’s subsidiary, PTC Energy Ltd, has around 290 megawatts (MW) of wind assets across Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.
Mint had on 23 August 2018 reported that PTC India was considering exiting its wind energy business as the power trader did not want to invest more in it, considering that the industry was moving from feed-in tariffs to auctions.
India’s wind sector has transitioned from a feed-in tariff regime, which ensured a fixed price for wind power producers, to tariff-based competitive auctions. Access to low-cost finance is a key competitive advantage in an auction-based system.
In addition, falling tariffs have also pushed the industry towards consolidation. 
Several renewable energy deals are in the works in the Indian market. 
Mint reported earlier this year that Morgan Stanley was looking to exit its stake in wind energy platform Continuum Wind Energy."

MUMBAI :
CLP India, one of the largest foreign investors in India’s power sector, is in talks to acquire Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners-owned wind energy platform Continuum Wind Energy, two people aware of the development said.
The company, which manages over $4 billion globally, had invested $212 million in Singapore-based Continuum Wind in 2012. Continuum, which focuses on India, was founded in 2009 by Arvind Bansal and Vikash Saraf.
Mint reported in January that Morgan Stanley had appointed investment bank Moelis to seek buyers for the wind platform.
“CLP India has been engaged in talks with Morgan Stanley and is looking to acquire the Continuum platform. Continuum has over 700 megawatts (MW) of operational wind assets and it has a pipeline of almost 1,700MW, making it one of the largest portfolios on sale in the market right now. Acquiring it will add a lot of scale for the buyer,"" said the first of the two persons cited above, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity. Continuum’s portfolio is spread across Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana, he said, adding Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu make up the bulk of its operational assets.
Arvind Bansal, co-founder and chief executive officer at Continuum, declined to comment. “At CLP, as a policy, we do not comment on market speculation,"" said a spokesperson for CLP India.
This is not the first time when Morgan Stanley has explored the option to sell the wind platform. In 2015, SunEdison Inc., then the world’s largest renewable energy company, entered into an agreement to acquire Continuum Wind. The transaction, however, was called off later. Mint reported in June 2018 that Bansal was looking to buy back Morgan Stanley’s majority stake in the company, and was in talks with private equity (PE) investors to raise capital for the same.
CLP India is backed by Canadian pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), which acquired a 40% stake in the company in September 2018 for around $365 million.
CLP entered India in 2002 by acquiring a stake in the 655MW gas-powered Paguthan Combined Cycle Power Plant in Bharuch, Gujarat. Since then, its portfolio has risen to nearly 3,000MW, which includes over 1,000MW of renewable energy projects and a 1,320MW coal fired power plant in Jhajjar, Haryana.
The Indian renewable energy sector is seeing increasing instances of mergers and acquisitions (M&As), because of falling tariffs and the capital-intensive nature of the business, particularly in the initial stage, making availability of low-cost funds critical for the success of a project.
Mint reported on 12 April that ReNew Power Ltd, India’s largest clean energy company, and state-run power utility NTPC Ltd have shown interest in the ongoing sale process of PTC India Ltd’s wind power business, which includes 290MW of wind assets. Other M&A deals in the works in the sector include Mahindra Susten’s sale of 160MW of solar assets, reported by Mint in April. Fotowatio Renewable Ventures also plans to exit its only investment in the Indian solar power space and Edelweiss Infrastructure Yield Plus Fund is in talks with Engie SA to pick up a significant stake in the French energy firm’s Indian solar business.
Several major M&A deals were struck in the sector last year.
Greenko Group, one of India’s largest renewable energy platforms, has acquired Orange Renewable from Singapore’s AT Capital Group at an enterprise value of under $1 billion and another 385MW of renewable assets from Skeiron Renewable Energy."

2) Global stocks had a rocky start to the week after Washington on Monday accused Beijing of backtracking from commitments made during trade negotiations. That followed President Donald Trump's unexpected statement on Sunday that he would raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%.
3) Back home in India, the Sensex has also been dragged down by by a less-than-inspiring ongoing corporate earnings season and uncertainty over election outcome.
4) Besides that foreign institutional investors have turned net sellers over the past few trading sessions in Indian markets while midcap and smallcap stocks have also come under strong selling pressure.
5) “Indian markets have been on a shaky ground for the past couple of days driven by ambiguity associated with the US-China trade negotiations and less-than-inspiring ongoing corporate earnings season. Further, the ongoing election season is another major variable that markets are watching closely,"" says Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of research (wealth) at Centrum Broking Limited.
6) ""Key risks to Indian equities include unfavorable outcome of general elections, further increase in Brent crude price (leading to INR depreciation, widening trade deficit and rising inflation) and waning liquidity from FIIs and domestic mutual funds,"" Kotak Securities said in a note.
7) Neogen Chemicals made a strong debut on exchanges today, ending over 20% higher than its issue price.
8) China said on Tuesday that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit Washington on Thursday and Friday for trade talks, setting up a last-ditch bid to salvage a deal that would avoid a sharp increase in tariffs on Chinese goods ordered by US President Donald Trump.

New Delhi: State-run power giant NTPC Saturday posted a 48.7 per cent jump in its standalone net profit at  ₹4,350.32 crore for the March quarter compared to the year-ago period mainly on the back of lower expenses.
The company's standalone net profit in January-March 2018 was  ₹2,925.59 crore, an NTPC statement said.
The company's total income slipped to  ₹22,545.61 crore in the March quarter from 23,617.83 crore year ago. Expenses also decline to  ₹19,008.44 crore in the quarter from  ₹20,229.26 crore.
For 2018-19, standalone net profit rose by 13.60 per cent to  ₹11,749.89 crore compared to  ₹10,343.17 crore in the previous year. Total income was  ₹92,179.56 crore in 2018-19, up from  ₹85,207.95 crore during the previous year.
Consolidated net profit of the firm rose to  ₹12,633.45 crore in 2018-19 from  ₹10,501.50 crore in the previous fiscal. Total consolidated income also rose to  ₹97,537.34 crore in the last fiscal from  ₹89,641.59 in 2017-18.
The Board of Directors of NTPC Ltd has recommended a final dividend for 2018-19 at the rate of 25­ per cent of the paid-up share capital (Rs­­ 2.50 per equity share of the face value of  ₹10 each), subject to the approval of shareholders in the Annual General Meeting scheduled to be held in the month of August 2019.
The final dividend is in addition to the interim dividend of  ₹3.58 per equity share for 2018-19 paid in February 2019. This is the 26th consecutive year of dividend payment by the company.
The gross power generation of the NTPC Group for FY2018-19 was 305.90 billion units (BUs) as against 294.27 BUs during the previous year. The average power tariff of the firm was  ₹3.38 per unit in the fiscal under review.
The company's plant load factor or capacity utilisation (PLF) of coal based projects dropped to 77.58 per cent in March quarter from 79.03 per cent year ago. During the 2018-19, the company's PLF of coal fired power plants also declined to 76.68 per cent from 77.90 per cent in 2017-18.
The company's domestic coal supply rose to 46.94 million tonnes in March quarter from 44.36 million tonnes year ago. During the last fiscal the company's domestic coal supplies also increased to 175.05 million tonnes from 168.21 million tonnes.
Coal imports by the company also went up slightly to 0.66 million tonnes in March quarter from 0.10 million tonnes year ago. During the last fiscal, the company's coal imports also increased to 1.05 million tonnes from 0.32 million tonnes in 2017-18.
The NTPC Group's total installed capacity has increased to 55,126 MW as on March 31, 2019 from 53,651 MW as on March 31, 2018.

50,2019-05-28,NTPC,"The company is sourcing more coal from imports, Coal India Ltd and from its own minesNTPC’s earnings can see significant expansion in FY20 due to new capacity additions

NTPC Ltd made good on its promise of reducing revenue loss due to fuel constraints. In the fourth quarter, revenue loss was reduced to  ₹800 crore from  ₹1,100 crore in the December quarter, implying a notable improvement. “Management delivered on its lower under-recovery target for FY19 of  ₹800 crore. We had expected this to remain high, at  ₹1,300 crore, with improvement built in only from FY20E,"" Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
The improvement triggered gains in the stock, which rose 3.14% on Monday. Expansion in its base capacity notwithstanding, the stock trailed the broader markets in the past year. Reported profit in the first nine months of FY19 largely remained flat, even as the stand-alone capacity base increased by 323 megawatts (MW). As cost recovery improved in the March quarter, profit jumped 48.7%.
Importantly, improving fuel supply trends means cost under-recovery can reduce further in FY20. The company is sourcing more coal from imports, Coal India Ltd and from its own mines. Incrementally higher coal supply is expected to improve NTPC’s plant availability, further reducing cost under-recoveries.
NTPC’s earnings can see significant expansion in FY20 due to new capacity additions. According to analysts, the company expects to commercialize 5,000MW at the group level in FY20. As commercialization of projects gathers pace, adding to NTPC’s regulated equity base, analysts expect the stock to further gain momentum. “Capitalization will outpace capital expenditure, boosting return on equity and driving re-rating of the stock,"" Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a note.
While improving coal supplies and project addition trajectory should provide good support to the stock, much also depends on the demand and earnings quality. Slow progress on distribution reforms is exerting renewed pressure on state power distribution companies (discoms). They are large buyers of electricity from NTPC. This is reflected in rising dues from discoms.
Though NTPC is better placed to manage receivables through securitization and other methods, mounting dues can impact electricity offtake unless discoms streamline distribution reforms.
Power plant utilization trends are unexciting, though. The plant load factor of thermal units stood at 77.6% in the March quarter, down from 79% a year earlier. For the full year, it fell from 77.9% in FY18 to 76.7%. If financial troubles at discoms were to curtail electricity offtake, then utilization can see further softening. This can reduce the earnings gains of new capacity additions to some extent. While the new government at the centre is expected to step up distribution reforms, this is one key risk NTPC investors need to keep an eye on."
49,2019-06-06,NTPC,"A scale-up of imports and diversion of more domestic coal to the power sector helped increase fuel availabilityPrices in the spot electricity market have dropped to unusually low levels, touching  ₹1 per unit this week

When coal inventory at thermal power plants dropped to critically low levels last October, spot electricity rates climbed to record levels of  ₹6 per unit.
Prices in the spot electricity market have since dropped to unusually low levels, touching  ₹1 per unit this week. Average prices in May, the peak summer month, were 44% less than the average prices last October.
The fall coincides with the moderation in coal prices in international markets. Besides, the price reduction is made possible by the improvement in fuel inventory levels at thermal power plants.
As the accompanying chart shows, coal availability at thermal power plants improved from 10 million tonnes (mt) in October 2018 to 29 mt as on 3 June. This is sufficient to run thermal power plants monitored by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) for 16 days. Last October, when prices surged in the spot markets, these plants had only six days of fuel in stock.
The availability is still lower than CEA’s target of 22 days. Even so, the improvement is remarkable. Before the onset of the summer, the plants had 31 mt of coal or 18 days of fuel in March.
A scale-up of imports and diversion of more domestic coal to the power sector helped increase fuel availability. Coal stock from imports and local supplies have both risen to about three times the levels of October.
This places the sector well for the forthcoming monsoon season, when coal production usually slows due to rains. The inventory levels as of June are highest in two years. This and low utilization levels of thermal plants should keep the power prices in the spot electricity markets in check unless there is major disruption in coal production and supplies.
The improvement in fuel supplies should also bode well for regulated power utilities such as NTPC Ltd. To recap, the company was unable to fully recover its fixed costs in FY19 due to insufficient availability of domestic coal. While the loss in revenue reduced towards the end of last fiscal year, the continuing improvement in fuel supplies should further lower the cost under-recovery this year.
But the sharp reduction in spot electricity prices and continued sluggishness in thermal power plant utilization levels also hold a cautionary message. 
The record low electricity prices in spot markets and slow improvement in thermal power plant utilization underscores subdued demand, especially from the industrial sector. Thermal power production is up just 1.8% so far this fiscal year. Besides, the growing usage of imported coal pushes up the cost of production. 
It’s only when power companies report financial results that we’ll know how much of a boon better fuel availability has proved to be for them."
48,2019-06-12,NTPC,"A power sector council has been proposed to address issues between the centre and state governmentsThe power ministry plans to set up a pan-India distributor

New Delhi: The Union power ministry has proposed a “power sector council"" to address issues between the Union and state governments as part of the ministry’s 100-day action plan for the second term of the Narendra Modi government.
With power being on the concurrent list of the Constitution, many sectoral issues get stuck due to differences between the Union and the state governments. The council will help the Union and the state governments work on a common agenda and ensure round-the-clock power to all, a government official, who is part of the exercise, said on condition of anonymity.
“The need for coordination between the centre and states in the power sector has never been more critical. And this must be done in line with the GST Council, involving the finance ministers of states and the centre,"" said Debasish Mishra, partner at Deloitte India.
According to information reviewed by Mint, the proposed council will comprise ministers and bureaucrats at various levels and will be a forum for collective decision-making.
Other proposals by the power ministry include separation of the wire and electricity supply business, setting up of a pan-India power distributor and building renewable energy management centres (REMCs) across India.
The power ministry has also proposed limiting Power Finance Corp.’s and REC Ltd’s lending to state electricity distribution companies (discoms) except for capital expenditure projects, setting up public charging stations for electric vehicles and seeking the approval of the cabinet committee on economic affairs for pre-construction activities for the strategically important Dibang hydropower project in Arunachal Pradesh.
India and China have a dispute over the diversion of the Brahmaputra river, which originates in Tibet. Even as India explores a diplomatic option, accelerating hydroelectric projects such as Dibang would give it user rights.
The proposed power council will be headed by the Union power minister and have the Union finance minister and power ministers of all states as members. It will be assisted by a standing committee headed by the Union power secretary, with finance secretaries, principal secretaries (energy) and principal secretaries (finance) of all states as its members.
The Modi administration’s plan to provide uninterrupted power supply to households in its second term was articulated by power minister Raj Kumar Singh after he assumed office. With electricity being on the concurrent list, it is for states to ensure reliable and affordable electricity to consumers.
To be sure, the decision-making of the so-called power sector council would preclude legislative and regulatory domains of the centre and states.
“The separation of carriage and content will be akin to the telecom revolution in India,"" said the government official cited earlier.
The previous National Democratic Alliance government had promoted the separation of the carriage and content operations of existing discoms. Carriage refers to the distribution aspect and content to power. The separation will allow consumers in India to buy electricity from a company of their choice.
The ministry’s 100-day plan also includes setting up a national electricity distribution company, proposed as an equal joint venture (JV) between state-run NTPC Ltd and Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd. The proposed firm may enter into JVs with the state discoms and help bridge market and credit risks at a time when state-owned discoms are struggling with their finances on account of losses and borrowings.
Queries emailed to a power ministry spokesperson on 6 June remained unanswered.
Interestingly, of India’s installed capacity of 349 gigawatts (GW), the peak demand is only 177GW. Peak electricity demand has been low due to precarious finances of some discoms, which prevents them from procuring the required power."
47,2019-06-16,NTPC,"Out of its current portfolio of more than 1 GW of SPV plants, nearly 500 MW has already been commissionedThe orders have been secured from the state-run power giant NTPC Ltd and GSECL

New Delhi: State-run engineering firm BHEL on Sunday said it has won two orders worth  ₹800 crore for setting up solar energy capacity of 200 MW, and its solar photovoltaic portfolio has touched 1,000 MW mark with these orders.
Valued at over  ₹800 crore, the orders have been secured from the state-run power giant NTPC Ltd and Gujarat State Electricity Corporation Ltd (GSECL), a company statement said.
""BHEL Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) portfolio has surpassed 1 GW with the company winning two EPC orders for setting up SPV plants with a cumulative capacity of 200 MW,"" it said.
The NTPC order envisages setting up India's largest floating SPV plant of 100 MW capacity at NTPC Ramagundam in Telangana, while the GSECL order involves setting up a 100 MW ground-mounted SPV plant at Raghanesda Ultra Mega Solar Park in Banaskantha district of Gujarat.
BHEL offers EPC (engineering procurement and construction) solutions for both off-grid and grid-interactive SPV plants at various locations in India, including the Lakshadweep islands.
Out of its current portfolio of more than 1 GW of SPV plants, nearly 500 MW has already been commissioned.
The enhancement of its state-of-the-art manufacturing lines of solar cells and solar modules has further strengthened its presence in the SPV segment, the company said.
In addition, space-grade solar panels using high efficiency cells and space-grade battery are being manufactured at its Electronics Systems Division, Bengaluru.

46,2019-06-23,NTPC,"A sustained fall in utilization levels can be a major earnings risk, and running plants at sub-optimal levels would hit returnsWhile tariffs in renewable energy have steadily fallen to  ₹2.50 per unit, the average tariff at NTPC has risen from  ₹3.18 in FY16 to  ₹3.38 in FY19

While fuel availability is normalizing for NTPC Ltd, a new challenge is emerging: demand.
Generation at thermal power plants tracked by the Central Electricity Authority dropped for the second consecutive month in May. Average utilization for April-May, as represented by the plant load factor (PLF), dropped from 78.7% a year ago to 73%. In May, it was even lower at 71.4%.
As the chart alongside shows, utilization has been steadily trending lower in recent years due to subdued demand. But the drop seems to have accelerated recently. “The 720-basis-point drop in NTPC’s coal PLF to 71% at the peak summer in May, which recorded the highest energy/peak demand, is quite surprising. The difference between the all India thermal PLF and NTPC’s coal PLF was at a record low of 8% (it averaged 15-18% in the past)"" analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note.
The fall in utilization coincides with a pickup in hydropower generation and in renewable energy. Given renewable energy’s must-run status, power distribution companies (discoms) would have reduced thermal power purchases. Other factors are at work as well, primarily on the cost front.
While tariffs in renewable energy have steadily fallen to  ₹2.50 per unit, the average tariff at NTPC has risen from  ₹3.18 in FY16 to  ₹3.38 in FY19. The tariff rise at the company may not be huge and the gap with renewable tariffs may not appear large, but for cash-strapped bulk buyers, such as state power discoms, the savings are considerable.
The fall in utilization, despite greater fuel availability, indicates the discretion in electricity purchases by state utilities.
According to an analyst, some of NTPC’s newly-built plants have significantly higher variable costs, resulting in tariffs of more than  ₹4 a unit. As states come across less-expensive alternatives in the form of hydropower, renewable or even spot thermal power, they generally back away from costly power-purchase agreements.
Of course, with a regulated business model, wherein minimum returns are assured, NTPC is insulated from changes in power offtake. Further, improved fuel availability and supplies help the company in recovering fixed costs. Also, the slow scale-up in the recently commissioned power plants may be weighing on overall utilization levels.
Even then, a sustained fall in utilization levels can be a major earnings risk, and running power plants at sub-optimal levels would hamper returns. “The sustained pressure on coal plant load factors is an area of concern as it affects efficiency parameters, among others,"" added the analysts at SBICAP Securities."
45,2019-07-02,NTPC,"The government plans to set up a national electricity distribution company (NEDC) as an equal joint JV between the state-run NTPC Ltd and Power Grid Corp. of India LtdIt will undertake electricity distribution by forming JVs with state-owned discoms and help bridge market and credit risks

1) What are NEDC’s objectives?
The aim of the NTPC-PGCIL joint venture is to act as a model discom, thereby improving efficiency and helping resolve the vexed issue of rising non-performing assets in the power sector. Given that electricity is on the concurrent list, NEDC will not only act as a nodal agency for implementing the Union government’s scheme in the distribution sector, but also serve as an implementation agency for state discoms. It will act as the beachhead for introducing distribution sector reforms and help bring new tech, including smart grids, big data and analytics, into fund-starved discoms.
2) Why is it needed?
The need for a pan-India discom was felt given that distribution will be key to the long-term fortunes of the power sector. Discoms have so far been the weakest link in the electricity value chain. Poor payment records of state-owned discoms have not only adversely affected power generation companies, but have also contributed to stress in the banking sector. In such a situation, a national electricity distribution company can be a precursor to “carriage and content operations"" and be used for asset and network management. It may also procure electricity at competitive rates and help address the issue of stressed assets in power generation.
3) How will it work?
Given that NEDC will have to seek licences from the respective state electricity regulatory commissions, the process will be tedious and unfeasible as this will create an adversarial relationship with the state discoms. The game plan is to form JVs with existing discoms, thus leveraging the experience of state-run firms such as NTPC and PGCIL to improve efficiency in areas such as system and network operations, asset management, and operations and maintenance. The state-run units can leverage their technical expertise, competence and access to cheaper funds to act as a change agent in electricity distribution.
4) What are the benefits?
Better functioning of state discoms will help reduce overall transmission and commercial losses, and help meet the increased power demand due to electricity connections provided to rural and urban households under the Saubhagya scheme. It will help expedite the plan to separate the “carriage and content operations"" of discoms, letting people and companies in India buy electricity from a firm of their choice.
5) What is the trigger for such a joint venture?
The government is trying to step up efforts to supply 24x7 power to all. But this can’t be achieved unless there is a robust electricity distribution space. The poor financial health of discoms has led to delayed payments to generation utilities. Hence, the government has made it mandatory for state discoms to offer letters of credit as part of the payment security mechanisms in power purchase pacts to ensure timely payments by states to generation utilities."

New Delhi: India will likely give up direct control of its most-profitable state-run behemoths as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to keep budget deficit in check, while reviving investments to spur economic growth.
The government has identified the biggest energy companies such as Oil & Natural Gas Corp, Indian Oil Corp, NTPC Ltd. and GAIL India Ltd as probable candidates for cutting its direct holding to below 51%, Atanu Chakraborty, who steers Modi’s asset sale department, said in an interview in New Delhi. “Government’s indirect holding, through arms such as Life Insurance Corp. of India, will stay above 51%.""

NEW DELHI :
The Indian government has plans to raise as much as 3.25 trillion rupees ($47.4 billion) in the next five years by reducing its stakes in some large state-owned firms to 40%, two senior government officials told Reuters, in the nation's biggest privatisation push in more than two decades.
Last week, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget announced that the government will look to reduce direct controlling stakes in some state-run firms on a case-by-case basis.
The plan will open up a steady stream of state companies to greater private investment, and target the kind of annual divestment revenue that will be crucial to meet fiscal deficit targets.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration already sold government stakes in a host of companies to raise a record $40.92 billion in his first five-year term, nearly three times the divestment proceeds of $14.52 billion achieved by the Congress party government in 2009-2014. Modi was re-elected for a second-term in a landslide victory in April-May.
The government has identified a number of state-owned firms, including explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp, oil refiner Indian Oil Corp, gas transmitter GAIL (India) Ltd, power producers NHPC Ltd and NTPC, miners NMDC Ltd and Coal India, and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd , said the sources, who declined to be named due to the sensitive nature of the matter.
""We have done a calculation on current prices and we could get 3.25 trillion rupees if we bring our stake down to 40% in government companies, excluding banks,"" one of the officials said.
The two officials, though, said the government is yet to gauge investor appetite for the state-owned companies and that the level of demand will be crucial to any timetable.
Analysts said the government would need to be flexible, especially given that a lot of the companies were in the resource sector and their prices would often depend on the volatility of commodities prices.
""The government should gauge investor interest and schedule an ideal timeframe that is in sync with the commodity cycle,"" said Satyadeep Jain, a global metals and mining equity consultant.
Jain said the government should wait before selling stakes in companies such as Coal India as demand for its shares would be hurt by weak global coal prices. The country's largest iron-ore miner NMDC would be a better target for sale as its stock has been buoyant this year, he said.
New Delhi wants to reduce its holdings in such a way that the cumulative stake of the government and state-owned companies such as Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) would continue to be above 51%.
This year, the government is planning to put stakes in a group of companies into exchange traded funds, which would then be sold on public markets and raise at least 400 billion rupees, the officials said. The state's stakes in those companies would be cut to 51% in some cases.
The government has set a divestment target of 1.05 trillion rupees for the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2020.
It is in the process of identifying some power companies for merger with a view to cutting its stakes to 40%, one of the sources said.
The government is planning a complex holding structure for companies such as state-owned power firm SJVN Ltd, which would be bought by another power firm such as state-owned NTPC or NHPC, sources said.
Eventually, the officials say the government would like to see its shareholdings reduced to 26% in some companies if the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party gets a third term.
""That step will be real privatisation,"" the second official said."

39,2019-07-23,NTPC,"AP govt will go ahead in renegotiating power purchase agreements with private developersEarlier, central government is attempting to steer Andhra Pradesh government away from altering existing power purchase agreements

The Andhra Pradesh government has struck a defiant note and will go ahead in renegotiating power purchase agreements with private developers, the state government said in a recent letter to the Prime Minister’s Office. Mint has seen extracts from the letter.
“We have inherited a bankrupt exchequer with a huge deficit of  ₹2.62 lakh crore, the discom’s (electricity distribution companies) unpaid generator dues of  ₹20,000 crore and accumulated losses of discoms of  ₹15,000 crore."" The letter goes on to say that the state incurred losses dues to the previous government accepting long-term tariffs that were above those being signed elsewhere in the country and because the state had chosen to procure more renewable power than coal-fired power.
“The state incurred losses due to high-cost purchases beyond renewable power purchase obligations (RPPO). Surprisingly, 70% of this power comes from only 5 producers,"" the letter says. “Wind energy in excess of RPPO was purchased at  ₹4.84 a unit, while thermal energy was available at  ₹4.2.""
Accounting for the fixed costs that have to be paid for thermal power even if the power is not procured, the effective price of procurement for wind energy in the state is  ₹5.94 a unit and for solar energy is  ₹8.09 a unit while thermal power is available at  ₹4.2 a unit. These cause losses of over  ₹1500 crore a year. The letter argues that wind energy has been available at  ₹2.43 a unit in Gujarat and solar energy at  ₹2.44 a unit in Rajasthan, based on reverse tendering process of Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).
The letter says the government will conduct a free and fair enquiry and also form a cabinet sub-committee to enquire into “serious irregularities.""
Last week, the central government is attempting to steer the newly elected Andhra Pradesh government away from altering existing power purchase agreements (PPAs). In a letter dated July 9, RK Singh, Minister of State for Power and New and Renewable Energy, has asked Andhra chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy to not cancel PPAs unless there is a clear evidence of corruption. The new state government has indicated over the last few weeks that it will review, negotiate and bring down the cost of wind and solar PPAs tied-up by the discoms, to the consternation of private power developers like Greenko, Renew and Tata Power, public developers like NTPC and SECI, which conducts the reverse bidding process.
The AP government’s letter goes on to say that “Though we are aware of the legal nature of contracts and their importance, the divided state of Andhra Pradesh and the discoms which are in a debt trap are helpless to honour these high-cost renewable power purchase agreements done with mala fide intent."""
38,2019-07-24,NTPC,"The order has alarmed power developers as it is likely to set a precedent for other states to follow suitAP has been in the forefront among states in setting up green power with commissioned capacity of 7.2 gigawatts

A clutch of several renewable power producers have challenged the Andhra Pradesh government move to renegotiate power purchase agreements (PPAs) which could see a downward revision of current tariffs, two people aware of the development said. These companies filed a writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh high court on Wednesday seeking a stay on the state government’s 1 July order, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.
Private renewable energy companies with substantial presence in the state include ReNew Power, ACME Solar, Greenko Energy Holdings and Mytrah Energy India Ltd.
Andhra Pradesh has been in the forefront among states in setting up green power with commissioned capacity of 7.2 gigawatts, with solar at 3.2GW and wind at over 3.9GW. On 1 July, the state directed a high-level negotiation committee to use current tariff rates, rates prevalent at the time of commissioning of projects, and the current opportunity cost of other sources of power to benchmark and renegotiate agreements, and submit a report in 45 days.
The order has alarmed renewable power developers and investors alike as it is likely to set a precedent for other states to follow suit and lower tariffs. Andhra Pradesh’s insistence on lowering tariffs will also place 5.2GW of installed wind and solar power, with combined debt of  ₹21,000 crore, at risk of default, a report by credit ratings agency Crisil estimated. Ratings agency Icra has already downgraded two projects of Mytrah Energy and ACME Solar, since part of the power generated from these projects would be supplied to AP power distribution companies (discoms).
“Prolonged delay in PPA resolution would put about half of capacity in the state (2.6GW with roughly  ₹10,600 crore of debt) at immediate risk of default in debt servicing as these projects would have no other liquidity support apart from project-level liquidity reserves, which are typically at six months of debt servicing,"" said Ankit Hakhu, associate director, Crisil Ratings.
Some developers are, however, still hopeful of an amicable solution without involving litigation. “We are hoping that the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) will take a favourable view to our argument that the state shouldn’t unilaterally change tariffs. We hope it will not come to taking legal recourse,"" said the first of the three people cited earlier, a senior official with a private developer.
According to the persons cited above, the bone of contention for the state government has been PPAs signed from 2014-2019 that were over and above the mandated 5% renewable power purchase obligation (RPPO) of the state, when cheaper options in thermal power were available.
Now, with tariffs having fallen for wind and solar power over the last two years, the state government wants to replace the old tariffs with new ones in line with the current PPAs being signed.
To this end, in the past month, the state government has slashed power developer Greenko’s tariff twice over from  ₹5.74 per kilowatt hour (kWh) to  ₹3.74 per kWh and then to  ₹2.44 per kWh, a decision which has been stayed by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity.
Solar Energy Corp. of India Ltd (SECI), the intermediary between state discoms and private developers, and NTPC Ltd, have both denied Andhra Pradesh’s request for renegotiation, with the latter threatening legal action if outstanding dues at the original tariffs aren’t paid.
The state has justified its stand, arguing that the new government has “inherited a bankrupt exchequer with a huge deficit of  ₹2.62 lakh crore, electricity distribution companies’ unpaid generator dues of  ₹20,000 crore and accumulated losses of discoms of  ₹15,000 crore."""

Mumbai: Public sector oil marketer Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has joined ranks with the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) in turning down the Andhra Pradesh’s request for a tariff revision in wind power supplied to the state. 
In letter last week to the Andhra Pradesh Southern Power Distribution Co Ltd (APSPDCL), IOC declined the state’s request to cut the tariff payable to it from  ₹4.7 as per the power purchase agreement to  ₹2.43 a unit.
Mint has seen a copy of the letter.
APSPDCL, one of the power distribution utilities in the state, had written to the IOC asking it to revise its power bills submitted to the utility applying the revised lower tariff. In its reply to the state, IOC said that the current wind tariffs are not comparable to those prevailing at the time the company had set up its wind farms. 
“A considerable amount of money is spent for the operation and maintenance of the windmills. This expenditure increases due to ageing windmills,"" the company said.
IOC also said that the state does not have the power to unilaterally alter or cancel PPAs, both of which it appears APSPDCL had threatened. Indian Oil reiterated that the utility continues to owe it  ₹23.35 crore for unpaid bills, and interest, is pending from August 2018 to May 2019.
Andhra Pradesh has been in the forefront among states in setting up green power with commissioned capacity of 7.2 gigawatts, with solar at 3.2GW and wind at over 3.9GW. On 1 July, the state directed a high-level negotiation committee to use current tariff rates, rates prevalent at the time of commissioning of projects, and the current opportunity cost of other sources of power to benchmark and renegotiate agreements, and submit a report in 45 days. Last Thursday, clean energy firms got a stay from the Andhra Pradesh High Court on the state’s unilateral move to change power tariffs with private developers. 
Solar Energy Corp. of India Ltd, the intermediary between state discoms and private developers, and NTPC Ltd, have both denied Andhra Pradesh’s request for renegotiation, with the latter threatening legal action if outstanding dues at the original tariffs aren’t paid.
However, Mercom reported on 26 July that since issuing the directive, the state has started curtailing the quantity of wind power it is purchasing from private developers, despite the renewable energy sector having “must-run"" status in the state."
35,2019-08-06,NTPC,"SECI and NTPC have assumed direct obligations for tariff payment under recent power purchase agreementsThis emphasis on only assuming payment obligations was absent in earlier PPAs and is a more recent trend

Mumbai: Lenders to renewable energy companies have long believed that their borrowers’ finances are intact as long as these companies have power purchase agreements with reliable counterparties such as Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) and National Thermal Power Corporation of India (NTPC) and not with the less dependable state distribution companies. This may not be the case, a research report from credit ratings agency India Ratings has found.
India Ratings studied the fine print in several power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed between renewable power developers and NTPC and SECI. They found that while PPAs underscore that payment obligations are direct obligations, all other risks and obligations would be on a pass-through basis. The emphasis on SECI and NTPC being only intermediaries and linking the PPAs signed with a developer to a power sale agreement (PSA) signed with particular distribution company (whose name is disclosed in PPA itself) indicates a trend of limiting the liabilities on SECI and NTPC. In fact, more recent tariffs signed in 2019 by both SECI and NTPC go further in limiting their own exposure in case of a default by the discoms.
SECI and NTPC have assumed direct obligations for tariff payment (monthly bills and supplementary bills which include change in law payments) under their recent PPAs. This emphasis on only assuming payment obligations was absent in earlier PPAs and is a more recent trend.
Certain critical provisions such as the establishment of payment security mechanism and payments towards grid-related compensation are to be met only if discoms comply with them. The latest PPAs of SECI and NTPC also emphasise they are intermediaries. These PPAs reaffirm the interpretation that counterparty risk has to be assessed based on the credit profiles of SECI and NTPC.
For instance, the payment security mechanism isn’t always followed in practice. “The letter of credit (LC) creation for the benefit of developers by NTPC/SECI is subject to the creation of the same by discoms under back-to-back PSAs,"" India Ratings said. “Hence, if SECI and NTPC do not create LCs, it indicates the non-creation of LC by discoms under PSAs signed by NTPC. Should LCs be created by discoms, SECI/NTPC may use them as the first line of defence for the non-payment of dues. In India Rating’s portfolio,
LCs haven’t been created under PPAs with SECI; they have been created for only a few projects selling to NTPC.""
In such cases, lenders have to look at the financial and business profile of the back-to-back counterparty to some extent also, since a project could significantly depend on other obligations such as late payment surcharge, payment security mechanism, grid compensation, and so on.
SECI and NTPC sign PPAs with project companies after signing back-to-back power sale agreement with discoms. Unlike NTPC’s PPAs of 2016, the latest ones disclose the name of the discom with which back-to-back PPA has been signed. NTPC’s latest PPA will stand cancelled and be terminated with no liability unless the tariff is adopted (the sole condition precedent) by relevant discoms who have signed back-to-back PPAs with NTPC. Such a clause was not present in the PPAs signed by NTPC in 2016. The investment in project development before adoption is at the risk of PPA cancellation. Also, the time period for commissioning is fixed in relation to the date of signing, while it should preferably be pegged to date of tariff adoption by the relevant Electricity Regulatory Commission.
Additionally, “an event of default on the PPAs signed by SECI or NTPC with developers will be triggered in case an event of default occurs due to the discom in the back-to-back PSA signed by SECI or NTPC with discoms. Practically, SECI and NTPC are not expected to use these clauses to terminate the PPAs signed with discoms. However, the analysis of back-to-back counterparty is all the more important because of the existence of such a provision,"" the agency said."

New Delhi: The outstanding dues of power producers from distribution utilities have risen by more than 30 per cent to  ₹46,412 crore in June 2019 compared to the same month of the last year, showing stress in the sector.
According to PRAAPTI portal, distribution companies owed a total of  ₹34,465 crore to power generation companies in June 2018.
The portal was launched in May 2018 to bring in transparency in power purchase transactions between generators and discoms.
In June this year, total overdue amount, which was not cleared even after 60 days of grace period offered by generators, stood at  ₹30,552 crore against  ₹21,739 crore in the same month in 2018.
Power producers give 60 days time to discoms for paying bills for the supply of electricity. After that, the outstanding becomes overdue and generators charge penal interest on that in most of the cases.
In order to give relief to power generation companies, the Centre has enforced a payment security mechanism from 1 August, 2019. Under this mechanism, the discoms are required to open letters of credit for getting power supplies.
The data on the portal indicates that the outstanding, as well as overdue amount, have increased over the preceding month. In May 2019, the total outstanding on discoms was  ₹43,814 crore while the total overdue amount was  ₹25,660 crore.
Discoms in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir account for the major portion of dues to power generating companies, taking a longer duration of up to 839 days to make payments, the portal showed.
Madhya Pradesh tops the list with 839 days to make payments, followed by Bihar (789 days), Andhra Pradesh (787 days), Haryana (787 days), Telangana (767 days) Karnataka (761 days), Tamil Nadu (760 days), Punjab (757 day) and Jammu & Kashmir (756 days) in that order.
Overdues of independent power producers amount to over 62.27 per cent of the total overdue of  ₹30,552 crore on discoms.
Among the public sector power generators, NTPC alone has an overdue amount of  ₹6,342.94 crore on discoms followed by NLC India at  ₹4,604 crore, THDC India at  ₹1,971.73, NHPC at  ₹1,963.71 crore and Damodar Valley Corporation at  ₹843.79 crore.
Discoms owe the highest overdue of  ₹3,201.68 crore to Adani Power followed by Bajaj Group-owned Lalitpur Power Generation Company Ltd at  ₹1,980.26 crore and GMR at  ₹1,733.18 crore among private generators.

31,2019-08-19,NTPC,"The move comes at a time when merchant trading in power has increased and state government utilities struggle to pay power bills that they are locked intoOne of its first projects where NTPC will go without PPAs is a planned 5,000MW solar park in Kutch, Gujarat

NTPC Ltd, India’s largest power generator, will explore setting up new generation capacity without signing long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs).
The move comes at a time when merchant trading in power has increased and state government utilities struggle to pay power bills that they are locked into.
“Till now, all of NTPC’s capacity is tied up with long-term PPAs,"" Gurdeep Singh, chairman and managing director, NTPC, said at a press conference. NTPC has installed power capacity of 55,000MW.
“But this financial year, we will start looking at setting up net capacity even without PPAs. Our strategy needs to keep evolving as the market evolves. We will see if NTPC can create capacity for the merchant (exchange-traded power) business.""
One of its first projects where NTPC will go without PPAs is a planned 5,000MW solar park in Kutch, Gujarat. “We’re doing feasibility studies for this project and we have narrowed down 2-3 likely sites. The government has accepted our viewpoint for this proposal,"" Singh said. “We will evaluate how to set this up, partly with long-term PPAs and partly without. We might even invite other developers to install their units at the park.""
NTPC expects the park to cost about  ₹20,000 crore, a cost of about  ₹4 crore per MW. Work will begin this fiscal. “We are also evaluating another ultra megawatt solar park project in Rajasthan,"" Singh said.
About 11% of electricity generated in India is bought and sold through power exchanges. This share of merchant power trades has stayed more or less flat as a percentage of the electricity market. However, the absolute units traded doubled from 65.90 billion units in 2009-10 to 127.62 billion units in 2017-18, according to data from the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission. Large power traders include companies like Tata Power, Adani Enterprises, RPG Power Trading and JSW Power Trading. Selling in the merchant market has long been seen as the only option for private generators unable to sign long-term contracts with state consumers. So, this will be a bold move for NTPC to keep its power sales options open.
NTPC added 2180MW of capacity in 2018-19, and aims to add about 2.5-3GW every year. “We have lots of land available at our existing plants, so we don’t need to do any greenfield projects and there is sufficient land for brownfield expansion. This year, we will add about 5GW of new capacity. We generate about 23% of the country’s electricity and we want to increase our market share.""
For the June 2019 quarter, NTPC reported net profit of  ₹2840.28 crore, on revenue of  ₹25931.11 crore. Singh also said that the company is exploring opportunities in waste-to-energy plants and has an operational pilot project in Varanasi of 214kW. NTPC has signed an MoU to set up a larger plant in Surat, Gujarat, which it hopes to commission within 30 months."

MUMBAI :
National energy major NTPC is planning to set up an ultra-mega solar park in the Kutch region of Gujarat that will produce up to 5,000 megawatts and involve an investment of Rs20,000 crore or more.
""We are looking at setting up an ultra-mega solar park in the Kutch and also one in Rajasthan. In the Kutch, we are planning to produce 5,000 mw at an investment of around Rs4 crore per mw, taking the total investment to Rs20,000 crore.
We are looking at two-three locations in the Kutch. We will invite others to invest as well,"" NTPC chairman and managing director Gurdeep Singh told reporters here Monday.
He said, the company is also looking at Rajasthan for setting up an ultra mega solar park. ""But the amount of energy that will be produced and the quantum of investment required will be decided after the location is finalised,"" he added.
Further, he said NTPC is also planning to tie up with municipalities to produce electricity from solid waste.
""Since last year we have been running a pilot project in Banaras in UP that converts bio-waste into electricity. Now we are planning to do a similar project with the East Delhi Municipal Corporation to produce 20 mw a day and we will float the tender over the next 30 months.
""However we are in more advanced stages of talks with the Surat civic body as we have available land and we are planning to award the contract soon,"" he said.
The company has a similar plan for Ladakh as well, Singh added.
""We are keen to partner with more municipal bodies for waste management. Our only demand is that they must deliver waste to the plant,"" he added.
NTPC is also looking at good projects to acquire through the bankruptcy process.
""At present there are not many good projects in NCLTs, we are looking at three projects, one hydro asset of 100 mw and two coal-based assets of 600 mw each. We are open to projects in hydro, coal and renewal as well,"" he added."

The company got shareholders' nod through a special resolution to raise funds up to Rs15,000 crore through issue of bonds/debentures on private placement basis in the domestic market at its annual general meeting (AGM) held on Wednesday, it said in a BSE filing.
According to the AGM notice, the funds raised will be used for capital expenditure, working capital and general corporate purposes.
NTPC has also got shareholders' approval to increase its borrowing limit from Rs1.5 lakh crore to Rs2 lakh crore.

28,2019-08-22,NTPC,"Operating earnings grew just 5% in FY19 despite expansion in installed capacity base and regulated equityThe capacity ramp-up will boost the company’s finances

The 16% fall in the shares of NTPC Ltd over the past one year has been disappointing. Not just because valuations are undemanding—with the shares trading close to their book value. The company’s fixed return earning regulated equity base has been steadily growing and is projected to grow faster.
Capacity additions are projected to accelerate to 5 gigawatts (GW) per year from FY20 against the average annual addition of less than 3GW in the last two years. As a consequence, NTPC’s regulated equity is estimated to expand 15% annually from FY20 over the next three fiscal years.
The capacity ramp-up will boost the company’s finances. FY20 will mark the beginning of the reversal of the capital work in progress (CWIP) ratio. The ratio as a percentage of property, plant and equipment, and CWIP is estimated to fall from 42% in FY19 to 36% in FY20 and 24% in FY21, projects NTPC. The fall in the ratio will enhance return on equity as the equity blocked in CWIP would start generating returns.
Still the Street is not convinced. The NTPC stock continued to fall on Thursday inching closer to its 52-week low. Why? Lack of commensurate growth in earnings. Operating earnings grew just 5% in FY19 despite a notable expansion in installed capacity base and regulated equity.
Worse, reported profit grew just 1% last quarter and adjusted earnings lagged Street estimates by a wide margin. “Street was almost certain that 1QFY20 would mark a turnaround for NTPC with most past issues having been suitably resolved. However, 1QFY20 results sprung a surprise with higher losses on account of usage of carpet coal (low value coal)—management highlighted the same as a one-off, and we hope that it does not recur, such that earnings profile is reflective of underlying capacity addition,"" said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a note.
Second is the overhang of the government share sale. There is a fear that the Centre may sell hydropower producer SJVN Ltd to NTPC, similar to Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd’s purchase of Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd, and the Power Finance Corp. Ltd-REC Ltd deal.
Such a transaction will enhance NTPC’s regulated equity base. But it can scuttle its dividend payouts in the short term, warns an analyst. SJVN has a market capitalization of  ₹9,500 crore. If NTPC has to buy a majority stake exhausting its close to  ₹3,000 crore cash reserves, then its ability to maintain current dividends can be impacted, says the analyst on condition of anonymity.
Perhaps clarity from the government will help. NTPC has been one of the consistent dividend payers. In FY19, the dividend yield was more than 5%."
27,2019-08-28,NTPC,"In NTPC Ltd, 18 senior level employees have been asked to work from home, ostensibly to 'optimize manpower', according to reports

In the private sector, a work-from-home culture is fast gaining popularity because of torturous daily commutes it saves employees and the productivity gains it offers employers. But the public sector still has a lot of catching up to do. In state-run power producer NTPC Ltd., 18 senior level employees have been asked to work from home, ostensibly to “optimize manpower"", according to a report in the Hindu BusinessLine. But the employees are feeling uneasy. Their fear: this could distance them from the main work environment—a possible lead-up to their redundancy.
The resistance of NTPC’s employees revives a debate over whether a work-from-home culture should be promoted. It has undeniable advantages. In cities such as Mumbai and Bangalore, where transport infrastructure is crumbling under the weight of a traffic overload, people often spend hours together trying to reach their workplace. This time could have been better used. In addition, real estate costs are high, which make it costly to maintain big offices. To tackle these issues, companies are permitting, even encouraging, their employees to work from home. After all, in today’s age of fast internet connectivity, technology allows employees to communicate with each other or with clients face-to-face through tools such as Skype or FaceTime. So why endure the pain of bumper-to-bumper traffic?
There could be negative effects too, such as employees feeling cut off, or suffering distractions at home. But, in general, the positives outweigh them. This is why some private firms, particularly startups, are trying to break down the conventional notion of an office as a must-have. The government, though, still appears stuck in the old paradigm. In June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi exhorted his ministerial colleagues to avoid working from home to set an example for others. True, being seen hard at work does influence the perceptions of onlookers, but how effectively one performs at a job is no longer a function of hours spent in an office."

25,2019-09-12,NTPC,"These massive green parks will cost around $2 billion eachMega renewable energy power parks will be set up in states such as Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh

New Delhi: As part of India’s energy security efforts, state-run companies present in the conventional power space such as NTPC Ltd, NLC India Ltd (earlier known as Neyveli Lignite Corp. Ltd) ,and Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd (PGCIL) are being roped in to build massive green energy parks.
Setting up such parks will provide heft to India at the world stage specifically in the view of a rapidly evolving global energy landscape and a fundamental change in the global investment culture. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be attending the UN Climate Action Summit on 23 September in New York.
These proposed ultra mega renewable energy power parks (UMREPP) of 2,000 megawatts (MW) involving a cost of around $2 billion each, are to be set up in wind and solar resource rich states such as Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, according to a government note reviewed by Mint.
The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s push may also see participation from other hydropower public sector units (PSUs) such as North Eastern Electric Power Corp. Ltd (Neepco), NHPC Ltd, Tehri Hydro Development Corp. Ltd (THDC), SJVN Ltd (SJVNL), and Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC).
Mint reported on Thursday about the central government plan of making state-run companies build massive clean energy parks to help developers achieve economies of scale and further bring down solar and wind power tariffs.
With built-in incentives to ensure states and operators are invested in the success of the parks, India’s largest power sector lenders such as Power Finance Corp. Ltd (PFC) and REC Ltd may also participate in the push to cut India’s dependence on fossil fuels.
“The effort is to make land and decimated transmission available to renewable energy developers aiming for catalysing the growth of renewable energy in the country,"" Anand Kumar, secretary in the ministry of new and renewable energy told Mint.
To ensure that these plans don’t meet the fate of ultra-mega power project programme, attempted to create large power generation capacities at a single location, the preliminary meetings for setting up such large clean energy parks under the existing Solar Park scheme, has also been attended by the principal energy secretaries and principal revenue secretary of the above mentioned states. Also, the chairman and managing directors of the CPSUs have also been made a part of the initial discussions.
This assumes importance given the standoff between the centre and the Andhra Pradesh government over reworking power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed by the previous TDP government for wind and solar power.
Given the delays in land allocation, the centre also made the district commissioners of solar radiation rich districts such as Barmer, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and Kutch attend the preparatory meetings for such large clean energy parks.
To get states on board and facilitate the requisite clearances, state governments will be paid Rs0.02 per unit of electricity generated from the projects over their lifetime. Also, the SPVs will be paid park development and operations and maintenance (O&M) charges by the developers, and Rs0.02 per unit on the electricity generated over their lifetime. The operators that will set up renewable energy projects such as wind or solar inside the clean energy park will be selected through tariff-based competitive bids.
Even as the US withdrew from the Paris climate deal, clean energy projects now account for more than a fifth of India’s installed power generation capacity."
24,2019-09-26,NTPC,"The move will provide a fresh push to hydropower in India’s energy mixDeveloping hydropower projects has been a recurring theme of India’s strategic play in the border areas, specifically with China and Pakistan in mind

New Delhi: As part of India’s plan to expedite strategically important hydropower projects, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ruled Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday inked agreements entailing an investment of Rs25,000 crore with central public sector units (PSU) for setting up hydropower projects on Chenab river.
The move will provide a fresh push to hydropower in India’s energy mix, and will also help fully utilize its share of water under the Indus Waters Treaty. The treaty sets out a mechanism for cooperation and information exchange between the two countries regarding their use of rivers and was inked after nine years of negotiations, with the World Bank being a signatory.
While state-run NHPC Ltd signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Himachal Pradesh state government for developing 449 megawatt (MW) Duggar project, India’s largest power generation utility -- NTPC Ltd -- inked MoUs for Seli (400 MW) and Miyar(120 MW) projects.
Chenab is a western river that originates from India and flows into Pakistan. According to the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, “India shall be under an obligation to let flow all the waters of the western rivers, and shall not permit any interference with these waters, except for the following uses,"" such as—domestic use, non-consumptive use, agricultural use, and generation of hydro-electric power.
“The Duggar project is a run of the river scheme on Chenab river and will require an investment of Rs4,112 crore. It will provide Himachal Pradesh free power, local area development and employment opportunity,"" Balraj Joshi, chairman and managing director NHPC told Mint.
Developing hydropower projects has been a recurring theme of India’s strategic play in the border areas, specifically with China and Pakistan in mind. A case in point being the 330 MW Kishanganga hydro power project in Jammu and Kashmir that was commissioned last May on the river Kishanganga, a tributary of Jhelum. While Pakistan had challenged the project under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, the International Court of Arbitration at The Hague ruled in India’s favour in 2013. Pakistan had also raised objections on the 1,000 MW Pakal Dul and 48 MW Lower Kalnai hydroelectric projects on River Chenab.
State-run NHPC Ltd is India’s largest hydro power producer, with a power generation capacity of 7,071 MW through its 22 operational hydro projects and two wind and solar projects. It also has four hydro projects totalling 4,424 MW under construction and 10 projects totalling 7,321 MW awaiting clearance.
“NTPC Ltd, India’s largest power producer, today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Himachal Pradesh government to set up two hydro projects totalling 520 MW in the state,"" the utility said in a statement.
India now also looks at expediting strategically important hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir to fully utilize its share of water under the Indus Waters Treaty. State-run NHPC Ltd plans to construct these hydropower projects in the context of China developing the controversial China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
With nearly 100 gigawatts (GW) of electricity potential in India’s rivers lying untapped because of high tariffs, the NDA government has approved a slew of measures under the hydro policy to make it competitive.
Executing a hydropower project is time-consuming and tedious. It involves a thorough survey and investigation, detailed project reports, resettlement of the affected population and infrastructure development.
At present, India has an installed power-generation capacity of 357,875 MW, of which around 13% or 45,399.22 MW is generated through hydroelectric power projects. The other central hydro sector PSUs are Tehri Hydro Development Corp Ltd, North Eastern Electric Power Corp. Ltd (Neepco), and SJVN Ltd.
Hydropower projects, often located in remote regions, are crucial to stabilise the grid as India looks to add 175 GW of renewable capacity. However, given the issues regarding resettlement of the affected population and infrastructure development, many projects have been stuck and delayed leading to a decreasing share of hydropower in the country’s energy mix.
The government’s plan is to add hydro capacities of about 45 GW to the renewable energy basket of existing 80 GW which includes solar, wind and small hydro.
This comes at a time when India has brought 26.4 million new electricity consumers into its fold, which according to Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) is the largest expansion of electricity access in the history of mankind. In an indication of growing appetite for electricity in India, the country’s per capita electricity consumption has reached 1189 kilowatt-hour (kWh) as compared to a global average of 3600 kWh."

New Delhi: In an attempt to facilitate its overseas foray, state run Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) plans to change its article of association to do business in solar rich countries.
The public sector unit (PSU) hopes to land overseas business under the aegis of International Solar Alliance (ISA). ISA, the first treaty-based international government organization headquartered in India will see the number of inducted countries that have signed its framework agreement reach 100 nations at its second general assembly to be held from 30 October—2 November.
“There was a plan earlier to float SECI Videsh on the lines of ONGC Videsh. However, it lost traction. Lets see, how does the plan unfolds this time,"" said a senior Indian government official requesting anonymity.
SECI has been leading the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’ efforts rejig its energy mix in favour of green energy sources by conducting the bid process. This has helped India emerge as a clean energy champion. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also recently gifted $1 million ‘Gandhi Solar Park’ to the United Nations when he attended the Climate Action Summit 2019 in New York.
“The plan to facilitate SECI’s overseas foray is at a preliminary stage,"" said a second Indian government official who also did not want to be named.
The International Solar Alliance initially envisaged a group of 121 sunshine countries situated between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn as its members. However, later all United Nations members were made eligible for ISA membership. With 76 countries currently signatories to the landmark agreement, ISA has become India’s calling card on climate change and is increasingly being viewed as a foreign policy tool, especially with India and France front-ending efforts to set up the ISA.
At present, India has an installed power generation capacity of 357,875MW, of which around 22%, or 80.47 GW, is generated through clean energy projects. Of this solar and wind comprises 29.55 GW and 36.37 GW respectively. With addition of large hydro projects to clean energy segment, India is poised to have 225 GW of renewable energy by 2022.
Queries emailed to Jatindra Nath Swain, managing director, SECI and a spokesperson for India’s ministry of new and renewable energy on Sunday evening remained unanswered.
India also plans to help set up a global electricity grid that may initially aim to link countries such as Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam with the sub-continent as part of an evolving energy security architecture. The proposals for the same will be presented at the second general assembly of the ISA.
There are also new plans in the works. Mint reported on 12 September about the central government’ plan of making state-run companies build massive clean energy parks to help developers achieve economies of scale and further bring down solar and wind power tariffs.

21,2019-10-14,NTPC,"For the fourth straight month, coal dispatches to the power sector have fallen in Aug, hitting thermal plants’ inventoriesEven as NTPC fully commercializes the new plants, red flags are emerging regarding its running plants

Over the past month, shares of NTPC Ltd have remained powerless, down about 7%. The company said last week that it added 1,320 megawatts (MW), which takes it closer to its annual capacity target of 5,000MW. The capacity additions augur well, though, and the firm’s regulated business model assures a fixed return on invested equity.
Still, the stock’s lacklustre reaction implies investor concerns about earnings. As pointed out in previous columns, NTPC’s earnings have in recent years barely kept pace with capacity additions.
Fuel security for one of the newly added plants (Unit-1 of the Khargone super thermal power station) depends on a production ramp-up at one of NTPC’s captive mines, points out Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. If production does not scale up, the company will have to secure coal from other mines that are not so close.
In fact, even as NTPC fully commercializes the new plants, red flags are emerging regarding its running plants. Production at Coal India Ltd, the biggest producer of the fuel, has been hit by protracted rains. Production in September plummeted 23.5% from a year ago. In the six months to September this year, coal production was down 6%.
The drop in production has affected dispatches to the power sector. In August, for the fourth consecutive month, coal dispatches to the power sector have fallen, points out Elara Capital (India) Pvt. Ltd. The shrinking dispatches have been reducing coal inventories at thermal power plants, though the situation is not yet alarming.
Analysts fear that falling output at Coal India and dispatches to the power sector may hurt NTPC. Apart from impacting power plant utilization levels, insufficient coal can weigh on fuel availability at power plants. This fall in plant availability beyond a certain level impacts the incentive income of NTPC.
Recent data from the Central Electricity Authority shows a notable reduction in utilization and availability levels at NTPC’s power plants in August. Also, generation fell sharply (down 8%), though it is not yet clear how much of this is due to seasonal factors such as maintenance shutdowns.
If the trend in September continues beyond the current month, it would have a noticeable impact on the company’s earnings. “NTPC’s Q2 FY20 earnings may be subdued owing to lower coal stocks at its pithead plants given muted supply by Coal India. However, NTPC is planning to import around 2-2.5 million tons of coal even for its pit-head stations, etc., to avoid plant availability under-recovery in Q3 FY20. Thus, for the Corporation’s Q3 FY20 profit growth, coal supply growth (from Coal India) and imports are key monitorable,"" analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd said in a note."

17,2019-11-11,NTPC,"The management is confident of recouping revenue loss in the second half of the current fiscalNet earnings jumped 34.5% as the company benefited from levies on payment delays from customers

Mumbai: After successive quarters of earnings misses, NTPC Ltd impressed the Street with strong profit for the September quarter. The stock gained 2% in Monday morning trade. Net earnings jumped 34.5% as the company benefited from levies on payment delays from customers -- power distribution companies. Adjusted for the surge in other income, standalone net profit grew 6.9% which is decent considering the constrained revenue growth.
Revenues grew a mere 2.3%, weighed down by 7% fall in generation. In this backdrop, the performance looks decent. “Adjusted for ~ ₹900 crore of treasury income we estimate core project level profit of ~ ₹2,600 crore. This profit on a regulated equity base of  ₹53,200 crore translates into core project return on equity of ~20%,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note.
Dig deeper and the pressure points are hard to escape. Thermal power plant utilization levels remain sub-optimal. Last quarter they dropped to 64.3%, from 72.6% a year ago.
Worryingly, fuel constraints resurfaced. This impacted availability of the company’s power plants, resulting in cost under recoveries or the loss of revenues. In September quarter, the amount is pegged at  ₹330 crore.
The management is confident of recouping revenue loss in the second half of the current fiscal, helped by better fuel supplies. But the concerns do not end there. Demand challenges remain. The deceleration in power production in the country continues. India’s thermal power generation dropped 19% in October.
Second is payment dues from power distribution companies. As on August, total amount owed by buyers to generators stood at  ₹61,133 crore. NTPC, with has power purchase agreements is still better off. Further, with the central government insisting on letter of credits to be issued by the buyers, the financial risk is mitigated.
Even then, dues from buyers continues to pile up. As of September quarter, customers owe NTPC  ₹8,000 crore.
As a consequence, trade receivables more than doubled from March 2019 levels, impacting the company’s cash flows. “NTPC’s Q2FY20 performance reflected deteriorating financial health of discoms and domestic coal shortage. As a result, receivables (jumped) and cash flow took a hit (negative free cash flow in H1FY20),"" analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a note."
16,2019-11-12,NTPC,"Thermal power generation dropped 2% in April-October this yearThe slowdown in industrial demand can have larger implications for the state electricity boards

Mumbai: Thermal power generation dropped for the third consecutive month, registering a 19% fall in October. Monthly generation numbers are susceptible to vagaries of the season, especially monsoon when demand cools and thermal power plants undergo maintenance shutdowns.
But the longer duration trends are not encouraging either. Thermal power generation dropped 2% in April-October this year, the first such fall in at least a decade, show data from Central Electricity Authority. Part of the fall can be attributed to healthy rainfall, which apart from reducing temperatures has lowered the agriculture load and boosted hydro power generation. The 16% rise in hydro power generation in April-October is best in at least five years.
Still the fall in thermal power generation is disconcerting. Despite the rise in renewable energy, most of India’s electricity needs are met by thermal power. The fall in generation implies demand deceleration.
According to an industry expert, the growing use of energy efficiency appliances such as LED lights have slowed demand. But much of the fall in generation can be explained by the slowdown in demand from industries, which are large consumers of electricity, the expert added.
“We estimate that energy demand fell ~11% YoY in October 2019, the largest across-the-board fall in the last decade. Peak demand also continues to fall. The steep fall is probably the result of a confluence of factors such as a delayed monsoon retreat, implementation of the payment security mechanism, and continued weakness in industry demand,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note.
The slowdown in industrial demand can have larger implications for the state electricity boards (SEBs), large buyers of electricity in India. SEBs sell electricity to industrial users at relatively higher tariffs, helping them recoup part of the losses they incur in selling power at subsidized rates for households and agriculture sector.
Not surprisingly, the demand slowdown is making SEBs wary. They are reducing their off-take from electricity producers. Utilization levels at two thermal power plants of JSW Energy Ltd were hit last quarter due to reduced offtake by power distribution companies. Similarly, NTPC Ltd’s latest quarterly results show a fall in utilization levels at its thermal power plants, indicating low offtake from buyers. Renewable energy developers are seeing back-down in power offtake by distribution companies.
Volumes and prices in the spot electricity market are also trending lower. The low demand, if it persists for long, will weigh on the earnings of utility companies. Firms dependent on spot electricity and short-term power markets will be hit the most. Comparatively, NTPC is better placed due to its regulated business model where the company’s power plants are tied-up with long term power purchase agreements and are assured minimum return on equity invested.
Still, the weakening demand from the industrial sector does not bode well for overall financial health of the sector. This is one factor investors need to keep a tab on."

Even renewable energy firms are seeing a backdown in power offtake by discoms.
An industry expert attributes the fall in demand to the increasing use of energy-efficient appliances. Besides, industry demand has also been contracting and it is a big consumer of power, the expert added, asking not to be named.
The same sentiments are being echoed in the market. “We estimate that energy demand fell 11% YoY in October 2019, the largest across-the-board fall in the last decade.

NTPC: State-run power giant NTPC Ltd is likely to raise around  ₹10,000 crore through green bonds for acquisition of the government's stake in THDC India Ltd (THDCIL) and North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd (NEEPCO), according to a PTI report."
11,2019-11-26,NTPC,"THDCIL’s plants are seeing high operations and maintenance costs, while Neepco’s are facing availability issuesTHDCIL and Neepco are also facing similar problems, though at varying degrees

The acquisition of THDC India Ltd (THDCIL) and North Eastern Electric Power Corp. Ltd (Neepco) will not test NTPC Ltd’s financial limits. But the company will have to be careful in integrating these new acquisitions to generate remunerative returns.
Together, the firms will add close to 3 gigawatts (GW) of operating power plants to NTPC. Around 2GW of power plants are under construction and several more are in the pipeline. This provides good growth visibility for NTPC.
But these projects are predominantly hydropower plants. NTPC, on the other hand, has a proven track record in building and running a large portfolio of thermal power plants efficiently.
The company runs an 800 megawatts (MW) hydropower plant efficiently (1,000MW equals 1GW). But as demonstrated by another listed hydropower producer NHPC Ltd, hydro projects are susceptible to execution delays. Inordinate delays in the construction of NHPC’s hydropower projects have resulted in sub-optimal returns.
THDCIL and Neepco are also facing similar problems, though at varying degrees. Neepco’s 600MW Kameng hydropower project in Arunachal Pradesh is delayed for several years now. THDCIL has around 1.4GW of power plants under construction. Most of them are expected to be commissioned in FY23.
With significant amount of funds in capital work in progress (CWIP), timely execution and commissioning is crucial. According to analysts, the reported return on equity (RoE) of Neepco is impacted by high CWIP in recent years. While RoE of THDCIL is relatively better, the firm also has high CWIP, says analysts.
Further, as SBICAP Securities Ltd points out, performance of the operating power plants of both the firms is not up to the mark either. THDCIL’s plants are seeing high operations and maintenance costs, while Neepco’s plants are facing availability issues, which is impacting cost recovery.
Comparatively, NTPC demonstrated better expertise in running its hydropower plant, which should help it beef up the performance of THDCIL and Neepco’s operating power plants. But how well NTPC can execute under-construction hydropower plants remains a question mark.
Of course, NTPC is well placed financially to purchase THDCIL and Neepco. The government is yet to finalize the valuation of these firms. Analysts peg the acquisition cost in the range of  ₹10,000-14,000 crore for NTPC.
With debt-to-equity ratio of less than two times and annual free cash flow of around  ₹16,000 crore in FY19, the company is well placed to fund the acquisition. “We find both additions to be earnings accretive for NTPC at the fair value and with NTPC’s strong balance sheet and annual profits of  ₹10,000-12,000 crore these are easily funded from 2-3 years of internal accruals,"" analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd said in a note."
10,2019-12-01,NTPC,"According to Moody’s, power demand grew 1.5% till October, compared to an average growth of 4.9% in the past five yearsImplementation of the payment security mechanism may have temporarily thwarted electricity purchases by power distributors

Mumbai: Is the pace of 4.5%, the slowest in six years, the lowest point of India’s gross domestic product growth?
While there is no easy answer to that question, the dimming lights in the power generation space portend a worsening economic outlook. After all, part of the economy is powered by how much electricity its factories, farms and households consume.
Electricity generation, tracked by many to gauge the momentum in the economy, saw its biggest fall in more than five years in October.
To be sure, the government and many on the Street see the 12.9% drop in October power generation as an aberration, attributing it to a combination of high base, an extended monsoon and a economic slowdown. Even then, there is no denying the fact that electricity generation so far this fiscal is the slowest in at least a decade. Importantly, the deceleration in power generation has intensified in recent months. Data for November is not available. But daily generation data till 25 November shows a 6% decline.
“If manufacturing slows, then the (power) usage also falls. This is reflected in weak IIP (index of industrial production) data,"" said D.K. Joshi, chief economist at Crisil Ltd.
“The economy has witnessed a significant loss of momentum—from 8.13% (GDP growth) in Q4FY18 to 4.5% in Q2FY20, clearly establishing the fact that this is a cyclical slowdown and the cycle is yet to bottom out,"" Gaurav Kapur, chief economist at IndusInd Bank, said in a 29 November report.
The demand-side story is even more worrying. According to Moody’s Investors Service, power demand grew 1.5% till October, compared to an average growth of 4.9% in the past five years. “For the past 10 years, the ratio of power demand growth to real GDP has been around 0.8. This implies that the sharp decline in power demand is symptomatic of a slowing economy,"" Moody’s said on 18 November.
About 40% of the electricity produced in India is consumed by the industrial and commercial sector. Around one-fourth is used by households and a fifth by the agriculture sector. The quantum of fall in power usage by the industrial sector is difficult to calculate because of lack of data.
Implementation of the payment security mechanism may have temporarily thwarted electricity purchases by power distributors. Even then, analysts say power demand cannot be pulled down only by the farm and household sectors.
Electricity usage dropped in all but three states in October, shows data collated by Elara Capital (India) Pvt. Ltd. This is the largest across-the-board fall in the last decade, points out SBICAP Securities Ltd in a separate note, referring to the reduction in energy demand.
Consumption in the most industrialized states—Gujarat and Maharashtra—dropped 18% and 21%, respectively. This fiscal through October, usage in these states was down 3-5%. “This reflects the slowdown in the manufacturing activity, increased penetration of renewable energy sources and demand-side measures on energy efficiency,"" said Deepak Agrawala, president of investment banking at Elara Capital.
Other indicators such as freight traffic at Indian Railways show a slowdown in October. They are down 8% vis-à-vis a 6% fall in September. Volumes on the Indian Energy Exchange remained sluggish despite tariffs falling to a two-year low in October. “Decline in diesel consumption also points to weak economic activity,"" said Teresa John, an economist at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities.
Analysts fear the readings for October may deteriorate. “Power generation fell an unprecedented 12% in October and remains weak so far in November too, likely suggesting manufacturing (IIP) may fare even worse than it did in September,"" Jefferies India said in a 14 November note.
The impact of a continued slowdown in electricity demand from industrial and manufacturing sector will be first felt by power distribution companies (discoms). Industry and commercial consumers pay higher tariffs helping discoms recoup part of their losses from selling power at below the cost for households and agriculture sector. A sustained fall in power offtake from the industrial sector will impact the cash flows of discoms, which in turn can curtail electricity purchases.
Thermal power generators are already feeling the heat. Utilization levels dropped below 50% in October. Thermal power plant utilization levels at India’s largest power producer, NTPC Ltd, dropped to a 13-year low in October, points out Elara Capital.
The situation is no better at private utilities. Generation volume dropped at CESC Ltd, JSW Energy Ltd, Reliance Power Ltd and Adani Power Ltd. This comes on the back of reduced power offtake that many of these companies saw in the September quarter.
The economy is low on power and the worry is things could get worse."
9,2019-12-02,NTPC,"The CAG also recommended that railways need to take steps to augment their internal revenuesThe Railways has also been unable to meet its operational cost of passenger services and other coaching services

NEW DELHI :
The Railways recorded an operating ratio of 98.44% in 2017-18 which is the worst in the previous 10 years, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has said in a report tabled in Parliament on Monday.
A measure of expenditure against revenue, the operating ratio shows how efficiently the railway is operating and how healthy its finances are. An operating ratio of 98.44% means that the Railways spent  ₹98.44 to earn  ₹100.
The national auditor in its report on the railways' finances, said that the railways would have ended up with a negative balance of  ₹5,676.29 crore instead of a surplus of  ₹1,665.61 crore but for the advance received from NTPC and IRCON.
""The Indian Railways' operating ratio at 98.44% in 2017-18 was the worst in the last 10 years,"" the national auditor, Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), said in a report tabled in Parliament on Monday.
""Exclusion of this advance would otherwise have increased the operating ratio to 102.66%,"" the auditor said.
The Railways has also been unable to meet its operational cost of passenger services and other coaching services. Almost 95 per cent of the profit from freight traffic was utilised to compensate for the loss on operation of passenger and other coaching services, it said.
The audit analysis of the finance accounts of Indian Railways revealed a declining trend of revenue surplus and the share of internal resources in capital expenditure. The net revenue surplus decreased by 66.10 per cent from  ₹4,913.00 crore in 2016-17 to  ₹1,665.61 crore in 2017-18.
The share of internal resources in total capital expenditure also decreased to 3.01% in 2017-18.
""This had resulted in greater dependence on Gross Budgetary Support and Extra Budgetary Resources,"" the CAG said.
The CAG also recommended that railways need to take steps to augment their internal revenues, so that dependence on gross and extra budgetary resources is contained.
""Under provisioning for depreciation is resulting in piling up of 'throw forward' of works concerning renewal of over aged assets. There is an urgent need to address this backlog and ensure timely replacement and renewal of old assets,"" it said.
It also advised the railways to avoid creating new funds without any ""justifiable reason""."

New Delhi: Indian Railways’ operating ratio was at its worst, hitting a 10-year high of 98.44% in 2017-18, according to Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).
“The operating ratio of 98.44% was the worst in the last ten years. Indian Railways, in fact, would have ended up with a negative balance of  ₹5,676.29 crore instead of surplus of  ₹1,665.61 crore but for the advance received from NTPC and IRCON,"" according to CAG report ‘Union Government (Railways)- Railways Finances’ tabled in the Parliament on Monday.
Had it not been for the advances received from the two state-owned companies, the national carrier’s operating ratio would have been 102.66%, the report said.
The operating ratio is the amount spent of every rupee earned. In the last few years, the railways has been bearing high operating ratio, which indicates that it has not been able to generate higher revenue as compared to its expenses. According to the Union Budget, railways is eyeing an operating ratio of 95% in 2019-20, down from 97.3% a year ago.
The CAG report spelled out the impact of passengers fare concessions on railways’ earnings and effectiveness of the existing internal control mechanism to check misuse of concessions during 2017-18.
Indian Railways runs one of the largest logistics and transportation networks in the world. Its sheer scale of operations makes it a challenge to cater to demands of both freight and passengers. Railways, therefore, end up cross-subsidizing passengers by overcharging freight.
“Indian Railways was unable to meet its operational cost of passenger services and other coaching services. Almost 95% of the profit from freight traffic was utilized to compensate the loss on operation of passenger and other coaching services,"" it said, adding that one of the contributing factors towards this has been free and concessional fare and tickets.
According to CAG, 89.7% of the Railways’ revenue is forgone towards concessions was due to special consideration given to senior citizens and privilege pass holders.
“Several instances of misuse of passes and irregular grant of concessions on medical certificates were noticed. Passenger Reservation System lacks adequate validation controls to validate age of freedom fighters and to prevent irregular multiple booking on the same privilege pass,"" it said.
The audit analysis also showed declining trend of revenue surplus and the share of internal resources in the capital expenditure.
“The net revenue surplus decreased by 66.10% from  ₹4,913 crore in 2016-17 to  ₹1,665.61 crore in 2017-18. The share of internal resources in total capital expenditure also decreased to 3.01% in 2017-18. This had resulted in greater dependence on gross budgetary support and extra budgetary resources,"" the report said."

New Delhi: Railways have been spending an additional  ₹22,000 crore on salaries and pensions of its employees following implementation of the 7th Pay Commission recommendations, which has hit its financial health, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said in Lok Sabha on Wednesday.
Responding to a question on operational losses of railways, Goyal said construction of new lines and operating trains in economically unviable areas under its social obligations also take away a sizeable amount of its funds.
""After the implementation of 7th Pay Commission recommendations, there has been an over expenditure of  ₹22,000 crore for salaries and pension of railway employees. This has contributed to the overall operating loss,"" he said during Question Hour.
The minister said railways spend a lot a funds on cleanliness, running suburban railway trains, gauge conversions and others.
""All these have cost and have effect on railways,"" he said.
""When we see the overall picture, implementation of the 7th Pay Commission recommendations and running trains under social obligations lead to operating ratio going down by 15 per cent in just one year,"" he said.
Goyal said time has come to explore the possibility of separating the budgets of social obligation expenditure and trains running in commercially viable sectors.

6,2019-12-09,NTPC,"Government-owned POSOCO implemented the SCED mechanism on a pilot basis from 1st April this yearUnder SCED, a separate account was created for payments to/from generators for increment/decrement in their schedule

New Delhi: Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFS) has recommended a ‘buy’ on shares of state-owned NTPC Ltd as it expects higher savings for the company due to Central Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (CERC) order.
The financial service firm sees a 44% upside in the stock and has set a target price of  ₹164.
At 1.50 pm, shares of NTPC were at  ₹112.25, down 0.27% from previous close.
The Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) scheme — planned to optimize sourcing from thermal inter-state generating stations (whose full capacity is tied up and regulated with CERC) — will help NTPC reap benefits of around  ₹400 crore, the brokerage firm said.
“The results of the SCED scheme have been encouraging. Total savings of around  ₹310 crore were achieved in the first three months of FY20. According to CERC, 50% of these savings would be shared with generators. NTPC’s share stands at  ₹100 crore for first three months of FY20, implying an annual benefit of  ₹400 crore for the company,"" MOFS said in its report.
Government-owned Power System Operation Corporation Limited (POSOCO) implemented the SCED mechanism on a pilot basis from 1st April this year. Under SCED, a separate account was created for payments to/from generators for increment/decrement in their schedule. On implementation, the scheme led to savings of  ₹310 crore in the cost of power purchase, around 1.5% reduction in generation cost, over Apr-Jun’19.
The CERC had directed that benefits within the SCED pool should be shared equally between the participating generators and power distribution companies (discoms) after compensation for part load operations of generators.
Under SCED, power is dispatched in the order of the lowest cost (variable cost) of generation. With better utilization of lower cost plants, generation costs within the system were reduced."

Leading a Nifty rally, three among these advanced 38 to 50 per cent in the last one year. Market participants are now guessing who would be the next set of stocks leading the rally.
A section of traders is betting on SALMAN -- SBI, Axis Bank, Larsen and Toubro, Maruti Suzuki, Adani Ports and National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) -- to lead the next rally.
The Brokerages have maintained 'BUY' on SBI, betting on a recovery in India's growth momentum. Nomura had said SBI's Q2 asset quality beat its estimates. SBI gained over 12 per cent in the past one year, and closed on Friday at  ₹337.25 a share.
The asset quality of the bank improved with gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio coming in at 7.19 per cent, down 276 bps yearly and 34 bps sequentially.

The bank had reported a consolidated Interest Income of  ₹12,183.88 crore, up 3.89 per cent from last quarter. Axis Bank has gained over 15 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹739 a piece.
The NTPC has also been on the rise after the foreign financial firm Morgan Stanley upgraded the company's shares to 'Overweight' from 'Equal-Weight' earlier. This came on the back of the government's decision to approve strategic disinvestment in the power major.
It had, however, fallen 23.53 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹114.55 a share on Friday.
JPMorgan had recently reiterated 'overweight' rating on Maruti Suzuki and also raised its target price. The largest car manufacturer in India has, however, declined 8.58 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹7,255 a share.
Larsen and Toubro had recently downgraded by Credit Suisse to 'neutral' from outperform and revised target price down to  ₹1460 from  ₹1750.

It has fallen 8.64 per cent in the past year and closed at  ₹1,310.75 a share.
Global brokerage houses are also bullish on Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone despite its quarterly results falling short of market expectations.

4,2019-12-24,NTPC,"All but one of the 26 analysts covering the company rate it a buy, with a return potential of 34%, the third-highest among Sensex members

NTPC Ltd. is the world’s most-loved power producer by equity analysts, and yet the shares of India’s largest utility are trading near a 10-month low. What gives?
The New Delhi-based company is the top rated stock among the world’s largest utilities, with a recommendation consensus of 4.9 on a Bloomberg scale where 5 is a unanimous buy. Analysts expect the company to wring more profit from soon-to-be acquired hydro-power assets, helping it lift its earnings and share price.
“The hydro assets to be acquired offer significant scope to improve efficiency and boost profitability,"" analysts at SBICap Securities Ltd. wrote in a recent note after a government panel approved the sale of stakes in generators THDC India Ltd. and North Eastern Electric Power Corp. to NTPC.
NTPC trades at 8.5 times projected earnings for the next fiscal year, the fourth-cheapest among members of India’s S&P BSE Sensex. All but one of the 26 analysts covering the company rate it a buy, with a return potential of 34%, the third-highest among Sensex members.
Profit took a hit over the last two years due to disruptions in coal supplies, but the “fundamentals are now priced in and valuation is near historic lows,"" said Rupesh D Sankhe, an analyst at Elara Capital India Pvt. in Mumbai. “Capacity addition in the next two years will drive earnings growth.""
Unlike private sector rivals, NTPC’s revenue doesn’t depend on India’s demand for power - which slumped for a fourth straight month in November. The company, which supplies power to state electricity boards, is assured a 15.5% return so long as it keeps its plants running 85% of the time, according to Rohit Natarajan, an analyst at Antique Stock Broking Ltd.
“Private sector players have systemic issues of some or the other form, while NTPC has remained unscathed and has a matured predictable business model,"" said Natarajan. “The consensus view is completely justified.""

2,2019-12-30,NTPC,"Bond covenant requires that firms be majority-owned by the governmentReducing the government’s stake to below 50% will increase the cost of selling bonds for these companies

New Delhi: The government is facing hurdles in trimming its stakes in Power Finance Corp. Ltd (PFC) and NTPC Ltd, as the companies may breach a bond covenant that requires the companies to be majority-owned by the government.
Reducing the government’s stake to less than 50% will also increase overseas borrowing costs for these companies, as they will lose their quasi-government status as borrowers.
NTPC and PFC are among state-run companies in which the government plans to reduce its stake by selling shares through its two exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a basket of securities that trade on exchanges. The government sells its stakes in listed central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) through the CPSE ETF and Bharat 22 ETF.
“We don’t have the necessary headroom now to raise a big amount through ETFs. We have asked the administrative ministry to examine the legal matter of bringing the stake below 50% in NTPC and PFC,"" a finance ministry official said on condition of anonymity. “If it is an expensive and time-consuming proposition to get the clearance from overseas market regulators, then we will take out the two stocks from the ETFs.""
A former NTPC official said that when the power producer sold overseas bonds, it gave an undertaking that if the government stake in the company comes down below 50%, then investors can withdraw their money. “NTPC has raised funds through bond issues worth  ₹70,000 crore, planning for a period of 10 years. If investors start asking for their money back, then the company has to be closed down. That’s why the government is not sure how to bring its stake below 50%,"" the former official said on condition of anonymity.
PFC and NTPC, besides other companies in which the government owns more than 50%, enjoy the status of quasi-sovereign borrowers. The implicit guarantee of the government reduces the cost of borrowing by selling bonds. Reducing the government’s stake to below 50% will increase the cost of selling bonds for these companies as investors will seek higher yields for the additional risks they take.
In September, PFC had scaled up the quantum of funds to be raised through overseas bond sales to $5 billion from $3 billion under its Global Medium Term Note Programme. In April 2017, NTPC had raised  ₹2,000 crore through masala bonds under its $4 billion medium-term note programme for capital expenditure.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on 20 November approved a proposal to bring down its stake in select CPSEs to under 51% on a case-to-case basis.
The government’s stake in NTPC has come down from 56.4% in June to 54.5% at the end of the September quarter, while in PFC, its stake has reduced from 59.05% in June to 56.16% in the September quarter.
Industry lobby Ficci, in its pre-budget memorandum to the finance ministry, has urged it to go for privatization rather than partial disinvestment as the latter does not find much interest among investors. “The government should announce a five-year plan to reduce government stake in PSUs (public sector undertakings) with the idea of keeping the Maharatnas and key strategic companies, and selling the rest,"" it said.
The government has garnered  ₹17,364 crore from disinvestment till November, around 82% ( ₹14,369 crore) of it has been accrued from the index funds and not from stake sales, indicating a heavy reliance on ETFs to meet the disinvestment target.
Out of the  ₹14,369 crore,  ₹10,000 crore was raised through CPSE-ETF and  ₹4,369 crore through Bharat-22 ETF.
On 26 December, Mint reported that the government’s disinvestment target might fall short by  ₹40,000-50,000 crore as it was unlikely to complete the privatization of Air India Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Container Corp. of India Ltd by March-end."
