82,2018-06-07,Bajaj Finserv,"Bajaj has taken a 'price correction' on the CT100 range to cater to the marriage market, says Kevin D'sa, president of the finance vertical at the firm

Mumbai: The idiom ‘desperate times call for desperate measures’ seems to ring immensely true for India’s third largest motorcycle maker, Bajaj Auto Ltd, as the company has been slashing prices of its CT100 range of entry-level models since the beginning of the year, the most recent being an average reduction of about Rs3,000 in April. 
Mumbai: The idiom ‘desperate times call for desperate measures’ seems to ring immensely true for India’s third largest motorcycle maker, Bajaj Auto Ltd, as the company has been slashing prices of its CT100 range of entry-level models since the beginning of the year, the most recent being an average reduction of about Rs3,000 in April.
The Pune-based auto maker has taken a “price correction"" on the CT100 range to cater to the marriage market, said Kevin D’sa, president of the finance vertical at the firm, on a conference call after the announcement of the company’s March quarter results.
The company will reconsider its prices once the marriage season demand dries up, he said, adding that Bajaj seeks to “expand market share in the lowest-end segment by make it more affordable"".
At present, the ex-showroom (Mumbai) price of the basic CT100 variant is Rs31,098, giving it a significant price advantage compared with motorcycle market leader Hero MotoCorp Ltd’s well established Splendor and Passion, which retail at over Rs50,000 a piece.
An upgrade of the basic variant was launched in mid-2017 with an ex-showroom (Mumbai) price tag of Rs33,536. A back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates a price reduction of over Rs2,400 for the basic model alone.
Within the CT100 range, Bajaj offers various trims depending on an electric start system and alloy wheels. On average, Bajaj has reduced the ex-showroom price of the CT100 range by about Rs5,000 in 2018, said a dealership executive based in western Mumbai, on condition of anonymity.
“Prices were reduced in March and April. In both months, sales of CT100 range went up 20% over the previous year. About 50% of these customers considered other brands but decided on Bajaj because of the price reduction"", the dealer added.
The maker of the Pulsar motorcycle aims to corner a larger share of the rejuvenated domestic motorcycle industry by undercutting rivals in the volume-spinning entry-level segment (having an engine capacity between 75cc to 110cc), as the onset of the wedding season in north and central India drives up non-metro demand.
The strategy seems to be working as Bajaj outgrew the broader industry in April, according to data provided by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers and posted a rise of 61 basis points in market share to 16.33%.
One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Bajaj’s sales jumped 23.97% to 200,743 units during the month, while India’s motorcycle industry grew 19.38% to over 1.2 million units.
The company also slashed prices on an older model of the Pulsar150 by about Rs2,500 to “make place"" for a new twin-disc brake variant introduced in April, according to D’sa.
Bajaj ended FY18 with a market share of 15.65%, down from 18.04% during FY17.The firm had intended to exit FY18 with a 24% market share.
On the back of these initiatives, Bajaj is confident of outgrowing the domestic industry but not without at a cost. The pricing power in the entry-segment is marginal, if at all, and such a price cut will further dampen margins, say analysts.
The CT100’s Ebitda margins are already in the red, D’sa said.
The company further plans to “attack"" the entry-level segment, “where a big chunk of the market sits"", with some new products which are in the works, according to S. Ravikumar, president, business development and assurance, at Bajaj Auto.
“For the immediate quarter and the next, the main action is going to be in the entry segment"", he added.
Going forward, analysts say the worst is not yet behind Bajaj. The company faces intense competition in the domestic market, which will lead to continued market share erosion for the company, said Bharat Gianani, analyst at Sharekhan Ltd in an 18 May note.
Analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd hold a “bleak outlook"" for Bajaj, and have reduced their margin estimates by 130 basis points for FY19 owing to “the company’s inability to take the required price hike"" and rising commodity costs, said Saksham Kaushal and Poorvi Banka in a 21 May note."

80,2018-07-20,Bajaj Finserv,"Given that most banks have upped their ante in acquiring retail customers, Bajaj Finance perhaps found it tougher than before to grab more customers

Consumer lender Bajaj Finance Ltd seems to be facing some competition in its lending business, with more and more banks chasing the aspiring individual borrower through lucrative deals. The non-banking financial company’s growth metrics for the June quarter fell short of Street expectations, although it’s fair to say that these expectations were extraordinarily high. 
Consumer lender Bajaj Finance Ltd seems to be facing some competition in its lending business, with more and more banks chasing the aspiring individual borrower through lucrative deals. The non-banking financial company’s growth metrics for the June quarter fell short of Street expectations, although it’s fair to say that these expectations were extraordinarily high.
Bajaj Finance reported a good 49% growth in fresh loans for the three months ended 30 June, but slower than the previous two quarters. Given that most banks have upped their ante in acquiring retail customers and even other non-banks are aggressively chasing individual borrowers, the company perhaps found it tougher than before to grab more customers.
The first quarter is usually the strongest for Bajaj Finance, which is why a lower-than-expected growth upset investors. The over 5% knee-jerk fall of the stock intraday reflected this sentiment. 
But since investors have few options that compare with the company’s pristine quality and high growth, the slowdown was soon forgiven and the stock recovered to close over 1% up on Thursday.
The growth in assets under management has remained strong at 35% and it also seems to be secular across segments. In the words of Rajiv Jain, managing director of Bajaj Finance, there is no one-trick pony in the loan book. 
The company’s main consumer lending business grew 35%, loans to small business rose 42%, rural business increased at a breakneck speed of 75% and even the mortgage business, newly housed under a separate subsidiary, gained 27% in the quarter.
The management is sanguine but also cautious as it expects a growth of 25-27% for the current fiscal year. Asset quality continues to be enviable with the gross bad loan ratio within the vicinity of 1%.
Adding to this, the lender reported a 69% surge in net profit on the back of a 42% rise in core income for the quarter ended June. Since the company is in a sweet spot, having got the consumption story right, the stock trades at a rich multiple of six times its estimated book value for fiscal year 2020.
The risk to Bajaj Finance lies from rising borrowing costs, which could crimp margins and hurt its sky-high valuations."

The lack of penetration of financial products in India and the play on these penetration rates getting sorted over time is an overarching investment theme in the present day. We have seen this play out in the past with automobile, home and durable financing reaching significant penetration levels. There has also been strong progress made by the government in rolling out programmes on insurance, banking and the like for the lower-income population. Companies that have taken a persistent view on cracking these large opportunities have become immensely valuable, e.g., Bajaj Finance. There are opportunities to solve specific need gaps for the large population in the middle class. We believe the right way to do this is by creating the right product addressing a specific customer need combined with a distribution strategy which is economically viable. Several success stories abound, for instance, Zerodha, which became a major profitable retail broker without a dollop of venture money with a simple value proposition. Ideally, one would imagine a world where there is a great product which sells itself. Our sense though is that we are not there yet due to a lower level of awareness about financial products in India as opposed to benchmark models we see in the west.

75,2019-01-30,Bajaj Finserv,"Higher margins, rising proportion of low-yielding mortgage portfolio needs to be closely monitoredThe non-banking financial company surprised the Street with record profits of  ₹1,060 crore

Is there a liquidity crisis? That’s the question Bajaj Finance Ltd’s investors would have asked after going through its December quarter (Q3) results.
The non-banking financial company surprised the Street with record profits of  ₹1,060 crore, 54% higher than the same period last year. Assets under management (AUM) rose as much as 41% over the same period of the previous year, higher than the growth recorded in the preceding seven quarters.
Little wonder, Bajaj Finance shares jumped nearly 6% in the last hour or so of trading on Tuesday.
Strong growth in high-yielding segments, such as rural and consumer, helped the company’s AUM growth on a year-on-year basis. Sure, the rural portfolio grew at the fastest pace, but that has come off a smaller base.
Expectations were running low on Bajaj Finance’s overall loan growth due to liquidity constraints. For instance, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities were expecting loan growth or AUM growth to moderate to 35% compared to 38% in the September quarter.
Net interest income, or the difference between interest earned and expended, increased sharply by 46% year-on-year, for the December quarter.
According to Digant Haria, vice president (research) at Antique Stock Broking Ltd, net interest margins increased to 12.6% in the December quarter from 11.5% in the September quarter, which is the highest in many years.
Nonetheless, there are some weak spots. “Asset quality witnessed slight pressure with slippages coming in higher,"" said analysts from ICICI Securities Ltd in a note to clients, adding that overall headline NPA (non-performing assets) numbers were still under control.
Gross NPA and net NPA ratios for the December quarter came in at 1.55% and 0.62%, respectively. The measures were six basis points and nine basis points higher compared to the September quarter. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The Bajaj Finance stock is still 16% lower than its annual closing high seen on 29 August. While the liquidity crisis doesn’t seem to have impacted the company’s growth in the December quarter, investors may do well to watch for some more time.
Also note that valuations at 4.8 times estimated book for FY21 leave little room for error. Going ahead, increasing margins in the backdrop of a fast growing book and rising proportion of low-yielding mortgage portfolio needs to be closely monitored, according to Haria of Antique Stock."

71,2019-04-11,Bajaj Finserv,"From the start of 2019 through Thursday, more than a dozen companies raised $7 billion offshore, according to RefinitivAmong those aiming for dollar-debt are renewable energy firms Adani Green Energy Ltd, Greenko Group and Azure Power, said report 

Mumbai: Indian companies are lining up to seek dollar-denominated debt as global interest rates soften, but only a few are likely to find it as foreign investors remain wary about the credit quality of many, bankers say.
It's no surprise that firms want to tap the offshore market, given lower rates, ample dollar liquidity, reduced rupee hedging costs and the reluctance of Indian lenders - many of whom are grappling with bad debts - to take on more risk.
Also making offshore debt attractive is that the Reserve Bank of India has eased external commercial borrowings guidelines, and started forward dollar-rupee swap auctions.
From the start of 2019 through Thursday, when India's giant election got under way, more than a dozen companies raised $7 billion offshore, according to Refinitiv.
That's well above the $4.7 billion done in 2018, when dollar liquidity was tight due to four rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve.
And among those aiming for dollar-debt are renewable energy firms Adani Green Energy Ltd, Greenko Group and Azure Power, according to people knowledgeable about their plans.
Together these companies plan to raise over $1 billion in overseas bonds in the next few months, they say.
Also wanting to tap offshore funds are non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) Bajaj Finance, Tata Capital, Tata Motor Finance, L&T Finance and Shriram Transport Finance, according to bankers who estimate that in total they hope to secure $2.0 billion-$2.5 billion.
Along with manufacturing firms, NBFCs are natural applicants for securing offshore funding. The institutions - commonly called shadow banks in India - are the biggest source of funding for small businesses. Many NBFCs need to increase capital, and are struggling to do it domestically.
A STRUGGLE TO SECURE
But bankers say lower-rated ones will also struggle to secure dollar debt, as foreign investors remain skeptical of their credit quality.
Shantanu Sahai, Nomura's head of debt capital markets in Mumbai, said top-rated NBFCs ""will easily get access"" to offshore money"" while a second tier will have to wait until the elections are over, and a third tier face months of trying to convince investors to be confident of their credit quality.
""Investors will only buy debt in those NBFCs which have predictive cash flows,"" he said.
A series of debt defaults by an infrastructure funding major in September has eroded confidence of lenders and investors in the not-so-tightly-regulated NBFCs, as many remain worried about their asset quality despite policymakers taking steps to improve cash conditions.
The forward dollar-rupee auctions started by the central bank are one factor incentivising Indian firms to seek offshore debt. This has brought down hedging costs by as much as 60 basis points to 3.51 percent on one year forward dollar/rupee rates.
""There are many corporates and NBFCs who are enquiring with us,"" said a private debt investment banker.

66,2019-05-16,Bajaj Finserv,"The lender booked 5.83 million new loans during the quarter under reviewOn an annual basis, assets under management grew 41% to  ₹1.15 trillion

Mumbai: Bajaj Finance reported a consolidated net profit of  ₹1,176.06 crore for the quarter ended March 2019, suggesting an increase of 57% from the same period last year. The consolidated results of Bajaj Finance include its wholly-owned subsidiaries – Bajaj Housing Finance and Bajaj Financial Securities.
The non-banking financial company (NBFC) posted a net interest income (NII) of  ₹3,395 crore in Q4FY19, up 50% on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis. The lender booked 5.83 million new loans during the quarter under review, up 53% from 3.8 million in the same period last year and, on an annual basis, its assets under management (AUM) grew 41% to  ₹1.15 trillion in Q4FY19.
While the non-bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs) ratio — gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans — stood at 1.54%, its net non-performing assets were at 0.63% of its assets.
In a rating release on 5 April, Crisil said Bajaj Finance has emerged as one of the largest retail asset financing NBFCs in India. Crisil added that Bajaj Finance's asset-liability profile is comfortable. Between 31 August 2018 and 21 March 2019, the company had debt repayments of  ₹12,540 crore, of which commercial paper repayments are around  ₹7,695 crore. As on 21 March, 2019, it had cash and cash equivalents of  ₹3,525 crore and unutilized bank lines of  ₹4,202 crore.
“Bajaj Finance's liquidity profile also benefits from the high proportion of shorter-tenor assets such as consumer durables; it has significant positive gaps in its asset liability management (ALM), indicating that business inflows support repayments,"" said Crisil.
Of the consolidated AUM mix of the lender, consumer business accounted for 39%, rural at 8%, SME at 14%, commercial at 10% and mortgages at 29% as on 31 March. However, on a standalone basis, consumer accounted for 45% of the AUM, rural at 9%, SME at 16%, commercial at 12% and mortgage (residual) at 18% in the same period.
Meanwhile, Bajaj Finserv, the holding company for Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company reported a consolidated profit after tax (PAT) of  ₹839 crore in Q4FY19, up 32% year-on-year.
S Sreenivasan, chief financial officer, Bajaj Finserv said the inflows that come from its retail business, matches against the outflows and in each of the maturity buckets Bajaj Finance has a surplus.
“The difference between us and some other NBFCs might be that our book is predominantly short-term. Our longer term housing finance book is about 30% of the total book and the rest is predominantly consumer finance and the loan churns in less than a year,"" said Sreenivasan.
Sreenivasan added that Bajaj Finance does not need access to as much long-term funds as an infra company would need. “Therefore we are in a good liquidity position and we have no issue of funding either in the market of in terms of our asset liability management (ALM),"" he said."
65,2019-05-16,Bajaj Finserv,"Consumer loans grew by over 50% from the year-ago period, while loans to small businesses increased by 38%Bajaj Finance’s asset liability position is comfortable and nearly 13% of its borrowings are from retail deposits

Investors have nothing but adulation for Bajaj Finance Ltd, which is visible in the outperformance of the stock compared to the broader market since last December.
The fact that the scrip gained more than 4% intraday on Thursday shows investors were happy with its fourth quarter performance. It closed the day with a gain of 3.6%. After all, net profit growth beat Street estimates to come in at 41% on a stand-alone basis, and 57% on a consolidated basis.
The growth is not hollow, because it came from a strong 50% expansion in core income, along with enviable asset quality metrics. The consumer lender’s disbursals continued to gallop across verticals, with its rural business leading as usual. Consumer loans, the mainstay of the lending business, grew by over 50% from the year-ago period, while loans to small businesses increased by 38%.
That said, the emerging narrative of a slowdown in consumption was visible on Bajaj Finance’s books too.
As shown by the accompanying chart, the AUM (assets under management) growth of the lender was 23% year-on-year for the March quarter. This was lower than the 33% growth in the year-ago period. The management said: “Consumption is slower, but it is also patchy.""
In a post-results call with analysts, the management added that signs of a marginal slowdown were visible in certain categories of loans, while other categories showed robust growth. However, on an aggregate, consumption has slowed.
Indeed, when the housing loan subsidiary is included, AUM growth has remained steady. Bajaj Finance’s infusion of capital into the subsidiary also shows that growth rates are expected to be high.
Even the reported stand-alone AUM growth is no small change when compared with low-double-digit growth by peers.
Also, one cannot fault investors from seeking refuge in a stock that gives them exposure to a proven business model, especially when other financiers lending to small businesses and real estate are not doing too well. More so, Bajaj Finance has delivered strong growth metrics consistently for several quarters now.
The lender has also managed to emerge unscathed from the liquidity crunch that still continues to haunt some non-banking financial companies. To be sure, it got nicked by the defaults of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd, but barely any pain was visible.
Bajaj Finance’s asset liability position is comfortable and nearly 13% of its borrowings are from retail deposits.
With more than 17% gain since January, the stock trades at a multiple of over five times its estimated book value for FY21, which according to analysts is rather rich."
68,2019-05-16,Bajaj Finserv,"Companies that will declare their March quarter results today include Hindalco Industries, Bank of India, Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj FinanceTata group stocks may be in focus in trade today

Indian markets may rebound on Thursday as Asian shares steadied on news that US President Donald Trump is planning to delay tariffs on auto imports, providing much needed relief to markets hit by a flare-up in trade tensions and on weak US and Chinese economic data.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, with both Australia and South Korea little changed. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.6%, with banks hurt by weak earnings.
On Wednesday, Wall Street shares extended their rebound, with the S&P 500 gaining 0.58% and the MSCI's broadest gauge of world stocks bouncing back from a two-month low hit on Tuesday.
The uptick came after three administration officials told Reuters on Wednesday that Trump is expected to delay a decision on tariffs on imported cars and parts by up to six months.
Also on Wednesday, less than a week after Washington slapped higher tariffs on $250 billion imports from China, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he will likely travel to Beijing soon to continue negotiations with Chinese counterparts.
Back home, companies that will declare their March quarter results today include Hindalco Industries, Bank of India, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance, JSW Energy and Shree Renuka Sugars.
Tata group stocks may be in focus in trade today. Tata Global Beverages Ltd is acquiring all the branded food businesses from Tata Chemicals Ltd in an all-stock transaction that is aimed at creating a consumer business company with revenues of  ₹9,099 crore.
As part of the deal, shareholders of Tata Chemicals will get 1.14 new shares of Tata Global for every share held, the company said in an exchange filing on Wednesday. The transaction values the consumer business of Tata Chemicals at around  ₹5,800 crore. Post the acquisition, Tata Chemicals will own a 31.5% stake in Tata Global Beverages.
Meanwhile, oil prices edged up on the prospect of mounting tensions in the Middle East hitting global supplies despite an unexpected build in US crude inventories. Brent crude rose 0.7% to $72.25 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fetched $62.45 a barrel, up 0.7%.
The United States pulled staff from its embassy in Baghdad on Wednesday out of apparent concern about perceived threats from Iran.
The sabotage of the tankers, for which no one has claimed responsibility, and Saudi Arabia's announcement on Tuesday that armed drones hit two of its oil pumping stations have raised concerns Washington and Tehran may be inching toward conflict.

At day’s highs, Bajaj Finserv shares soared 5% to  ₹8,021 while Bajaj Finance surged 6% to  ₹3,298 amid a spurt in volumes in both the counters. Bajaj Finance on Thursday reported a 50% jump in standalone net profit to  ₹1,114 crore for March 2019 quarter. The company had registered a net profit of  ₹743 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago. Its total income during the quarter rose to  ₹4,887.76 crore from  ₹3,424.99 crore in the year-ago period. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) and net NPAs stood at 1.54% and 0.63%, respectively, at the end of March 2019.
Bajaj Finserv reported a consolidated net profit of  ₹839 crore in March quarter vs  ₹637 crore last year. March quarter consolidated total revenue from operations rose to  ₹12,994 crore in Q4 as against  ₹9,055 crore in the year-earlier period.
JM Financial said in a report said that despite broader sector headwinds, Bajaj Finance reported strong growth across different fronts: new customers, AUM growth and margin expansion. Asset quality trends also remained stable, it said. ""Bajaj Finance remains well positioned to deliver earnings CAGR of 36% over FY19-21E driven by a) strong customer acquisition engine, b) expanding rural footprint with a diversified product offering, c) scale-up of the housing finance subsidiary (targeting an 8-9% market share from the current 1.5%), d) robust fee income generation and e) superior asset quality,"" added JM Financial, which has a buy rating on Bajaj Finserv with a target price of  ₹3,600.
However, some analysts warn about the headwinds from a broader consumption slowdown. “The risks of an eventual consumer cycle are completely ignored by the Street even as Bajaj is actively working on minimizing the impact of the same,"" says a report from Kotak Institutional Equities, which has a “sell"" rating on the stock.
“The current valuations do not reflect any risk of cyclicality in its business, nor slowdown in growth. We continue to find valuations expensive and will await better entry points,"" it added."

Mumbai: The predicted victory of National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Lok Sabha elections drove stocks of 40 companies to record highs on Monday. This included blue-chips, mid-caps, small-caps and penny stocks.
Some of the blue-chip stocks that hit all-time highs were Bajaj Finance Ltd (up 3.2%), DCB Bank Ltd, Federal Bank Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd (both 3%), ICICI Bank Ltd (4.5%), Titan Co. Ltd (3.4%) and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd (2.8%).
Among large-caps, Adani Enterprises Ltd jumped 27%, with the forecast of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s win and the re-election of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
Morrison’s re-election is seen as a positive for the Adani group’s mining operations in Australia, as he is widely expected to ease restrictions on its mega coal mines in Queensland, facing protests over concerns of environmental impact.
“Adani group shares rallied on exit polls’ prediction that Narendra Modi-led BJP would come back to power. The rally was further fuelled by Australian poll results, which too augurs well for the business interests of Adani group,"" an analyst said on condition of anonymity. “We expect the positive momentum to continue in the coming trading session in view of the positive political development.""
Other Adani group stocks rose as well: Adani Green Energy was up 14.97%, Adani Gas Ltd gained 12.54%, Adani Power Ltd advanced by 15.27%, Adani Transmission Ltd by 8.98% and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd by 9.10%.

“If we have the BJP-led coalition coming back to power on 23 May, then expect broader participation in the mid- and small cap space as they are the most beaten down in the last 18 months,"" said Rusmik Oza, head of fundamental research at Kotak Securities Ltd."
60,2019-05-22,Bajaj Finserv,"Bajaj Finance has cracked the code in consumer lendingIts cost of funds is higher than banks but it has superior margins

Mumbai: Investors are singing the vintage 1980s ad jingle ‘Hamara Bajaj’ for Bajaj Finance stock. That ad jingle had put its parent on the road to growth.
What else can explain the consumer lender’s market capitalization crossing  ₹2 trillion on Tuesday with the stock touching its 52-week high? This is despite concerns over valuations expressed by analysts.
At this milestone, the lender looks precious to investors than banks. As of Tuesday, only four banks boast of market cap that exceeds that of Bajaj Finance. These are State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank.
Why are investors so in love with the stock?
For one, Bajaj Finance has cracked the code in consumer lending and Indians can’t seem to say no to its interest-free equated monthly instalments (EMI).
As this column had pointed out earlier, Bajaj Finance has continued to report roughly 50% growth in its asset under management consistently for many quarters. Even though it gives unsecured loans to a large extent, its asset quality metrics are enviable. In short, it knows how to price risk.
Many banks are late to this market, having preferred to give loans to corporates which are margin friendly. Banks have also failed to price risk appropriately. The consumer lender has already made a strong mark in financing discretionary purchases.
Another reason why public sector banks look poor in front of Bajaj Finance is their balance sheet. They have unsustainable levels of toxic assets and some of them have been loss making entities for two years in a row.
But the key difference between a bank and a non-bank financier is the deposit franchise. Bajaj Finance’s cost of funds is of course higher than banks but it has superior margins.
And to investors delight, it has shown that it can escape the liquidity crunch most other non-bank finance companies are facing. Indeed, it could easily borrow from the market even on worse days.
Bajaj Finance now trades at a rich multiple of 5.6 times its estimated book value for FY21. Even though a consumption slowdown is underway in the economy, analysts are in no hurry to re-rate the stock. The dream of non-bank lenders in India is to become a mainstream bank and get a piece of the low-cost deposit pie especially now since most of them have been ravaged by rising cost of borrowing. Even Bajaj Finance aspires to become a bank someday.
But for now, it is no less than a bank for the market and perhaps some banks want to be Bajaj Finance."

57,2019-06-21,Bajaj Finserv,"Bajaj Finance shares are up over 35% this yearThe company has done a good job of diversifying their business beyond housing finance, unlike other NBFCs: Analyst

Bajaj Finance Ltd. has been one of the top stock performers in India this year, defying drops in peers amid a crisis of bad loans and defaults that has hobbled India’s non-bank financial companies. The shadow bank’s shares have surged 25% while some rivals have plunged as much as 89% since August 2018. That was the month IL&FS Financial Services missed a payment on short-term borrowings, triggering a cash crunch and a crisis of confidence in its fellow lenders.
Bajaj Finance’s stock gains have accelerated more recently, with its 36% advance so far this year topping the benchmark Sensex index. The company has been helped by its strategy of diversifying into lending to the consumer durables sector as well as rural and medium-sized businesses. This has limited the company’s exposure to housing finance loans, and kept its bad loan ratio at 1.5% versus 8.8% at Shriram Transport Finance Co. and 9.7% at Mahindra Rural Housing Finance Ltd.
“They have done a good job of diversifying their business beyond housing finance, unlike other NBFCs,"" said Deepak Kumar, an analyst at Narnolia Securities Ltd. “Also, their asset-light operating model by working with dealers has helped the company bring down its operating expenses.""
The NBFC crisis began due to an asset-liability mismatch, which transformed into a problem of mistrust after IL&FS was downgraded from its former triple A rating. Bond buyers shunned non-banking lenders with large exposure to housing finance loans leading to a credit crunch.
“Well-run NBFCs with parentage and vintage never saw a funding crunch,"" Subramanian Iyer, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a video address. “They grew their borrowing, at a higher cost though. The funding market has been clearly demarcating them from the rest."""
58,2019-06-24,Bajaj Finserv,"Learn the differences between short-term and long-term personal loans to make an informed decision.

Personal loans constituted 96 % of new bank loans taken in FY 2018, according to RBI data. This staggering figure can be attributed to the fact that personal loans can be availed within an hour and have an easy eligibility criteria. When it comes to using them to your advantage, keep in mind that personal loans come in all forms. For example you get short-term loans that have tenures ranging from a few months to a couple of years, and long-term loans that have tenure of three years or more.
In terms of the loan tenure, both short- and long-term personal loans come with their own set of benefits. While long-term personal loans help build your credit score and ensure your EMIs are affordable; taking a short-term personal loan means that you will need to pay less in terms of overall interest.
Here are a few pointers to keep in mind while choosing the right personal loan for your needs.
Short-term personal loans do not require collateral
Short-term loans pose less of a threat to lenders in terms of repayment. As such, your lender may ask you to pledge security to obtain a loan for a lengthy tenure but not for short tenure. The security may take the form of gold, an investment or any other valuable asset. Nevertheless, you can get collateral-free financing for tenure of up to five years when you opt for the Bajaj Finserv Personal Loan.
Long-term personal loans help meet important financial commitments
You can use a long-term goal to fund your child’s overseas education programme, take care of a medical expense or finance a wedding, with ease. You can also use this loan to fund your dream vacation, or to renovate your home and update it with the latest conveniences and décor.
Short-term personal loans can give you a better interest rate
Lenders evaluate your financial profile before offering loans. Since the status of your finances is not expected to change in the imminent future, you tend to get lower personal loan interest rates on short-term loans.
Long-term personal loans help you reduce your EMI amounts
Long tenures help you space out your instalments over a greater number of months, thereby reducing the value of each one individually. You can split up large and small personal loans alike, over many years, and bring down the monthly cost of your loan. Use an EMI calculator to compute your instalments and remember to choose the shortest tenure you can manage. As this ensures you do not pay extra interest in the long run.
Short-term personal loans get disbursed more quickly
Lenders normally examine your credit score, monthly income and debt-to-income ratio before approving your loan application. While these terms may be same for both short and long-term personal loans, short-term loans are often approved and disbursed quickly. However, the advantage of using Bajaj Finserv is that you get both short-and long-term loans approved speedily and disbursed within 24 hours.
Long-term personal loans are better for your credit score
Your credit score is built over time. By repaying a loan over a lengthy tenure you show diligence, financial discipline, and good money management. Since 30% of your score evaluates your credit history and 25% judges the type and duration of credit you have borrowed; a long-term loan can boost your score.
Short-term personal loans are more accessible
You can get a short-term personal loan that ranges up to INR 2 lakh with a tenure spanning from 1 day to 3 years, easily online. Bajaj Finserv gives you access to both short and long-term personal loans up to INR 25 lakh through its personal loan app.
Selecting the right lender is the first step towards finding the perfect match for your financial needs. For example, with Bajaj Finserv you get a flexible 12 to 60-month tenure that allows you to get both short and long-term loans at one place. Further, this lender offers you small personal loans up to INR 10 lakh, and large loan amounts up to INR 25 lakh, sans collateral as well.
To get a personal loan that’s tailored to your current finances, all you need to do is check your pre-approved offer from Bajaj Finserv. Doing so gives you instant approval through a customised deal and is a convenient way to get funds."
56,2019-07-08,Bajaj Finserv,"TCS and Infosys will announce their results this weekTax on buyback of shares from companies and move to raise public float have hurt market sentiment: Analysts

Indian markets fell sharply today, extending losses to the second day. At day’s low, the Sensex fell over 900 points and breached the 39,000 mark, extending its two-day loss to over 1,300 points. The Nifty slumped below 11,600. On Friday, both the Sensex and Nifty fell nearly 1% after some Budget proposals spooked market sentiments. Global cues were also weak today after strong US jobs data tempered expectations for a Fed rate cut. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost more than 1%, with every market in the red.
Among the Sensex stocks, Bajaj Finance was the biggest loser, falling nearly 9%. NTPC, L&T, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki and ONGC fell between 4% and 6%.
Here are 5 things to know about market fall today:
1) In Budget 2019, “tax on buyback of shares from companies and move to raise public float to 35% are fresh surprises and that would lead to some more adjustment of prices on the down side,"" says Ashish Nanda, EVP at Kotak Securities.
2) Rajiv Singh, CEO of stock broking at Karvy Broking, said many companies would need to increase their public shareholding, mostly by selling of promoters' stakes or additional equity issuance. ""The detail to watch out for is the time allowed to meet this new rule,"" Singh added.
3) Though many analysts have welcomed the Budget proposals, they say there’s no big fiscal stimulus plan, quite contrary to what many investors had expected.
4) A higher income tax levy on high net individuals has also hurt sentiments further, say some analysts. Amar Ambani, president and research head at Yes Securities, said: “Union Budget FY20 was well detailed and in the right direction in terms of focus of this government. However, higher tax on high net-worth individuals reduces their investible surplus in stocks directly, through MFs and PMSes, especially in the midcap space."" The BSE midcap index fell 2% today.
5) Analysts say that after the initial overhang of the Union Budget, focus would shift to the earnings season. IT heavyweights TCS and Infosys will announce their results on July 9 and July 12, respectively. On the macroeconomic front, IIP and CPI inflation will be unveiled on July 12. Besides, progress of monsoon and global developments will also be on participants’ radar.
Nifty has support at 1,500 levels and in case of any rebound, 11,900-12,000 zone would act as hurdle, says Religare’s Mishra, who advises stock- specific trading approach."
53,2019-07-09,Bajaj Finserv,"A number of firms are calling out the impact of demand slowdown on businessThe fact that consumption is benign has triggered a correction in consumer stocks

MUMBAI :
How deep is the consumption slowdown?
Everyone in the market has the same question, but not many have the answer.
However, there are visible signs and put together, they show that Indians have no plan to ratchet up their consumption like they used to.
Discretionary spending is being axed and the ripple effects are visible in the equity markets now.
Titan Co. Ltd’s shares ended a massive 12% down on Tuesday. The company said it witnessed a tough macroeconomic environment in the June quarter with consumption being hit due to rising gold prices.
Bajaj Finance Ltd, a key lender to consumers for discretionary spending, fell as much as 8% on Monday, although it has since then recovered about three-fifths of those losses.
Sanjiv Bajaj, who steers this successful consumer lending business, believes when cricket-obsessed Indians refrain from buying a television set to watch the World Cup, it is time to worry more.
In an interview with CNBC- TV18 on Monday, Bajaj said that the slowdown is dramatic.
The lender’s business model is wrapped around hooking Indians to spend more, one equated monthly instalment to another. Even though Bajaj expressed worry that his firm is not seeing the growth rates it used to, the company reported an impressive 41% growth in assets under management (AUM) for the first quarter.
While investors were initially troubled by the “dramatic slowdown"" comment, they seem to have later concluded that Bajaj Finance has had a good track record of bucking the trend, something its AUM growth in the June quarter also suggests.
Titan, on the other hand, has more pain. Gold prices have surged and the government announced a 2.5% hike in customs duty on gold and precious metals in the budget. Ergo, a slew of broking houses such as HSBC Securities Capital Markets (India) Pvt. Ltd and Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd have downgraded the stock, citing stretched valuations amid slowing growth.
According to Credit Suisse, Titan’s price-to-earnings multiple has no room to further rerate. Domestic broking house Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd has lowered its earnings per share estimates by 2.7%/1.8% for FY20/FY21.
Indeed, it would be unfair to pin the entire weakness in consumption stocks to just the slowdown.
“Discretionary stocks show more volatility than those of consumer staples. Therefore, part of the fall could also be because of stretched valuations,"" said Nitin Gupta, an analyst at SBICAP Securities Ltd.
Nevertheless, the fact that consumption is benign has triggered a long overdue correction in stocks. “Also, the increase in income tax for high-income individuals would impact consumption demand for high ticket discretionary items. So, if the June quarter earnings from other big companies in this space are below estimates, then the expected earnings recovery will get pushed further,"" said an analyst with a global brokerage firm on condition of anonymity.
To be sure, discretionary buying is the first casualty during a widespread economic slowdown. But even toothpaste makers are feeling the hit, along with home gadget makers.
Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) in its June quarter pre-result update said that it witnessed relatively softer demand across some of its geographies of operations during the quarter. “In India, demand continued to be challenging, impacted by a general consumption slowdown,"" it said in a press release on 3 July. The company said that it has recorded volume growth of close to mid-single digits during the quarter.
Analysts expect an extended summer to impact GCPL’s household insecticide sales in India, whereas the soaps category is likely to be subdued owing to an unfavourable base and demand slowdown in rural areas. Analysts are estimating volume growth of 4-5% and value growth of 2-3% in the India business for GCPL.
So, the slowdown is real but is it, as Bajaj says, dramatic?
Abheek Barua, chief economist and executive vice president at HDFC Bank Ltd, believes that the slowdown is on anticipated lines. “One of the indicators that I have found very useful is the growth of regional FMCG brands rather than large national ones. You tend to move down to lower price category in items like toothpaste or other staples during a broad-based slowdown. There is the substitution effect and performance of some regional brands suggest that their growth was higher than normal in the March quarter,"" he said.
The next key question is how long will the slowdown stretch.
The answer would be visible if one monitors the rural markets. The delay in the onset of the monsoon has already impacted the outlook on incomes in rural markets. Already facing a tightening of the purse strings, farmers are even more wary of spending now.
With the Union budget giving no immediate fillip to consumption, all eyes are now on the monetary policy to push consumption demand. Even so, it is likely that it could get worse before it gets better and most analysts are foreseeing a delay in consumption revival.
“The consumption slowdown may have bottomed out due to passing of uncertainties of elections, but is unlikely to fly much higher. There is a lot of expectation that stimulus provided to farmers (in the interim budget) will translate into better rural demand. However, these amounts could be first used to repay debts and even if they start spending immediately, it would be for low-value basic items and not high-value items,"" said Indranil Pan, chief economist at IDFC First Bank Ltd."
54,2019-07-09,Bajaj Finserv,"With high interest rates and safety of investment capital, fixed deposit options are becoming highly popular.

Amongst the many investment options available in the country, fixed deposits are often overshadowed by other growth-oriented avenues. However, with interest rates up to 8.95% and high safety of investment capital, options like Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit are becoming more and more popular.
There’s no doubt that this simple, yet effective investment instrument has become the key to guaranteed high returns. Here’s why you need to invest in a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit now.
Announcements made during Union Budget 2019
Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, presented the first budget for the Government’s second term on July 5, 2019. Apart from tax deductions to those buying affordable homes and electric cars, she also announced that those earning a taxable income of up to INR 5 lakh will get a complete tax rebate.
Additionally, the budget also emphasised on the importance of higher contribution from those who earn more. As a result, those earning INR 2¬¬–5 crore have to pay 3% higher surcharge, while those earning more than INR 5 crore have to pay 7% more as surcharge.
To counter the increase in out-go, you can invest in a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit, to increase your wealth over time.
Lower rate of interest on small savings schemes
For the July-September quarter, the RBI has lowered the interest rates offered by popular savings schemes such as PPF and NSC. While both these instruments will yield 7.9% interest instead of 8%, Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana will yield 8.4% interest instead of 8.5%. Similarly, an investment in the Senior Citizens Saving Scheme will yield 8.6% interest as opposed to 8.7%. In such a scenario, it makes sense to invest in an FD that offers a higher rate of interest.
Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit offers an interest rate of 8.6% for new customers, while senior citizens get 8.95% interest. Moreover, on FD renewal, you can get an additional 0.10% interest.
Constantly declining repo rate
In 2019, the RBI lowered the repo rate thrice, by a total of 75 basis points. Furthermore, experts are of the opinion that a rate cut is likely in the future as well as the nation’s monetary policy has transitioned from being neutral to being accommodative.
Are you wondering how this will impact your investments?
For starters, when the repo rate drops, financial institutions can borrow more affordably from the RBI, and loans become more inexpensive. However, financial institutions aren’t as reliant on deposits any longer, and hence the interest rate offered on deposits, falls. Before the repo rate is lowered further, it makes sense to lock in on the high interest rates offered by Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit right now.
Graded exit load on early mutual fund exits
Investors typically use liquid funds to park money for a short duration, as this instrument allows you to withdraw the amount as and when you need to. However, recently the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), has introduced a graded exit load on early exists from liquid mutual fund schemes.
This cost takes away from the very purpose of a liquid mutual fund and so, it makes sense to opt for instruments such as overnight funds, or better yet, fixed deposits, as they often offer a better rate of return.
While fixed deposits aren’t very liquid either, issuers such as Bajaj Finance allow you to take a loan against your FD if the need arises. Moreover, you can invest for a tenor of 12 to 60 months as per your goals and liquidity needs. Apart from laddering FDs, you can opt for regular payouts to meet monthly, quarterly, bi-annual and annual liquidity requirements.
Incentivising NRI investor participation
To encourage greater NRI investments in Indian markets, the government has decided to combine the NRI Portfolio Investment Scheme Route with the Foreign Portfolio Investment Route.
The goal here is to ultimately make it easier for NRIs to invest in Indian equities. While you await this change, you can add a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit for NRIs to your portfolio in right away, to earn returns of up to 8.95% by investing as little as INR 25,000.
These economic conditions and policy changes are reasons enough to invest in a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit right away. You can start investing with just INR 25,000 and make your investments grow with a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit. You can also benefit from other features like multi-deposit facility, auto-renewals, FD with debit card and a hassle-free online paperless process.

55,2019-07-09,Bajaj Finserv,"Sanjiv Bajaj, managing director of Bajaj Finserve thinks the slowdown is 'dramatic'The fact that consumption stocks haven’t seen great days, shows that Indians have begun postponing their purchases

How deep is the consumption slowdown? While everybody in the market has been asking the question, not many have an answer. Sanjiv Bajaj, managing director of Bajaj Finserve that has a thriving business of consumer loans under Bajaj Finance, thinks the slowdown is “dramatic"".
Bajaj, in a CNBC-TV18 interview on Monday, said the company had seen lower growth in the first quarter of FY19. The 8% drop in Bajaj Finance stock on Monday should give some hint as to how this fear has gripped the market.
The fact that consumption stocks haven’t seen great days and revenue growth looks benign, for everyone from toothpaste makers to home appliance builders, shows that Indians have begun postponing their purchases.
Bajaj Finance’s business model is wrapped around hooking Indians to consume, one equated monthly instalment (EMI) after another.
Bajaj finds unusual that television sales are lower even as a mega event like cricket World Cup series is on. Indians can never get enough of cricket and how much of this drop in television numbers is due to shift to streaming services is unclear.
HDFC Bank, another lender with more than half of its loan portfolio consisting of retail loans saw its growth drop to multi-quarter lows in April-June period, the lender said in a pre-earnings release on Monday.
The upshot is that the consumption slowdown is real and in Bajaj’s words dramatic.
As our column pointed out last week, the commentary from consumer staples companies is not encouraging.
With the Union Budget giving no immediate fillip to consumption, all eyes are now on monetary policy to push consumption demand. Even so, it is likely that it could get worse before it gets better and most analysts are foreseeing a delay in consumption revival."
52,2019-07-15,Bajaj Finserv,"Here is a checklist of seven things to ensure high FD interest rates.

When you invest in a FD, you earn returns at a fixed interest rate through the tenor. Usually, fixed deposit rates on company deposits are higher than those you can obtain at a bank. For example, you can earn interest at a rate as high as 8.95% when you invest in a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit. Even after the recent repo rate cuts, this FD is offering one of the highest interest rates.
While you may think that marginal differences in FD rates do not amount to much, results obtained through an FD calculator indicate otherwise. To help you make a smart FD investment, here are 7 things to know about high FD interest rates.
Company FDs normally offer you better rates than bank FDs
You can open an FD with a bank or a non-banking financial institution. While bank fixed deposit schemes may be the more familiar option, they aren’t the best when it comes to getting high interest rates. Company fixed deposit schemes can outmatch bank FDs in this regard.
To illustrate, consider that FD interest rates at banks run up to around 6.5% to 7%. At most, you may get a rate of 8% to 8.25% on a bank FD. However, rates on a Bajaj Finance FD, a company deposit, start at 8% and run up to 8.95%.
Even a 0.5% rate difference can impact your returns greatly
At first, you may not make much of the marginal differences in FD interest rates. For example, you may obtain a rate of 8.10% on a certain FD and an interest rate of 8.60% on Bajaj Finance FD taken for 3 years with interest payouts at maturity. The 0.5% rate difference impacts your returns substantially, especially in the long run.
Consider that you start with a principal of INR 5 lakh and opt for a tenor of 5 years. An FD that offers a rate of 8.10% transforms your principal into INR 7, 38, 071. However, the FD that yields interest at an 8.60% rate gives comparatively better returns. Here, you get INR 7, 55, 299 at maturity.
Higher rates let you meet your financial goals like a retirement fund more effectively
Whether you need to finance you child’s overseas education or build a large retirement corpus, high interest rates help you tackle your financial goals more easily. When you invest in FDs for longer timeframes, say 20 years, higher FD interest rates provide you with additional finances and help you cater to urgent and unforeseen needs as well.
FD interest rates depend on tenor and payout frequency
To fetch the highest fixed deposit rates your issuer has on offer, choose your FD parameters wisely. Generally, FD interest rates peak when the tenor reaches 3 years. For example, as a new customer, interest rates on a Bajaj Finance FD start at 8%.
However, this rate rises to 8.60% when you invest for a tenor of at least 3 years and take back your proceeds at maturity. While you have the option to earn frequently through regular interest payouts, this comes at a cost. The interest rate drops as your payout frequency increases.
Higher FD interest rates for senior citizens and existing customers
By investing in a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit, existing customers and senior citizens benefit from higher FD interest rates. The interest rate hikes are 0.25% and 0.35% for both customer profiles, respectively. By accounting for this hike, the FD interest rates for senior citizens goes up to 8.95%, which is one of the highest interest rates in the country.
0.10% more interest on renewing FD
Investing with a Bajaj Finance FD also helps you develop good investment habits with greater financial discipline. Here, you get a 0.10% interest rate boost when you renew your FD. In the long run, this incremental rate increase can provide you with a higher payout that you may consider a surplus. Use it to add a bit of luxury to your lifestyle or to cater to short-term financial setbacks.
High interest rates are more valuable when coupled with low risk

51,2019-07-25,Bajaj Finserv,"Shares of IndiGo are likely to be in focus todayTata Motors, Bajaj Finance, Bank of Baroda, Ambuja Cements are expected to announce June quarter earnings

Indian equity investors are likely to be on the sidelines on Thursday in the absence of any major trigger amid widespread pessimism. Asian shares were cautious on Thursday, shrugging off a tech-fuelled rally on Wall Street, while the euro hovered near two-month lows as soft economic data bolstered expectations of rate cuts in Europe.
Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.5% to nearly three-month high while Australia’s benchmark index hit a new 12-year top on Wednesday. South Korea’s KOSPI was the only index in the red as leading chipmakers shed recent gains amid trade tensions between Seoul and Tokyo. That left the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan broadly unchanged.
On Wall Street, tech companies led the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to record highs on Wednesday after Texas Instruments Inc hinted the slowdown in semiconductor demand would not be as long as feared.
Stock investors have generally been encouraged in recent days by hopes of some headway in trade negotiations between the United States and China, and expectations the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy soon.
Cementing such expectations, a series of purchasing manager index (PMI) readings in the US and Europe on Wednesday were weaker than expected.
Back home, shares of IndiGo are likely to be in focus as Rahul Bhatia, one of the two founders of InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, will not accept a dilution of his shareholder rights unless there is a compelling offer from his estranged partner Rakesh Gangwal, according to a Mint Report.
Credit rating agency Icra Ltd on Wednesday downgraded ratings on Yes Bank’s  ₹32,911.7 crore bond programme, citing an increase in stressed assets and lack of debt resolutions. The rating on bonds aggregating  ₹22,111.7 crore were downgraded by one notch, while that on  ₹10,800 crore of additional tier I (AT-I) bonds were downgraded by two notches.
Major companies which are expected to announce June quarter earnings on Thursday are Tata Motors, Bajaj Finance, Bank of Baroda, Ambuja Cements, Biocon, Bajaj Finserv, Tata Coffee, AU Small Finance Bank and South Indian Bank.
Market attention on Thursday will be squarely on the ECB rate decision after PMI data showed euro zone manufacturing contracted for the sixth straight month. That dragged the single currency to $1.1125, a level not seen since late-May. It was last at $1.1136.
In the US, manufacturing activity slowed to a 10-year low in early July with production volumes and purchases falling.
The dollar index, tracking the greenback against six major currencies, nudged lower to 97.683. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was a touch higher at 108.20.
The weak global backdrop saw bond prices racing with US 10-year yields off 3.3 basis points at 2.05%.
Sterling was last traded at $1.2484, after it fell for several sessions as market participants feared the looming possibility of a no-deal Brexit under Britain’s new prime minister, Boris Johnson.
In commodities, US crude added 12 cents to $56 per barrel while Brent crude climbed 4 cents to $63.20. Spot gold slipped a tad to $1,424.62 an ounce, just short of last week’s peak of $1,452.60.

50,2019-07-25,Bajaj Finserv,"Gross NPA, a measure of asset quality, rose slightly as compared to the March quarterAssets under management increased 41% year on year

NEW DELHI :
Bajaj Finance today posted a 43% increase in net profit for the June quarter, driven by a jump in assets under management. Shares were volatile after the results were announced and traded 4% lower in afternoon trade. Bajaj Finance Q1 profit increased to  ₹1,195 crore as compared to  ₹836 crore in the year-earlier period. Assets under management rose 41% to  ₹128,898 crore against  ₹91,287 crore in the same quarter of the previous quarter.
New loans booked during Q1 FY20 increased by 29% to 7.27 million from 5.63 million. Gross NPA and net NPA, measures of asset quality, increased marginally quarter on quarter.
Other highlights from Bajaj Finance's Q1 results: 
Net Interest Income for Q1 FY20 was up by 43% to  ₹3,695 crore from  ₹2,579 crore in 01 FY19.
Total operating expenses to net interest income for Q1 FY20 was 34.98% against 37.02% in 01 FY19.
Gross NPA and net NPA as of 30 June 2019 stood at 1.60% and 0.64% respectively of total advances, as against 1.54% and 0.63% as of 31 March 2019.
The provisioning coverage ratio as of 30 June 2019 was 61%
Capital adequacy ratio (including Tier-11 capital) as of 30 June 2019 stood at 19.48%. The Tier-1 capital stood at 15.48%"
49,2019-07-25,Bajaj Finserv,"Bajaj Finance’s assets under management grew by 41% on a consolidated basis, similar to previous quartersThe percentage of loans having non-payment beyond 30 days has risen to 5.30% as of June end, from 4.65% in March, for two-wheeler loans

If the economic slowdown has made Indians think twice before buying a car or upgrading their gadgets, it is obvious they would also hesitate to finance their desires through loans.
The first signs of consumption slowdown were already visible a few quarters before. Now with Bajaj Finance’s apparent caution on loans, it has become amply clear that consumption demand remains weak.
Bajaj Finance’s business model revolves around giving individuals loans to finance their consumption through the most convenient method of equated monthly installments (EMI). In the June quarter, the consumer lender booked 29% more new loans than it did a year ago. This is half the growth rate the company reported in the previous quarters. Bajaj Finance said that as a prudent measure, it has tightened underwriting standards for loans to finance two-wheeler and three-wheeler purchases.
The sharp drop in auto sales has indeed made the lender worried enough to check for credit quality. Also, if a small businessman involved in the auto supply chain is hit, it is unsafe if he or she leverages more through borrowings. Bajaj Finance doesn’t want to be part of such unhealthy leverage. “As a measure of prudence, we have tightened underwriting standards in digital product financing in urban and rural business leading to approximately 15-18% cut in new disbursements,"" the lender said in its presentation.
The hit on disbursements would be 10-12% in the case of auto loans due to the tightening.
Investors no wonder got spooked because this means that the consumer lender may not report the high double digit loan growth it has been so far. For the June quarter, its assets under management grew by 41% on a consolidated basis, similar to previous quarters. Ergo, the over 4% fall in its stock on Thursday can be explained from the fact that growth has slowed, albeit by design.
Since these are not normal times in terms of growth, the signs of emerging stress also worried investors. After all, pristine asset quality is what makes consumer lender Bajaj Finance precious than its peers. As the adjoining chart shows, the percentage of 30-day overdue loans has risen for most products on a sequential basis.
To be sure, the ratios are lower than a year ago for some segments, which indicates that asset quality is not in danger. That said, any increase in slippages in the current environment should raise concern.
Despite dropping 12% over the past two months, the stock trades at a multiple of 5.6 times its estimate book value for FY20, which is fairly expensive in the above backdrop."

Tata Motors was the biggest loser in the Sensex pack, cracking 4.56%, ahead of its quarterly results. Bajaj Finance, RIL, Yes Bank, NTPC and Tata Steel were among other top losers. 
On the other hand, gains in Vedanta, Sun Pharma, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, PowerGrid, TCS, Tech Mahindra and Infosys helped support the index. 
Elsewhere in Asia, most bourses ended on a positive note on hopes of a resolution to the US-Chine trade tiff as US and Chinese officials prepared to restart negotiations in an effort to resolve the year-long trade dispute, with two days of talks due next week.
Shanghai Composite Index, Hang Seng and Nikkei ended higher, while Kospi settled in the red. Bourses in Europe were also trading on a mixed note in their early sessions.

Bajaj Finance Ltd shares declined in five out of sixth sessions, falling over 13% during this period. The stock on Friday slid 1.2% after the lender flagged early signs of stress in digital product segments and plans to prudently tighten credit norms in select segments as a pre-emptive measure.
Tata Motors Ltd fell for seven out of eight sessions with falling over 15% in this period. The stock fell 4% in opening trade after the company reported loss of  ₹3,680 crore in the three months ended 30 June, compared with a year-earlier loss of  ₹1,863 crore.

The Sensex fell over 600 points to close at 36,958 while Nifty settled at 10,925, down 1.6%, driven by sharp losses in auto and banking stocks. Barring energy, propped up by a surge in RIL shares, all other sectoral indices on the NSE ended in the red.

“Indian markets have been tagging along global markets in palpable risk-off sentiment due to multiple challenges of intensification of US-China trade war, sell-off in Argentina and Hong Kong markets.

Market participants are eagerly awaiting any pro-market measures by Indian government post their extensive consultations with various stakeholders over previous week, he added.

42,2019-08-15,Bajaj Finserv,"You can be financially independent in the true sense only when you are free from market risks. Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit gives you an opportunity to go risk-free by offering fixed returns on your investment.

As our country celebrates its 72nd Independence Day, let’s understand how freedom has evolved over the years. The freedom of speech, expression, religious, social or cultural norms is prerequisite, but the ability to live on your own terms and conditions comes essentially from financial freedom. Financial freedom enables you to be self-sufficient. The road to financial freedom is to earn enough to live on your own, pay for essentials and take control of your future. Your regular income may not always be enough to help you sustain yourself.
Making stable and mindful investments is hence an imperative aspect of financial freedom, which helps you grow your capital over time. However, swinging stock indices and changes in monetary policies have given sleepless nights to investors who seek stable growth of their capital. Thus, fixed-income investments are best suited for those seeking assured returns. Fixed deposit is one such preferred investment that can help you gain guaranteed returns.
Read on to know what makes FD the best investment avenue to ensure financial freedom.
1.	Guaranteed returns
You can be financially independent in the true sense only when you are free from market risks. Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit gives you an opportunity to go risk-free by offering fixed returns on your investment with no effect of market fluctuations.
Even as bank FD interest rates fluctuate with RBI’s policy announcements, Bajaj Finance FD rates are one of the highest in the market, even when the economic situation is volatile. Additionally, this FD has the highest stability ratings from CRISIL (FAAA/stable rating) and ICRA (MAAA/stable) rating.
2.	Higher earnings than bank FDs
When you compare the FD rates in 2019 from different lenders, Bajaj Finance FD stands out with its lucrative interest rate of 8.60%, which can go up to 8.85% for existing customers, and up to 8.95% for senior citizens.

As shown in the table below, you can achieve 51% growth of savings by investing in a 5-year Bajaj Finance FD.
3.	Freedom to choose
Independence means the freedom to choose, and this instrument gives you the flexibility to choose investment terms as per your requirements.
-	Flexible tenures: As per your financial needs and planning, you can choose a tenure between 12 and 60 months. Since financial independence has a lot to do with your liquidity and cash flow, flexibility in choosing tenure helps you ensure liquidity at all times.
-	Laddering: Flexible tenures make it easy for you to ladder your investments. You can avail the benefit of multi-deposit facility, wherein you can invest in up to five FDs with a single cheque. Also, a continuous stream of FDs will help you with steady inflow of money at intervals, thereby helping you with liquidity. This lets you efficiently plan for all major life events.
-	Interest payout frequency: You can choose to either receive the returns periodically or compounded at the end of the tenure depending on your needs. Interest payment mode can be set according to your preference-monthly, quarterly, yearly or at the time of maturity.
-	Investment mode: Bajaj Finance also offers you the option to start investing with options like debit card, cheque or simply book your FD online.
If you are looking to build a corpus and save for the future, say, for your child’s higher education/marriage, an international vacation or for retirement, you can go for a cumulative fixed deposit.
If you expect your investments to take care of your daily expenses, you can choose a non-cumulative deposit, which gives regular interest payouts. This is a great investment option for senior citizens and pensioners, who seek a regular income from their savings.
4.	Loan against FD facility
Financial exigencies come unannounced. An accident, hospitalization, unexpected business or material loss can threaten your stability. An instant online loan against FD will create a shield around you in times of crisis. You do not need to liquidate your savings.

41,2019-08-29,Bajaj Finserv,"To provide ease of investment, Bajaj Finance allows you to invest online and start an FD from the comfort of your home or workplace.

Investors seeking stable growth of their capital can invest in fixed deposit, to get guaranteed returns. However, the quantum of returns that you earn from an FD depends on its interest rate and the issuer. Thus, it is important to look for credible issuers who offer high interest rates. With Bajaj Finance, you can earn some of the highest Fixed Deposit interest rates in the country that accelerate your returns.
Opening a Fixed Deposit with Bajaj Finance is also simple. To provide ease of investment, Bajaj Finance allows you to invest online and start an FD from the comfort of your home or workplace.

Grow your principal by 51%
Based on your profile as an investor and the tenure you choose, Bajaj Finance offers different interest rates of up to 8.95%. These high FD interest rates yield returns of over 51% of your principal. Take a look at a few examples to understand your earning potential.
High stability ratings to safeguard your investment
Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposits carry the highest credit ratings of FAAA and MAAA by CRISIL and ICRA, respectively. This rating indicates the safety of your investment, which means you will get timely payouts at the promised interest rate. Further, Bajaj Finance is the only NBFC in India to enjoy an international rating of ‘-BBB’ by S&P Global. These high ratings indicate that FDs are a safe investment option, regardless of market volatilities or economic policy changes.
Flexible tenures to ladder your fixed deposits
Since the funds in your fixed deposit are locked in throughout the tenure, it is important to plan your investment beforehand. The best way to do this is to ladder your FDs over varying tenors and align them with your goals. This way, you will have the liquidity required to meet various goals from time to time. For this purpose, Bajaj Finance offers flexible tenures ranging from 12 to 60 months. To plan your finances better, ladder your FDs using the FD calculator.

You can opt for different parameters like investment, tenure, and interest payout frequency for each fixed deposit that you wish to open. This way, you can avoid the hassles of writing different cheques. What’s more, in case of an emergency, you can liquidate a single fixed deposit instead of breaking all your investments!
Online loan against FD to avail instant emergency funds
Emergencies come unannounced and can disrupt your finances. At such times, it is natural to think of breaking your fixed deposit to meet your requirements. However, doing this will take away your potential FD earnings. To help you safeguard your returns, Bajaj Finance offers an online loan against FD of up to INR 4 lakh. This way, you can access funds without breaking your investments, while still earning returns on the same.
Auto renewal option to reinvest seamlessly
Bajaj Finance also offers an auto renewal option that you can choose at the time of investing in your FD. Once you select this option, your FD will be automatically renewed on maturity.

Moreover, you can enjoy an additional interest rate of 0.10% on FD renewal, which adds to your returns!
Now, Bajaj Finance is also offering NRI Fixed Deposits, wherein NRIs can invest to grow their savings. You can consider investing in a Bajaj Finance FD to make your savings grow, with a simple online process. Book your FD today, and grow your corpus easily.

On Thursday, Bajaj Finance told stock exchanges that its board of directors will meet on 17 September to consider, “a proposal for raising of funds by way of qualified institutions placement, subject to such regulatory/statutory approvals as may be required, including approval of the shareholders of the company"".
QIP is a capital-raising tool through which listed companies can sell shares, fully and partly convertible debentures, or any securities other than warrants that are convertible into stocks, to a qualified institutional buyer.
The proposed share sale will help the non-bank lender shore up its balance sheet when consumer demand is showing signs of weakness and liquidity has been scarce for lenders.
For the quarter ended 30 June, Bajaj Finance’s assets under management grew by 41% to  ₹1.29 trillion.
“Gross NPA and Net NPA stood at 1.60% and 0.64%, respectively, on 30 June 2019. Adjusted for IL&FS exposure, GNPA and NNPA stood at 1.42% and 0.50%, respectively,"" the lender said in its recent exchange filings.
Bajaj Finance has also been exploring other routes to diversify its funding sources. “During the quarter, we established a secured Euro Medium Term Note (MTN) Programme for programme value of $1.50 billion on Singapore stock exchange. We intend to raise $750 million through ECB (external commercial borrowing), as allowed under automatic route, to diversify and strengthen our liability profile by March 2020,"" the lender said.
Till August, only five firms had tapped the markets to raise funds via QIP this year, raising a total of  ₹8,412.87 crore, while in 2018, 25 firms raised  ₹16,587 crore through this route, data from primary market tracker Primer Database shows."

38,2019-09-06,Bajaj Finserv,"For investors seeking a steady growth of savings during these volatile times, Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit fits the bill perfectly.

After a slew of repo rate cuts, issuers across the country have dropped deposit rates by a few points. That said, the appeal of fixed deposit hasn’t dulled, as it offers guaranteed returns – something that’s of immense value in an investment landscape that’s facing a stormy weather. Therefore, as an investor, your focus should be on locking in the current FD rates before another repo rate cut is announced.
For investors seeking a steady growth of savings during these volatile times, Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit fits the bill perfectly. Here are four reasons why you should consider investing in the Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit right now.
Get guaranteed returns in a time of economic turbulence
Whether it is 2018’s 1-year returns, the economic slowdown, global trade war or uncertainty permeating investor sentiment, the current market has made apparent the risks involved in investing. In such a scenario, the offer of assured returns is hard to beat. With Bajaj Finance, you can earn up to 8.35% if you are a regular customer and up to 8.70% in case you are a senior citizen. Your FD yields these returns when you opt for a tenure of at least 3 years and receive interest payouts at maturity only.
What makes this investment a safe bet is that it’s backed by high credibility ratings. It carries a rating of FAAA by CRISIL and MAAA by ICRA. Together, these ratings indicate a stable investment environment with timely payouts.
Moreover, since your returns are assured, you can forecast them accurately by using the FD calculator. Here, for instance, is what you can earn through the Bajaj Finance FD over 3 years as senior or regular investor.
Strengthen your portfolio against market-related risks
Making fixed deposits a part of your investment plan is a smart move, especially in a market wherein volatile instruments have an unsure trajectory. By offering guaranteed returns, fixed deposits balance out the risks posed by other instruments. So, in the event that some of them fail, and there have been instances of instruments earning negative returns, your portfolio will still yield returns thanks to stable FDs.
Keep this in mind when investing, as it will help you allocate appropriate amounts to FDs and other instruments.
Obtain fixed returns for a lengthy tenure
Fixed deposits offer certain advantages over saving schemes like PPF. For instance, you can lock in an attractive interest rate and earn it throughout the tenor. PPF rates, on the other hand, are revised every quarter. While the rate a while back was 8%, it now is 7.9%. Should there be further rate cuts, your investment will suffer. However, this is not the case with an FD. The rate applicable is constant throughout. This means that you can forecast your gains before investing. If you invest Rs. 5 lakh for 5 years right now, you can be sure of earning the following amounts as returns.
Invest in an instrument that offers value-added features
Another benefit of investing in a Bajaj Finance FD now is that you get to benefit from a wide range of features. For instance, you have the multi-deposit facility, which allows you to invest in several FDs with a single cheque. You can also opt for the auto-renewal facility that keeps your investment running post maturity and gives you an extra 0.10% interest rate boost. While this amount seems small, its impact is significant. Here’s how.
With generous returns, investment stability and attractive features on offer, the Bajaj Finance FD is a great asset to have in your portfolio. To invest without any delay, book a call with an executive by filling a short online form.

As a parent, it’s likely that your top priority is to secure your child’s future by making the necessary financial arrangements. After all, this gives you the flexibility to meet their every need, be it small or big.
Moreover, with education costs in India experiencing an annual inflation of around 10% to 12%, it may soon become difficult to comfortably pay for education expenses out of your pocket. Additionally, to nurture your child’s athletic or musical inclinations, you may wish to spend on equipment and training too. These are just two of the many reasons why financial planning for your child is a necessity, not a luxury.
Given the myriad costs that you’re likely to encounter, the best option is to invest when your child is young, so that you have the necessary finance to provide for every requirement. A particularly lucrative investment is the Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit, as it promises guaranteed returns as well as a high rate of interest. It also has excellent stability and credibility ratings from national as well as international rating agencies, making it a viable investment for even the most cautious investor.
To know how the Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit can help you financially secure your child’s future, read on.
Invest in a long-term FD for education expenses
As you may have noticed, education expenses rise every year. This cost further increases if you want your child to study overseas. So, to prepare for education expenses, it’s best to invest in a long-term FD that offers substantial returns owing to compounding interest. Assuming that you invest Rs.5 lakh for 5 years right now, take a look at the corpus you can accumulate for this purpose.
Take advantage of the multi-deposit facility to tackle yearly expenses with ease
The multi-deposit facility is a great way to invest in several FDs at once. Using just one cheque, you can invest in multiple FDs and have them mature at different tenors. This can give you the liquidity you need for yearly expenses, be it hobbies or extra-curricular activities. Further, laddering your investment eliminates the need to make a premature withdrawal, thereby preserving your returns.
Opt for the auto-renewal feature to build a sizeable amount
Using the Bajaj Finance auto-renewal feature is a great way to accumulate wealth for your child. You can opt in for it at the time of investment and upon maturity, your money will be automatically reinvested for a tenure of your choice. What’s more, you benefit from an extra 0.10% interest that increases your returns further. To understand the difference this can make to your returns, take a look at what happens to the aforementioned FDs when they are renewed.
Plan effectively using the FD calculator
Now that you’re aware of ways in which a Bajaj Finance FD helps your secure your child’s future, take the time to plan your investment. You can use the FD calculator to accurately compute your earnings before you invest. This way, you can stay one step ahead and ensure that you never fall short of money for your child’s needs.
In this manner, by using FDs, you can comfortably tackle costs that you will come across when raising your child. Further, if you have enough finance for all of your child’s current needs, consider investing in an FD nonetheless. Creating a security net for your children to fall back on ensures that they are able to follow their dreams without compromising or worrying about financial security.
If you wish to get started, all you have to is book an appointment by filling the online application form. An authorised representative will contact you so you can invest immediately.

Mumbai: Bajaj Finance Ltd on Tuesday surpassed state-run lender State Bank of India (SBI) in terms of market capitalisation for the first time, with shares of the former having surged over 50% so far this year. SBI has fallen 13% so far this year.
Bajaj Finance, which was trading at  ₹3,992.20 on the BSE, down 1.4% from previous close, has a market cap of  ₹2.32 trillion. SBI, which fell 6% to  ₹254.55 a share, has a market cap of  ₹2.28 trillion.
""With the upcoming festive season and several planned online and offline mega sales events ahead, we reiterate our theme around Bajaj Finance being in the best position to play the India consumption story,"" said Emkay Research in a 25 September note.
The brokerage firm has upgraded its earnings per share for fiscal year 2020-21 by 9-10%, factoring in the corporate tax cut. Emkay Research remained ‘overweight’ on the stock with a target price of  ₹4,550 a share.
Bajaj Finance has a total loan book of  ₹1.25 trillion, whereas SBI’s loan book stood at  ₹22.40 trillion.
Gross non-performing asset as percentage of advances of Bajaj Finance stood at 0.6% as of fiscal 2019 against 0.4% a year ago.
On 24 September, Morgan Stanley had downgraded the State Bank of India to ‘equal weight’ from ‘overweight’ amid asset quality and net interest uncertainty. It maintained the target price of the lender’s shares at  ₹330. According to Bloomberg data, SBI has 45 buys, four holds and one sell.
""We raise our F21 and F22 EPS estimates ~5% each, as the tax rate cut outweighs lower margins. We downgrade to EW; upside appears limited given uncertainty on asset quality (for SBI and the system) and NIMs. We prefer large private banks where we see better EPS progression and re-rating,"" Morgan Stanley report said.
Banking stocks fell sharply over the past few sessions following concerns over financial irregularities and surging bad loans. Fall in credit growth, recent default by Altico Capital, and issues with PMC Bank, Lakshmi Vilas Bank and DHFL dented investor sentiment."
29,2019-10-03,Bajaj Finserv,"In FY19, Bajaj Finance generated a net profit of  ₹3,995 crore, far higher than SBI’s  ₹862 croreInvestors were reminded this week that further stress on SBI’s book is imminent

Mumbai: Why do investors prize Bajaj Finance more than the country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) when the former is just a fraction of the size of the latter?
This week, the nimble consumer lender’s market capitalisation surpassed that of the banking giant. Note that SBI has a balance sheet size of  ₹22.4 trillion, about 14 times the size of Bajaj Finance’s book.
But what use is size, if it doesn’t result in greater profits? Investors love profits and a company that dishes profits every year with a promise of more will enjoy investor love.
In FY19, Bajaj Finance generated a net profit of  ₹3,995 crore, far higher than SBI’s  ₹862 crore. SBI suffered in that year simply because its bad loans ate up much of the profits. In the first quarter of FY20, the company reported a net profit of  ₹1,195 crore, while SBI’s was  ₹2,312 crore.
Besides, the fact remains that growth prospects at Bajaj Finance look better. The latter has less of a problem recovering loans. In the coming quarters, SBI will have to set aside more profits towards bad loans, something which Bajaj Finance needn’t do.
SBI’s book is dominated by corporate loans, which also means that in times of stress, the bank will face exponential increase in delinquencies compared with others simply because of the size of its exposures.
Investors were reminded this week that further stress on SBI’s book is imminent considering it has exposure to some troubled non-bank finance companies.
Bajaj Finance, on the other hand, is no troubled NBFC. It has a business model that rests on making individuals take equate monthly instalments to fund their desires and lifestyle purchases. Considering that India’s households are net savers with low leverage, the company stands to benefit from the sheer potential of growth in retail loans.
No wonder Bajaj Finance adds millions of new consumers to its business every year while SBI’s growth cannot match that of the consumer lender.
Analysts at Jeffries India Pvt Ltd said that Bajaj Finance could report 30% loan growth on a compounded annual growth basis for FY19-21 period. “Given its high pre-tax return on assets, we expect Bajaj Finance could see a 280-300 basis points return on equity boost (if it retains the gains), which supports a higher sustainable growth rate (without external capital) in the longer term,"" the firm said in a note.
SBI, on the other hand, faces higher provisioning and lower loan growth. But there is no denying that at a multiple of 7 times its estimated book value for FY21, Bajaj Finance valuations are stretched.
In contrast, SBI trades at a discount to its FY21 estimated book value. SBI may be a tired elephant but it is in no way giving up the race. With the bank consciously de-risking its balance sheet, valuations could see a relook."

India’s shadow banking crisis has sucked in more financial firms this week, eroding a stock market rally that’s been driven by a surprise $20 billion tax cut package. The S&P BSE Sensex Index posted its third day of losses on Tuesday, ending a surge since the Sept. 20 announcement of the tax cuts. Financial stocks, which account for 45% of the benchmark index, contributed the most to the declines since late last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Debt concerns at lenders including Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd. and a co-operative bank, and worries a cleanup in corporate debt could be prolonged, have spooked the financial markets. The sight of depositors lining up to pull their money from Punjab & Maharashtra Co-operative Bank Ltd., after the central bank put limits on lending, has also been unsettling.
The Reserve Bank of India on Friday tweeted the “banking system is safe and stable and there is no need to panic.""

Stay Selective
Negative news flow around lenders has “overshadowed the recent tax cut tailwind, bringing focus back on sector issues: liquidity issues and contagion risks,"" Jefferies Financial Group Inc. analysts including Bhaskar Basu wrote in a note on Tuesday.
Basu said he likes non-bank lenders with a strong liability base, low asset quality risks and good earnings visibility. He prefers stocks including Bajaj Finance Ltd. and Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd.

Renewed Concerns
There have been “renewed concerns"" around India’s banking system’s stability in the last week but the corporate tax cuts will help economic growth, UBS Group AG strategist Gautam Chhaochharia said in a television interview with Juliette Saly and Rishaad Salamat.
Chhaochharia’s June 2020 target for the NSE Nifty 50 index is 12,300 and he remains overweight on financial, property and oil & gas stocks.

28,2019-10-11,Bajaj Finserv,"The 25 richest families in the world now control almost $1.4 trillion in wealth, up 24% from last yearPallonji Mistry, chairman of Shapoorji Pallonji Group, owns much of Tata Sons and is worth $20.3 billion

Siblings Susanne Klatten and Stefan Quandt own almost half of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG.
The billionaires are descendants of Guenther Quandt, who built a German industrial empire by, among other things, supplying weapons to the Nazis during World War II. In the years since, the family has established stakes in both Daimler-Benz AG and BMW.
Today, Klatten is Germany’s second-richest person, worth $18.6 billion, with interests in chemicals and carbon production, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Quandt, who owns part of a logistics company and a homeopathic medicine company, has a net worth of $15.5 billion. Both are members of BMW’s supervisory board, making them the richest related pair deriving wealth from the automotive industry.
All told, the 25 richest families in the world now control almost $1.4 trillion in wealth, up 24% from last year. Our list of the 20 wealthiest people who have made fortunes in the automotive sector includes some household names: Tesla’s Elon Musk is worth $23.1 billion; Larry Ellison, with $58.5 billion in total wealth, owns a stake in Tesla that’s worth more than $730 million.
Others are less prominent but no less successful: Pallonji Mistry, chairman of Shapoorji Pallonji Group, owns much of Tata Sons and is worth $20.3 billion; Li Shu Fu, the chairman of Volvo and Geely, is worth $10.6 billion.
The Method
The methodology behind wealth analysis can be challenging. In fortunes backed by decades of accumulated assets and dividends, the true extent of an individual’s or family’s holdings is often obscured. Most in this tax bracket are not thrilled to have their names, assets, shares, and interests published by a global news organization. Automotive wealth also tends to be a family affair. While individual members of these dynasties may not make the list, a clan’s overall wealth may be vast. (See: the Ford, Porsche, and Pieech families.) So we followed the same criteria applied to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index.
In order to keep it (relatively) simple, we have omitted those whose wealth comes from oil. Take the House of Saud, for instance. The family is worth an estimated $100 billion, a figure based on the cumulative payouts the country’s royals have received over the past five decades from the executive office of the king. That number doesn’t even include the planned initial public offering of its crown jewel, oil giant Saudi Aramco. It will be offered with an anticipated valuation of $2 trillion.
Maybe we’ll come up with a special list for members of the House of Saud. In the meantime, here are the year’s richest people in cars.*

27,2019-10-14,Bajaj Finserv,"Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit ensures a secure financial future while providing higher interest rates, guaranteed returns and taking care of emergencies.

Since retirement marks the end of your working years, you may no longer have a regular source of income. Thus, planning your finances beforehand is important to maintain your desired standard of living. When investing as a senior citizen, minimising risk and earning guaranteed returns should be your main objective. Only then can you safeguard the wealth that you have accumulated throughout your career. While there are several investment options tailored for senior citizens, a fixed deposit remains a popular choice.
From the safety of investment to guaranteed returns, a fixed deposit is a safe haven for your retirement. This is why most investors approaching retirement or those who are retired invest in this low-risk option to safeguard their wealth. Take a closer look at what makes this instrument ideal for your needs as a senior citizen.
Fixed deposits offer higher interest rates to senior citizens
Typically, issuers of a fixed deposit offer a higher interest rate to senior citizens as compared to regular investors. For instance, Bajaj Finance, one of the reputable NBFCs in India, offers an additional interest of 0.35% on Fixed Deposit for senior citizens, which totals up to 8.70% for selected tenures. To understand how varied tenures will alter your returns, take a look at this calculation.
You can also opt for the auto-renewal facility at the time of applying for an FD. This way, your maturity proceeds will be reinvested. Thanks to this, your returns will multiply. On choosing the auto-renewal facility, Bajaj Finance offers an additional interest rate of 0.10% on the prevailing rates. Assuming that the fixed deposit tenures remain unchanged, here’s how much you can earn on your FDs.
Fixed deposits help in meeting recurring and non-recurring expenses alike
Besides meeting your daily expenses, as a retiree, you may have other non-recurring expenses and goals to achieve. For instance, you may want to gift a property to your children, host a wedding, throw a grand party, make a prepayment of your home loan and so on. To conveniently pay for each need, you can ladder your FDs over varying tenures and align them to different goals. This way you will always have funds at your disposal to tackle your needs on time.
With Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit for senior citizens, you can choose tenures ranging from 12 to 60 months. Besides, you can also choose from various regular payout options like monthly, quarterly, semi-annually and annually, as per your choice. To meet monthly expenses, you can invest in an FD and choose the monthly payout option, whereas to meet non-recurring expenses, you can invest in an FD payable at maturity.
Fixed deposits can be pledged as collateral to avail a loan in emergencies
Emergencies can show up anytime in your life. As a senior citizen, this may most often take the form of medical treatments. To aid you in such times, Bajaj Finance lets you pledge your FD as collateral and avail a loan against it. You can apply for this loan online and access a sanction of up to Rs.4 lakh almost instantly! This way, you can address your emergency without breaking your investment and keep earning interest on it until maturity.
Fixed deposits are not linked to the market and offer guaranteed returns
Unlike equities and most other investments, fixed deposits are not linked to the market. This means your interest rate will remain unchanged throughout the tenure and so your returns are assured. Besides, you can also determine your returns beforehand using the FD calculator and plan your finances accordingly.
Fixed deposits are easy to invest in and monitor
Unlike other investments, you can invest in a fixed deposit without any hassle. All you have to do is fill in and submit an application form and make the payment. With Bajaj Finance, you can also open an FD online from the comfort of your home. Alternatively, you can visit your nearest branch and invest using your debit card. If you wish to invest in several FDs at once, you can do so by opting for the multi-deposit facility. Here, you can invest in up to 5 FDs using a single cheque and still choose a different amount and tenure for each unique scheme.
Monitoring your FD is also as simple. In fact, as the FD interest remains unchanged throughout the tenure, you don’t really have to monitor the performance but keep an eye on its maturity. Some issuers like Bajaj Finance also offer auto-renewal facility. Thanks to this facility your maturity proceeds are automatically reinvested when the tenure ends. You can also avail doorstep services, or invest online, to ensure a hassle-free investment experience.
So, as a senior citizen you can invest in fixed deposits to safeguard your capital, earn guaranteed returns and keep your worries at bay. With the Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit, you can rely on the high stability rating of FAAA and MAAA by CRISIL and ICRA, respectively to secure your sunset years by assuming no risk at all.

The earnings season is likely to gain momentum as some of the front liners would be declaring their results in the next few days.

Further, market participants would keep a close watch on trade talk developments between US and China, currency and crude oil price movement.""

22,2019-10-23,Bajaj Finserv,"The segment most affected was its consumer B2B vertical, which deals in discretionary spendingIronically, the warnings on slowdown and pressure on asset quality have been coming from Bajaj Finance.

The festive season is not all bright this time with muted consumption demand, and consumer lender Bajaj Finance Ltd’s performance didn’t impress investors. If the first quarter showed signs of a demand slowdown, troubles have piled in the second quarter for the non-banking financial company (NBFC).
Bajaj Finance reported 38% growth in its consolidated assets under management (AUM) for the September quarter, lower than 41% from the previous quarter. Exactly a year ago, when the credit crisis hit NBFCs, the lender’s AUM growth was at the same level. In short, business doesn’t seem to have improved.
Deceleration was witnessed across the board, but the segment most affected was that of its consumer business-to-business (B2B) vertical, which deals in discretionary spending. Consumer B2B grew by just 19%, far lower than the 24% a year ago. Simply put, Indians are not buying that latest gadget or appliance with the fervour seen earlier. This is worrisome, more so, as the ongoing festival season was supposed to inspire consumers to loosen their purse strings.
Rajeev Jain, managing director of Bajaj Finance, said the pickup in disbursements during the current festival season is not living up to previous years, but he was hopeful that the next one week will be different. “While I would not be able to hazard a guess on third quarter so soon, the next few weeks are critical,"" Jain said over the phone.
Bajaj Finance has however seen the slowdown coming. Four months ago, Sanjiv Bajaj, vice chairman of the company, had warned of a dramatic slowdown.
Ironically, the warnings on slowdown and pressure on asset quality have been coming from Bajaj Finance. Last quarter, the company had said the slowdown was affecting the payment capacity of borrowers. The percentage of 30-day overdue loans had risen for most products on a sequential basis. This has continued even in the September quarter.
In fact, excluding home loans, all other loan categories showed a rise in delinquencies from a year earlier. Some categories, such as loan against property and auto loans, showed comparatively sharper deterioration.
It is clear that the average Indian is finding it harder to pay EMIs (equated monthly instalments), but the levels are not alarming. Even so, the rise in delinquencies only adds to the narrative of the ongoing slowdown.
Investors worried over the slowdown impact drove the Bajaj Finance stock down by 2.5% on Tuesday. But the stock still trades at a steep multiple of seven times its estimated book value for FY21. Part of this premium is simply because most other NBFCs are either battling a rise in delinquencies or a liquidity crunch. For Bajaj Finance, its asset-liability profile is superior to most peers. But perhaps, in light of the slowdown, its valuations may prompt a relook."

Shares of Bajaj Finance Ltd, a subsidiary of Bajaj Finserv Ltd, jumped on Tuesday after the consumer-focused non-banking financial company (NBFC) announced that it would raise funds through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) offer at a floor price of  ₹4,019.78 apiece.

17,2019-11-05,Bajaj Finserv,"On these same lines of seeking safety, the consumer lender’s play to raise money through equity was bound to receive a good responseAccording to some media reports, Bajaj Finance’s qualified institutional placement issue received bids of more than five times its size

It is a tried and tested method to seek refuge in stocks that seem to stand tall during times of stress. Bajaj Finance Ltd was an obvious choice when other non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) fell like nine pins after the liquidity crisis hit.
On these same lines of seeking safety, the consumer lender’s play to raise money through equity was bound to receive a good response. Even when the total size of fundraising is large enough at  ₹8,500 crore.
According to some media reports, Bajaj Finance’s qualified institutional placement (QIP) issue received bids of more than five times its size. What helped the QIP is that benchmark equity indices are near all-time highs or getting there and the market mood is buoyant. Most analysts have a buy rating on the stock and some have even raised their target prices recently.
What is more is that Bajaj Finance managed to maintain its pristine asset quality despite some pain points emerging due to consumption slowdown.
The lender reported a 63% increase in net profit in the September quarter. Of course, the slowdown has begun to reflect on Bajaj Finance’s balance sheet. Loan growth has decelerated from its historic average of 45-50%. Even so, the lender’s 38% growth in assets under management trumps everyone else in the market.
The secret is being best in hooking the retail borrower. Bajaj Finance’s business model is to make the average individual consume through credit and pay in equated monthly instalments (EMI).
The EMI hook has worked well for Bajaj Finance though it is increasingly facing tough competition from private banks.
All this explains why the stock has outperformed the broader market by giving a 30% return over the past three months.
Surely, the rather steep multiple of seven times its estimated book value for FY21 should make investors think before adding the stock to their kitty. That doesn’t seem to have happened.
The company set a floor price of  ₹4,020 a piece for its QIP issue and according to the reports, the price band for the issue is  ₹3,860-4,900. That means a discount of 4% over Tuesday’s closing price at the lowest of the QIP price band. The dilution for existing shareholders would also be very limited.
While analysts may have a buy rating, most have warned that valuations are expensive. “Bajaj Finance is winning because there are no better picks in this market when it comes to financials. Also, the consumption story has worked always,"" said an analyst asking not to be named.
Here is a thread of caution for investors. The consumption slowdown is already nipping at the heels of Bajaj Finance. Moreover, private banks such as HDFC Bank are entering into small ticket retail loans. For investors wanting to get more bang for their buck from the stock, the wait could stretch a bit in the wake of the slowdown."

The market value of Asia’s oldest stock exchange BSE Ltd slipped below that of its depository subsidiary Central Depository Services (India) Ltd (CDSL) for the first time on Tuesday, as its stock fell nearly 8% so far this year.
On Tuesday, the market capitalization of CDSL stood at  ₹2,431 crore, against BSE’s  ₹2,430.31 crore. At the end of September, BSE held 24% stake in CDSL.
Typically, the parent company’s market value should be more than that of its subsidiary, considering the parent may have its own core business in addition to the subsidiary units. However, there are some exceptions where the units are valued higher. For instance, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd and Bajaj Finance Ltd have higher market value than their parent Suzuki Motor Corp., Housing Development Corp Ltd, and Bajaj Finserv Ltd, respectively.
Shares of BSE have declined 7.8% this year with the exchange continuing to lose market share to its competitor National Stock Exchange. BSE went public in February 2017 and its shares have since fallen 31.7% from its issue price of  ₹806 a share.
BSE’s financial performance has been muted over the past several quarters, and this has reflected in its stock price, according to Ajit Mishra, vice president of Religare Broking.
“Despite BSE’s duopoly position, the stock has been on a continuous downtrend ever since its IPO in early 2017. It has been losing market share and the network effect is playing against it, which is why it is a dying business model with no visibility for growth and weak durability and sustainability of earnings,"" said Umesh Mehta, head of research, Samco Securities.
Shares of CDSL, which was listed in June 2017, have surged more than 59% from the issue price of  ₹149 a share. So far this year, they have gained 6%.
CDSL has an asset-light and well-diversified business model in which 35% of the revenue is fixed (annuity-based), which cushions it from market volatility. “CDSL has a more secular business working in a duopoly position where there is high visibility of earnings sustainability and durability. The triggers of the government’s new rule that even unlisted companies will have to dematerialise their shares and the huge untapped potential of investors in India around 10%, which is currently just 2%, have laid the foundation for a rally,"" Mehta said."

15,2019-11-07,Bajaj Finserv,"Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit prioritises convenience and safety of investment, in addition to handsome returns.

While it is a known fact that you should invest your money, knowing where to invest and how to go about it is just as important. As the financial market is extremely volatile, you must keep up to date with the latest developments to find offerings that can earn you substantial, guaranteed returns.
Since choosing the best instrument for you can seem like an overwhelming task given these factors, here’s a quick guide on the investments that you should consider in the current scenario to earn stable, sure returns, regardless of whether you’re a first-time or seasoned investor.
NBFC fixed deposits
Due to the latest repo rate cut in October 2019, you may find that fixed deposit investments are likely to bring in lower returns. However, they are still your best bet, as they are stable and offer yield that is unaffected by volatility. When it comes to generating wealth in a reliable, stable and consistent manner, you can count on an NBFC FD, as it offers higher returns compared to bank FDs.
Further, with a reputed financial institution, you can also enjoy additional features that will enhance your experience. A proof of this is the Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit, as it prioritises convenience and safety of investment, in addition to handsome returns.
This FD has the highest stability and credibility ratings from two of the most prominent credit rating agencies in India: ICRA’s ‘MAAA’ and CRISIL’s ‘FAAA’ ratings. Additionally, it is the only Indian NBFC to have S&P Global’s ‘BBB’ rating. These three accolades speak volumes about the security that you can enjoy. In fact, a book size of Rs.16,000+ crore and an investor base of more than 2.5 lakh customers is further proof that it’s a sound choice.
What makes the Bajaj Finance FD truly a cut above the rest is that you can also benefit from value-added services like the multi-deposit facility and the auto-renewal feature. These help you stay invested for longer, while reducing the effort required at your end. Bajaj Finance also offers industry-leading interest rates through its FD. You can get up to 8.75% as a senior investor, and up to 8.35% as a regular investor, for an FD that has a tenure of at least 36 months with interest payable at maturity.
To understand what you stand to earn, consider the following table.
Customer type: New Customer
You can also determine the exact returns you can earn before you start investing, by using the FD Calculator. All you need to do is enter the intended investment amount and tenure.
Public Provident Fund
Investing in PPF is a good way to grow your wealth over an extended period of time. This is because the money is locked in for a 15-year tenure and during this time your corpus grows steadily. As per recent updates, the applicable PPF interest rate sits at 7.9%.
A PPF investment works best when the goal is to build a healthy retirement fund. This is because you cannot withdraw funds until the 7th year of investment. Additionally, you can also extend the investment at the time of maturity in five-year blocks at the prevailing interest rate.
National Pension Scheme
This government scheme is another way to invest for your retirement. Through NPS, you can choose between two options: auto and active. These dictate your involvement with the investment and earnings. In case of the former, your funds are automatically invested in equity, bonds or government securities. On the other hand, if you can choose the latter, your involvement in where to invest is greater. As per the scheme regulations, NPS matures only when you turn 60 years of age.
While the above-mentioned options serve vastly different goals, it is essential to consider factors like lock-in period, interest rate on offer and the risk involved. A fixed deposit stands out amongst these 3 options as it promises admirable returns, immense flexibility, near unmatched safety and is ideal for both short- and long-term goals.
For those looking for a quick and convenient investment option, Bajaj Finance online FD is a great way to grow your savings. All you have to do is fill the application form and authorise a representative to contact you. Thereafter, leverage the multi-deposit facility, auto renewal facility and other unique features to power your finances.

On this Children’s Day, you may be thinking of ways to make the day special for your children. While you can consider options like an outing, or a sumptuous treat for your child, this year, you must also take a step towards securing your child’s future. The best way to do this is to build a strong financial foundation through an investment.
This is important because as your child grows older, you will require a greater amount to address a wide range of expenses related to food, clothing, healthcare, housing, transportation, entertainment and education. In fact, as per data from a popular news daily, you may need to save up as much as Rs. 67.4 lakh to assure your child of the very best from conception to college graduation. As this number is only going to increase, it’s best to be prepared.
Among the instruments that you can select for the purpose of building a corpus, the Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit stands out as it offers generous yields and high level of safety. To know how you can secure your child’s future with this FD, read on.
Grow your finances at a fixed interest rate
Bajaj Finance offers some of the best FD interest rates available, which peak when you invest for 3 years and choose to receive payouts at maturity. Further, as an FD isn’t linked to the market, you can use the FD calculator to forecast the growth of your finances beforehand.
According to a report, you need around INR 6 lakh to 10 lakh every 4 years for all the expenses related to your child. Here’s how you can accumulate the amount as a regular or senior citizen by investing in a Bajaj Finance FD with payouts at maturity.
Utilise auto-renewal bonuses for better yields
To multiply your earnings and invest for a long-term goal like overseas education, Bajaj Finance allows you to opt for auto-renewal when you book the FD. This prolongs the life of your FD for another term and gives you an extra 0.10% interest.
Earmark finances effectively with a flexible tenor and the multi-deposit facility
To plan efficiently for various expenses pertaining to your child, you can choose an FD tenor ranging from 12 to 60 months. Further, you needn’t park all your finances in one deposit. You can invest in several deposits through one cheque with the multi-deposit facility. This way you can invest in different FDs for different goals, and enjoy timely liquidity. Moreover, should you need finance for a particular goal, such as your child’s college fees, you can simply dip into one FD and leave the others undisturbed.
Get timely interest payouts as per your needs
Some goals pertaining to your child may be long-term, such as saving for their wedding, while others might be short-term, such as paying their tuition fees. In such scenarios, you can opt for payouts at maturity for long-term goals to benefit from the power of compounding, and opt for periodic payouts for short-term goals.
Enjoy a safe investment environment
When you invest with Bajaj Finance, remember that you can bank on the NBFC providing you with timely returns. You enjoy this peace of mind as the FD carries ICRA’s and CRISIL’s highest stability ratings, MAAA and FAAA respectively. Further, Bajaj Finance has to its credit S&P Global’s BBB rating, and the trust of over 2.5 lakh customers who contribute to a book size of over Rs.16,000 crore.
Lastly, bear in mind that should an emergency crop up you can leverage the value of the deposit to access a convenient loan against FD of up to Rs.4 lakh. So, what are you waiting for? This Children’s Day, make a beginning towards creating a financially secure future for your child. To set up your deposit quickly, make use of the Bajaj Finance online FD form and request a call from an executive right away.

Indian equity market ended higher on Thursday led by gains in financial services and IT sectors. However, positive investor sentiment was marred by headline inflation rate based on consumer price index (CPI) that breached Reserve Bank of India’s medium-term target of 4% for the first time since July 2018.
The government released CPI inflation data after market hours on Wednesday. Retail Inflation jumped to 4.62% in October from 3.99% in September due to a surge in food inflation.
Contrary to the rise in CPI inflation, wholesale prices based inflation, or WPI, eased further to 0.16% in October from 0.33% in September due to subdued prices of non-food articles and fall in prices of manufactured items, according to the government data released today.

12,2019-11-19,Bajaj Finserv,"Cement maker has appointed JM Financial and ICICI Securities as advisers to the dealLarge firms such as UltraTech, ACC and Ambuja saw their sales volume decline in Q2

Shree Cement Ltd, India’s third largest cement maker, is at an advanced stage of raising more than  ₹2,000 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) offering, two people aware of the development said.
“The money will be used for capex and debt reduction. They have been meeting investors for this purpose and are targeting to close this fundraise within this quarter,"" said one of the two people cited above. “They could raise anywhere between  ₹2000- ₹3000 crore depending on demand from investors.""
Shree Cement has hired JM Financial and ICICI Securities as advisers to manage the QIP, the people said, requesting anonymity. QIP is a tool, through which listed companies can sell shares, debentures, or any securities, other than warrants that are convertible into stocks, to a qualified institutional buyer.
While e-mails written to Shree Cement and JM Financial remained unanswered, ICICI Securities declined to comment on the matter.
Cement producers in the country have been hit by a prolonged monsoon season and falling cement prices amid an ongoing demand slump. While other large cement producers such as UltraTech Cement Ltd, ACC Ltd and Ambuja Cements Ltd saw their sales volume decline in the September quarter, Shree Cement was an exception.
In the quarter ended 30 September, the Rajasthan-based cement maker’s sales volume grew marginally at 1.5% to 5.72 million tonnes and net realizations rose 9% to  ₹4,654 per tonne from a year earlier. The company’s profit also rose over five times to  ₹309 crore, compared to the corresponding quarter in the previous fiscal.
On 19 October, the company’s board had said that it planned to raise as much as  ₹3,000 crore equity, in one or more tranches, through QIPs. It planned to use these funds for inorganic growth opportunities that may come up over the next 12-18 months, according to a 22 October note by HDFC Securities.
“Markets have done well recently and we have seen a few QIPs getting closed with Bajaj Finance raising almost $1.2 billion. In this environment, companies are eager to re-look at equity deals and we may see some more QIPs hitting the market,"" said the first person.
As of October, five companies have raised  ₹17,930 crore via QIPs, exceeding the  ₹10,489 crore raised by 13 firms in the entire fiscal year 2018, according to primary market tracker Prime Database.
Recently, consumer lending firm Bajaj Finance Ltd mopped up  ₹8,500 crore through private placements to qualified institutional investors. Subscribed over five times its size, the QIP got interest from foreign institutional investors including BlackRock, Nomura and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund.
In September, private sector lender Axis Bank Ltd raised  ₹12,500 crore in India’s second-largest QIP from domestic institutions and large foreign investors, including GIC, Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, Nomura and American investors T Rowe Price and BlackRock. In August, another private lender, Yes Bank Ltd also raised  ₹1,930.46 crore through a QIP."
11,2019-11-29,Bajaj Finserv,"India’s biggest retail lender, HDFC Bank Ltd saw its retail loan book grow by 15% in the September quarter, lower than previous quartersNon-bank retail lender Bajaj Finance Ltd also witnessed a slowdown

Bank credit growth may be at a five-year low, but still hasn’t reached the bottom. It won’t be the corporate loan book, but retail loans that could pull down growth in the coming months.
Indian banks have been chasing the retail customer over a decade now, since businessmen were busy deleveraging their balance sheets. Also, the retail customer turned out to be more disciplined in repayments with delinquencies being low. In the 10 years since 2008, retail loans on an average grew at a breakneck pace of about 20%, in some months even faster.
In fiscal year 2018-19, this fast-paced engine began to slow a bit. As of September, the growth came to about 17%. Part of this is due to banks’ own caution after economic growth data began to show a slowdown in consumption. As the sentiment around future employment and earnings soured, lenders realized that the retail customer could come under stress.
Indeed, delinquency rates have inched up in the unsecured personal loan space, although they are far from raising serious worry. Even so, bankers seem to have taken of note of this. If one pieces together the commentary from big banks during the September quarter, there seems to be a cautionary note setting in.
India’s biggest retail lender, HDFC Bank Ltd saw its retail loan book grow by 15% in the September quarter, lower than previous quarters.
Non-bank retail lender Bajaj Finance Ltd also witnessed a slowdown. In a conversation with Mint post quarterly results, the lender’s managing director Rajeev Jain said that festive season demand was not as good as expected.
Both lenders have tightened their risk filters on retail loans. HDFC Bank in an earnings conference call told analysts that it has tightened its filters and policies to chase better customers and to keep delinquencies in check.
Ergo, the sobering effect on loan growth cannot be ruled out.
“We believe the near-term growth will continue to taper down further and could pull headline banking system loan growth towards demonetization lows,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
During demonetization, credit offtake had halted, as banks were occupied with handling the demonetized currency notes. Recall that during the demonetization quarter, loan growth crashed to 4%.
As of 8 November, credit growth was 8.1%. The drivers of loan growth for banks have been retail and small business loans so far. The corporate loan book has been growing in low single digits.
Given the concerns over consumption demand and employment prospects, banks cannot be faulted for their growing caution on consumer loans. The worst of credit growth deceleration is yet to come."
10,2019-11-30,Bajaj Finserv,"The bank’s board has agreed to allot 24.24 million shares at  ₹340.7 apiece to five investors, including Bajaj FinanceThe bank had a capital adequacy ratio of 12.3% as of 30 September, falling from 13.7% in the year-ago period

Mumbai: Private sector lender RBL Bank Ltd, on Saturday, said it has approved raising of  ₹825.79 crore worth equity capital by way of preferential allotment to five investors.
The bank’s board has agreed to allot 24.24 million shares at  ₹340.70 apiece to Bajaj Finance Ltd, foreign institutional investors East Bridge Capital Master Fund I and FEG Mauritius FPI Ltd, along with Ward Ferry Management Ltd-managed hedge fund WF Asian Reconnaissance Fund and Asia-focused stock hedge fund, lshana Capital, the bank said in an exchange filing. The shares were issued at a 9.8% discount to the bank’s  ₹374.15 closing price on Friday.
On 25 November, Mint reported that the bank has appointed ICICI Securities, IIFL Securities and IDFC Securities as advisers to raise up to  ₹2,000 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) offering. QIP is a tool used by listed companies to sell shares, debentures, or any securities, other than warrants that are convertible into stocks, to a qualified institutional buyer such as mutual funds and foreign institutions. A source had told Mint at the time that the fund raising will be a combination of preferential issue, along with a QIP for public market investors.
The development follows RBL Bank's announcement to shareholders at its annual general meeting on 9 July that it would raise equity capital not exceeding  ₹3,500 crore. The bank had a capital adequacy ratio of 12.3% as of 30 September, falling from 13.7% in the same period a year ago.
Between July-September, the bank’s asset quality also worsened as its gross non-performing loans jumped 95% to  ₹1,539 crore from  ₹789.21 crore in the same period last year. As a percentage of total loans, its gross bad loans ratio nearly doubled to 2.6% from 1.38% during the period while profit fell 73% to  ₹54 crore. That put the bank’s stock under pressure as it tanked from a 52-week high of  ₹716.40 on NSE in May this year to a 52-week low of  ₹230.55 on 23 October.
On 22 November, CNBC TV18 reported that RBL Bank was in talks with a strategic investor, Bajaj Holdings & Investment and two private equity firms- ChrysCapital and Blackstone, for the proposed share sale, which could help it raise about  ₹2,000 crore to shore up its capital base.
In 2017, the bank had raised  ₹1,680 crore of equity capital by selling 32.6 million shares for  ₹515 apiece on a preferential basis to its existing investors, UK’s development finance institution CDC Group Plc, HDFC Standard Life Insurance, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, Steadview Capital Mauritius and Multiples Private Equity, among others.
The 76-year-old bank, which was historically concentrated in south-west Maharashtra and northern Karnataka, has grown to become a pan-India lender with a network of 346 branches and 394 ATMs, serving over 7.3 million customers."
9,2019-12-02,Bajaj Finserv,"Shares transferred to customers, pledges can’t be accessed by lenders nowNSDL said it has transferred securities into the accounts of clients who had paid in full for their securities

Mumbai: The National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) on Monday unilaterally transferred back to client accounts the securities that Karvy Stock Broking Ltd had illegally pledged with lenders, on a day Bajaj Finance Ltd moved the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) to access the same securities.
The NSDL move, which comes as a relief for 90% of Karvy clients, shuts out lenders from accessing client securities pledged with them, unless the appellate tribunal reverses the transfer.
In a statement, NSDL said it has transferred securities into the accounts of clients who had paid in full for their securities based on an order by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).
According to a Sebi order on 22 November, Karvy illegally pledged client securities with lenders and raised money, some of which was diverted to its real estate business. The order barred Karvy from signing up new clients and stopped lenders from accessing the pledged shares. Bajaj Finance, which claims to have lent  ₹345 crore to Karvy, is one of the lenders affected by the Sebi order.
The depository has transferred securities worth  ₹2,013.77 crore back into the accounts of 83,806 clients, which is over 90% of the estimated bank exposure. A Mint report on Friday had said that 95,000 clients were awaiting payouts from Karvy; NSDL’s transfer leaves around 11,000 clients still awaiting payout, including cash payout, from Karvy.
“This move may lead to more litigation as it seems that NSDL’s move to transfer securities to clients’ accounts was done in the absence of any specific Sebi directive. In transferring these securities, the depository seems to have ignored the third party lien marked on such securities. By doing so, the sanctity of the pledges appears to have been diluted,"" said Tushar Ajinkya, senior partner at law firm ELP.
Bajaj Finance’s SAT petition sought an interim restriction on transferring shares to clients’ accounts. On behalf of Sebi, Rafique Dada, assisted by Anubhav Ghosh, Partner at Law Point, argued that SAT cannot give relief as the relevant parties—NSE and NSDL—have not been included in the case. Sebi also argued that Bajaj Finance did not conduct proper due diligence in verifying whether the shares belonged to the brokerage or to the clients. It said Bajaj Finance had relied on Karvy’s undertaking. The tribunal heard the petition and reserved it for orders on Tuesday.
According to Registrar of Companies (RoC) charge documents, only five private banks and one NBFC—Aditya Birla Finance—had fund-based exposures to Karvy against pledges. However, Bajaj Finance’s plea indicates more lenders are likely to have non-fund exposures.
A Mint report indicated that so far, Sebi has estimated the total exposure of lenders to Karvy at  ₹2,800 crore.
According to Bajaj Finance’s petition, reviewed by Mint, Karvy had even extended the sanctioned limit and taken an overdraft. Starting September, it had started defaulting on repayments.
On 20 November, Bajaj Finance issued a loan recall notice to Karvy and the pledges against the loan would have been invoked on 23 November. Interestingly, just a day earlier, on 22 November, Sebi had barred depositories from transferring securities from Karvy’s account except to beneficial owners or clients who had paid in full. The petition also says Karvy had given a false undertaking to Bajaj Finance that these securities belonged to the brokerage.
The 22 November Sebi order, followed a preliminary report by National Stock Exchange of India, which indicated that Karvy had merged clients’ securities with its own securities and used the clients’ securities to borrow. These funds, or money received due to selling off these securities, were transferred to related company businesses, specifically its real estate business.
“Sebi and the depository move seems to come from a point of equitability and trying to safeguard small investors. The banks anyway have a number of avenues to recover their dues by filing a fraud case or even approaching National Company Law Tribunal under bankruptcy proceedings,"" said a lawyer who did not wish to be named as he is representing one of the stakeholders.
Fearing that Karvy’s lenders may approach the Bombay high court for possession of shares, Sebi also filed caveats in the court through its law firm, Law Point, to ensure such a plea is not heard in its absence."
7,2019-12-03,Bajaj Finserv,"Sebi has estimated the total exposure of lenders to Karvy at  ₹2,800 croreBajaj Finance is aggrieved by the Sebi order, which prevents it from accessing its pledged shares

Mumbai: The Securities and Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Tuesday gave Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) time till 10 December to pass an order in the plea filed by Bajaj Finance Ltd against the capital market regulator’s move to transfer pledged shares to clients of the troubled Karvy Stock Broking Ltd.
Sebi has estimated the total exposure of lenders to Karvy at  ₹2,800 crore, of which Bajaj Finance has an exposure of  ₹345 crore as per a copy of the petition reviewed by Mint.
Bajaj Finance is aggrieved by the Sebi order, which prevents it from accessing its pledged shares. The firm claimed that it has the right to its pledged securities and that Sebi was wrong in returning the securities to the accounts of Karvy’s clients.
HDFC Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd and some other lenders also joined Bajaj Finance on Tuesday in its plea against the Sebi move. An order in their pleas will be passed later. SAT asked Sebi to hear Bajaj Finance’s plea by Wednesday.
Early on Monday, the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE) and the BSE suspended Karvy’s trading licence for all segments due to non-compliance with the exchange’s and Sebi norms. Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) and MSEI also suspended the licence of the brokerage firm.\
This action follows the 22 November order by Sebi which had said the brokerage firm misused client securities and used it for other purposes. Karvy had sold clients securities and the proceeds were transferred to related party businesses such as Karvy Realty Ltd.
Sebi’s prompt action against Karvy has resulted in nearly 83,000 investors getting back their securities, which were illegally transferred by the brokerage firm to its own account and were even pledged without any authorisation.
With the latest transfer by National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL), nearly 90% investors have got back their securities and the remaining ones will get after clearing their dues.
Karvy took loans to the tune of  ₹600 crore by pledging securities worth more than  ₹2,300 crore of 95,000 clients with lenders. Of these, 95,000 clients, nearly 83,000 of them have got their securities.
On 20 November, Bajaj Finance issued a loan recall notice to Karvy and the pledges against the loan would have been invoked on 23 November. Sebi had on 22 November barred depositories from transferring securities from Karvy’s account except to beneficial owners or clients who had paid in full. The petition also says Karvy had given a false undertaking to Bajaj Finance that these securities belonged to the brokerage."

Private sector lender RBL Bank today said it has raised  ₹2,025.27 crore from institutional investors through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) offering and will utilise the proceeds to fund business growth. RBL Bank shares were down about 7% in noon trade to  ₹349, giving up early gains. The QIP opened on December 2 and closed on December 5.
In a statement RBL Bank said it concluded the QIP of  ₹2,025 crore at the issue price of  ₹351 per share pursuant to the allotment of 5.77 crore equity shares
""The issue saw strong demand from domestic as well as foreign QIBs. The overall allocation to domestic investors including mutual funds and insurance companies is approximately 60% with the balance allocated to foreign institutional investors in Asia and Europe,"" RBL Bank said in a statement.
""We saw participation from our credit card partner, Bajaj Finance Ltd. and from other new investors especially long only foreign institutional investors diversifying the shareholder base of the bank,"" RBL Bank said.
QIP is a tool used by listed companies to sell shares, debentures, or any other security, other than warrants that are convertible into stocks, to qualified institutional buyers such as mutual funds and foreign institutions.
""This capital infusion significantly enhances our capital adequacy, and positions us well to capitalise on the various growth opportunities available to us, especially as economic growth returns to normal,"" RBL Bank MD and CEO Vishwavir Ahuja said.

5,2019-12-09,Bajaj Finserv,"Lenders have asked brokers to verify the ownership of securitiesSebi is expected to decide on the lenders’ representation on 10 and 12 December, as per the SAT order

Mumbai: The Karvy Stock Broking debacle and the ensuing loss of securities underlying their secured credit have forced lenders, especially banks, to review their exposure to brokerage firms, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Fearing that more secured loans could turn unsecured if the loans are backed by client securities, these lenders have sent out letters to brokers to verify whether these securities belonged to them or to clients, these people said on condition of anonymity.
“We are taking a relook at the documentation and other risk management measures required to ensure that the loan against pledged shares is not misused, like in the case of Karvy,"" said the chief risk management officer of a private sector bank, one of the three people cited above.
Some banks have also begun a review of their exposure to smaller brokers and are considering reducing it by 10%, said the proprietor of a mid-sized brokerage and the second person cited above.
This follows a 22 November notification by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which barred Karvy Stock Broking Ltd from adding new clients or acting on behalf of clients, and ordered depositories to transfer securities only to their beneficial owners.
Karvy is accused of misusing client securities worth  ₹2,800 crore to secure loan facilities from lenders towards working capital. The brokerage also sold off client securities and transferred the proceeds to its real estate group company.
Following the Sebi directive to transfer securities only to beneficial owners, the National Securities Depository Ltd on 2 December transferred  ₹2,013 crore into the accounts of 83,862 Karvy clients, which is almost 90% of the affected clients.
Four lenders then approached the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) saying the shares were pledged with them and therefore they had the right over these shares.
On 4 December, SAT ruled that reversing these transfers was untenable, leaving the lenders with no securities to invoke the pledge.
Karvy owes ICICI Bank  ₹642 crore and HDFC Bank had granted the brokerage a loan facility of  ₹350 crore. IndusInd Bank has an exposure of  ₹132 crore. Another lender, Bajaj Finance Ltd, has an exposure of  ₹345 crore, and its plea has already been referred to Sebi for a relook. The total estimated exposure of these four lenders is  ₹1,400 crore.
The banks were required to file representations with Sebi for redressal of their lost shares. “At least three of the lenders sought that Sebi allow them more time to file representations,"" said a lawyer representing the lenders.
Sebi is expected to decide on the lenders’ representations on 10 and 12 December, as per the SAT order.
“We have received letters this week from bankers trying to verify that the securities belong to us and not to the clients,"" the second person said. “In the Karvy issue, Bajaj Finance had, in fact, relied on the brokerage firm’s assertion that securities belonged to it and not clients.""
While the banks have increased their due diligence on broker exposures, a Sebi official, the third person cited earlier, said this should have happened earlier.
The official said: “Sebi had issued a circular on 20 June this year, asking brokers to segregate their securities from client securities, and prohibited them from using client securities for funding purposes. Considering the changes in rules, the banks should have increased their due diligence earlier. Brokers were also required to unwind the pledges which used client securities, by the end of September, and many of them are yet to affect the same."""

3,2019-12-10,Bajaj Finserv,"Firm chose to subscribe to shares via QIP instead of the preferential allotment routeSebi’s norms on preferential allotment of shares would make Bajaj Finance ineligible

MUMBAI :
Last week, Bajaj Finance Ltd, one of India’s largest non-bank lenders, made a  ₹150 crore investment in RBL Bank Ltd through a qualified institutional placement (QIP). That, however, wasn’t its intended investment route.
On 30 November, RBL Bank informed the stock exchanges of plans to raise around  ₹825 crore through a preferential allotment of shares to a bunch of investors, including Bajaj Finance.
Bajaj Finance, according to the exchange notification, was supposed to subscribe to 4.4 million shares at  ₹340.7 apiece.
The proposed preferential allotment would have closed only after approval from the bank’s shareholders at the extraordinary general meeting (EGM), scheduled for 27 December.
A 3 December notice to shareholders, informing them about the EGM, however, did not list Bajaj Finance as one of the preferential allotment investors.
That is because between Saturday, 30 November, and Tuesday, 3 December, Bajaj Finance changed its plans to invest in the bank from the preferential allotment route to subscribing to shares through the QIP, which opened for subscription on 2 December.
The change of plan was prompted by the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (Sebi) norms on preferential allotment, which would have made Bajaj Finance ineligible for participation, according to two people aware of the developments.
“Sebi states that for strategic investors, such as Bajaj Finance, to be eligible for participation in a preferential allotment of shares, they should not have sold shares of the issuer company in the previous six months,"" said one of the persons mentioned above, on condition of anonymity. Bajaj Finance, through its various lending products such as loan against shares (LAS) was holding RBL Bank shares as pledge, the person said.
“When some of these loans saw defaults, Bajaj Finance invoked these pledges and sold the RBL Bank shares it was holding. This inadvertently made Bajaj Finance ineligible to participate in the proposed preferential allotment by RBL,"" he said.
For RBL Bank, this was a crucial fundraising exercise as rising bad loans and provisions have hit its profit as well as stock price. Stocks tanked from a 52-week high of  ₹716.40 on NSE in May to a 52-week low of  ₹230.55 in October. At such a time, a technical glitch rendering Bajaj ineligible would have impacted investor sentiment. In the quarter ended 30 September, the bank saw its gross non-performing loans jump 95% to  ₹1,539 crore. As a percentage of total loans, its gross bad loans ratio nearly doubled to 2.6% from 1.38% during the period while profit fell 73% to  ₹54 crore.
Interestingly, Bajaj Finance seems to have stumbled upon this roadblock only after a public announcement of its intention to participate in the bank’s preferential allotment of shares.
On Friday, RBL Bank announced that it had successfully raised  ₹2,025 crore through its QIP offering by selling shares to institutional investors such as mutual funds, insurance companies and foreign institutional investors.
Bajaj Finance subscribed to 4.27 million shares at  ₹351 apiece, aggregating to  ₹150 crore in the QIP, according to filings to stock exchanges.
Apart from Bajaj Finance, other investors that participated in the QIP included a fund managed by BNP Paribas, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, Credit Suisse (Singapore) Ltd, and funds managed by Nippon India Mutual Fund.
Investors that are participating in RBL Bank’s preferential allotment include East Bridge Capital Master Fund I and FEG Mauritius FPI Ltd, along with Ward Ferry Management Ltd-managed hedge fund WF Asian Reconnaissance Fund and Asia-focused stock hedge fund, lshana Capital.
Emails sent to Bajaj Finance remained unanswered till the time of going to press."
2,2019-12-10,Bajaj Finserv,"Keep your worries at bay because wealth generation has never been so easy

With a plethora of investment options available to you today, identifying one that balances out your portfolio and matches your risk appetite can be tricky. Thankfully, age-old favourites like the fixed deposit offer a stable environment and serve as a viable option for wealth generation.
For example, with a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit you not only get access to market-leading FD interest rates, but also benefit from guaranteed returns as the deposit carries top stability ratings. In fact, Bajaj Finance is the only NBFC to have 0 unclaimed deposits. Further, this FD programme witnessed a YoY growth of 60% and has a book size of Rs.17,633 crore.
So, to better understand the value in this safe offering, take a look at the 5 reasons why you should invest in a Bajaj Finance Fixed Deposit.
Get guaranteed returns with high credibility and stability ratings
A key reason to invest in this FD is the fact that you’re getting guaranteed returns. Bajaj Finance is the only NBFC to have been assigned the long-term issuer credit rating ‘BBB-’ with a stable outlook, and short-term issuer credit rating of ‘A-3’ by S&P Global. These, in combination, with ICRA’s MAAA and CRISIL’s FAAA ratings indicate that this FD is an extremely stable and safe avenue to invest in.
This is vital when investing large amounts of money over extended periods of time as any defaults can result in hefty losses. Thankfully with Bajaj Finance’s vouched-for track record, you can invest freely knowing you will earn the returns promised.
Take advantage of current FD interest rates to rake in earnings
After 5 successive repo rate cuts by the RBI, and another one expected in the first week of December 2019, securing fixed deposit rates now may be the best option for you. This is especially the case as certain economists predict a net 25-50bps cut by March 2020. So, investing with Bajaj Finance FD now, would allow you to couple safety with generous yields.
To help you understand your potential earnings when you invest in this FD, consider the following example.
To compute these values for yourself and invest effectively, use the online FD calculator. This minimises errors and gives you an accurate figure of what you can expect to earn.
Choose to auto-renew and gain high returns
When you start a Bajaj Finance FD account, you also benefit from the Auto Renewal feature. This way, when your investment matures, you can reinvest it entirely or partly without needing to fill any additional forms or intervene. This allows you to benefit from a rewarding and stable environment for longer without interruptions and even benefit from the FD renewal bonus upon reinvesting. Currently, the bonus rate is an additional 0.10% on the base rate.
Ladder your investments efficiently with the Multi Deposit facility
In addition to other value-added features, you can also opt for the Multi Deposit facility. This allows you to invest in several FDs using one cheque only. The upside of doing this is that you can invest in FDs that mature at different tenors and enjoy liquidity all through a given timeframe. This way you don’t have to compromise on liquidity to enjoy safety.
Get a loan against your FD for an amount up to Rs.4 lakh
In case of any emergencies that demand a hefty sum of cash, you can take a loan against your FD and get approved for a sanction of up to Rs.4 lakh. This way, you don’t need to prematurely withdraw your investment, saving you from paying a penalty and from interrupting your investment.
As you’ll notice, besides stability and interest gains, this FD also grants access to a range of value-added features. These can come in handy when you’re in a pinch and can even aid your wealth-creation efforts. Further, with the minimum deposit amount being just Rs. 25,000, you can start investing at the earliest without having to wait to gather a larger corpus. All you have to do to is online FD application and authorize an executive to contact you with further details.

1,2019-12-19,Bajaj Finserv,"The market regulator held that Karvy had misused client securities by pledging them with various lenders without authorizationIn a stock exchange filing, Bajaj Finance said that it has invoked 24 lakh pledged shares of KDMSL representing 10% equity stake in the company

MUMBAI :
Non-bank lender Bajaj Finance Ltd on Thursday said that it has invoked shares of Karvy Data Management Services Ltd (KDMSL), which were pledged by Karvy Stock Broking Ltd to raise funds from the lender.
In a stock exchange filing, Bajaj Finance said that it has invoked 24 lakh pledged shares of KDMSL representing 10% equity stake in the company.
KDMSL, incorporated in 2008, is a Hyderabad-based step-down subsidiary of Karvy Stock Broking and provides business and knowledge process services. The company started off with back-office services and has over the years added various other services to its portfolio to cater to the banking, telecom, and e-commerce sectors.
“The shares of KDMSL were pledged with the company for securing the outstanding dues of Karvy Stock Broking Limited, the borrower company. The company has invoked the pledged shares of KDMSL for recovery of its dues,"" the stock exchange filing said.
Bajaj Finance is amongst the group of lenders with the largest exposure to Karvy Stock Broking, which raised money from the lenders by pledging shares belonging to its clients.
