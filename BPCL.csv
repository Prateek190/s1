147,2018-02-12,BPCL,"ONGC's overseas arm ONGC Videsh, IOC and a unit of BPCL paid $600 million for a 10% stake in the UAE's offshore oil and gas field Zakum

New Delhi: A consortium of Indian companies led by state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC)’s overseas arm, ONGC Videsh Ltd, has bought a 10% stake in the UAE’s offshore oil and gas field Zakum, as India pursues overseas hydrocarbon assets while oil-rich nations resort to ways of reducing risk and balancing their budget deficits. 
New Delhi: A consortium of Indian companies led by state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC)’s overseas arm, ONGC Videsh Ltd, has bought a 10% stake in the UAE’s offshore oil and gas field Zakum, as India pursues overseas hydrocarbon assets while oil-rich nations resort to ways of reducing risk and balancing their budget deficits.
ONGC Videsh said late on Saturday night that the Indian side will pay a sign-up bonus of $600 million as part of the deal inked in Abu Dhabi between company executives and UAE officials in the presence of visiting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Abu Dhabi crown prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
The deal gives the Indian consortium, which includes Indian Oil Corp. Ltd and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd’s overseas arm Bharat PetroResources Ltd, access to about two million tonnes of annual share from the field which produces about 400,000 barrels of oil a day.
Backed by diplomatic efforts, Indian energy companies have been aggressively pursuing a share in the world’s most prolific oil and gas fields. In 2016, Indian Oil, Oil India Ltd and Bharat PetroResources had bought stakes in two assets in Siberia owned by Russia’s state-backed PJSC Rosneft Oil Co. for $3.3 billion.
Although global oil prices have been rising recently, it is far below the $100-plus levels seen three years ago, forcing many oil-rich nations to narrow their budget deficits by selling assets and diversifying into non-oil sectors of the economy. US exporters stepping up their supplies is also helping to reduce the effectiveness of the supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), aimed at propping up prices. The UAE is a member of Opec.
“The trend in upstream oil and gas projects is to take a consortium approach which helps in mitigating the risk. Besides, building good relationship between the two nations is also a motivation for the deal,"" said K. Ravichandran, senior vice-president and group head, corporate ratings, at Icra Ltd.
In a statement, ONGC Videsh said the stake acquisition in Zakum is the first time that Indian oil and gas companies have been given a stake in the development of Abu Dhabi’s hydrocarbon resources. The deal has a term of 40 years.
“We are hopeful that this historic agreement will lead to further opportunities for Indian oil and gas companies to participate in the UAE’s energy sector,"" the statement said, citing chairman Shashi Shanker."
146,2018-02-28,BPCL,"Oman Oil, Kuwait National Petroleum and Abu Dhabi National Oil have evinced interest in buying Bharat Petroleum's stake in Bina refinery

Mumbai: National oil companies of Oman, Kuwait and Abu Dhabi are in talks to buy up to 24% stake in Madhya Pradesh’s Bina refinery, two people aware of the development said. 
Mumbai: National oil companies of Oman, Kuwait and Abu Dhabi are in talks to buy up to 24% stake in Madhya Pradesh’s Bina refinery, two people aware of the development said.
Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd (BORL), which operates the refinery, is an equal joint venture between Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) of India and Oman Oil Co. S.A.O.C. of the Sultanate of Oman. It has a capacity of 6 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa).
“Oman Oil Co., Kuwait National Petroleum Co. and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. have evinced interest in buying stake in Bina refinery. Oman Oil, which is an existing partner, has expressed interest in making further investments in the refinery. BPCL may be able to raise around Rs2,000 crore from the stake sale,"" said a banker, one of the two people cited above, on the condition of anonymity. 
BPCL, Oman Oil, Kuwait National Petroleum Co. and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. did not respond to emails sent on Monday.
“The Indian market is one of the fastest growing which explains the interest from international companies. As for Bina refinery, it is a good functional refinery. There is no gestation period involved which makes it an attractive bet for investors,"" said K. Ravichandran, senior vice president and group head, corporate ratings, ICRA Ltd.
BPCL and Oman Oil together hold 50% stake in BORL. In addition, BPCL has subscribed to share warrants of Rs1,585.68 crore in the firm. 
“BPCL has made an investment in compulsorily convertible debentures and share warrants of BORL. This investment is equivalent to 24% additional equity stake in BORL. So, technically, BPCL holds 74% stake in BORL. The share warrants would be converted to equity when global companies buy stake in BORL,"" the banker added.
In 2015, Oman Oil Co. had expressed its reluctance to put more money in the refinery to fund its Rs3,000 crore expansion. So BPCL, in April 2016, sought government approval to put in more equity to fund the expansion by way of subscription of convertible warrants, giving it the right to convert it into equity shares.
BORL meets BPCL’s product requirements in the northern and central regions in the country and receives crude supply by a cross-country pipeline from Vadinar to Bina. In 2016-17, it recorded a crude throughput of 6.33 million tonnes at an average capacity utilization of 106%. Its gross refining margin for 2016-17 stood at $11.80 per barrel. 
“Bina is a well performing refinery posting double-digit gross refining margins. BPCL is planning to expand it further which has got international companies interested,"" said the second of the two people cited earlier. He added that Oman Oil, which had earlier declined to participate in the refinery’s expansion, has also expressed interest in pumping in more money.
In 2016-17, BORL reported profit after tax of Rs808.13 crore. According to documents with the registrar of companies, BORL’s net worth is at Rs2,300-odd crore.
Bina refinery is raising its refining capacity in two phases— to 7.8 million tonnes mtpa from current 6 mtpa at a cost of Rs3,072 crore by 2018, and then to 15 mtpa for an additional investment of Rs30,000 crore in the next four-five years. The refinery will also set up a petrochemicals unit with a 1.5 mtpa naphtha cracker.
“BPCL is preparing a detailed feasibility report for the expansion, which would be shared with the companies who have shown interest in the refinery,"" the second person added. 
According to the oil ministry’s petroleum planning and analysis cell, in January, India recorded a 10.3% increase in oil demand, a fourth straight monthly gain. 
Total oil consumption expanded at the fastest pace in 14 months to 16.9 million tonnes from 15.3 million tonnes a year ago."

144,2018-03-18,BPCL,"Indian Oil and BPCL may buy 26% stake each in gas utility GAIL India Ltd, paying the government over Rs20,000 crore each to become integrated energy firms

New Delhi: State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) may buy 26% stake each in gas utility GAIL India Ltd, paying the government over Rs20,000 crore each to become integrated energy firms.  
New Delhi: State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) may buy 26% stake each in gas utility GAIL India Ltd, paying the government over Rs20,000 crore each to become integrated energy firms. 
Following finance minister Arun Jaitley’s February 2017 Budget announcement of creating integrated oil majors, IOC and BPCL had submitted separate proposals to buy the government’s 54.89% stake in India’s biggest gas marketing and transportation firm, GAIL. 
A top source said since the government is not looking at actual merger of oil companies but only transfer of its ownership to a cash rich PSU, the best option would be to split the 54.89% holding in GAIL equally between IOC and BPCL. At Friday’s closing price of Rs440.85 a share for GAIL on BSE, the stake is worth close to Rs41,000 crore. 
In January this year, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) bought out government’s 51.11% stake in refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for Rs36,915 crore. But HPCL hasn’t been merged with ONGC and continues to remain a separate listed company with the same board. After the buyout, HPCL has become a subsidiary of ONGC, which gets up to two seats on the company board. 
The source said IOC and BPCL too can follow the same model and split the government’s stake equally among themselves. GAIL will become their subsidiary and will continue to operate as a listed company with an independent board. 
IOC and BPCL would get to appoint one director each on GAIL board. Like in case of ONGC’s acquisition of HPCL, the government would get to encash its holding in GAIL yet retain control over the company through IOC and BPCL. The source said the government has so far not taken any view on the proposals made by IOC and BPCL. 
How and to whom the stake would be sold will be decided after inter-ministerial consultations, he said adding that the option of splitting the stake equally among the two firms is one of the options that would be considered during such deliberations. 
Jaitley in the 2017-18 Budget had unveiled government’s plan to create integrated public sector oil majors “through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions"" so as that the merged company has “capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions"" and is “able to match the performance of international and domestic private companies?. 
Following this, ONGC expressed interest in taking over HPCL while IOC and BPCL said they keen on taking over GAIL to help add natural gas transportation and marketing business to their kitty. The government took up ONGC’s proposal first and the transaction was completed at January-end this year.
IOC, the largest oil refiner and fuel marketing company in the country, wanted to either acquire another refiner to add to its capacity or a gas company like GAIL. The firm feels it already has a fledging gas business in under-construction liquefied natural gas terminals, city gas distribution projects and gas marketing. 
And GAIL, the nation’s biggest gas transporter and marketing company, would complement that. BPCL, on the other hand, too has natural gas ambitions and wrote to the oil ministry saying GAIL was its number one choice for acquisition. It listed Oil India Ltd, the nation’s second largest exploration firm, as its number two choice. 
The government holds 66.13% stake in OIL, which at current market price is worth about Rs18,000 crore. Incorporated in August 1984 by spinning off gas business of ONGC, GAIL (India) Ltd owns and operates about 11,000-km of natural gas pipelines in the country. It sells around 60% of natural gas in the country. The source said the government has not taken any decision on the proposals sent by other PSUs."
143,2018-03-22,BPCL,"BPCL's Bharat Petro Resources Ltd, at present, is deliberating on what instruments it will be using to raise funds

Mumbai: Bharat Petro Resources Ltd (BPRL), the exploration and production arm of state-run oil marketing company Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) is planning to raise $600 million to refinance debt, two people aware of the development said.  
Mumbai: Bharat Petro Resources Ltd (BPRL), the exploration and production arm of state-run oil marketing company Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) is planning to raise $600 million to refinance debt, two people aware of the development said. 
BPRL has $600 million debt, which the firm accumulated across its acquisitions of global hydrocarbon assets.
“BPRL is planning to raise $600 million to refinance its existing debt. The firm is deliberating on what instruments it will be using to raise funds,"" said a banker, one of the two people mentioned above on condition of anonymity.
BPCL did not reply to an email sent on 19 March. 
As on 31 March 2017, BPRL recorded a consolidated income of Rs50.92 crore and a consolidated loss of Rs500 crore.  The consolidated loss was mainly due to interest cost on loans taken for investments in Russian assets and due to fair valuation of financial assets, the company’s annual report for 2017-18 said. 
“BPRL has a string of projects lined up next financial year and the company has plans to hit the market to raise funds for these projects at regular intervals. A consortium of banks would be participating in refinancing its debts,"" said the second person mentioned above. 
On 10 January, the board of BPRL passed a resolution to enhance the company’s authorised share capital from the present  ₹ 3,000 crore to  ₹ 5,000 crore.
BPRL has participating interest in 22 blocks, of which 12 are located in India and 10 overseas. Seven of the 12 blocks in India were acquired under different rounds of New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) and five blocks were awarded under the discovered small fields bid round in 2016. 
Of the overseas blocks, six are in Brazil and one each in Mozambique, Indonesia, Australia and Timor Leste. BPRL and its consortia have a total of 25 discoveries in respect of blocks held in five countries i.e. Brazil, Mozambique, Indonesia, Australia and in India. Most of the blocks of BPRL are in advanced stages of exploration, appraisal, pre-development and production."
142,2018-03-29,BPCL,"Indian Oil, HPCL and BPCL are among companies that have bid for the NHAI's ambitious highway amenities scheme titled 'Highway Village'

New Delhi: State-run fuel retailers Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) are among companies that have bid for the National Highways Authority of India’s (NHAI) ambitious wayside amenities programme, according to two government officials aware of the development. 
New Delhi: State-run fuel retailers Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) are among companies that have bid for the National Highways Authority of India’s (NHAI) ambitious wayside amenities programme, according to two government officials aware of the development.
Under the scheme titled “Highway Village"", the government plans to develop 150 sites along national highways with a range of amenities such a helipads, motels, village haats or markets, shopping malls, electric charging stations, fuel stations, parking for cars, buses and trucks, restaurants and food courts, dhabas for truckers, repair shops and dormitories for drivers.
The scheme pushed by transport minister Nitin Gadkari is aimed at improving long-distance driving experience for commuters and providing employment to local youth, as also a platform to local farmers to sell their produce. 
The scheme is aimed at encouraging frequent breaks during the journey and reduce driver-fatigue related accidents, with the helipads expediting evacuation for medical emergencies and providing disaster relief.
According to the scheme, these villages will be developed on the public-private-partnership (PPP) model wherein NHAI would be providing land for the proposals, while the investments will be made by the bidders. In response to the Request for Proposals (RFPs) for 34 Highway Villages floated last year, NHAI received bids for 21 sites, with a majority of them placed by state-owned oil marketing firms.
“The first bundle comprised 34 sites out of which bids were received for 21 sites last week. Most of these are being eyed by OMCs,"" said a government official on condition of anonymity. He added that the technical and financial bids will be opened in next one month to take a final decision and the sites are likely to see an investment of around Rs500 crore in total.
Another official who also didn’t want to be identified and is part of the bidding process confirmed the development.
State-owned oil firms are exploring ways to diversify revenues as a means to combat crude oil price rise and narrowing refining margins. According to analyst reports, the marketing margin on auto fuels for the third quarter was at Rs0.27 per litre, the lowest since diesel deregulation in mid-October 2014.
Queries emailed to NHAI, IOCL, HPCL and BPCL remained unanswered.
According to the government’s plans, the sites shortlisted in the first bundle are in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar. Areas with more than 5 acres will be developed under the brand name of “Highway Village"".
“The private entity will be assisted in getting free access permission to the facility, assistance in land use conversion etc. along with co-branding, logo and signage, and will be required to sign a service-level agreement with NHAI,"" the government said in a 3 August statement.
NHAI has been trying to raise resources to fund its ambitious work programme by monetizing publicly funded, operational national highways through the toll-operate-transfer (ToT) model. The state-run authority is also planning its first equity-funding model for its upcoming expressway and economic corridor projects, auctioning them before they are built as reported by Mint on 19 March. 
“Shri Gadkari called on individuals owning land along national highways to come forward and participate in the endeavour. The minister said that these wayside amenities would not only benefit the highway commuters, but also the local population. The sites will promote local handloom and handicrafts by having shops selling these items. Local cuisine can be made available at the eateries in these site,"" the statement added.
NHAI’s greenfield expressway projects under the Rs5.35 trillion-Bharatmala programme aims at building 34,800km of national highways. Out of this, 9,000km will be economic corridors and 800km expressways, many of which are greenfield projects.
“About 20 lakh people will get direct and indirect employment from these sites. All in all, the development of these sites will bring economic development to the villages along the highways,"" the statement said."

140,2018-04-10,BPCL,"Indian Oil will set up Bio-CNG plants in North India, and BPCL and HPCL will replicate the model in rest of the country

Mumbai: State-run oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corporation (IOC); Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) plan to spend nearly Rs10,000 crore to set up Bio-CNG plants across India to promote clean fuel and reduce the country’s fuel import bill, two people aware of the development said. 
Mumbai: State-run oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corporation (IOC); Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) plan to spend nearly Rs10,000 crore to set up Bio-CNG plants across India to promote clean fuel and reduce the country’s fuel import bill, two people aware of the development said.
The Bio-CNG plan will be detailed in the national biofuels policy to be released this month, the people added. 
The policy will detail a Rs1 trillion investment opportunity under Waste-to-Wealth projects.
Bio-CNG is a purified form of biogas with over 95% pure methane. It is similar to natural gas in its composition (97% methane) and energy potential. 
While natural gas is a fossil fuel, Bio-CNG is a renewable form of energy produced from agricultural and food waste.
“IOCL is taking the lead in terms of setting up plants for generation of Bio-CNG so that farmers can supply biomass instead of burning it. IOCL will buy back Bio-CNG and sell the same,"" said one of the people aware of the development, the first person quoted above. 
He spoke on condition of anonymity as he is not allowed to speak to the media.
He added that while IOCL will execute the plan in north India, BPCL and HPCL will replicate the model in western, southern and eastern India.
This January, IOCL signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Punjab government to set up biogas and Bio-CNG plants in the state.
IOCL will be setting up a plant in Haryana shortly. In 2018, 42 plants will become operational which will be scaled up to 400 over the next three to four years. 
“These Bio-CNG plants would be multiple in number and would be phased evenly so that 100-150 tonne per day rice straw becomes available. Converting bio-mass to compressed biogas and bio-CNG will not only help curb the menace of stubble burning but also create additional income for farmers,"" said the second person mentioned above, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
IOCL, BPCL and HPCL did not reply to Mint’s queries sent on 2 April. 
Bio-CNG is seen as an environment-friendly alternative to diesel.
It can be transported either through injecting fuel into the CNG grid or by trucks or in cylinders from the filling stations. The average cost of setting up a Bio-CNG plant is around Rs40-50 crore.
“In the long run, the overall oil bill, which is pinching us is a challenge. And on the other hand, we have so much of renewable biomass available that we can definitely look at reducing the imports by 20% if not more by 2022,"" said the first person quoted above. 
The cost of production of Bio-CNG could be around Rs23 a litre, cheaper than compressed natural gas (CNG), petrol and diesel.
“Today we are using CNG which is imported. Bio-CNG will easily replace that. This will save us nearly Rs40,000 crore in imports. Bio-CNG replaces both, diesel and petrol. Also, the static consumption for generating power, in remote places, today either consume diesel or CNG. But Bio-CNG can replace these too,"" added the second person quoted above. 
India currently imports one-third of its energy requirement. The world’s third-largest crude oil importer targets halving its energy import bill by 2030. 
The government aims to increase the contribution of gas in India’s energy mix to 15% from the current 6.5%. 
At present, fossil fuels meet 95% of India’s transportation fuel requirement."
138,2018-04-11,BPCL,"Apart from holding on to diesel and petrol price hikes, Indian Oil, HPCL and BPCL will have to bear a loss of Rs1 per litre of fuel

New Delhi: India’s state-run oil retailers have been asked not to increase retail diesel and petrol prices and absorb a part of the losses due to the recent recovery in global crude oil, people with knowledge of the matter said. 
New Delhi: India’s state-run oil retailers have been asked not to increase retail diesel and petrol prices and absorb a part of the losses due to the recent recovery in global crude oil, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Companies, including Indian Oil Corp., Bharat Petroleum Corp. and Hindustan Petroleum Corp., will have bear a loss of up to Rs1 per litre on sale of diesel and petrol, the people said asking not to be identified as the matter is private. Shares of Indian Oil fell as much as 7.6% in Mumbai, the most since November 2016 in intraday trading, while HPCL lost as much 8.3%.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration wants to keep petrol prices under check to shore up popular support ahead of a series assembly elections this year. The South Asian nation, which imports more than 80% of its annual crude oil requirement, wants to see prices at about $50 a barrel in order to manage its finances better, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said in an interview.
A cut in excise duty on fuel prices is unlikely due to sluggish revenue collections on the back of a botched rollout of the goods and services tax, the people said. The oil ministry has been asked to prepare subsidy payments at different price points in case of a further run up in oil prices.
HPCL is not aware of any directive from the government to absorb a part of the losses from higher crude prices, the company’s chairman, M. K Surana, said on the sidelines of the International Energy Forum in New Delhi.
While Modi has reaped the benefits of the biggest price crash in a generation since coming to power 2014, oil is recovering as the government gears up for elections in 2019. Since hitting a low of $ 27.1 per barrel in 2016, Brent crude is currently trading around $70 level. Bloomberg

139,2018-04-12,BPCL,"The refinery, an equal joint venture of Indian Oil, HPCL, BPCL and Saudi Aramco, will process 1.2 million barrels of crude oil per day and 18 mtpa of petrochemical products

New Delhi: The world’s biggest oil producer, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., or Saudi Aramco, will partner with a consortium of Indian state-run companies to set up the largest global refinery and petrochemical complex at Ratnagiri in Maharashtra at an investment of $44 billion. 
New Delhi: The world’s biggest oil producer, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., or Saudi Aramco, will partner with a consortium of Indian state-run companies to set up the largest global refinery and petrochemical complex at Ratnagiri in Maharashtra at an investment of $44 billion.
Saudi Aramco will also enter fuel retailing in India, where energy demand is expected to grow at 4.2% over the next 25 years.
The equal joint venture between the Indian firms and Saudi Aramco will process 1.2 million barrels of crude oil per day and 18 mtpa of petrochemical products. The Indian consortium comprises of Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and will hold a 50% equity stake in the joint venture. Of this, the Indian Oil’s share will be half, with the rest equally shared by HPCL and BPCL.
The kingdom is fully committed to provide for the principles of energy access, sustainability and security as articulated by India, said Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid Al-Falih at the signing of a memorandum of understanding for the 60 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemcials Ltd (RRPCL).
Apart from investing in the project, Saudi Aramco will also supply crude oil to the project, ensuring supply security. This assumes significance given India’s energy needs are primarily met through imports, with the country importing 214 million tonnes of crude oil in 2016-17. In future, Saudi Aramco may also induct a strategic partner by divesting its 50% equity stake in the project.
Assurance and (energy) security will only increase with this investment, added Khalid Al-Falih who is in India to attend the 16th International Energy Forum Ministerial (IEF—16) inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday.
Saudi Aramco’s India play has been in the works for some time now and follows Modi’s visit to the Gulf kingdom in 2016. It marks a reset in the changing global energy architecture, with buyers at the centre of oil majors’ future growth plans. India is the world’s third-largest energy consumer after the US and China.
“We see India as a priority destination for our investments,"" said Khalid Al-Falih.
The Indian government is seeking Saudi Arabia’s participation in grassroots refinery projects coming up in the country, Mint had reported on 3 May 2007.
India’s petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the relationship between India and Saudi Arabia has progressed from the level of a buyer and seller to that of a “strategic partnership"".
The development also assumes significance in the backdrop of a supply cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec)—of which Saudi Arabia is a prominent member—and Russia triggering a rally in global crude oil price. This has resulted in the cost of Indian basket of crude, which averaged $47.56 a barrel in 2016-17, touching $63.80 (average price) in March 2018, according to information from Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell. Extreme volatility has marked crude oil prices, which had touched a record $147 per barrel in July 2009.
The Indian basket represents the average of Oman, Dubai and Brent crude.
“The strategic partnership brings together crude supply, resources, technologies, experience and expertise of these multiple oil companies with an established commercial presence around the world,"" the Indian government said in a statement."
137,2018-04-13,BPCL,"Currently, lack of clarity on gross under-recoveries and sharing of the unmet under-recoveries remains. This uncertainty clouds investor sentiments

Reports that the state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) will absorb about Re1 a litre of the increase in diesel and petrol prices sent these stocks plummeting on Wednesday. 
Reports that the state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) will absorb about Re1 a litre of the increase in diesel and petrol prices sent these stocks plummeting on Wednesday.
OMCs are Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC).
It will be a blow to these companies if this happens. In the run-up to the Gujarat assembly elections at 2017-end, OMCs hadn’t fully passed on the impact of higher crude oil prices to consumers. With many state elections lined up this year and the general elections in May 2019, who’s to say there won’t be a repeat.
An excise duty cut will hurt government revenues at a time when revenues from the goods and services tax aren’t impressive. Give this, getting the OMCs to share some of the burden of high oil prices is easier.
Nitin Tiwari, analyst at Antique Stock Broking Ltd, calculates, year-to-date, on an average, OMCs have clocked in a marketing margin of about Rs3-3.1 a litre on petrol and diesel sales. “The same is higher than the range of Rs2-2.5 a litre observed in the past, thereby leaving cushion for adjustment to a normalized level should a need arise,"" said Tiwari.
Profits of these companies will be impacted, though analysts say there were not expecting the current high margins to sustain.
Still, investors are on shaky ground. On an accrual basis, Jefferies expects under-recoveries on LPG and Kerosene for FY19 at about Rs36,000 crore, much higher than the budget provision of Rs20,800 crore. The risks of fiscal slippage and an uncertain outlook in a pre-election year may prompt the government to limit its subsidy payout bringing back the spectre of unmet under-recoveries, wrote analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 11 April. “In the recent past, the bulk of this unmet under-recoveries has devolved on upstream state-owned enterprises who shared ~92% of the unmet under-recoveries in FY09-16 but this could now change,"" said Jefferies.
In recent years, OMCs have improved their profitability substantially. It is possible, therefore, that unmet under-recoveries that remained post government subsidies are shared more equitably, like they were in FY03-08 when OMCs shared 46% in aggregate, say analysts from Jefferies.
While how this plays out remains to be seen, currently, lack of clarity on gross under-recoveries and sharing of the unmet under-recoveries remains. This uncertainty clouds investor sentiments. As Ajay Bodke, CEO & chief portfolio manager PMS, Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd, points out, the mere overhang and fear of a dreaded government diktat in the event of further flare-up in crude prices would make investors wary of the OMC stocks till the 2019 general elections."

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has approached three state-run oil marketing companies to buy petroleum coke (petcoke) from them to fire its $5 billion petcoke gasifiers, according to three officials aware of the development. RIL operates the world’s biggest refining complex in Jamnagar, Gujarat, where two adjacent plants can process about 1.4 million barrels of oil a day. It has 10 petcoke gasifiers of which four, in the domestic tariff area (DTA), are already in the ramp-up phase, and the remaining six, in the special economic zone refinery, are likely to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of this fiscal.

It has 10 petcoke gasifiers of which four, in the domestic tariff area (DTA), are already in the ramp-up phase, and the remaining six, in the special economic zone refinery, are likely to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of this fiscal.
“RIL has approached us seeking additional petcoke as RIL’s own petcoke generation capacity will not suffice to meet its gasification needs. We are deliberating on the matter,"" a senior official of one of the oil marketing companies said on condition of anonymity.
Reliance Industries, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) did not reply to an email sent on 2 August.
“We produce 6.5-7 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of petcoke and once the gasifiers are running at full capacity, we would be running the entire petcoke for gasification. We also may require more of either coal or petcoke. Once we are running at 100% capacity, we would stop importing LNG,"" said V. Srikanth, RIL’s joint chief financial officer. 
With refineries processing heavier crudes, the production of petcoke at refineries is peaking and gasification of petcoke has become an efficient and environmentally safe way of utilising it.
RIL wants to completely eliminate its petcoke production of 6.5 million tonnes a year, generated from two of its cokers. Petcoke gasification will help it produce 23 mscmd (million standard cu. m a day) of synthesis gas or syngas which will reduce intake of regasified liquefied natural gas (R-LNG) at its refineries. Syngas is a fuel gas mixture of primarily hydrogen, carbon monoxide and, very often, some carbon dioxide.
RIL takes around 8 million standard cubic metres a day (mscmd) of R-LNG for its refineries which it eventually plans to bring down to 2 mscmd. 
In an emailed response, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd said, “Reliance Industries has expressed interest in procuring petcoke from Indian Oil but discussions in this direction have not yet been initiated."" Indian Oil sells petcoke to customers from industries like cement, lime kiln and steel. The company plans to install the facility of petcoke gasification in one of its refineries, for which a study is in progress, it said.
Petcoke gasification will help RIL lower the refinery’s energy costs and boost its gross refining margin (GRM), which is what a refiner earns by turning a barrel of crude oil into refined products.

“We expect the entire project (with 10 gasifiers) will be fully commissioned by March 2019. In addition, RIL’s flexibility to switch crude sourcing toward heavier crudes should raise its competitiveness versus global peers. Every $1 per barrel change in GRMs affects FY19-21e earnings by 5-6%,"" said HSBC Research in a report dated 29 July.
However, if the government decides to ban import of petcoke, owing to environmental concerns, RIL can use 15-20% coal instead of petcoke. “RIL will require 25% of its petcoke requirements once gasifiers are fully ramped up. However, the company does not see a ban on imports for gasifiers and cement kilns,"" said Morgan Stanley Research in its report dated 30 July."

Singapore: India’s Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd will keep a secondary unit at its 120,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) Mumbai refinery offline for at least two months following a fire last week, two industry sources said on Friday.
When contacted, a BPCL spokesman could not immediately confirm the duration of the shutdown, saying that a decision will be made in one to two days.
The middle distillates-making unit, a 6,000-tonnes per day (tpy) hydrocracker, was shut since 8 August following a fire that left 40 people injured.
Middle distillates are namely, gasoil and jet fuel/kerosene.
“The hydrocracker is expected to be shut for two to three months but BPCL is unlikely to import gasoil due to high domestic inventories,"" said one of the two sources. 
India on Friday banned the import of petcoke for use as fuel, but said shipments for use as feedstock in some industries was allowed.
Usage of petcoke, a dirtier alternative to coal, in the energy-hungry country has come under scrutiny due to rising pollution levels in major cities.
“Import of Petcoke is allowed for only cement, lime kiln, calcium carbide and gasification industries, when used as the feedstock or in the manufacturing process on actual user condition,"" the directorate general of foreign trade said.
As the world’s largest consumer of petcoke, India imports over half its annual petcoke consumption of about 27 million tonnes, mainly from the United States. Local producers include Indian Oil Corp, Reliance Industries and Bharat Petroleum Corp.

The OMCs seek applications through newspaper advertisements whenever they plan to open outlets in new locations.
However, since 2014, the OMCs have not set up new outlets as rules were amended, but not approved by the oil ministry. This prevented them from issuing new advertisements.

“The three OMCs are doing this exercise together for the first time. In 2014, we undertook a ‘de-duplication’ exercise to ensure we do not set up retail outlets in each other’s location to avoid eating into each other’s business,"" said the IOCL official quoted above.
Retail outlets opened after 2014 were largely through the revival of old stations or restoration of dealerships that had been terminated because of non-performance since 2005.
Under the new dealership guidelines, the educational qualification for a dealer has been lowered to 10th pass from the previous requirement of being a graduate and the upper age limit has been raised to 60 years from 45.

Ltd, corrosion of its pipelines has been an enduring problem. The country’s largest fuel retailer spends  ₹  70,000 per kilometre annually to maintain its pipeline and with the task of monitoring a 13,000km-long network, the cost of keeping the pipeline network healthy is mammoth.  
Mumbai: India’s top state-run fuel retailers are collaborating and often investing in startups to solve several vexing issues facing the companies. For Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, corrosion of its pipelines has been an enduring problem. The country’s largest fuel retailer spends  ₹  70,000 per kilometre annually to maintain its pipeline and with the task of monitoring a 13,000km-long network, the cost of keeping the pipeline network healthy is mammoth. 
That cost is expected to fall, thanks to a startup funded by state-run Indian Oil.
“We have a startup which claims it can develop a novel material composition which when applied on an operating pipeline heals corrosion,"" said S.S.V. Ramakumar, director for research and development at Indian Oil.
For state-run Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), shutting down its refinery stack (the refinery chimney) and checking underground pipelines has become easy through a startup that uses drones.
“Chimneys and stacks need to be inspected regularly. You raise scaffolding, somebody climbs up to inspect and it is shut for two to three days. However, an industrial drone which is pre-programmed, flies around boilers and stacks assessing the status of these assets. It then brings data which is useful in making reports,"" said A. Krishnaswamy, BPCL’s digital and strategy head. 
There are underwater drones too which help BPCL monitor single buoy moorings and underwater pipes for leakages and repairs. 
“We would like to fund startups so we can also use them to solve our operational issues. We give them funding, assistance, and provide them a platform to test their technology and also contract with them for services,"" said Krishnaswamy.
India’s state-run fuel retailers began to fund startups after the government launched a start-up policy in January 2016. Last October, 10 oil companies formed a  ₹ 320 crore fund to support 30 startups in various sectors including fuel and waste. Most of these startups are in the technology space.
So, while BPCL went to incubators and accelerators at technology institutes, Indian Oil and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) launched an online portal wherein entrepreneurs can register their ideas. Last year, which was the first edition, Indian Oil received 250 entries of which only 11 ideas made the cut.
“Our startup funding is to establish the proof of concept. We are not selecting existing and operational startups but fresh ideas,"" said Ramakumar of Indian Oil.
“All our ideas we are going to categorize in two—those that help our day-to-day business (business process re-engineering) and those which will actually bring in some innovative process or products required by the oil and gas industry (technology process re-engineering),"" Ramakumar said.
He said Indian Oil is “now nurturing these ideas, providing them grants and helping them establish the proof of concept"".
“Once they can be matured into a business proposition, Indian Oil may deal with the incubatee in any of the following three ways: one, if they wish to commercialize, Indian Oil will let them go and build their product and brand; secondly, if the idea is good for Indian Oil and we see enough business potential in this, we would propose to pick up stake in the prospective startup entity. Thirdly, if the idea is too compelling, we might propose an acquisition of the start-up, if the entrepreneur agrees to sell,"" he added.
DeTect Technologies, an Internet of Things startup from IIT Madras’s incubation cell has given BPCL a transducer which, when wrapped around a pipeline, constantly measures the heat and temperature and pressure in the pipeline and keeps sending digital signals continuously. “So pipeline monitoring becomes extraordinarily easier,"" said Krishnaswamy at BPCL.
The oil marketers have, for years, been battling the issue of fuel theft from their vast pipeline network.
Executives at Indian Oil, BPCL and HPCL said they lost a combined  ₹  450-500 crore in crude oil and finished products in the last decade. But the companies are more worried about safety of their pipelines than financial losses caused by oil theft.
“Addressing crude oil or product theft has been a challenge for us. Thieves do not realise that when they weld a contraption arrangement on the pipeline to draw crude derivatives, they cause oil leakage which could result in fire leading to loss of lives and property. Technology from startups will help us address such issues too,"" said an official at one of the oil marketing companies.
HPCL’s launched It’s HPOpen Innovation Challenge advertisement last year and shortlisted six start-ups for funding from the first round of applications, according to its annual report for 2017-18. 
The company has allocated a startup fund of  ₹  25 crore to support innovation and upcoming entrepreneurs by funding projects from new or early stage start-ups in areas associated with its business."

New Delhi: With the US sanctions on Iran looming, Moody’s Investors Service has estimated an around $500 million decline in earnings for Indian state-owned refiners, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), on account of substituting crude oil imports from the Persian Gulf country.
President Donald Trump pulled the US out of a historic 2015 accord with energy-rich Iran, which was signed to curb the Islamic Republic’s nuclear programme in return for ending sanctions. The development assumes significance for India, which is the world’s third largest oil importer and had been ramping up supplies from Iran, its biggest supplier after Iraq and Saudi Arabia.
According to Moody’s, India is one of the biggest buyers of Iranian crude, accounting for about 30% of total crude exports from Iran during April to August 2018. Also, India imported 220.4 million metric tonnes (million MT) of crude oil in the year ended March 2018, out of which about 9.4% was from Iran. Between April and August 2018 India imported 94.9 million MT of crude, of which about 14.4%, was from Iran. Exports to India accounted for 21% of Iran’s crude oil exports in the fiscal year ended March 2018 and 30% from April to August 2018.
“Assuming a complete cessation of imports of crude oil from Iran and a $3 per barrel negative impact on earnings because of that on the barrels being substituted, we estimate the total decline in earnings for the Indian refiners to be about $400-$500 million, against combined EBITDA of about $10 billion for the three largest state-owned Indian refiners in the fiscal year ended March 2018,"" Moody’s Investors Service wrote in its report.
This comes in the backdrop of Brent crude oil spot prices breaching the $80 per barrel mark, and retail diesel and petrol prices in India continuing to set new records every other day. Transportation fuel prices touched a new high on Thursday, with diesel and petrol prices reaching  ₹ 74.24 per litre and  ₹ 83 per litre in Delhi, respectively. Petrol and diesel now cost  ₹ 90.35 per litre and  ₹ 78.82 per litre, respectively, in Mumbai.
The cost of the Indian basket of crude rose to $80.96 a barrel on 26 September, according to the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell. To this, taxes at the central and state levels are added, besides dealers’ commission, to arrive at the retail price. The Indian basket represents the average of Oman, Dubai and Brent crude.
“We expect Indian refiners will either have to significantly reduce or completely stop importing crude oil from Iran over the next month or so. As a result, Indian refiners will increase dependence on the remaining Middle Eastern crude oil suppliers (mainly Saudi Arabia and Iraq). Iranian crude is usually sold at a discount of up to $2-$4 per barrel to other Middle Eastern crude oil grades. Iran’s national oil company, National Iranian Oil Company, also subsidizes the freight costs for crude oil delivery and offers extended payment terms to buyers,"" the Moody’s report added.
India’s increasing dependence on other West Asian suppliers comes at a time when customers from Asia are seen paying a so-called Asian premium owing to this dependence as compared to prices paid by the US or the EU. India has consistently pitched for a price and terms correction. Also, India has proposed a consumers’ collective comprising major energy buyers: China, India, Japan and South Korea.
However, despite demands of a rollback of the hike in fuel prices by opposition parties, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government has not intervened in the price rally. Any rally in global crude oil prices will affect India’s oil import bill and trade deficit. Every dollar increase in oil prices will push up the import bill by around  ₹ 10,700 crore on an annual basis.
Of the  ₹  8 trillion of excise, service tax and GST collected last year, petroleum and petroleum products accounted for 36%, says CARE Ratings. Petroleum products accounted for around 20% of states’ tax revenues.
Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Wednesday said reducing taxes won’t have any lasting impact due to the continuing volatility in crude prices. He added that the government was looking at ways to offer relief to consumers.
“The basic problem is that crude prices are volatile. The effect of any measures, including reduction in VAT by the states and the excise duty by the Centre, will not last long due to the volatility in crude prices,"" he told reporters."

The announcement came just before the market closed on Thursday, driving refiners’ stocks down. The S&P BSE Energy Index tumbled 6.7%, the most since August 2015, while each of the three state-run refiners closed more than 10% lower.
HPCL, BPCL and IOC shares came under heavy selling pressure today also, falling as much as 29%. HPCL slumped as much as 25% to  ₹ 165.45 per share on BSE, Indian Oil fell as much as 24.9% to  ₹ 105.65 and BPCL dived 28.9% to  ₹ 239.
The imposition of price controls is an “unequivocal negative"" that underscores “high political risk"" associated with state-owned enterprises, Citigroup’s analyst Saurabh Handa wrote in a note.
The move would reduce pretax profit of state-run oil marketing companies by a combined  ₹ 4,500 crore in the year ending March 31, according to people with knowledge of the matter. On an annualized basis profit before tax may drop by about  ₹ 9,000 crore based on current sales volumes, they said, asking not to be identified as they aren’t authorised to speak to the media.

Mumbai: Shares of upstream and downstream companies eroded nearly  ₹ 1.25 trillion of their market valuation in the last two sessions after government asked the state-run companies to absorb  ₹ 1 for every litre of petrol and diesel sold. Upstream companies are so far exempted from the subsidy burden despite expectations of windfall gains in earnings on higher crude and rupee deprecation. Analysts, however, belive that the government may consider a higher dividend from upstream companies to compensate the revenue loss due to a cut in excise duties.

At 9.50am, HPCL was down 21%, BPCL fell 21%, IOC 20%, ONGC 11%, Gail India 14%, MRPL 10%, and Chennai Petrolum Corp 8%.
“While the move is certainly benign for the consumer, the modality of the same has negative fallout for the OMCs. As if the covert price control (during elections) was not enough to dampen the investor sentiments, re-introduction of underrecovery, in our view, could further dent investment environment. We therefore re-caliberate our earnings estimates, trim our target prices & valuation multiples and downgrade OMCs to HOLD"", said Antique Broking firm
The government on Thursday cut prices of petrol and diesel by  ₹ 2.50 a litre each wherein it factored in an excise duty reduction of  ₹ 1.50 per litre and asked the OMCs to absorb   ₹  1 per litre on sales of petrol and diesel respectively.
“Earnings for India’s OMCs remain starkly uncertain, therefore, with little tailwind from refining either with margins trending lower y/y. We find little reason to recommend these stocks, therefore, even after their 28-48% fall YTD"", said Jefferies India in a note.
Analyst belives that the  ₹ 1/ltr burden on OMCs was a huge negative surprise as it is likely to be construed as reversal of the autofuel price deregulation policy by investors (and return of the erstwhile subsidy sharing mechanism), apart from the financial burden. Analyst estiamtes an annualised impact on OMC’s EBITDA of  ₹ 14000 crore while for fiscal year 2019 the impact would be  ₹ 7000 crore.
“In a scenario where we mechanically cut our petrol/ diesel marketing margin assumption for the OMCs (IOCL, BPCL, HPCL) by Rs1/L the impact on EPS is material, with scope for 25%-40% consensus earnings downgrades. Petrol and diesel combined account for slightly under two-thirds of OMC marketing volumes, and given existing thin EBITDA margins, this burden would leave segment EBITDA in the red"", said Macquarie Research in a 5 October note."

Singapore/New Delhi: Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, will supply Indian oil buyers with an additional four million barrels of crude oil in November, several sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The extra supply indicates a willingness by Saudi Arabia to increase crude supply to make up the shortfall once sanctions by the US on oil exports from Iran, the third-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), start up on 4th November.
India is Iran’s top oil client after China, though several refiners have indicated they will stop taking Iranian barrels because of the sanctions.
Reliance Industries Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp and Mangalore Refinery Petrochemicals Ltd are seeking an additional 1 million barrels each in November from Saudi Arabia, the sources said.
Three of the companies did not immediately reply to an email from Reuters seeking comment. Mangalore replied “no comments"" when contacted by email.
State-owned oil producer Saudi Aramco was not immediately available for comment.
Given their dependence on Iranian oil supplies, the Indian refiners are concerned about the loss of Iranian crude once the sanctions start and are seeking exemptions. Refiners in the country have placed orders to buy 9 million barrels from Iran in November.

New Delhi: State-run Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) will shut the crude distillation unit and the secondary units at its Kochi oil refinery that were installed last year for maintenance starting in December, a company official said on Tuesday.
BPCL will shut the crude unit with 210,000 barrels per day (bpd) of processing capacity along with the secondary units for about three weeks, said R. Ramachandran, BPCL’s head of refineries.
“It (this shutdown) is mandatory to inspect the new plant after you run it for a year. We will open up some of the critical equipment to see if things are intact,"" Ramachandran told Reuters on Tuesday.
BPCL last year installed new crude distillation capacity by combining an existing 90,000 bpd unit with 120,000 bpd of new capacity, raising overall distillation output at Kochi by 63% to 310,000 bpd.
The company also installed new secondary units as part of the expansion including a delayed coker, fluid catalytic cracker, vacuum gasoil hydro-treater, diesel hydro-treater, sulphur Recovery Unit, and hydrogen generation unit (HGU). All of those units will be shut during the maintenance, said Ramachandran.

International benchmark Brent crude oil futures struggle to claw back after plunging 7% on Tuesday, over concerns of a potential supply glut in 2019.
The sharp drop came after the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) said late Tuesday that crude oil output from seven major shale basins in the country was expected to hit a record of 7.94 million barrels per day (bpd) in December.
This coincided with a monthly report from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that the market would see a lower demand than expected in 2019.
A low crude oil price is a boost to India’s state-owned oil marketing companies and the economy in general which imports 80 percent of its crude oil requirement.
The three public sector companies were forced to take a price cut last month hurting their margins as the government wanted to cushion the impact of high crude oil price on the public.
Shares in Indian airline companies InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, Jet Airways Ltd and SpiceJet Ltd also rallied on Wednesday, as the surge in oil prices earlier this year had pushed them into losses.

New Delhi: Ahead of general elections, public sector oil companies plan to allot about 65,000 petrol pumps across the country to nearly double the existing retail network, officials said on Sunday.
Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) on Sunday issued advertisements for setting up 55,649 petrol pumps across the country.
“This does not include any sites in poll-bound states,"" HPCL’s state-level coordinator Vishal Bajpai told reporters here.
Assembly elections are on in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Mizoram and advertisement for these would be issued after polling is completed.
IOC, which already has 27,377 petrol pumps across the country, has advertised for setting up 26,982 more in states that are not going to polls. BPCL will add 15,802 outlets to its existing strength of 14,592 and HPCL would add 12,865 petrol pumps to its existing tally of 15,287.
Delhi has 390 petrol pumps and 170 more are to be set up, Bajpai said.
The poll-bound states may have some 9,000-10,000 sites, another official said.
The allotments will be done on relaxed guidelines which has lowered the educational qualification to 10th pass from 12th pass and graduate currently and the only essential requirement is ownership of the land where the pump is to be set up, Bajpai said.
This is the first time in almost four years that allotment of petrol pump sites is being advertised.
India currently has 63,674 petrol pumps, most of them with public sector firms. Nayara Energy Ltd, formerly Essar Oil Ltd, has the highest number of outlets in the private sector at 4,895 while Reliance Industries has 1,400 pumps. Royal Dutch/Shell has 116 outlets.
“For a fast-growing economy like ours, energy needs are growing manifold. PSU oil marketing companies are undertaking retail outlet (petrol pump) network expansion in tandem with the growth in demand for petrol and diesel. Retail sales of petrol and diesel are increasing at the rate of approximately 8% and 4% per annum,"" Bajpai said.
The expansion, he said, was being undertaken to meet the growing fuel needs and convenience of customers in emerging markets like upcoming highways, agricultural pockets and industrial hubs.
The retail outlet network in rural, remote and far-flung areas is also being expanded with the intention of increasing availability of products, predominantly diesel, ensuring quality and correct price to meet the rural agricultural demand and cater to people in remote areas, he said.
He said the process of dealer selection has been simplified by introducing online applications and doing away with the requirement of submitting voluminous documents in support of eligibility.
“Only the selected candidate would be required to produce the documents. Similarly, the eligibility norms have also been relaxed,"" he said. “Availability of suitable land at the advertised location/stretch is the most important requirement. Applicants without land can also apply, however, they are expected to offer land when called for,"" he added.
For the first time, the computerised draw of lots or bid opening would be held under the aegis of an independent agency to bring in more transparency."

The firms may end up opening no more than 15-20% of the 79,770 sites advertised last month in what is their first expansion of fuel retail network in four years, the officials said.

The firms may end up opening no more than 15-20% of the 79,770 sites advertised last month in what is their first expansion of fuel retail network in four years, the officials said.
Of the proposed number, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd () plans to open 37,971 retail outlets, and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) around 16,000 each. “Given the strike rate of around 15-20%, we may only be able to set up 13,000 petrol pumps in the next three years,"" said a senior official from an OMC, seeking anonymity. “A low strike rate is because getting permissions for land approval is the biggest impediment in setting up a petrol pump. More often than not, land is not approved and even if it is, in many cases it goes into litigations,"" the official said.
Indian Oil currently has 27,185 petrol pumps, HPCL runs 15,127 and BPCL operates more than 15,000.
“Setting targets is not a problem. The issue comes in selecting land parcels for them. After we advertise, our panel will check if the dealer land is at a feasible location. We will then seek a statutory no-objection certificate from over a dozen agencies involved. It’s only after that, that the process of setting up a retail outlet begins,"" said a second official from an OMC.
OMCs segregate retail outlets into A&B sites. An “A"" site outlet is where OMCs take land on lease and install the infrastructure. Dealer-owned “B"" site outlets are where the land and infrastructure are arranged for by dealers and OMCs only provide for the underground fuel storage tank, dispensing pumps and signages.
Analysts do not share the enthusiasm of OMCs in growing their retail presence.
“Given the government’s push towards a gas-based economy and advent of electric vehicles (EVs), fuel retail expansion may not be the best move. Though expanding compressed natural gas (CNG) and EVs may still be a few years away, petrol pumps are not set up with a short-term view,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst with a domestic brokerage.
City gas distribution (CGD) network is expected to see an investment of  ₹ 1.1 trillion over the next decade.
At present, 31 firms are developing CGD networks across 81 locations in 21 states and Union territories. The central government, which plans to provide 10 million piped natural gas (PNG) connections, has introduced stringent emission levels for vehicles and plans to develop green corridors to reduce the carbon footprint.
“CNG as an alternative fuel is showing significant growth, but keeping in mind the large number of existing vehicles that are operating on conventional fuels like petrol and diesel, it is expected that the demand for conventional fuels is likely to be sustained in the near future. Further, the option of adding CNG facility at fuel stations, as is being currently undertaken, is always available,"" said Indian Oil in an emailed response.
The OMCs plan to expand in Tier-II and Tier-III cities as well as rural areas. In urban areas, they have reached saturation point.
Under OMCs’ revised rules for dealership, introduced this year, the required educational qualification for a new dealer has been lowered to Class X from the previous requirement of being a graduate, and the age limit has been raised to 60 years from 45 earlier. The new dealerships would be alloted on the basis of a lottery system introduced in 2014 for more transparency. 
OMCs already follow the lottery system in allotting dealerships for liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG."

New Delhi: State-run Bharat Petroleum Corp will import 1 million barrels of Iranian oil in February after a gap of three months, with the nation’s overall purchases from Tehran remaining at 9 million barrels, three industry sources said.
The United States in early November granted India a six-month waiver from sanctions on Iran’s oil exports.
Under the agreement, New Delhi must restrict its Iranian oil purchases to 1.25 million tonnes, or 9 million barrels.
BPCL and Hindustan Petroleum Corp will lift 1 million barrels each of Iranian crude oil in February, the sources said. HPCL this month resumed purchases of Iranian oil after a gap of six months. The company halted Iranian oil purchases in July after its insurance company refused to provide cover for the crude because of US sanctions, although its chairman said HPCL may resume buying Iranian oil under sanctions waivers.
Indian Oil Corp, the country’s top refiner, will lift 5 million barrels of Iranian oil in February, the same as this month. Mangalore Petrochemicals Ltd will buy 2 million barrels compared with 3 million barrels this month, the sources said.
An IOC official had previously said his firm would lift 180,000 bpd - the full volume contracted under an annual deal with Iran for this fiscal year ending March 31, 2019.
India recently exempted rupee payments to the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) for crude oil imports from a steep withholding tax, paving way for pending dues to be cleared.

“BPCL is expanding its refining and petrochemicals operations. The fundraise will help the company meet the capex requirements for its expansion plans,"" said the first investment banker. The bonds have been issued Baa2 rating by Moody’s. The tenure of the issue could, however, not be ascertained immediately. “The affirmation of BPCL’s ratings reflects our expectation that its credit profile will remain constrained by high shareholder returns despite its improving operating profile,"" said Vikas Halan, senior vice president, Moody’s, adding that the company may moderate its dividend payments or adjust its capital spending over the next 12-18 months to improve its credit metrics.
Moody’s also expects BPCL to pay an interim dividend of  ₹ 14 per share next month. The quantum of dividend is expected to be higher in the absence of a share buy-back.
“Although BPCL, unlike some of the other state-owned oil and gas companies in India, has not yet announced a share buyback, Moody’s expects the company will need to pay an interim dividend in February 2019 of at least  ₹ 14 per share, equal to the interim dividend paid in February 2018,"" the agency said. 
On 13 December, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL) had announced a buyback of over 297.6 million shares, besides offering an interim dividend of  ₹ 6.75 per equity share. The same month also saw Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) announcing a buyback for 1.97% of its equity shares.
Moody’s added that in the absence of a share buyback and given an increase in BPCL’s reported net profit, the interim dividend payable could be even higher than Moody’s current estimates. The agency expects that any such a move may further weaken the company’s credit metrics. Last August, BPCL had paid dividend of  ₹ 7 per share for 2017-18.
The rating agency expects BPCL’s debt/earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) to remain at elevated levels of 2.7-2.8 times in the fiscal year ending March 2019, compared to 2.8 times in 2017-18. 
BPCL’s operating profile has improved since the completion of its Kochi refinery in 2018. Its total refining throughput increased to 37.7 million tonnes in fiscal 2018 from 34.4 million tonnes in the previous financial year. It has also upgraded its refinery to use a higher proportion of heavy crude oil, positioning it well to benefit from the increasing differential between light and heavy crude oil."

ERNAKULAM,
		             CHENNAI :
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday went on an inauguration spree of big-ticket projects and carried out high-decibel political attacks against opposition parties in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, in what could be seen as the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) efforts to rally voters in the run-up to the general elections.
Tamil Nadu and Kerala are among the few states where the saffron party has negligible presence, despite being on a rollercoaster ride across the country—a trend, if not turned around, could become detrimental to the BJP’s chances in the 2019 general elections. In Tamil Nadu, the BJP has one MP, but has warmed up well to the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and superstar Rajinikanth, even while remaining independent. In Kerala, the party does not have an MP, and an unstable alliance partner in Ezhava leader Vellappally Natesan. However, it is targeting at least five seats on the back of the recent Sabarimala agitations.
In Tamil Nadu’s Madurai, Modi laid the foundation stone for a new  ₹1,264 crore All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), which is being propagated as a big boost to the state’s public healthcare services. In Kerala’s Kochi, he inaugurated a  ₹16,504 crore expansion project of the Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), which is the single-largest investment made by the centre in Kerala, and has made BPCL-Kochi the biggest public sector refinery in India.
However, both events were punctured with protests, which took some sheen off the Prime Minister’s presence. Modi faced criticism under the hashtag “#GoBackModi"", which started trending ahead of his Tamil Nadu visit, besides witnessing black flag protests by various political outfits on the ground. Earlier in the day, Kerala chief minister and BJP’s principal rival Pinarayi Vijayan of the CPM said that “some migratory birds have started arriving and that too very often"", like a harbinger of bad times, apparently in reference to Modi since it was his second visit within a fortnight to Kerala.
Unfazed by the backlash, Modi supported the protests following the entry ban of women of menstruating age in the Sabarimala hill shrine. The BJP was behind the protests after the Supreme Court annulled the custom in September 2018, and blamed the ruling Communists for supporting the apex court order.
“I fail to understand why the Communists are undermining our culture and civilization, which has stood the test of time over centuries. The (Congress-led United Democratic Front) UDF, too, is just like the communists. Their doublespeak has been exposed,"" Modi said, claiming BJP as the sole defender of the faith for the devotees of the hill shrine.
“Neither the Congress nor the communists have any concern for women enforcement. If they did, they would not be opposing the NDA government’s efforts to end triple talaq. India has had so many women chief ministers. Has there been even one communist woman chief minister?""
Modi also gave political colour to his government conferring the Padma award on Friday to Nambi Narayanan, the celebrated Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientist, who had to undergo trial after he was wrongfully accused of spying by the state police.
“It is an honour that our government had the opportunity of conferring the Padma Award on Nambi Narayanan. For them (Congress and Communists) science can be abused as spying, for us science is a matter of national pride,"" Modi said.

AHMEDABAD :
Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) today sought the liquidation of the assets of Essar Steel India Ltd at a bankruptcy court. The public sector oil company objected to ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan, which, it said, sidestepped dues to operational creditors like BPCL.
The financial creditors had voted in favour of the resolution plan of ArcelorMittal on 25 October. ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan envisages an upfront payment of  ₹42,000 crore to lenders and an additional  ₹8,000 crore towards capital expenditure.
A clutch of operational creditors have challenged the committee of creditors and the resolution professional’ decision to accept ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan. Standard Chartered Plc has also approached the NCLT as a dissenting financial creditor so that it can be heard before the tribunal decides on ArcelorMittal’s bid.
Earlier during the hearing, the counsel for the committee of creditors had told the NCLT that after assessment by three independent valuers they had found the creditors would not get more than  ₹15,000 crore if Essar Steel went in for liquidation.
Challenging this, the counsel for BPCL today said there was no reason to believe that Essar Steel would not receive more than  ₹15,000 crore rupees if it went into liquidation. He said the shareholders of Essar Steel, led by the former promoters, had already expressed their intent to pay the entire debt of about  ₹55,000 crore as compared to the  ₹42,000 crore offered by ArcelorMittal as part of its resolution plan.
The BPCL counsel said if Essar Steel went into liquidation, an official liquidator would invite bids and there was a chance that BPCL might recover its dues in full. According to the contention of ArcelorMittal and the resolution professional, BPCL, as an operational creditor seeking  ₹500 crore for supply of liquefied natural gas, was not entitled to any money as part of the resolution plan.
About a week ago, the NCLT had turned down Essar Steel shareholders’ bid to regain control over the company. Meanwhile, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on Monday directed the NCLT Ahmedabad bench to take a final decision on ArcelorMittal's resolution plan for Essar Steel by February 11, failing which it would call records and pass an order accordingly."
109,2019-02-04,BPCL,"As compared to other crudes processed, Iranian crude brings more value in terms of gross refining marginLast November, US offered a six-month waiver to eight countries allowing them to import oil from Iran until the end of March

MUMBAI :
State-run refiners Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) are hoping the US will extend a waiver on sanctions imposed on Iran to let them continue crude oil imports from the Middle East nation, said two officials at the oil marketing companies.
Last November, the US offered a six-month waiver to eight countries, including India, allowing them to import oil from Iran until the end of March.
Under the agreed terms, the oil companies (OMCs) must restrict their purchases of Iranian oil to 1.25 million tonnes, or 9 million barrels a month. “Of course, we would want an extension of the waiver. It is absolutely worth taking Iran crude beyond April.
As compared to other crudes that we process, Iranian crude brings more value in terms of the gross refining margin,"" said the first official cited above, requesting anonymity.
Iran is the third-largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and India is the world’s third-biggest oil importer.
India’s imports from Iran totalled about $11 billion between April and November 2018, with crude oil comprising about 90%.
BPCL and HPCL said earlier this month they will, after a gap of three months, import 1 million barrels of Iranian oil each in February and March.
Reuters reported earlier in January that IOCL, India’s top refiner, will lift 5 million barrels of Iranian oil in February, the same as this month. Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) will buy 2 million barrels, compared with 3 million barrels this month.
IOCL, BPCL and HPCL did not reply to emailed queries till press time. 
“It is very difficult for any refinery to generate a differential of 70 cents only by crude processing. So, if any crude supplier is offering that differential to us, we would take it. Besides, there is free shipping, an extended credit period and they deliver the cargo to your port,"" said the second official quoted above.
 India had imported about 22 million tonnes of crude oil from Iran in 2017-18, and had plans to raise the same to about 30 million tonnes in 2018-19.
 But, with the waiver in the picture, oil companies were forced to cut imports from Iran and scout for other sources. 
Another waiver will bring relief to IOCL and MRPL, two major Iranian oil consumers."

State-owned oil and gas companies in India are set for their lowest spending in the last four financial years with the interim budget proposing a capital outlay of  ₹93,639 crore for 2019-20 .
The spending is less than this fiscal year’s outlay of  ₹94,438 crore, while it was  ₹1.32 trillion in the previous year. In 2016-17, it was  ₹1.04 trillion, while in 2015-16 it was at  ₹97,223 crore, according to the Expenditure Budget document.
Among the state-owned oil marketing companies, the capital outlay for Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) rose 13% and 7%, respectively, the document showed.
While HPCL has an outlay of  ₹9,500 crore in 2019-20, compared with  ₹8,425 crore in 2018-19, BPCL will spend  ₹7,900 crore, as against  ₹7,400 crore this fiscal year.
The largest oil marketing company, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL) however, has seen its capital outlay drop marginally to  ₹25,084 crore in 2019-20, from  ₹25,582 crore in 2018-19.
“Most of the capital intensive projects for these companies are already implemented, so going forward, capital expenditure for large projects would be at the end of the project cycle and immediate outflow will be limited. Currently, capital expenditure is limited to de-bottlenecking projects and laying of pipelines and expanding marketing network,"" said K. Ravichandran, group-head, corporate sector ratings at rating agency ICRA.
Ravichandran said exploration and production companies such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) have a separate outlay for acquiring oil and gas blocks.
The capital outlay for ONGC, India’s largest exploration and production company, fell 0.26% from  ₹33,007 crore in the current fiscal year to  ₹32,921 crore in 2019-20. The capital outlay for its overseas arm, ONGC Videsh Ltd is down 15% to  ₹5,161 crore from  ₹6,111 crore.
The capital expenditure for OIL is at  ₹4,105 crore for 2019-20, marking a 7% increase, from  ₹3,849 crore to be spent in the current financial year. The spending, however, is being curtailed at a time when the government wants an increased focus on ramping up domestic output to curb rising oil imports.
For state-run natural gas utility GAIL India Ltd, capital outlay is at  ₹5,339 crore, down by 9.5% against  ₹5,902 crore in 2018-19."
106,2019-02-12,BPCL,"BPCL will sign a sales and purchase agreement with Mozambique LNG1 Company to bring the gas to IndiaA final investment decision or FID for the block in Mozambique is expected to be ready by this April

MUMBAI :
State-run Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) will bring to India the much-awaited natural gas from its Rovuma basin in Mozambique in the next five years, said officials aware of the development.
BPCL will bring in 1 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) of gas from the Rovuma field where its upstream arm, Bharat Petro Resources Ltd (BPRL) holds 10% stake.
""BPCL will sign a sales and purchase agreement with Mozambique LNG1 Company to bring the gas to India. BPRL holds 10% stake in Mozambique LNG1 company which was formed to market the gas,"" said a company official aware of the development. Mozambique LNG1 Company is owned by the Mozambique Offshore Area 1 partners.
The Offshore Area 1 is operated by Anadarko Mozambique Area with a 26.5% stake. Other partners include National Oil Company Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos (15%), Mitsui E&P Mozambique Area 1 (20%), ONGC Videsh (16%), Bharat PetroResources (10%), PTTEP Mozambique Area 1 (8.5%), and Oil India (4%).
A final investment decision or FID for the block in Mozambique is expected to be ready by this April, said the chairman of Mozambique’s national oil company ENH on the sidelines of Petrotech. He said that the project would be financed in a debt-to-equity ratio of 60:40 but this ratio could evolve as the partners progress on the project.
An FID for the block allows the partners to unlock value in one of the world’s biggest gas discoveries, estimated at 75 trillion cubic feet. To put it in perspective, this would be more than the combined resources of all the gas fields in India.
“One of the Indian companies has already signed a share and purchase agreement for the gas. The first molecules will come to India by 2024,"" ENH chairman Omar Mitha said adding that the location of Mozambique is strategic for Indian imports of natural gas and it does not have the geopolitical challenges of the Middle East.
The Anadarko-operated Mozambique LNG project will be Mozambique’s first onshore LNG development, initially consisting of two LNG trains with total nameplate capacity of 12.88 MTPA. The LNG trains will initially require around $18-20 billion, of which $14 billion will be raised in loans.
""BPCL has aggressive plans to expand in the natural gas segment. So they will use the Mozambique gas and may market it too,"" the first official quoted above added.
In 2017-18, BPCL formed a wholly owned gas subsidiary Bharat Gas Resources Ltd with a view to focus on natural gas as a separate business.
BPCL may also revive its plan to build a 1-to-3 mmtpa imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal to cater to the rising domestic demand for the clean fuel. This could be expandable to 5 mmtpa later.
Given the government’s focus on increasing the share of gas in India’s overall energy mix and the development of infrastructure in terms of LNG terminals and pipeline connectivity, the demand for LNG is positive over the medium to long term, encouraging companies including BPCL, Indian Oil Corp. and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd to expand their natural gas businesses. All three are promoting city gas distribution, setting up LNG terminals and marketing natural gas.
Besides, a Supreme Court ban on polluting fuels for industrial use has also fuelled LNG demand. During April-October 2018, natural gas consumption rose 17.1%. During the same period, LNG imports increased 12.7% due to higher demand and lower domestic production."

The one-day Additional Offering Period (AOP) managed by ICICI Prudential AMC launched on 14 February saw a subscription of over 14 times, said an official statement.
“The offering attracted an aggregated subscription amount of approximately  ₹50,000 crore from all categories of investors. The total number of applications received stands at approximately 1.25 lakhs,"" said a statement issued by ICICI Prudential AMC.
The sale is part of the government divestment target of  ₹80,000 crore set for this fiscal. The government has so far raised  ₹22,900 crore through the Bharat-22 ETF. While  ₹14,500 crore was raised in November 2017, another  ₹8,400 crore was raised in June 2018.
The central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) that are part of the ETF include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco.
Other constituents include Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Only three public sector banks — SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda — figure in the Bharat-22 index.
Also, the government’s strategic holding in Axis Bank, ITC and L&T, held through Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India (SUUTI), has been put in the ETF basket.

India’s consumption of petroleum products increased by 6.4% year-on-year in January, based on data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell. This looks decent, considering that growth was relatively soft in the previous five months, and also keeping in mind that in January 2018, consumption had increased by a robust 12.4% year-on-year. So the growth in January has come off a relatively high base.
Demand growth was seen across various products but, going ahead, it will be interesting to watch whether the overall demand growth seen in January persists. “With oil prices rising again, economic activity soft and a stiff base awaiting, growth may moderate in the coming months,"" point out analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd.
For state-run oil marketing companies, margins remain critical from an earnings perspective. Here, the benchmark Singapore gross refining margin has dropped further from the $4.3 per barrel seen in the December quarter. “With retail prices likely to pause ahead of elections, auto fuel marketing margins could normalize down from their all-time highs, especially if crude prices spike further,"" said Jefferies India.
These factors may weigh on sentiments for oil marketing companies including Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd."

MUMBAI :
Two Indian issuers deferred bond sales on Wednesday as borrowing costs surged, after tensions between India and Pakistan escalated in one of the most serious confrontations in decades.
State-run Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency withdrew plans to raise as much as  ₹10 billion ($140 million) from 10-year bonds because rates were higher than expected. State-controlled refiner Bharat Petroleum called off a plan to sell at least  ₹5 billion of five-year securities, saying the market was choppy and not conducive to fund-raising at the moment.
India’s credit markets could do without the added strains just now. Shock defaults by shadow lender Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. and scrutiny of non-bank financing firms have constrained access to funds, frustrating the government’s efforts to deepen the local debt market.
Average yields on top-rated three-year Indian rupee corporate notes issued by state companies jumped 41 basis points to 8.55 percent Wednesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the sharpest increase since July 2013.
The tensions could also test appetite for new new dollar bond sales planned by Indian firms that had enjoyed a revival at the start of 2019.
Pakistan said on Wednesday that its fighter jets shot down two Indian aircraft, in a significant escalation of tensions a day after India said its Air Force had bombed a terrorist training camp inside Pakistan.

New Delhi: In a boost to India’s energy security efforts, Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (Adnoc), the state-run oil company of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), on Monday awarded the exploration rights for the Abu Dhabi Onshore Block 1 to an Indian consortium of state-run Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Indian Oil Corp Ltd (IOC).
This comes in the backdrop of India’s evolving energy security architecture, with the UAE supplying 6% of India’s crude oil imports. With three million barrels per day of crude oil production, Adnoc is the world’s 12th-largest producer. The UAE is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), which accounts for around 83% of India’s total crude oil imports and 40% of global production.
“The award has been endorsed by Abu Dhabi’s Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) and represents a further deepening of the fast-growing UAE-India energy relationship as well as the continued expansion of Adnoc’s strategic partnerships with those who can provide access to key growth markets for the company’s crude oil and products,"" Adnoc said in a statement on Monday.
Adnoc is looking to expand its presence in India by investing in refining and petrochemical projects and stocking more crude oil in India, the world’s third-largest energy consumer. India’s worry over crude oil prices stems from its energy needs being primarily met through imports.
“In the past 12 months, ADNOC has enhanced its strategic energy links with India, a key growth market for crude, refined and petrochemical products. It is the only foreign energy company, so far, to partner in India’s strategic petroleum reserves programme. It is also a stakeholder in one of India’s largest refinery and petrochemicals projects, to be constructed on India’s west coast. In addition, in February 2018, for the first time, an Indian consortium of three companies, comprising ONGC Videsh, Indian Oil Company and Bharat PetroResources Ltd, a 100% subsidiary of Bharat Petroleum Corporation, was awarded a 10% participating interest in Abu Dhabi’s offshore Lower Zakum Concession,"" the statement said.
Mint reported on 21 June about Adnoc’s plans to pick up 25% in the $44-billion refinery and petrochemicals project in Maharashtra, post which Saudi Aramco and Indian Oil Corp Ltd will hold 25% each in the project, while 12.50% each will be held by Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL).
“The consortium will hold a 100% stake in the exploration phase, investing up to AED 626 million ($170 million), including a participation fee, to explore for and appraise oil and gas opportunities in the block,"" the statement added.
This comes at a time of growing uncertainties in the global energy market. International crude oil prices have been hit by factors such as the moves made by the Opec and Russia to cut supplies. Also, the US has imposed sanctions on state-run oil firm Petr leos de Venezuela SA, and President Donald Trump has pulled the US out of a 2015 pact with energy-rich Iran, which was signed to curb the Islamic Republic’s nuclear programme in return for ending sanctions.
“This award highlights the important role of energy cooperation in strengthening the strategic relationship between the UAE and India,"" UAE’s minister of state and Adnoc Group CEO Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber said in the statement."

1)""After four straight sessions of healthy gains, the Indian markets took a breather, ending the session in the red, largely led by profit taking, as investors preferred to remain cautious ahead of RBI monetary policy,"" said Jayant Manglik, president of retail distribution of Religare Broking.
2) The RBI will announce its interest rate decision tomorrow, due at 11:45 am, amid expectations of a cut in key lending rate by another 25 basis points to boost economic activities.
3) However, the central bank's inflation outlook will be closely watched in view of Skymet's forecast of below normal monsoon and rising oil prices. 
4) ""Tomorrow’s RBI monetary policy would provide further direction to the markets. Soft inflation and muted domestic macro data have increased probability of a rate cut. Further, monetary policy committee’s commentary on future interest rate and inflation trajectory would be closely monitored by the market participants,"" said Jayant Manglik of Religare Broking.

7) On the downside, Nifty has strong support at 11,200-11300, said Sahaj Agrawal of Kotak Securities. ""On the higher side we would expect 12300-12500 on Nifty. Banking is expected to witness some profit-booking,"" he said.

98,2019-04-17,BPCL,"State refiners have not yet placed orders for Iranian oil for May, when the current waiver expires, pending clarity from the USOPEC and other producers including Russia have gradually tightened supply through 2019 to reduce a global glut

New Delhi: Indian refiners are increasing their planned purchases from OPEC nations, Mexico and the United States to make up for any loss of Iranian oil if the US enforces sanctions more harshly from next month, sources and company officials said.
All four Indian state-owned refiners that buy Iranian oil are confident of securing additional barrels from other producers, officials from the companies told Reuters.
The state refiners have not yet placed orders for Iranian oil for May, when the current waiver expires, pending clarity from the United States.
India's Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) have tapped Iraq to make up for Iranian oil, while Indian Oil Corp (IOC) has signed its first annual contract with US suppliers and raised supplies from Mexico.
""There will be no supply constraints. The supply can come from both OPEC and non-OPEC nations like the US,"" said M.K. Surana, chairman of Hindustan Petroleum Corp, which purchased up to 1.5 million tonnes per year of Iranian crude in 2018-19.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers including Russia have gradually tightened supply through 2019 to reduce a global glut. OPEC and its partners may not renew the curbs when they expire after June because of the risk of over-tightening the market.
IOC, India's top refiner and Iran's biggest Indian client, will cut Iranian oil imports to 6 million tonnes, or about 120,000 barrels per day, in the 2019-20 period from 9 million in 2018-19, and has raised the optional volumes it can buy from other producers to 2 million tonnes, a company official said.
""Our optional quantities under term deals are higher than last year. We have optional contracts with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other suppliers... They will supply more if we want,"" the official said, adding his firm would also buy more US oil if required.
IOC also hopes to buy 1.5 million tonnes of Mexican oil in 2019, compared with 1 million tonnes last year, the source said.
Officials from state-owned National Iranian Oil Co did not immediately reply to requests for comment on the Indian refiners' plans to purchase less Iranian crude.
No watertight plan
Refinery officials said their 2019-20 crude import strategy was not contingent on Iranian oil, and was more flexible than in previous years.
""We don't have a watertight plan for the year, we have optional quantities so that it is possible to find replacement if any country goes out for any reason,"" said an MRPL official.
During previous sanctions against Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iraq raised supplies to India to grow market share in the country, the world's third-biggest oil consumer and importer.
Last year, MRPL signed its first annual deal with Iraq to buy 1.5 million tonnes of Basra oil in 2019.
BPCL has signed a deal to buy 5 million tonnes of Iraqi oil in 2019 compared with 1.5 million tonnes in 2018, its head of refineries R. Ramachandran said, adding his company is considering buying more oil from South America.
BPCL recently bought Brazilian crude and plans to buy Mexican oil as well, he said.
""We have a strategy with and without Iran,"" he added.

97,2019-04-26,BPCL,"Struggling to meet budget targets, the government had asked PSUs to pay second interim dividend as well as undertake share buybackThe higher shareholder returns will put more pressure on the financial profiles of the companies, Fitch said

NEW DELHI :
Financial profiles of state-owned oil marketing companies such as Indian Oil Corp (IOC) may be at risk in the near to medium term due to pressure from the government to increase shareholder returns, Fitch Ratings said Friday.
Struggling to meet budget targets, the government had in the just concluded fiscal (2018-19) asked cash-rich PSUs to pay second interim dividend as well as undertake share buyback. The share buybacks, wherein a company repurchases its shares and extinguishes them, helped the government get money while maintaining its control over them.
""The oil marketing companies (OMCs) IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and upstream entity Oil India Ltd (OIL) declared high interim dividends of 67.5 per cent to 110 per cent of the face value of their shares, and undertook share buybacks in the financial year ended March 31, 2019,"" Fitch said in a statement.
These, it said, were likely to have been driven by pressure from the Indian government to increase shareholder returns to shore up the weak fiscal position and finance promises made ahead of elections in April and May 2019.
""The higher shareholder returns will put more pressure on the financial profiles of the companies, which have large investment plans for the next two years,"" Fitch said.
IOC and BPCL are in the process of upgrading and expanding their refineries to meet the deadline for producing ultra-clean Euro-VI grade fuel by April 2020, and improving downstream integration in petrochemicals. OIL plans to augment its domestic production and reserves.
In addition, BPCL and OIL are likely to invest in an upcoming Mozambique LNG project after a final investment decision on the project, which is expected in the second half of 2019, it said.
""OIL has limited headroom in its current standalone credit profile of 'bbb-', which may be revised down if weakening of its financial profile results in net leverage (adjusted net debt/operating EBITDAR) exceeding 2.5x. However, in such an event, OIL will benefit from one notch of support from the state, resulting in the final rating remaining unchanged at 'BBB-',"" the rating agency said.
In comparison, IOC and BPCL have more headroom in their 'bb ' standalone credit profiles and are likely to remain resilient even in case of any modest weakening in their financial profiles.
The OMCs additionally face the risk of government intervention in fuel prices during the elections.
""However, Fitch does not foresee any significant impact on OMCs' financial profiles on account of fuel price controls. We expect the OMCs to make up the losses in the subsequent period during the year in such an event,"" the statement said.
Fitch said it believes OMCs will continue to revise prices daily to reflect the market prices over the medium term.
The ratings on IOC and BPCL are equalised with that of the state, in line with Fitch's Government Related Entities Rating Criteria.

MUMBAI :
Indian equity markets fell to a near six-week low, tracking losses in global markets spooked by escalation of trade tensions between the US and China.
The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex fell 0.84% to close at 38,276.63 points, while the NSE Nifty 50 index declined 0.87% to end at 11,497.90 points. Both indices fell for the fifth consecutive session, their longest-losing streak since February, to end at a level last seen on 27 March.
Investors remained cautious even as China confirmed its vice-premier would attend trade talks in Washington this week, in a sign that Beijing is battling to keep negotiations on track after the Donald Trump administration ratcheted up pressure with plans to raise tariffs on Chinese goods from Friday.
“The Indian markets have been on shaky ground for the past couple of days, driven by ambiguity associated with the US-China trade negotiations and less-than-inspiring corporate earnings. The election season is another major variable that markets are watching closely,"" said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, senior vice-president and head of research (Wealth), Centrum Broking Ltd. Investors are also assessing the quality of earnings in the quarterly results season. Early March quarter earnings indicate that the Indian economy has slowed and the much awaited revival in earnings growth may be delayed—developments that are likely to deepen investor unease about stock valuations and a more than two-month-old stocks rally.
Analysts are concerned that the markets are likely to be volatile till the election results are out.
The National Stock Exchange’s (NSE) India VIX index, which tracks investors’ perceptions of volatility has risen 21.3% so far in May, indicating that the turbulence in equity markets will continue. On Tuesday, the index stood at 26.47, the highest in 44 months. India VIX had risen 27.01% in April and is up 65.48% this year so far. The volatility index typically has an inverse correlation with the markets. The index at elevated levels indicates that investors are expecting a major correction at least over the next month.
To be sure, the India volatility index is not the only one to rise to new highs. The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s (CBOE) volatility index has risen 29.84% in the last two sessions.
“Federal elections have historically resulted in short-term volatility. MSCI India has moved 11-38% in the 40 days around results. Indian equity volatility has already decoupled from emerging markets (EM) and should subside post the event. After a strong catch up in March, MSCI India has underperformed EM in April, as oil prices rose. A favourable electoral outcome could lead to a small catch up trade in India, we think,"" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch in a note on 3 May.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch thinks that equity markets prefer a stable government, one that has visibility of five years in power and that does not have to make to too many compromises to coalition partners.A sure-footed government is likely to contain fiscal slippage near term, it added.

MUMBAI :
State-run Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) will be reporting their Q4 numbers today. Though inventory gains, super-normal marketing margins and forex gains (stronger INR) during the fourth quarter mean a spectacular quarter for these companies, weak refining margins and debt may weigh on the quarterly performance.
Analysts expect these companies to report higher earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) led by  ₹3.75 a litre of increase in marketing margins for auto fuels amid a quarter-on-quarter decline in global product prices and a sharp $14 per barrel increase in end-period crude price.
""Overall while refining margins have fallen further quarter-on-quarter, we would highlight that the environment is particularly negative for the more complex refiners. Separately, the implied marketing margins for the diesel and gasoline surged in 4Q, as the companies did not fully pass on the global product price fall, hence we would expect marketing to be another strong quarter,"" said JP Morgan in its report dated 7 April.
Jefferies India expects BPCL to report net income of Rs38.9 billion and HPCL to report net income at  ₹30.3 billion, up 8-12 times quarter-on-quarter from a low base of the previous quarter, which was impacted by significant inventory and forex losses.
During the quarter, Singapore gross refining margins (GRMs) averaged at $3.2 per barrel for the fourth quarter, declining 25% quarter-on-quarter due to a crash in light distillate cracks. While GRMs recovered in Mar’19 to $4.5/bbl, they are still trending well below the five-year average ($6.4/bbl). ""Margin pressure appears to be largely driven by rising concerns on oil demand. We expect GRMs to improve closer to the onset of international maritime organisation regulations (expected from Jan’20), primarily led by a surge in diesel cracks which are currently subdued at $13 per barrel,"" said Emkay Research in its report dated 8 April.
Average Dated Brent price fell 7% quarter-on-quarter $63.1 per barrel in Q4. However, toward the second half, prices moved up due to Iranian/Venezuelan sanctions and OPEC cuts, and between the quarter ends, closed $14 per barrel higher, implying inventory gains for refiners.

90,2019-06-04,BPCL,"IOC will hold the remaining 50% stake in the LPG pipelineThis will be the longest LPG pipeline in the country

NEW DELHI :
Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) have joined in the country's longest LPG pipeline project being laid by state-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) to cater to cooking fuel needs of a fourth of the country's population.
BPCL and HPCL will take 25 per cent stake each in the  ₹9,000 crore project that involves laying of a pipeline from Kandla in Gujarat to Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, the companies said in separate but almost identical regulatory filings.
IOC, which had in 2016 proposed laying of the pipeline, will hold the remaining 50 per cent stake.
""IOC, BPCL, and HPCL have signed an agreement on June 3, 2019, for the formation of a joint venture company for implementation and subsequent operation of 2757-km long LPG pipeline from Kandla, Gujarat to Gorakhpur, UP,"" the filings said.
LPG will be imported at Kandla and some sourced from oil refineries on the west coast will be moved up north via Ahmedabad (in Gujarat), Ujjain, Bhopal (in Madhya Pradesh), Kanpur, Allahabad, Varanasi, and Lucknow (in Uttar Pradesh).
The pipeline will carry 6 million tonnes per annum of LPG.
This will be the longest LPG pipeline in the country. State-owned gas utility GAIL currently operates a 1,415-km line from Jamnagar in Gujarat to Loni near here. The line carries 2.5 million tonnes of LPG annually.
GAIL also has a 623-km Vizag-Secunderabad pipeline. IOC also has a 274-km pipeline from Panipat in Haryana to Jalandhar.
In pre-election project inauguration spree, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on February 24, laid the foundation stone of the pipeline project which will be built over the next four years.
The companies said the pipeline will supply LPG to 22 bottling plants along the route.
""The proposed pipeline will source product from Kandla and other LPG import terminals on West Coast and two refineries at Koyali in Gujarat and Bina in Madhya Pradesh and would directly link 22 LPG bottling plants in Gujarat (3), Madhya Pradesh (6) and Uttar Pradesh (13) owned by the three promoter companies,"" according to the filings.
In addition, the pipeline would feed LPG through road-bridging to an additional 21 LPG bottling plants in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh.
""The pipeline is expected to provide reliability in the supply chain of LPG. Besides economic benefit as compared to road transportation, movement of LPG by pipelines shall enhance safety as well,"" it said.
IOC has committed to using 3 million tonnes of capacity while HPCL and BPCL have committed 1.8 million tonnes and 1.7 million tonnes respectively. Reliance Industries wants to use the pipeline to transport 242,000 tonnes of LPG. These companies will source some LPG from their respective refineries.
IOC in its application to oil regulator Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) for laying the pipeline had in 2016 stated that: ""The demand for LPG is increasing consistently in recent years. Further, due to the Government of India's emphasis to make LPG - a clean and environmentally friendly fuel, available to every domestic household in the country, LPG demand is expected to increase at a much steeper rate in the coming year.""
It expected the deficit between what its refineries produce and the demand to reach about 10 million tonnes per annum by 2031-32. LPG demand has grown 10.5 per cent this fiscal with just about half of the 8.4 million tonnes consumed being locally produced.
""Considering the deficit figures for LPG, it is essential to import LPG at the nearest port and then transport it to the bottling plants through the most economical modes,"" IOC had said.
IOC is building additional import capacities at Paradip, Cochin, and Kandla to meet the increasing requirements of imports.
""West coast remains most suitable to import LPG to meet the demand of North and Central India. Though there is a common carrier pipeline to link West Coast to North ie Jamnagar-Loni pipeline, there is no LPG pipeline in existence or in construction to link West Coast to Central India or Eastern India,"" it had said.

89,2019-06-04,BPCL,"Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had in the past been critical of the nearly $6 billion spent by the Indian public sector firms to take 30% stake in the Rovuma Offshore Area-1 in MozambiqueThe government is vary of making the same mistakes and wants detailed scrutiny before any investment is approved

NEW DELHI :
An informal ministerial group that included Home Minister Amit Shah Tuesday reviewed state-run Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd's $2.2-2.4 billion investment proposal in a giant gas field in Mozambique as the government attempted to do deeper scrutiny of overseas investments to avoid the fiasco of the past.
Sources said others in the group were Foreign Minister S Jaishankar, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant and the review was a prelude to the investment proposal going to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) for formal approval.
Pradhan had in the past been critical of the nearly USD 6 billion spent by the Indian public sector firms to take 30 per cent stake in the Rovuma Offshore Area-1 in Mozambique during the Congress-led UPA regime, as falling oil and gas prices did not justify such huge investment.
He has also been critical of ONGC Videsh buying Imperial Energy of Russia after oil production lagged projections made at the time of USD 2.58 billion acquisition in 2008.
Sources said the government is vary of making the same mistakes and wants detailed scrutiny before any investment is approved.
Previously such decisions were vetted by ministerial grouping headed by the then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. But with Jaitley out of the government because of health reasons, the task has now been taken over by Shah, who many believe is now the No.2 in the government after Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
About 75 trillion cubic feet of natural gas has been discovered in the field and the same will be in phases converted into liquefied natural gas (LNG) for sale to overseas customers in ships.
In the first phase, USD 22-24 billion is to be spent by partners in Mozambique project to develop the field and build two LNG trains of 12.88 million tonnes.
BPCL holds 10 per cent stake in the project and its share of investment comes to USD 2.4 billion. Of this USD 800 million would be as equity - the single largest investment in an upstream project by the company ever. The remaining would be raised as debt.
Sources said this investment requires CCEA clearance and before that, the informal group vetted the plan.
BPCL Chairman and Managing Director D Rajkumar was also called at the review meeting.
The company board held an emergency meeting on Monday, possibly to approve the investment plan.
While Rajkumar did not answer multiple calls made to seek his comments, oil ministry was tight-lipped about the deliberations at the meeting.
BPCL had paid USD 703 million to buy the 10 per cent stake in Rovuma Offshore Area-1 concession in the Cabo Delgado province in northern Mozambique.
ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), had in 2013 bought Videocon's 10 per cent stake in the project for USD 2.475 billion and a similar stake from project operator Anadarko of US for USD 2.64 billion. It later gave 4 per cent out of this to Oil India Ltd.
Sources said the investment made commercial sense when gas prices were ruling in double digits but with their fall to USD 4-5, the project looked uneconomical.
However, all the three firms feel that the project is viable and they along with other partners in the project have sold as much as 9.5 million tonnes of LNG out of the initial production of 12.88 million tonnes. Two additional sale agreements are in the final stages of execution that, if executed, would bring the total volume to more than 11 million tonnes.
Last week, Anadarko Petroleum, the US independent energy group in the midst of a takeover battle, had stated that it was ready to make a final investment decision on the LNG project in Mozambique on June 18.
This might have triggered the emergency meeting of the BPCL board, they said adding OVL already has government approvals for investing upto USD 7 billion in the project.
Anadarko Moçambique Area 1, Lda, a subsidiary of Anadarko Petroleum, operates Offshore Area 1 with a 26.5 per cent working interest. Co-venturers include ENH Rovuma Area Um, SA (15 per cent), Mitsui E&P Mozambique Area1 Ltd (20 per cent) and PTTEP Mozambique Area 1 Ltd (8.5 per cent).

Brent crude prices rose on Monday, a day when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and other oil producers met in Vienna. Crude oil prices increased on expectations that Opec and its friends will extend their supply cuts.
Back home, expectations of crude oil prices firming up sent jitters across shares of state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs), taking them lower by 2.4-4.1%. OMCs include Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd. Typically, investors worry whether these companies will be able to pass on higher crude oil prices to end consumers.
Still, it’s not as if sentiments were rosy for these companies to begin with. Sure, the benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM) is estimated to have marginally improved in the June quarter on a sequential basis. For the March quarter, Singapore GRM stood at $3.20 a barrel. However, a slight gain in refining margin from its ultra-low level in the March quarter is hardly anything to get excited about. In any case, the year-on-year deterioration in performance is expected to have been huge in Q1 FY20.
“Owing to weaker refining environment, marketing and refining inventory losses, and tepid growth in domestic petroleum consumption, we expect OMCs to report 80-90% lower earnings year-on-year during 1QFY20,"" said Antique Stock Broking Ltd in a report on 26 June. Healthier marketing margins are the only saving grace, it added.
But investors cannot take it for granted that the marketing margin gains will continue to save the day, like they did during the March quarter.
“We doubt if OMCs will be able to sustain auto fuel margins at elevated levels even if crude prices were to remain steady or fall further,"" said a report from Kotak Institutional Equities on 27 June. “(They) are unlikely to sustain amid a constrained fiscal environment, which may warrant a hike in excise duties, and slower demand growth.""
Simply put, the above-mentioned factors are likely to keep investors on the edge in the near future. True, OMC stocks have recovered their early October losses, when the government had asked these companies to forego a portion of their marketing margins. However, they are subdued since the beginning of FY20, suggesting investors are adopting a cautious approach.
Going ahead, global refining capacity addition is expected to be more than demand, capping margin expansion. Diesel demand in China, a big market for the global oil industry, has taken a beating lately and that’s a dampener.
Nonetheless, investors will watch whether refining margins get a fillip a few months down the line, as the International Maritime Organization’s new regulations come into effect in 2020. Until then, appreciation in OMC shares may not be too refined."
87,2019-07-08,BPCL,"Stocks of oil marketing companies are down 3.5-6.4%, with IOC registering the sharpest fallAccording to analysts, IOC remains the most vulnerable in the pack

Mumbai: Shares of state-run Indian oil marketing companies (OMCs) extended their losses on Monday, after closing lower on Friday, the day the Union Budget was presented in Parliament.
OMCs comprise Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp Ltd (IOC). OMCs’ stocks are down 3.5-6.4%, with IOC registering the sharpest fall.
This is not without a reason though. There are some discomforting elements in the budget for OMCs. First, the government intends to look at the cumulative shareholding of the government and other government companies to arrive at the 51% minimum ownership limit. This provides the government a significantly higher headroom for disinvestment in energy PSUs going forward, analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report on 5 July. “This may act as a technical overhang on the stocks,"" added Kotak.
According to analysts, IOC remains the most vulnerable in the pack. IOC’s effective government stake, including stakes of other public sector units (PSUs), stands at 78.1%. For perspective: the government’s stake in IOC, excluding other PSU stakes, was 52.18% for the quarter ended 30 June, 2019.
Further, the government also increased the excise duty by  ₹1 each on the sale of petrol and diesel. Companies have passed on this increase to the end consumer. According to IOC's website, prices of petrol and diesel have been increased since the budget. However, an increase in the excise duty could well limit the room for expansion in the auto fuel margins of OMCs.
According to JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, this has the potential to increase CNG use given that petrol/CNG spread will increase. “However, we expect the impact on HPCL, BPCL, IOC to be negligible, given the lack of pan-India CNG network and the (vast) scale of operations of OMCs,"" the company said in a report on 6 July.
Nonetheless, the increase in excise duties is expected to fetch the government around  ₹28,000 crore. Even as government revenues increase, this also means that OMCs may not gain in terms of marketing margins in a lower crude oil price environment.
Note that these developments come at a time when investor confidence in OMCs is not its best. Refining margins are low and worse, outlook is expected to remain weak from a near-to-medium term perspective."
86,2019-07-11,BPCL,"Firms said to have given consent to move project to Roha, Maharashtra CM may announce shift in AugDelays in land acquisition pushed Ratnagiri Refinery project’s deadline to 2025 from 2022

MUMBAI :
The $44 billion refinery and petrochemicals project being implemented by Ratnagiri Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (RRPCL) may come up in Roha, a city in Raigad district of Maharashtra, according to two oil company executives aware of the development.
“The refinery may come up in Roha. The companies involved have given their consent. The Maharashtra chief minister is likely to make a formal announcement next month,"" said one of the officials cited above.
RRPCL is a joint venture between Saudi Aramco, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc), and three state-run oil marketing companies, Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp. (BPCL). Saudi Aramco and Adnoc will jointly own 50% of the refinery, with the remaining 50% being owned by the Indian oil companies.
The land bank for the project could be around 10,000 acres.
“We are assuming that the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation has secured the land this time and the transfer process would be smooth. The land that has been acquired and is being acquired are different pieces of land,"" said one of the officials mentioned above.
IOCL, HPCL, and BPCL did not reply to email queries till press time.
The Ratnagiri refinery project, announced in December 2015, was to be commissioned by 2022, but delays in land acquisition pushed the deadline to 2025.
Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had said in February that his government would relocate the refinery project, following protests by farmers and local landowners who feared the project may damage flora and fauna in the region, and affect Alphonso mango and cashew plantations.
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ally Shiv Sena had also backed the people opposing the refinery in the Ratnagiri district. Moving the project out of Ratnagiri was one of the conditions on which the Shiv Sena renewed its alliance with the BJP for the recently held Lok Sabha elections and the Assembly polls in Maharashtra to be held in October.
Raigad is located in the Konkan region of the state and Roha has a big industrial set up with the majority of the industrial units being chemical process industries.
“I think the political parties have come to a consensus that it’s best not to lose a refinery project of this scale. So, a decision on this is imperative,"" said the second official cited above.
The pre-feasibility study of the 60 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) refinery has been completed. The refinery will be capable of processing 1.2 million barrels of crude oil and produce 18 million tonnes per annum of petrochemicals. It will provide direct and indirect employment to up to 150,000 people.
The site of the project has been finalized but it may be announced later in view of the upcoming assembly elections, according to two Maharashtra government officials. A top Maharashtra government bureaucrat, however, said on condition of anonymity that Roha hadn’t been finalized “as yet"" but added that political factors may have delayed the decision. “Roha is a feasible site in many ways but the chief minister may not want to make that announcement right now as Roha is in Raigad district and some activists had earlier this month opposed the setting up of the project in Raigad, too, after the matter came up during the recent monsoon session of the state legislature. The chief minister may not want to create a fresh controversy at this stage though many factors do favour Roha,"" said the official."

NEW DELHI :
The government wants Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) to sell its golf courses in Ahmedabad and Vadodara in Gujarat, sending the company into a tizzy as one of them has two producing oil wells, sources said.
The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) has deemed golf courses and sports clubs owned by central public sector enterprises as 'non-core' assets and wants to monetise them.
A recent exercise by DIPAM to assess land banks and other non-core assets of government departments as well as central PSUs identified two of ONGC's golf courses in Ahmedabad and Vadodara, as also a sports club owned by Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) in Chembur, Mumbai.
Sources said the exercise identified only properties with real estate potential in prime cities while leaving out golf courses ONGC has in Ankleshwar in Gujarat and Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh. It also did not prioritise the grand golf course Oil India Ltd (OIL) has in Assam and one ONGC has in the North-East.
While the golf courses are used by executives of the PSUs for playing the leisurely game and hosting their business partners, ONGC had built the one in Ahmedabad after it struck oil in the city more than two decades back.
After the Motera field was discovered in Ahmedabad, ONGC was wary of encroachment around the oil wells in a city that was developing into a megapolis. So it built a golf course around the wells to ward off encroachers, they said.
The golf course identified by DIPAM has two producing oil wells, sources said, adding the field exists in a nomination block that according to rules ONGC cannot sell off or farm-out to outsiders.
The DIPAM diktat has sent the company into a tizzy as selling the golf course would mean the buyer also gets ownership of the two oil wells -- something which is not allowed as per rules, they said.
A recent meeting of officials from DIPAM, NITI Aayog, Oil Ministry and other departments gave its nod to monetising non-core assets of ONGC and BPCL. The proceeds will go to the PSUs and not to the exchequer, they said, adding the aim of the exercise is to rationalise resource utilisation in the public sector.
The field may be one of the 64 that ONGC has identified for involving private and foreign firms for raising output. But even in that exercise, ONGC is retaining the ownership of the field and its licence and only getting the private partner for raising output beyond a pre-agreed threshold.
The incremental output beyond the agreed baseline will be shared with the private or foreign partner, sources said, adding ONGC as the licensee would be responsible for statutory payments such as cess on the entire oil produced.

83,2019-08-06,BPCL,"Maharashtra government will decide on the price of the landInitially, the refinery was considered to include three crude units of 20 million tonnes each

New Delhi: India is looking at cutting capacity at its biggest oil refinery to match lower fuel demand projections and contain costs which jumped to $60 billion due to meeting stringent environment norms and relocation of the plant, top officials said.
State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) together with Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) plan to set up a 60 million tonnes refinery-cum-petrochemical complex on Maharashtra coast.
The refinery was projected to cost $44 billion (about  ₹3.08 lakh crore) but meeting stringent environment norms such as not producing petroleum coke, and relocation of the plant has jacked up the cost to an estimated $60 billion (about  ₹4.2 lakh crore).
""Supreme Court has mandated that you cannot sell petroleum coke and so to produce fuel without any such residue requires the use of best in class technology and will cost more,"" an official said.
Also, the unit will now be set up in Raigad district as land acquisition at a previous site in Ratnagiri district was stalled due to farmer protests.
""Land acquisition is a small cost in the project of such size. To say that the project cost has increased by $16 billion or  ₹1.12 lakh crore just because the site was relocated is absurd,"" he said. ""We would have paid some money for purchasing land at Ratnagiri. We would pay for land at Raigad too, which can be higher or lower, I don't know. It can be slightly more than Ratnagiri but it certainly cannot be over  ₹1 lakh crore more.""
Maharashtra government will decide on the price of the land, he said.
The consortium has engaged Engineers India Ltd (EIL) to do a cost study which should be out by next month, another official said.
Also, a detailed feasibility report (DFR) is being prepared that will detail the cost. Simultaneously, demand assessment is being done keeping in mind the government push for moving away from petrol/diesel driven vehicles and adopting electric vehicles (EVs).
The two will be married to arrive at an optimal refinery configuration, he said adding that the preliminary cost estimate going up to as much as $60 billion from $44 billion previously was primarily due to producing fuel meeting the stringent environment norms including those set by the Supreme Court.
""We will come up with different scenarios - should we do a 60 million tonnes unit in one go or should we do a 40 million tonnes refinery first and built another 20 million tonnes later if there is demand for fuel. Alternatively, should we build a 20 million tonnes refinery first and later scale it up depending on the demand,"" he said.
The refinery configuration would also depend on financing power of the companies involved.
The three PSU firms can put in  ₹30,000 crore to  ₹40,000 crore as equity and equivalent money would come from Saudi Aramco and ADNOC as they own 50% of the project. But the rest of the money will have to be financed from domestic sources or raised internationally, the official said.
""The final call will have to be taken by the government. Can banks finance about  ₹3.5 lakh crore in just one project?"" he said.
The project, he said, will have to be approved by the Cabinet and it will have to take a call on how much financing can be put in one project.
Another official said the DFR, which will include the type of products the refinery will produce, will not be ready before 2021 and it would take four-five years to build the project from thereon.
Initially, the refinery was considered to include three crude units of 20 million tonnes each that could produce petrol, diesel, LPG, aviation turbine fuel (ATF) and feedstock for making petrochemicals such as plastics, chemicals, and textiles.
While the project will give IOC a strong foothold in western states as catering to customers in the west and the south is difficult with its refineries located mostly in the north, for HPCL and BPCL this will increase their capacity as their Mumbai refineries cannot be expanded further.
Currently, the country has a refining capacity of a little over 232 million tonnes, against the domestic demand of 194.2 million tonnes in fiscal 2017. According to the International Energy Agency, this demand is expected to reach 458 million tonnes by 2040.
The country is the world's third-biggest oil importer. But the fuel demand is slowing due to a slowdown in the economy as well as a shift towards EVs.
IOC has 11 refineries with a capacity of 81.2 million tonnes, while BPCL runs four with a capacity of 33.4 million tonnes and HPCL operates three refineries with a capacity of 24.8 million tonnes.
Saudi's interest in the project can be seen as securing its future with a large customer as India has been moving away from Saudi to other markets like Africa, Latin America, and even the US.

81,2019-08-07,BPCL,"Demand for motor fuels has been rising at a fast clip, and though electric vehicles are touted as the future, classic old petrol pumps will be around so long as fossil-fuel vehicles are still road-worthy

Economic liberalization threw India open to competition in many fields, but what stayed conspicuously unchanged was the retail market for vehicle refuelling. Public sector petrol pumps have long dominated the landscape. Now, with Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) having struck a joint venture (JV) with the global energy major BP Plc, real competition in this market may finally be upon us. In five years, the JV partners expect to have 5,500 stations across India. Apart from regular outlets, the JV has plans for mobile fuelling units and the home delivery of fuels.
It’s true that RIL has had pumps of its own for many years, but nine-tenths of the 65,000-odd stations are still run by state-run oil companies such as Bharat Petroleum, Indian Oil and Hindustan Petroleum. Apart from their signboards, there is little to tell one station apart from another; service levels do vary, but only a bit. In a truly competitive market, players would woo consumers through price differentiation, superior service quality, or some combination thereof. The most efficient of the lot would have an advantage, incentivizing the rest to keep up. So far, it has been more of a fuel-dispensing business.
As RIL-BP expands its network and attains a sizeable scale, perhaps we will begin to experience the actual benefits of private sector participation in this business. Since the JV would have access to RIL’s efficient refineries, it could gain a competitive edge and force public-sector retailers to get into better shape. Demand for motor fuels has been rising at a fast clip, and though electric vehicles are touted as the future, classic old petrol pumps will be around so long as fossil-fuel vehicles are still road-worthy."
82,2019-08-07,BPCL,"RIL and BP to jointly set up 5,500 fuel retail outlets in the countryOil marketing companies — IOC, BPCL and HPCL — have decided to set up close to 80,000 fuel retail outlets in the next three years

Mumbai: To expand its fuel retail network to 5,500 outlets, Reliance Industries Ltd and BP may look at having a presence on the national highways, as it is an underserved segment in the country. With oil marketing companies planning to set up over 80,000 petrol pumps in the next three years, highways, according to officials, are the most coveted destination.
""If you look at the fuel demand scenario in the country, all companies are optimistic about the retail business. Presence on the highways will be attractive for them as it is an underserved segment,"" an OMC official said on the condition of anonymity.
Reliance Industries and BP's announced a new joint venture on Tuesday to set up 5,500 fuel retail outlets. Oil marketing companies — Indian Oil Corp Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) — have decided to set up close to 80,000 fuel retail outlets in the next three years.
But given the success rate of around 15-20%, OMCs may only be able to set up 13,000 petrol pumps in the next three years. A low success rate could be due to the cumbersome land approval process. More often than not, land is not approved and even if it is, in many cases, it goes into litigation.
OMCs plan to expand in Tier-II and Tier-III cities as well as in rural areas. In urban areas, they have reached a saturation point.
But RIL and BP's plan could also mean they would eat into the marketshare of OMCs. At present, OMCs dominate the domestic fuel retailing segment with 90% stake, while RIL along with Essar Oil and Shell India share the remaining 10%.
RIL, which had a 12% marketshare in fuel retailing in 2005, saw its marketshare slip to less than 0.5% in 2014, by when it had shut most of its petrol pumps after sales plunged as it could not match the subsidized price offered by state-run fuel retailers. RIL had spent  ₹5,000 crore in setting up 1,470 retail outlets between 2004 and 2006."

India has a plan to achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s goal of reducing the country’s dependence on energy imports, and it starts in the kitchen.
Three main state-run fuel retailers — Indian Oil Corp., Bharat Petroleum Corp. and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. — are looking to turn used cooking oil that might otherwise be discarded into biodiesel fuels. The retailers are seeking leftover cooking oils from bulk consumers such as hotels, restaurant and canteens across 100 cities, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said in New Delhi on World Biofuels Day.
The retailers will pay  ₹51 ($0.72) per liter to buy biodiesel derived from used cooking oil in the first year,  ₹52.7 in the second year and  ₹54.5 in the third. As one of the world’s top edible oil consumers, India uses about 27 billion liters of cooking oil each year, of which 1.4 billion liters can be collected to produce 1.1 billion liters of biodiesel, according to the ministry.
India is the third biggest crude oil consumer on the globe and meets about 85% of its needs through imports, exposing the economy to the risks of price and supply disruptions often caused by geopolitical tensions and trade wars. The prime minister has set a target to reduce such overseas energy purchases by 10 percentage points by 2022, through increased domestic output and greater use of alternative fuels.
Correction: An earlier version of this article erroneously mentioned in the third paragraph that the price is for used cooking oil when in fact the price is for biodiesel derived from cooking oil.

Mumbai: State-run Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd will spend  ₹8,000 crore to meet its capital expenditure this fiscal.
Of this planned layout, BPCL has already spent  ₹1,760 crore during the first quarter of this fiscal. It will spend  ₹300 crore for laying pipelines,  ₹2,500 crores towards marketing and research and development,  ₹200 crore towards gas business,  ₹800 crore for exploration and production and  ₹2,125 crore towards miscellaneous expenses.
The company will commission around 6,000 retail outlets over the next three years, that is approximately 2,000 retail outlets every year. Currently, BPCL has about 14,900 outlets.
""Focus area for these retail outlets is largely on the rural side plus on highways. We have already started commissioning outlets out of this new lot of letter of intents which we have issued. Around 60 outlets, we have already commissioned during the first quarter. So, we are progressing well in terms of expanding our retail network,"" BPCL management told analysts in a call post their first-quarter earnings.
The company does not expect any major competition from private players.
""In the last few quarters, we have not seen any major development happening on the front of private competition. While they have been growing in certain markets where they have already established, but rest we are not seeing any major development happening. We have to wait and watch for how future development fans out of the new alignment which has happened,"" BPCL told analysts.
BPCL added that though diesel demand has been muted over the last few quarters, registering a growth of only 0.5% in the first quarter of this fiscal, the company still plans to expand its fuel retail network.
""The auto sector is going through a very negative growth pattern. And till there is a revival in the manufacturing sector, we don't see that diesel growth will happen, which is a major chunk of the product which is being sold.

New Delhi: Air India owes three state-owned oil firms close to  ₹4,500 crore in unpaid fuel bills with payments being delayed by almost seven months, forcing retailers to snap supplies, senior officials said on Friday.
Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) on Thursday afternoon stopped jet fuel or ATF supplies to Air India at six airports - Kochi, Pune, Patna, Ranchi, Vizag and Mohali - over payment defaults.
""Air India has a 90 day credit period, which means they have to make payment for fuel they buy today by November 21. But Air India had not been making payments and the credit period was now over 200 days,"" a senior official at one of the three state-owned oil firms said.
Total unpaid dues to three fuel retailers stand at close to  ₹4,500 crore.
""They (Air India) offered to pay  ₹60 crore which is a drop in the ocean of what they owe,"" another official at one of the fuel retailers said.
IOC, BPCL and HPCL more than a week back jointly wrote to Air India seeking expeditious clearance of the dues, failing which they will be constrained to take action.
""Air India however failed to provide a clear roadmap to clear dues, forcing us to stop supplies,"" the official said.
Another official said Air India gets financial support from the government while for oil firms there is no such help.
""Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) pricing was deregulated in April 2002. And since then we have to run this business without any subsidy support from the government,"" he said.
At present, the government only provides some subsidy on LPG to help roll out its ambitious Ujjwala scheme of providing free cooking gas connections to poor. There is also a subsidy on kerosene supplied through the public distribution system (PDS).
A senior Air India official had on Thursday said that oil firms stopped fuel supplies to the airline at Cochin, Visakhapatnam, Mohali, Ranchi, Pune and Patna around 4 pm.
Air India spokesperson had on Thursday stated that ""in the absence of equity support, Air India cannot handle the huge debt service liabilities"".
""Our financial performance, however, this fiscal is very good and we are moving towards a healthy operating profit. The airline despite its legacy issues is performing very well,"" he had added.

New Delhi: Public sector oil marketing companies — Indian Oil Corp (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) — that have restricted aviation fuel supply to Air India Ltd at six domestic tier two airports due to non payment of dues to the tune of  ₹5,000 crore by the national carrier, will not extend this to other airports, two officials with OMCs told Mint.
""Our idea is not to cause inconvenience but claim our dues that run very high at the moment. Air India had been buying time for the past six months on some pretext or the other such as elections, parliament sessions etc. But we are not in a position to give any more extension now,"" said one of the officials mentioned above, who's an official with one of the above mentioned OMCs.
Public sector oil marketing companies had earlier suspended fuel supplies to the national carrier at six tier two airports — Cochin, Pune, Patna, Ranchi, Mohali, and Visakhapatnam — due to non payment of dues from 22 August.
The second official said OMCs would wait until Monday (26 August) to see if Air India comes back to them with a resolution plan to clear the dues.
""The joint decision to stop fuel supply to Air India from six airports, i.e., Kochi, Mohali, Pune, Ranchi, Patna and Visakhapatnam, was taken by OMCs in the wake of long overdue payments to the tune of  ₹5,000 crore. This includes the interest accrued on the outstanding dues,"" IOCL said in a statement on Friday.
Meanwhile, Air India may find it difficult to pay off its entire dues since the airline is currently facing a cash crunch.
An Air India official told Mint under the condition of anonymity that the airline was not in a position to pay off its entire dues to OMCs and had earlier offered OMCs about  ₹60 crore to clear a part of its dues.
""We are sure that the government will intervene since we can't have a situation where the national carrier will have to ground its planes due to restriction in fuel supply,"" the Air India official said, requesting anonymity.
Air India has often delayed payment of dues to OMCs in the past. Oil companies have also temporarily stopped fuel supply to the national carrier, but resumed services after the airline paid back part of its dues.
""Because we are both government companies, we would not be surprised if there is government intervention in this matter. However, it is important that we recover our dues since we are listed companies,"" said the second OMC official mentioned above, on the condition of anonymity.
Air India currently has a debt of over  ₹55,000 crore. The government had, in February 2019, approved the creation of a special purpose vehicle (SPV), Air India Asset Holding Ltd (AIAHL), to house  ₹29,464-crore debt of the airline as well as its non-core assets, painting and artefacts and other non-operational assets.
With massive outlay of cash on debt servicing, the national carrier often finds itself in short-term cash crunch, which has in the past led it to delay payment to vendors.
The cash-strapped national carrier's plans to raise funds to the tune of  ₹7,000 crore from a bond sale earlier this year did not materialise.
The government is hoping to privatise the national carrier in the coming months. The Centre had, in June 2019, announced that its plans to sell the debt-laden state-run carrier were still on track for 2019-2020, after it failed in its attempt to sell a 76% stake in the airline during 2018-19 due to a lack of interest from bidders."

Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) plans to invest Rs1,500-1,700 crore in building a floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal at Krishnapatnam in Andhra Pradesh by 2022, its chairman D. Rajkumar said on Monday.
BPCL, the country's second-biggest state-owned oil refining and fuel marketing company, is betting big on gas business in anticipation of energy consumption basket undergoing change as focus shifts to cleaner sources.
The company will hold 74% interest in the project while the remaining 26% will be with Petronet LNG Ltd, he said here.
""Initially it will be a 1 million tonne per annum FSRU based terminal which can be scaled up to 3 million tonne or 5 million tonne in future,"" he said.
The project is likely to be commissioned by 2022.
""It (the project) may cost Rs1,500 crore to Rs1,700 crore,"" he said.
The global oil and gas market is going through a transformation as mounting climatic concerns drive changes in the energy mix in favour of natural gas and renewables.
In India, natural gas demand is slated to grow at a rate much faster than oil as the share of environment-friendly fuel rises in the energy basket.
To tap this opportunity, BPCL has made a foray into city gas distribution (CGD) and is now looking to set up an LNG import terminal of its own.
Krishnapatnam will be the sixth LNG terminal to be announced, on the coast. Petronet had previously signed a firm and binding term sheet for developing a land-based Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) terminal at Gangavaram Port in Andhra Pradesh with an initial capacity of 5 million tonne with Gangavaram Port Ltd (GPL) but later dropped it. State-owned GAIL too had planned a facility at Paradip in Odisha but it also dropped the plans.
This space was quickly taken up by Adani Group which is building a 5 million tonne facility at Dhamra in Odisha. GAIL as also Indian Oil Corp (IOC) has booked capacity on the Dhamra terminal.
IOC recently commissioned a 5 million tonne per annum import facility at Ennore.
GAIL had also previously announced plans for setting up an LNG terminal at Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh but the project has not taken off. Hiranandani Group-promoted H-Energy is executing a Rs3,500 crore project in West Bengal.
Rajkumar said BPCL is transferring its gas business to a new subsidiary, Bharat Gas Resources Ltd (BGRL). The company on its own or in a joint venture with other companies now has CGD licence for 37 geographical areas (GAs), he said.
Also, BGRL has entered into a long-term sales and purchase agreement to buy 1 million tonne per annum of LNG from Mozambique for 15 years, he said.
The company owns 10% interest in Mozambique LNG1 Company Pvt Ltd - the joint venture which is developing a giant gas field offshore Mozambique and converting the gas into LNG for shipping to consuming nations.
Anadarko Petroleum Corp of the US is the Operator of the field that holds about 75 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas. In the initial phase, 12.88 million tonne per annum of LNG will be made from the field.
The supply is likely to start from Financial Year 2024-25. BPCL is also a co-promoter of Petronet LNG Ltd, along with IOC, GAIL India and Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC). It is also a co-promoter of four city gas distribution companies -- Indraprastha Gas in Delhi with GAIL; Sabarmati Gas in Gujarat with Gujarat State Petroleum Corp Ltd (GSPL); Maharashtra Natural Gas and Central UP Gas with GAIL."

73,2019-09-03,BPCL,"The Negative macroeconomic data led to a steep correction in Indian equitiesThe rupee also depreciated sharply against the US dollar on economic growth woes

Market participants had a tough time digesting the slew of negative macroeconomic data served over the weekend. And, the sharp fall in Indian stock market indices mirrors that pain very well.
The Nifty and the Sensex shed more than 2% each on Tuesday, pushing the fear gauge India VIX (volatility index) up 11% to the 18-mark. Global cues weren’t very supportive either, with the Asian markets closing on a mixed note. But the decline in Indian stocks was largely due to domestic concerns.
Analysts say while the market may have factored in most of the poor data, fresh buying may not come in a hurry.
“There are media reports that the government may sell its stake in BPCL (Bharat Petroleum Corp.) to IOC (Indian Oil Corp.), which has further weighed on sentiments because this route of privatization will weaken the buying profit-making government entity. Investors feel that the government’s actions in responding to economic woes are not sufficient. They also need to be more pre-emptive with their measures. That said, most negative data has been factored in after today’s steep fall. However, investors may not be in a hurry to make large fresh investments, for now,"" said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities Ltd.
Sharing a similar view, Dhananjay Sinha, head of strategy and chief economist at IDFC Securities Ltd, said: “For equities, selling pressure from foreign institutional investors continues. Feedback from mutual fund distributors indicates that retail investors are wary of investing right now. Value erosion has happened in midcap and smallcap space, where mutual funds haven’t performed well. So, the appetite for fresh investments remains low.""
Not just the equity indices, the rupee also took a knock, weighed down by growth concerns. The Indian currency depreciated sharply against the greenback, sliding past the 72-mark once again. It ended Tuesday’s session at a nine-month low of 72.39/US dollar (USD).
“The current valuation of Nifty at PEG (price earnings to growth ratio) of 5 times indicates that multiples haven’t moderated much despite the recent correction. However, the Indian rupee has convincingly crossed the 72/USD mark, indicating that risk aversion is happening. Given the economic woes, we foresee depreciation in the rupee to around 74/USD in the near term,"" added Sinha of IDFC Securities.
The June quarter gross domestic product data, which was released on 30 August, was much below expectations. That apart, lower goods and services tax collections for August, falling auto sales, manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index survey and subdued core sector growth data, pointed to further stress in the economy.
Also, D-Street wasn’t too impressed with the government’s move to consolidate 10 public sector banks into four entities. Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said this was unlikely to revive credit growth to the liquidity-starved non-banking financial companies or have meaningful cost synergies."

New Delhi: PSU oil companies on Saturday resumed jet fuel supplies to cash-strapped Air India following talks mediated by the government, an official spokesperson said.
Supplies to Air India resumed from Saturday evening, he said.
Declining to give details of the agreement reached at talks earlier this week, the spokesperson said Air India agreed to payment terms for future ATF purchases.
On 22 August afternoon, Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) stopped fuel supplies to Air India at six airports of Kochi, Mohali, Pune, Patna, Ranchi and Vizag over payment defaults. According to the three fuel retailers, Air India owed  ₹5,000 crore in unpaid fuel bills with payments being delayed by almost eight months.
The overdue amount includes the interest accrued on outstanding dues.
Air India has a 90-day credit period, which means the aviation turbine fuel (ATF) it buys on a given day has to be paid for in three months. But Air India had not been making payments and the credit period was 230 days, forcing oil firms to snap supplies.
Air India uplifts about 250 kilolitres (kl) of ATF at the six airports on a daily basis.
Air India flights operating from the six airports, where ATF supplies were suspended, were tanking up from other airports.
‎Air India has a debt of over  ₹58,000 crore.

71,2019-09-08,BPCL,"Indian Oil, BPCL are also in the race for assets of the firm, which is divesting its pipeline businessGovt has been planning to split GAIL by hiving off its gas marketing and pipeline business

MUMBAI :
Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Ltd have joined the race to buy the gas pipeline assets of state-run Gail (India) Ltd, three people aware of the matter said.
A potential deal would be a vital win for Brookfield, which recently bought the gas pipeline assets of Reliance Industries Ltd. Gail owns more than two-thirds of India’s 12,000-km pipeline network.
Gail, which is in the process of divesting its pipeline business, has already received interest from state-run Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) for the gas transmission assets.
“Prospective bidders have begun initial discussions with Gail and are expected to put a formal offer once a formal sale process begins post the demerger,"" said the first of the three persons cited above, all of whom requested anonymity.
Brookfield and Temasek declined to comment emails sent on Friday.
The government has been planning to split Gail by hiving off its gas marketing and pipeline business into a separate entity and selling a majority stake in it to strategic investors. The government holds 52.68% in Gail, which had a market capitalization of  ₹59,195.61 crore as on 6 September 2019.
Gail’s marketing business brought in more than three-fourths of its total revenue in the last fiscal.
Gail, India’s biggest natural gas marketing and trading firm, is also adding another 9,000km of pipelines. The company dominates India’s gas marketing landscape with a 59% share.
Gail did not reply to an email sent on Friday on details of the stake sale process.
An IOCL official said the company sees huge value in Gail’s transmission assets as it plans to expand its own gas distribution network. IOCL, the second-largest gas marketer in India after Gail, has lined up aggressive expansion plans for city gas distribution.
A BPCL official said Gail’s transmission network will give a fillip to its plans of expanding in the gas distribution business. Last fiscal, BPCL hived off its gas business into a separate wholly-owned unit so that the company can sharpen its focus by bringing all natural gas-related businesses into one fold.
Spokespersons at IOCL and BPCL did not respond to emails sent on Friday on whether they plan to bid for Gail’s pipeline assets.
A second person, an investment banker aware of the talks said, “The RIL-Brookfield pipeline deal has set a precedent for such asset monetization. Gail too has been exploring this option. They have held talks with several investors including, Brookfield and Singapore’s Temasek"".
This March, Brookfield’s India Infrastructure Trust, an InvIT, bought RIL’s loss-making entity East-West Pipeline for  ₹13,000 crore. The InvIT took 100% stake in Pipeline Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd that owns and operates the East-West Pipeline.
Though Gail has argued that its gas marketing and transmission businesses operate at arm’s length and hence splitting them is of little significance, the government, in order to meet part of its  ₹1.05 trillion target for raising revenue from disinvestments this fiscal, is keen on the bifurcation.
To achieve its disinvestment target last fiscal, the government has sold its entire 51.11% stake in refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd to state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) for  ₹36,915 crore.
Gail, which took shape in August 1984 after it was spun off from ONGC’s gas business, has multiple long-term contracts to import gas in its liquid form (LNG) from countries such as the US.
It is currently unclear if the strategic buyers would be given the responsibility of retaining these contracts. One option is to allow Gail to continue with the marketing business that would include all the sale contracts and the city gas retailing.
Since Gail has been maintaining separate accounts for its gas pipeline and marketing businesses, analysts said this makes it easier to split them into two entities. Gail’s networth rose to  ₹39,062 crore last fiscal from  ₹35,142 crore in the previous year."
70,2019-09-09,BPCL,"OMCs have put the airline on a cash and carry modeAt present, on a daily basis, Air India buys about  ₹20-22 crore worth of products from the OMCs

Mumbai/New Delhi: Public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) like Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), which together have unpaid liabilities of close to  ₹5,000 crore from Air India Ltd., will receive  ₹100 crore from the national carrier in September, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Mint adding that this payment is one of the arrangements chalked out by the government to ensure uninterrupted fuel supply to the debt-ridden airline.
OMCs have, however, put the airline on a cash and carry mode, which means that the carrier will have to make immediate payment for fuel purchase.
“Air India will be making daily payments for the current supplies that are being provided to them by OMCs, a step which will prevent the airline’s outstanding (towards OMCs) from shooting up further,"" said one of the above mentioned people, who requested anonymity.
“To settle the old outstanding, Air India will pay a lump sum of  ₹100 crores every month to the OMCs,"" the person added.
Public sector OMCs had earlier on 22 August afternoon stopped fuel supplies to Air India at six airports of Kochi, Mohali, Pune, Patna, Ranchi and Vizag over payment defaults. According to the three fuel retailers, Air India owed  ₹5,000 crore in unpaid fuel bills with payments being delayed by almost eight months.
The overdue amount included the interest accrued on outstanding dues.
However, the OMCs have resumed jet fuel supplies to Air India from 7 September after the government stepped in to mediate talks between the debt-ridden airline and the oil companies.
""We don't know how Air India plans to finance the repayment. At a meeting last week, top Air India officials assured us that outstanding dues will be repaid in a monthly installment,"" said the person mentioned above adding that it could possible take months for the national carrier to clear its dues.
“Though this is an ad hoc arrangement, if the government takes steps to pump in funds in Air India, then the situation may change,"" the person added.
Air India has a 90-day credit period, which means the aviation turbine fuel (ATF) it buys on a given day can be paid anytime in the next three months.
However, since Air India had not been making regular payments and with the credit period shooting up to 230 days, oil firms are cautious about further extending the national carrier’s credit line in future.
""It is difficult to say what will happen in future. OMCs as well as Air India are both government-owned companies which have a public duty to fulfill,"" said the second person.
“We are going by Air India's word that it will pay us  ₹100 crore every month,"" the second person added.
At present, on a daily basis, Air India buys about  ₹20-22 crore worth of products from the OMCs, while a fraction of the national carrier’s fuel is supplied by private players.
“Air India is committed to pay off its dues towards receivables from OMCs,"" said a senior Air India official, who requested anonymity."
69,2019-09-10,BPCL,"Oil marketing companies have planned a capital expenditure of  ₹2.9 trillion over the next five yearsOf the  ₹2.9 trillion planned spend, the companies are expected to incur a capital expenditure of  ₹1.2 trillion in refining alone

Mumbai: A jump of nearly  ₹1 trillion in capital expenditure over the next five years could increase the leverage for oil marketing companies, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), struggling with weak operating margins, said analysts.
The oil marketing companies (OMCs) have planned a capital expenditure of Rs2.9 trillion over the next five years compared with Rs1.8 trillion spent between financial years 2015 and 2019.
""While we believe that capex in new and expansion projects would gradually enhance refining complexity and diversify product yields, we are cautious on the near-term prospects, as operating margins are weak and aggressive capex has led to greater leverage,"" said Centrum Broking in a research report dated 6 September.
Of the Rs2.9 trillion planned spend, the companies are expected to incur a capital expenditure of Rs1.2 trillion in refining alone, led by IOCL and HPCL for upgradation of refineries to comply with BS-VI regulations, integration of petchem units at multiple refineries, and capacity expansion.
Additionally, HPCL is setting up a greenfield 9mtpa refinery and a 2mtpa petchem unit at Barmer, Rajasthan, for Rs431 billion.
In a bid to diversify and cut dependence on transportation fuels, OMCs are also planning a significant capex of  ₹400 billion for the petchem segment aimed at integration of larger refineries with petchem capacities, enabling them to enhance product yields and diversify revenue mix.
""Additionally, the fact that direct benefit transfer of LPG payouts from the government have started to lag significantly, it creates working capital stress, raising near-term interest costs. With higher capex and debt, we expect leverage to remain high, depressing return ratios and profitability for the next 12-18 months,"" Centrum Broking said."

67,2019-09-13,BPCL,"Government selling its BPCL stake to IOC can create a monopoly in the oil marketing businessPrivatization would realize a higher price and may help take politics out of auto fuel pricing

The government has set a tall divestment target of  ₹1.05 trillion for FY20. Needless to say, it would need to sell stakes in some of the large public sector companies to achieve the target.
Here, state-run oil marketing and refining company, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), seems to be on the radar. Earlier this month, a Business Standard report said that the government is considering selling its entire stake worth over  ₹40,000 crore in BPCL. Of course, like similar such deals in the recent past, the stake sale will most likely be to another government-owned entity, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC).
But there is a twist to this tale. CNBC-TV18 reported that the finance ministry has raised objections on the government’s stake sale to IOC, as it can create a monopoly in the oil marketing business (see chart). So will the government consider selling its stake to a private sector firm?
A moot question then is whether the privatization of BPCL would be a good thing for investors. “Privatisation would realise a higher price, may help take politics out of auto fuel pricing, would ensure IOC’s ability to pay hefty dividend to the government of India is not impaired and may improve market sentiment as it would be seen as big bang reforms,"" said analysts from ICICI Securities Ltd in a note to clients.
Besides, as analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd point out, the real price discovery of BPCL will happen with a stake sale to foreign/private sector firms.
The government had earlier sold its stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) to Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd at a roughly 18% premium to prevailing prices. Prabhudas Lilladher analysts believe the premium can be much higher in the case of privatization.
HPCL along with BPCL and IOC are commonly referred to as oil marketing companies.
Moreover, a merger with IOC will create an unusually large behemoth in the energy sector. According to ICICI Securities, BPCL’s stake sale to IOC would further raise the latter’s market share dominance in transportation fuels, which may discourage proposed private sector investment in these areas.
While investors closely watch how this story develops, the recent strength in gross refining margins is encouraging to say the least.
More recently, investors have taken note of the improved refining environment. BPCL and HPCL shares have risen 23% and 16%, respectively, in the past three weeks thanks to the improvement in gross refining margins.
Still, valuations are subdued, having corrected substantially since end- 2017. According to analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, “Valuations are not demanding vis-à-vis historical averages; the government of India (GoI) stake sale overhang remains."""

New Delhi: India is considering a plan to sell the nation’s second-largest state refiner and fuel retailer to a global oil company as it explores options to give up its controlling stake in Bharat Petroleum Corp., people with knowledge of the matter said.
The government is keen to lure multinational companies in the domestic fuel retailing to boost competition and shake up a sector that’s long been dominated by state-run firms, the people said, asking not to be identified as the plan is not public. The Business Standard newspaper reported on September 2 government’s plan to sell a majority stake in the company. It holds 53.3% in BPCL.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has set a record target of raising 1.05 trillion rupees ($14.8 billion) in the current fiscal year from sale of state firms. The government’s budget gap goal of 3.3% of GDP is at risk due to sluggish revenue collections on the back a growth slowdown, limiting the government’s ability to spend on infrastructure and welfare programs.
Offloading its holding in Bharat Petroleum can help meet more than 40% of the aim based on the closing price on Sept. 12. Finance ministry spokesman Rajesh Malhotra could not be immediately reached for a comment.
Shares of Bharat Petroleum gained as much as 7.1%, touching day’s high of 411.55 rupees in Mumbai. That compares with a 0.5% gain in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex index.
Early stage
The talks are at an early stage and it’s unclear how long it will take to finalize a decision and what option the government will choose, the people added. A move to privatize BPCL will parliament’s approval.
Saudi Aramco is targeting refining deals in India, while Russia’s Rosneft PJSC has already invested in oil refining and fuel marketing. Others such as Total SA, Shell and BP Plc are also expanding into fuel retailing in India. The International Energy Agency expects energy demand to more than double by 2040.
An earlier attempt to sell state refiners Hindustan Petroleum Corp. to a single investor and Bharat Petroleum to the public was stalled by a Supreme Court order in 2003 following protests by labor and political groups.
Bharat Petroleum was previously Burmah Shell, which in 1970s was nationalized by an act of parliament. Burmah Shell, set up in the 1920s, was an alliance between Royal Dutch Shell and Burmah Oil Co. and Asiatic Petroleum (India).

Mumbai: Drones which targeted Saudi Aramco’s Abqaiq oil refinery and Khurais oil field, over the weekend, have hit 5% of global oil supply, pushing up global oil prices nearly 12% so far.
While this could push India's import bill upward, potentially exacerbating the current economic slowdown, another concern could be ensuring continuous crude supply to Indian refineries to meet India's oil demand. India is the world’s third-largest oil importer.
Currently, India has the capacity to meet about 12 days’ of the country’s crude oil requirement. While India's strategic oil reserve in Vishakhapatnam has a storage capacity of 1.33 million tonnes, Mangaluru has 1.5 MT, and Padur has 2.5 MT. Indian Strategic Petrol Reserves (ISPRL) is responsible for maintaining the country’s strategic petroleum reserves.
“Indian refiners maintain 65 days of crude storage, and when added to the storage planned and achieved by ISPRL, that takes the Indian crude storage tally to 87 days,"" said Anuj Gupta of Mumbai-based stock brokerage firm Angel Broking.
State-run oil marketing companies--Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL)--have said they are closely monitoring the situation.
""Since we have a diversified crude procurement strategy we are currently not worried about crude supplies, however, we are monitoring the situation and are hopeful that normalcy is restored soon,"" said a senior official from an oil marketing company.
In the current fiscal so far, India has imported 4.5 million barrels per day (mbpd) of crude oil, which is 0.1 mbpd less compared with import volumes in the corresponding period in previous financial year. The compliance of US sanctions on Iran, beginning May, has led to a decline in India’s imports. Iran was India’s third-largest crude oil supplier.
According to the oil ministry, share of crude oil imports from the OPEC (The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) fell to 78% of total imports during the first four months of FY20 compared with 83.2% during the corresponding period a year ago. On the other hand, India’s crude oil imports from the US rose 213% during the period.
“However, despite the decline of crude imports which is supposed to be considered favourable for the Indian economy, import dependency based on consumption has increased from it being 83.4% to 84.9%,"" said Care Ratings in its report dated 13 September.
Fall in crude imports has led to a decline in the country’s crude consumption and an increase in overall imports of petroleum products. Crude oil processed by Indian refineries declined 2.3%, while imports of petroleum products rose 22.5%. There has been a sharp increase in petrol and diesel imports, by 298% and 363.5%, respectively, to make up for subdued refining activities."

New Delhi/Mumbai: Indian refiners are assessing security protocols put in place for the multi-billion dollar installations following drone attacks on Saudi Aramco, which has resulted in the biggest-ever disruption in global crude oil supply.
These security assessments also come in the backdrop of India becoming a preferred refining hub, with its refining capacity increasing from 62 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in 1998 to around 249.366 mtpa now. The issue assumes significance given that Indian refineries have capacity of oil reserves equivalent to at least 65 days of net imports.
On 27 August last year, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) laid down strict regulations, forbidding flying of civil remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) or drones within restricted distance from the perimeter of airports, military installations, international border which includes Line of Control (LoC), Line of Actual Control (LAC) and Actual Ground Position Line (AGPL), into sea from coast line, Vijay Chowk in Delhi, state secretariats, among others.
“We are assessing the security situation,"" said a senior official at one of the state-run refiners, adding that “Whenever there is a threat of any sort, the CISF (Central Industrial Security Force) issues an advisory.""
India has become Asia’s largest refined product exporter since August 2009. India is a net exporter of petroleum products and imported 207.3 million tonnes of oil in 2018-19 fiscal.
Some of the large refiners in India are private sector refiners such as Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Russia’s largest oil company Rosneft PJSC’ Nayara Energy (earlier Essar Oil Ltd) and state-run Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL). The other refiners in the country are ONGC owned Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Chennai Petroleum Corp. Ltd (CPCL), Numaligarh Refinery Ltd, Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd and HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd.
“It is for the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to issue a security advisory,"" said an Indian government official requesting anonymity.
“No such advisory has been issued till date post the attacks on Saudi Aramco facilities,"" added a second Indian government official who also did not want to be named.
According to a PTI report last month, an armed contingent of over 100 CISF commandos took over counter-terror security duties at Nayara Energy Ltd’s refinery in the Vadinagar area of Gujarat. This is the tenth installation in the private sector of the country to get an armed cover of the CISF, a paramilitary under the Union home ministry. RIL’s Jamnagar refinery too has a CISF cover.
India’s crude basket, which averaged $47.56 and $56.43 a barrel in FY17 and FY18, respectively, touched $59.35 in August, according to data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell. The average price jumped to $65.11 a barrel on 16 September. The Indian basket of crude represents the average of Oman, Dubai and Brent crude.
Consequently on Tuesday, automotive fuel prices saw the biggest increase since 5 July. While the price of petrol jumped 14 paisa per litre to  ₹72.17, diesel price gained 15 paisa to  ₹65.58 in New Delhi.

Mumbai: Bharat Gas Resources Ltd (BGR) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), has signed a five-year loan agreement with Bank of Baroda for  ₹3100 crore, according to two officials aware of the deal.
The company will use the loan to fund expansion of its city gas distribution business. BGRL has a board approved borrowing limit of  ₹4000 crore.
""We have 11 geographical areas that we had won in the latest round of city gas distribution. For the first five years, we had to achieve financial closure for those areas and for that purpose we have already approved a long term loan of  ₹3,100 crore from Bank of Baroda,"" said an official from BGRL on the condition of anonymity.
A BGRL spokesperson confirmed the development but declined to divulge the name of the bank. He, however, said the company will raise more funds for the geographical areas it won in the 10th city gas distribution bidding rounds and other projects.
BGRL had participated in the 9th and 10th round of CGD bidding by Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board, winning 13 geographical areas. The total investment in these CGD networks is expected to be around  ₹11,750 crores.
In the first phase, BGRL has completed the detailed feasibility report as well as the financial closure process for 11 GAs won in 9th round and has tied up the said loan on project finance basis for the same.
BGRL, formed to take over the gas business undertaking of parent BPCL, sees huge growth in LNG demand in the country.

58,2019-09-27,BPCL,"Ownership change can help companies become more focused on returns optimizationA case in point is Concor, which is in container rail transportation business in India

Shares of Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Container Corp. of India Ltd (Concor), and Shipping Corp. of India Ltd extended gains on Thursday, rising 2.5-10%.
CNBC-TV18 reported that the government is considering selling its entire stake in these companies, driving their stocks higher.
Whether the government is considering privatization or stake sales will be clear in time. Analysts, however, said that privatization can fetch the government higher revenues.
Kotak Institutional Equities research said that minority stake sales till now have only yielded limited financial benefits due to sub-par valuations of the public sector companies. Instead, if the government decides to cede majority ownership and privatize these companies, then it can derive much better value.
“We believe the government can raise significantly higher amounts if it were to privatize the PSUs through (1) strategic sale of a majority stake or (2) sale of its shares in tranches to institutional and retail investors with an explicit commitment to reduce its holding to below 50%,"" pointed out Kotak analysts in a 25 September report.
“We would strongly argue against golden share or any form of residual government control as it would lead to valid concerns about continued government influence on the operations of the companies,"" added Kotak.
An investor will value ownership control and management freedom more than being a passive partner. Ownership change can also help companies become more focused on returns optimization, which is key for minority shareholders.
A case in point is Concor, which is in container rail transportation business in India. The company, whose valuations are not particularly cheap, has been investing in multi-modal logistics parks (MMLPs) to sharpen its competitive advantage.
But as analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd said, the company is yet to see benefits from the investments. A private owner may have been more dynamic in capital allocation. “Return on capital employed has been trending lower for Concor over the last decade as large investments in MMLPs are yet to fructify,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities said in a note.
Perhaps the case for strategic divestment is the strongest for BPCL. “We are even more optimistic about the privatization of BPCL on three grounds. First, the latest tax rate cut and roll-back of stock market related taxes suggests GoI is finally doing big bang reforms, which are welcomed by investors. Second, the latest income tax rate cut would lead to large loss of revenue for GoI, which could be made up by the privatization of BPCL. And, thirdly, privatization would improve the broader market sentiment,"" said ICICI Securities Ltd in a client note."
57,2019-09-27,BPCL,"Oil ministry officials assured there would be no shortage of LPG during the upcoming festive seasonCurrently, states including Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab and Goa could face an LPG supply pinch

Mumbai: In the wake of a temporary shortage of cooking gas or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), state-run oil marketing companies -- Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd -- may ration LPG cylinders to users.
This means, users, holding only one LPG cylinder will be given preference over those having two cylinders.
""Currently, we are not short of LPG. But there is some disruption in supply due to recent issues with ONGC's Uran plant and Saudi Aramco. We are, however, able to service consumer demand. We are giving priority to single bottle users as double bottle users will have spare capacity. We have also arranged for alternative sources for LPG which will reach the Indian shore in a week's time,"" said a senior LPG official from an oil marketing company.
While a fire at the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd's processing plant in Uran, Navi Mumbai on 3 September caused disruption in domestic LPG supply, a drone attack on Saudi Aramco's facilities on 11 September added to the supply woes. Saudi Arabia is the second-largest supplier of crude and cooking gas to India and the oil marketing companies together have 273 million LPG customers.
Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL), which also supplies LPG, had a few units shut last month due to a minor landslide in the area owing to heavy rains, while private refiners had a maintenance shutdown.
Oil ministry officials assured there would be no shortage of LPG during the upcoming festive season as a fresh cargo from Adnoc would reach the Indian shores soon.
India's demand for LPG has grown significantly since the launch of Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) in 2016. LPG penetration in the country has gone up from 62% to around 95% since 2016.
Currently, states, including Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab and Goa, could face an LPG supply pinch reportedly due to a booking backlog.
""We had floated a tender and we have received a good response so we have tied up more than required cargoes. Supply from Uran is also expected to be restored before 15 October so there will be no demand-supply gap,"" said another official from an oil marketing company."
56,2019-09-29,BPCL,"SC had in September 2003 ruled that BPCL, as well as HPCL, can be privatised only after Parliament amends a lawOfficials said BPCL in present times will be an attractive buy for companies ranging from Saudi Aramco of Saudi Arabia

New Delhi: The government is considering a proposal to sell India's second-largest state refiner and fuel retailer BPCL to foreign and private firms but the privatisation plan will need a prior nod of Parliament, officials said.
Keen to get multi-nationals in domestic fuel retailing to boost competition, the government is mulling selling most of its 53.3% stake in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) to a strategic partner, officials aware of the development said.
Privatisation of BPCL will not just shake up fuel retailing sector long dominated by state-owned firms but also help meet at least a third of the government's  ₹1.05 lakh crore disinvestment target.
BPCL at the close of market on September 27 had a market capitalisation of about  ₹1.02 lakh crore and even a 2% stake sale at this valuation would fetch the government  ₹26,500 crore plus a control-and-fuel-market-entry premium ranging anywhere between  ₹5,000 crore to  ₹10,000 crore, officials said.
BPCL privatisation, however, will need Parliament's approval.
The Supreme Court had in September 2003 ruled that BPCL, as well as Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), can be privatised only after Parliament amends a law it had previously passed to nationalise the two firms.
The ruling had followed a plan of the then BJP-led NDA government headed by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to privatise the two firms.
The apex court ruling had stalled the plan to sell 34.1% out of government's 51.1% stake in HPCL to a strategic partner along with management control. Reliance Industries Ltd, BP plc of UK, Kuwait Petroleum, Petronas of Malaysia, the Shell-Saudi Aramco combine and Essar Oil had expressed their interest in acquiring that stake before the Supreme Court stalled the process.
Officials said BPCL in present times will be an attractive buy for companies ranging from Saudi Aramco of Saudi Arabia to French energy giant Total SA which are vying to enter the world's fastest-growing fuel retail market.
BPCL was previously Burmah Shell, which in 1976 was nationalised by an Act of Parliament. Burmah Shell, set up in the 1920s, was an alliance between Royal Dutch Shell and Burmah Oil Co and Asiatic Petroleum (India).
HPCL was incorporated in 1974 after the takeover and merger of erstwhile Esso Standard and Lube India Ltd through the ESSO (Acquisition of Undertaking in India) Act passed by Parliament. The company was in January last year taken over by state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) for  ₹36,915 crore.
At that time, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had cited the four-decade-old Nationalisation Act to justify exempting ONGC from making an open offer after acquiring the government's 51.11% stake in HPCL.
""We are bound by the Nationalisation Act and character of HPCL could not have changed so no open offer was mandated,"" he had said.
The Supreme Court had in September 2003 cited the ESSO (Acquisition of Undertaking in India) Act and the Burmah Shell (Acquisition of Undertaking in India) Act, 1976 and Caltex (Acquisition of Shares of Caltex Oil Refining India Ltd and all the Undertakings in India for Caltex India Ltd) Act, 1977 to rule that the government cannot privatise HPCL and BPCL without approaching Parliament for changing the Nationalisation Act.
""There is no challenge before this Court (Supreme Court) as to the policy of disinvestment. The only question raised before us whether the method adopted by the Government in exercising its executive powers to disinvest HPCL and BPCL without repealing or amending the law is permissible or not. We find that on the language of the Act such a course is not permissible at all,"" Justice S Rajendra Babu and G P Mathur wrote in the September 16, 2003 order ""restraining the Central Government from proceeding with disinvestment resulting in HPCL and BPCL ceasing to be Government companies without appropriately amending the statutes concerned suitably.""
BPCL operates four refineries at Mumbai, Kochi in Kerala, Bina in Madhya Pradesh and Numaligarh in Assam with a combined capacity to convert 38.3 million tonnes of crude oil into fuel. It has 15,078 petrol pumps and 6,004 LPG distributors.
India has a total refining capacity of 249.4 million tonnes of refining capacity and 65,554 petrol pumps and 24,026 LPG distributors.

54,2019-09-30,BPCL,"Group of secretaries' panel clears divestment of 30% govt stake in ConcorPanel cleared sale of entire govt stake in BPCL, Shipping Corp, THDC India, NEEPCO

New Delhi: A group of secretaries on disinvestment today approved sale of government’s entire shareholding in four public sector companies – Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), Shipping Corp of India (SCI), THDC India and NEEPCO, a CNBC-TV18 report said quoting Reuters. It also cleared a sale of 30% equity of Container Corp of India (Concor) from the government holding.
This is the biggest privatization of state-owned public sector companies proposed to be undertaken by an Indian government since the Atal Bihari Vajpayee dispensation in early 2000.
As far as stake sale of BPCL goes, the government will now have to seek the approval of the two Houses for its sale since the company was formed under an act of Parliament.
The government holds 53.29% stake in BPCL, 54.8% in Concor and 63.75% in SCI. THDC is a 75:25 joint venture between the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government. Entire equity of North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd (NEEPCO) belongs to the government.
At Monday's closing price of  ₹470.05 on the BSE, sale of its entire stake in BPCL will fetch the government  ₹54,055 crore. Concor stake sale will get the government  ₹11,051 crore at the Monday closing price of  ₹604.6 on the BSE. Stake sale in SCI will help the government earn  ₹1,282 crore. Thus, exit from BPCL and SCI and sale of 30% equity of Concor will help the government collect  ₹66,388 crore.
THDC and NEEPCO are unlisted companies and it is likely they could be handed over to NHPC and NTPC respectively, though no confirmation is available on that as yet.
The government has a target of mopping up  ₹1,05,000 crore through sale of its holding in public sector companies. It has so far collected a mere  ₹12,357.49 crore from the exercise. Sale of shares in the companies is crucial as the government struggles to adhere to its FY20 fiscal deficit target of 3.3%, under threat by the massive cut in corporate taxes to 22% from 30% and reduction in Goods and Services Tax (GST) while doing away with the short-lived super-rich tax."

50,2019-10-01,BPCL,"This may be an easy way for New Delhi to shore up its finances, but would end up eroding the credibility of its disinvestment programme

Given the shortfall in tax revenues, it’s a no brainer that New Delhi needs to pursue disinvestment in state-run companies aggressively to keep its fiscal deficit in check. But it’s also crucial that the programme sees stake sales that result in transfers of ownership to private entities, not to another state-run company. Going by the strategic disinvestment plans for five companies approved on Monday by a group of secretaries, though, it appears the government may again resort to financial jugglery. It may manage to raise the money it needs to meet its target, but fail to fulfill the broader objective of the exercise, which is to pare down its stake, both direct and indirect.
According to the plan, a sizeable stake in Bharat Petroleum Corp. would be put on the block. But it could yet end up in the hands of another government-run company, possibly Indian Oil Corp. (IOC). Through this sale alone, the government could raise about half its  ₹1.05 trillion disinvestment revenue target for the year. Similarly, stakes in power companies THDC India and Neepco could be sold to state-run NTPC.
This may be an easy way for New Delhi to shore up its finances, but would end up eroding the credibility of its disinvestment programme. Given the general inefficiency of public sector management, a change from one arm to another does not serve the goal of turning Indian resource allocation more efficient. For this, India needs new owners to take charge and push these companies to get into better shape. Finding private buyers would not be difficult if what’s on offer is a functional company with no strings attached."

The government has announced mega divestment plans for four blue-chip public-sector companies, but Moody’s Investor Service sees it as a setback. Calling the decision to privatise Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) “a credit negative"", Moody’s said it may not bode well for BPCL’s ratings.
“Stake sale could remove BPCL’s links to the government and prompt bond redemption,"" Moody’ said.
A group of secretaries on Monday cleared strategic sale of government’s entire shareholding in BPCL, Shipping Corporation of India, THDC India and North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd (NEEPCO). It also cleared a sale of 30% equity in Container Corp of India (Concor) from the government holding.
This would be the biggest privatisation of state-owned companies proposed to be undertaken by an Indian government since the Atal Bihari Vajpayee dispensation in early 2000. For the sale of BPCL, the government will have to seek the approval of the two Houses for its sale since the company was formed under an act of Parliament.

46,2019-10-06,BPCL,"BPCL holds the key as the govt with just  ₹12,357 crore sell-off proceeds so far is far away from the ambitious target of  ₹1.05 trillionThe Finance Ministry is pitching to divest the govt's 100% stake in Air India when the Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism panel meets later this month

New Delhi: In the first lot of big-ticket disinvetsments, the government is aiming the stake sales of PSUs, including BPCL, SCI and Concor, among others, which have recently been cleared by the Amit Shah-led panel, at the earliest and they could be placed for cabinet approval by November-end.
Sources said that out of the three, BPCL holds the key as the government with just  ₹12,357 crore sell-off proceeds so far is far away from the ambitious target of  ₹1.05 trillion.
Then there is the strategic sale of Air India which is also on the agenda, but the possibility of it reaching the cabinet is not so early. The Finance Ministry is pitching to divest the government's 100% stake in Air India when the Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism panel meets later this month, a senior ministry official said.
The ministerial panel headed by Home Minister Amit Shah held its first meeting last month.
Officials said on Thursday that the cabinet approved changes in the sell-off process where DIPAM (Department of Investment & Public Asset Management) becomes the nodal department for all decisions on strategic disinvestment while the other tweak in the process will be pre-bid stakeholder consultation before the government issues EOIs to get the prospective bidders' concerns, doubts and suggestions on board before floating the Expression of Interest (EOI).
Roadshows will also be arranged by the DIPAM and the concerned PSU jointly to attract more investors as per the new tweaks in the sell-off process. Earlier, roadshows were held only during the IPO or OFS (offer for sale) stage. So, there will be a two-stage bidding beginning with an initial expression of interest and a final financial bid.
Earlier this week, a group of secretaries agreed for the sale of the government's entire 53.29% stake in Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd, its 63.75% stake in Shipping Corporation of India (SCI), 30% in Concor, 100% in NEEPCO and 75% in THDC, officials said.
So far, the strategic disinvestment process did not allow for stakeholder consultation or roadshows, before the government started calling for EOI. For example, there was no pre-bid consultation in the case of the first Air India divestment attempt.
With this obstacle removed now, the government will be able to assess investor demand and concerns better on specific stake sales, before formally inviting bids.
BPCL has a market capitalisation of about  ₹1.02 trillion and even a 26% per cent stake sale at this valuation would fetch the government  ₹26,500 crore plus a control-and-fuel-market-entry premium ranging between  ₹5,000 crore and  ₹10,000 crore, officals said.
So, for a sale of 53% of its stakes, government is hoping to mop up around at a higher side of  ₹65,000 crore including any entry premium. That can take care of major part of the sell-off target.
The Concor stake sale may get the government  ₹11,000 crore at based on its closing prices.
The stake sale in SCI will earn  ₹1,300 crore. Thus, exit from BPCL and SCI and the sale of 30% equity of Concor will help the government mop up  ₹70,000-75,000 crore."
45,2019-10-06,BPCL,"The government is mulling selling most of its 53.3% stake in BPCL to a strategic partnerPrivatisation of BPCL will not just shake up the fuel retailing sector long dominated by state-owned firms but also help meet at least a third of the government's  ₹1.05 lakh crore disinvestment target

NEW DELHI :
Ahead of a proposed move to fully privatise state-owned fuel retailer Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), the government had quietly repealed the legislation that had nationalised the company, doing away with the need to seek Parliament nod before selling it off to private and foreign firms.
The Repealing and Amending Act of 2016 had annulled ""187 obsolete and redundant laws lying unnecessarily on the Statue-Book"" including the Act of 1976 that had nationalised erstwhile Burmah Shell.
""The Act has been repealed and there is no need for a Parliament approval for strategic sale of BPCL,"" a senior official said.
Keen to get multi-nationals in domestic fuel retailing to boost competition, the government is mulling selling most of its 53.3 per cent stake in BPCL to a strategic partner.
Privatisation of BPCL will not just shake up the fuel retailing sector long dominated by state-owned firms but also help meet at least a third of the government's  ₹1.05 lakh crore disinvestment target.
BPCL at the close of market on October 4 had a market capitalisation of about  ₹1.11 lakh crore and a government stake sale could get upwards of  ₹60,000 crore including a control-and-fuel-market-entry premium, officials said.
The Supreme Court had in September 2003 ruled that BPCL, as well as Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), can be privatised only after Parliament amends a law it had previously passed to nationalise the two firms.
The ruling had followed a plan of the then BJP-led NDA government headed by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to privatise the two firms.
The apex court ruling had stalled the plan to sell 34.1 per cent out of government's 51.1 per cent stake in HPCL to a strategic partner along with management control. Reliance Industries Ltd, BP plc of UK, Kuwait Petroleum, Petronas of Malaysia, the Shell-Saudi Aramco combine and Essar Oil had expressed their interest in acquiring that stake before the Supreme Court stalled the process.
But the Supreme Court mandated condition is no longer applicable, they said citing the May 9, 2016, Gazette notification following President's assent to The Repealing and Amending Act, 2016.
Besides others it listed repealing in ""the whole"" The Esso (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act, 1974, The Burmah Shell (Acquisition of Undertakings Act, 1976 and The Caltex [Acquisition of Shares of Caltex Oil The whole] Refining (India) Ltd and of the Undertakings in India of Caltex (India) Ltd] Act, 1977.
According to the Statement of Objects and Reasons for the Repeal Bill introduced in the Lok Sabha on May 13, 2015, the idea was to bring reform in the legal system by removing ""incoherent and redundant laws.""
""...the present proposal is to repeal 187 obsolete and redundant laws lying unnecessarily on the Statute-Book. On being enacted, it would reduce obsolete laws and bring in clarity to those for whose benefit the laws are enacted,"" it said.
BPCL offers attractive buy for companies ranging from Saudi Aramco of Saudi Arabia to French energy giant Total SA which are vying to enter the world's fastest-growing fuel retail market. It will not only give them 34 million-ton in refining capacity but also access to about 25 per cent share of India's fuel marketing.
BPCL was previously Burmah Shell, which in 1976 was nationalised by an Act of Parliament. Burmah Shell, set up in the 1920s, was an alliance between Royal Dutch Shell and Burmah Oil Co and Asiatic Petroleum (India).
HPCL was incorporated in 1974 after the takeover and merger of erstwhile Esso Standard and Lube India Ltd through the ESSO (Acquisition of Undertaking in India) Act passed by Parliament. The company was in January last year taken over by state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) for  ₹36,915 crore.
The Supreme Court had in September 2003 cited the ESSO (Acquisition of Undertaking in India) Act and the Burmah Shell (Acquisition of Undertaking in India) Act, 1976 and Caltex (Acquisition of Shares of Caltex Oil Refining India Ltd and all the Undertakings in India for Caltex India Ltd) Act, 1977 to rule that the government cannot privatise HPCL and BPCL without approaching Parliament for changing the Nationalisation Act.
""There is no challenge before this Court (Supreme Court) as to the policy of disinvestment. The only question raised before us whether the method adopted by the Government in exercising its executive powers to disinvest HPCL and BPCL without repealing or amending the law is permissible or not. We find that on the language of the Act such a course is not permissible at all,"" Justice S Rajendra Babu and G P Mathur wrote in the September 16, 2003 order ""restraining the Central Government from proceeding with disinvestment resulting in HPCL and BPCL ceasing to be Government companies without appropriately amending the statutes concerned suitably.""
BPCL operates four refineries at Mumbai, Kochi in Kerala, Bina in Madhya Pradesh and Numaligarh in Assam with a combined capacity to convert 38.3 million tonnes of crude oil into fuel. It has 15,078 petrol pumps and 6,004 LPG distributors.
India has a total refining capacity of 249.4 million tonnes and 65,554 petrol pumps and 24,026 LPG distributors.

The government today came out with advertisements in leading newspapers of the country, asking for bids from merchant bankers and legal advisors to undertake stake sale in three of its companies. But there’s a catch. Neither of the two advertisements – one for partial stake sale in a railway company and another for complete sale of two power producers – mentions any name. This is the first time that a government advertisement is seeking bids from advisors without mentioning the companies’ names.
Proposals by merchant bankers and legal advisors have to be submitted by November 4.
While the government aims to sell only a partial stake in the railway public sector company, it is willing to hand over its management control, as per the advertisement.
A group of Central government secretaries had on 30 September approved sale of entire government stake in four public sector companies and partial stake sale in another.
Three of the five companies in which sale of government stake was approved are THDC, North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd (NEEPCO) and Container Corp of India (Concor) and it is quite likely today’s advertisements referred to them.
Full sale of government stake was approved in the power PSUs besides sale of 30% equity of Concor from the government holding along with handover of its management control.
The two other companies in which full government stake sale was approved included Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Shipping Corp of India (SCI).
The government holds 53.29% stake in BPCL, 54.80% in Concor and 63.75% in SCI. THDC is a 75:25 joint venture between the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government. Entire equity of NEEPCO belongs to the Central government."

MUMBAI :
State-owned Air India on Sunday said the aviation jet fuel payment issues are being sorted out and will be resolved soon with the oil PSUs, which have warned the carrier of snapping supplies at six key airports if it does not make monthly lump sum payment by October 18.
The airline also ""assured"" its customers of smooth operations, saying it has taken all the measures in the eventuality of the two sides failing to reach an understanding on the issue.
""The issues with oil companies are being sorted out and would be resolved early,"" Air India spokesperson Dhananay Kumar said in a statement.
In a letter sent to Air India last Thursday, the three government-owned oil marketing firms -- Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) -- said the outstanding had not come down considerably in the absence of the committed monthly lump sum payment.
Late August, the three oil companies had stopped fuel supplies to Air India at six airports of Kochi, Mohali, Pune, Patna, Ranchi and Vizag over payment defaults and it was restored after 1 day following the intervention of the aviation ministry and a commitment from the airline to pay  ₹100 crore per month besides the same day payment for the daily uplift of the fuel.
At that time, the oil companies had claimed an outstanding amount of  ₹5,000 crore towards the national carrier.
""Meanwhile, Air India has taken all measures to ensure that flights are not disrupted and passengers are not inconvenienced at all. There is no reason whatsoever for any concern by esteemed Air India passengers,"" the spokesperson added in the statement.
On October 5, the oil companies had told Air India that if it did not make the monthly lump sum payment, they will stop fuel supply from October 11 at six major domestic airports.
However, Air India on Thursday requested the OMCs to not stop the supplies but did not give any timeline for clearing of the dues.
Following which, the oil PSUs deferred their decision to suspend supplies at six major airports to October 18.

NEW DELHI :
State-owned oil companies on Tuesday accused Air India of not honouring its commitment to pay  ₹100 crore every month to clear overdue ATF outstanding of over  ₹5,000 crore and will be forced to snap supplies at major airports from Friday if no solution is offered.
""Air India had back in June and again in September agreed to pay the three oil marketing companies  ₹100 crore every month to clear past ATF dues. But unfortunately it hasn't met its commitment,"" said Sandeep Kumar Gupta, Director (Finance), Indian Oil Corp (IOC).
IOC and two other oil marketing companies, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), have served a notice on Air India that they will be forced to stop jet fuel (ATF) supplies if payments are not made, he said.
The monthly payment was besides the airline being put on cash-and-carry where it was given fuel only against cash payment.
""We have said we will stop supplies at major airports. Let's see what is the outcome of negotiations before the October 18 deadline,"" Gupta said.
Air India owes IOC about  ₹2,700 crore in unpaid fuel bills. This includes  ₹450 crore of interest. It's outstanding towards the three oil firms is about  ₹5,000 crore including interest.
Gupta said the oil companies haven't indicated the airports where supplies will be stopped but they will be major airports, unlike the six small airports where fuel supplies to Air India aircraft were stopped in August.
Supplies were resumed last month after Air India committed to paying  ₹100 crore every month to oil firms to clear past dues, he said adding Air India buys about  ₹13-14 crore worth of fuel every day from IOC.
IOC controls about 50 per cent of the market share.
August 22, IOC, BPCL and HPCL had stopped fuel supplies to Air India at six airports of Kochi, Mohali, Pune, Patna, Ranchi and Vizag over payment defaults.
However, after the intervention of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, they resumed fuel supply on September 7.
On October 5, the oil companies had told Air India that if it did not make the monthly lump sum payment, they will stop fuel supply from October 11 at ""six major domestic airports"". Subsequently, Air India wrote to them requesting not to stop the fuel supply.
The OMCs wrote back on Thursday itself, stating that ""while we are in receipt of your letter dated 10th October 2019, requesting OMCs against stoppage of fuel supply, it has been observed that no timelines have been mentioned with respect to the lump sum payment"".
""However, taking into consideration your request, we are deferring our decision to suspend supplies to October 18, 2019,"" they said.
The OMCs requested the national carrier to adhere to its commitment to making lump sum payment towards ""overdue outstanding, failing which we will be reviewing our decision and stop supplies as per above notice"".
In Thursday's letter, they mentioned that the ""commitment towards daily payment has been mostly adhered to by Air India... the outstanding has not come down considerably in the absence of the committed monthly lump sum payment"".
The Centre is planning to initiate the process of divestment of its stake in Air India, which has a debt of over  ₹60,000 crore, from November this year. In 2018-19, the national carrier posted a net loss of around  ₹8,400 crore.‎

Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd had gained after Jio’s tariff announcement.
Wipro: The IT major posted its September quarter earnings after market hours on Tuesday. Investors are expected to be pleased with the company’s second quarter results. While revenue growth was more or less in line with analysts’ expectations, at 1.1% sequentially in constant currency terms, profit margins were better than estimate.
Indigo: Interglobde Aviation Ltd-owned Indigo has suspended flights on the Kolkata-Hong Kong route due to incidents of violence in the Chinese territory. However, the airline will continue to fly between Bengaluru and Hong Kong. Air India too will continue operations from Mumbai and Delhi.
Zee Entertainment: VTB Capital Plc, a unit of Russia’s state-controlled lender VTB Group, is in talks with two potential investors to sell a 10.71% stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. If the deal goes through, it may threaten promoter Subhash Chandra’s control over the company he founded.
Bajaj Consumer Care: The personal care firm’s promoter group on Tuesday sold about 22% stake, or 3.24 crore shares, for around  ₹630 crore in a single block deal. Bajaj Consumer Care Ltd is promoted by Kushagra Bajaj. The proceeds from the share sale will be used to repay debt.
BPCL: The state-owned company inched closer to the government’s plan of privatisation as news reports suggested that Saudi Aramco is likely to have shown interest to buy the government’s stake. The Centre has proposed to entirely sell its 53.3% stake in Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd.
HAL: The stalemate between workers and management of public-sector unit Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd is likely to be prolonged as both sides have refused to soften their stand on the contentious wage revision issue affecting production at India’s largest aircraft maker. This is one of the biggest strikes in the 79-year old history of the aircraft maker.
IOCL: The state-run issuer plans to raise  ₹60 billion via local-currency bonds this financial year, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd Director Finance Sandeep Kumar Gupta said, as reported by Bloomberg. India’s largest state-owned downstream petroleum firm by earnings plans to spend 250 billion rupees as capital expenditure this fiscal.

Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) have increased as much as 18% since its annual general meeting on 12 August where chairman and managing director, Mukesh Ambani, said the company will be a zero net debt one within the next 18 months by 31 March 2021. In that backdrop, when RIL announces its September quarter results on Friday, “any signs of decline in capex intensity should increase confidence in our view,"" said analysts from HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Pvt. Ltd.
That apart, the sequential recovery in refining margin, should help RIL’s refining business earnings. For perspective, benchmark Singapore GRMs have averaged to $6.5 a barrel for the September quarter from $3.5 a barrel during the June quarter. “A sharp recovery in refining margins coupled with lower ethane and LNG prices, and higher petchem volumes should partly offset weakness in benchmark chemical margins and deliver a 7% qoq growth in standalone earnings,"" said HSBC analysts in a report on 8 October.
Separately, state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) are expected to cough up a good set of numbers for the September quarter. OMCs include Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC). Performance of these companies will get a boost from the rebound in refining margin. Further, auto fuel marketing margins have remained resilient. These two factors are likely to set off inventory and forex losses to some extent.
Analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities expect BPCL and HPCL to report 20-23% qoq increase in Ebitda, despite accounting for  ₹1000-1100 crore of inventory and forex losses. The broker expects IOC to report 20% qoq decline in Ebitda, impacted by  ₹3300 crore of inventory and forex losses. Ebitda, a key measure of profitability, is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. IOC’s profitability is expected to be relatively weaker than its peers, HPCL and BPCL, mainly owing to higher inventory losses.
Meanwhile, crude oil prices have declined by about 18% on a year-on-year basis. This is expected to drag down profits of oil producers such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltd as price realisation gets adversely affected.
In keeping with the optimism in broader markets, shares of all these companies have run up after the corporate tax rate cuts. As such, September quarter results are not expected to fuel big jumps in share prices. “The stock prices, in our view, are unlikely to move on earnings but would be news flow dependent,"" wrote analysts from J.P. Morgan India in a report on 7 October. “For the broader state owned enterprises space, how the government moves on the potential BPCL privatization would be an important driver for stocks. For Reliance, the key events that investors are focused on are the completion of various deleveraging deals,"" add J.P. Morgan analysts."

Zee Entertainment: The company, surrounded by concerns over financial stress, will announce its earnings for the September quarter today. In another development, Russia’s VTB Capital Plc said it has acquired rights to sell Essel Media Ventures Ltd’s 10.71% stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd to recover loan dues. VTB Capital is in talks with two potential investors to sell the said stake.
Bharti Airtel: Swedish telecom gear maker Ericsson on Wednesday signed a deal with Bharti Airtel Ltd to deploy its 5G-ready Cloud packet core in the domestic telecom major's network in the country. The deployment would enhance capacity in Airtel's network and enable it to address the rapidly-growing demand for high-speed data services, Ericsson said in a statement.
TVS Motor: Investors will watch this space as the two-wheeler manufacturing company will post its September quarter earnings today. Demand slowdown in the auto sector has impacted sales of the company, with sales declining more than 25% to 315,912 units in September as against 423,939 units in the same month last year.
Bajaj Auto: India's second largest motorcycle manufacturer on Wednesday announced that it will again foray into the scooter market with the launch of electronic scooter Chetak. This after the auto company stopped manufacturing scooters a decade ago. The Pune-based company did not reveal the price of the product and will announce it before beginning dispatches.
HDIL: Promoters of bankrupt real estate firm Housing Development Infrastructure Ltd have written a letter to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and other agencies to sell their assets and repay the loans owed to Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank Ltd (PMC). HDIL promoters have allegedly siphoned off funds worth Ra 6,500 crore with the help of PMC Bank management.
HPCL: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) is likely to sell its stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) as the company is reportedly grappling with the latter’s cost and not able to derive profit from HPCL’s acquisition. Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan also said ONGC, which last year acquired HPCL for a massive  ₹36,915 crore, was free to divest its stake.
ONGC: The government plans to get ONGC to sell it entire 51.11% stake in HPCL as it can fetch high dividend for the government. Despite being the majority stakeholder in the company, ONGC has only got one member on the board and no say in the management.

32,2019-10-20,BPCL,"BPCL operates four refineries at Mumbai, Kochi in Kerala, Bina in Madhya Pradesh and Numaligarh in AssamIn of its most expensive buys, ONGC last year paid  ₹36,915 crore to purchase the government's entire 51.11% stake in HPCL

NEW DELHI :
Not one but two oil companies - BPCL and HPCL - may go under the hammer this fiscal with state-owned oil and gas explorer ONGC now looking to sell its stake in recently-acquired refiner HPCL to a strategic investor, possibly an overseas oil company, to regain debt-free status of the company existing prior to the expensive buy.
The plan for Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) follows the government's go ahead to invite a strategic investor for Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) where the Centre owns 53 per cent stake.
Government sources indicated that the board of ONGC has informally debated on continuing to hold on to HPCL as its subsidiary since no synergy was flowing from its acquisition but the expensive buy had only added debt burden on the parent. ""The matter may be brought up again before the board to finalise future course of action,"" sources added.
An ONGC spokesperson could not be contacted and a questionnaire mailed to the company on the issues remained unanswered.
In of its most expensive buys, ONGC last year paid  ₹36,915 crore to purchase the government's entire 51.11% stake in HPCL. The acquisition turned the character of ONGC from being a debt-free company to one with no cash and loads of debt on its books. ONGC took loan of close to  ₹25,000 crore to buy the government's equity in HPCL.
In addition, HPCL's acquisition has so far not worked to the advantage of ONGC as synergies have not flowed in. Moreover, HPCL failed to recognize ONGC as its promoter till recently. Only after the SEBI's intervention, HPCL decided to recognize its majority shareholder as promoter. ONGC has just one member on the HPCL board.
""With the government repealing the acts that nationalised HPCL and BPCL, hurdles have been removed for divestment of share in the two companies. ONGC can take advantage of this to sell either full or part of its holding in HPCL to a strategic investor,"" said the government source quoted earlier.
ONGC's 51.11% stake at current share prices of HPCL on the BSE would fetch the oil explorer close to  ₹25,000 crore. Even a lower state sale would substantially improve the company's ability to reduce its debt.
With regard to BPCL, disinvestment department DIPAM is working out a plan to offload entire government equity of 53.29 per cent in the fuel refiner and retailer to a strategic partner, possibly a large overseas oil entity like Saudi Aramco, Total, ExxonMobil, and Shell. However, with oil market globally facing a slowdown with demand not picking up despite supply squeeze, the appetite for a large acquisition becomes difficult.
The government's stake in HPCL is worth over  ₹60,000 crore at prevailing price of BPCL shares on BSE. If the buyer has to further acquire 25 per cent share in an open offer as per takeover code, the total amount will rise close to  ₹1 lakh crore. This is considered too high even by international standards.
""Government would have to stagger the equity dilution or decide to keep certain shareholding intact with it to make BPCL's disinvestment possible this fiscal,"" said an oil sector expert asking not to be named.
While no Indian company looks like mobilising such huge funds for BPCL's buy, industry experts hinted that companies from Russia and the Gulf region could be targeted to get the necessary investment. This, sources said, could be done through government to government talks as most oil companies in the region are state-controlled.
BPCL, in present times, will be an attractive buy for companies ranging from Saudi Aramco of Saudi Arabia to French energy giant Total SA which are vying to enter the world's fastest-growing fuel retail market including entry in retail space where BPCL has significant presence.
Alternatively, the government could also keep other oil PSUs such as Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), or OIL India on a standby to go in for share buybacks in the event strategic sale to a private partner met with little success.
BPCL operates four refineries at Mumbai, Kochi in Kerala, Bina in Madhya Pradesh and Numaligarh in Assam with a combined capacity to convert 38.3 million tonnes of crude oil into fuel. It has 15,078 petrol pumps and 6,004 LPG distributors.
The government proposes to raise  ₹1.05 lakh crore from disinvestment in the current financial year. It had exceeded asset-sale targets of  ₹1 lakh crore in FY18 and  ₹80,000 crore in FY19."
31,2019-10-20,BPCL,"Aramco, Rosneft, Shell among firms likely to bid for govt’s 53.3% stakeThe proceeds from the stake sale will be crucial for the government to contain its fiscal deficit

Mumbai: Saudi Aramco, Rosneft, Kuwait Petroleum, ExxonMobil, Shell, Total SA and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. are among companies that have had conversations with the government on asset sales and are likely to bid for the government’s stake in Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, two people aware of the matter said.
“While a formal interest from the potential bidders is expected in due course, all the above names are part of the list that the government will reach out to,"" said one of the two people cited above, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The privatization of BPCL is expected to attract global energy majors given that India is the world’s fastest-growing major oil market. The proceeds from the sale will also be crucial for the government to contain its fiscal deficit amid lower-than-expected goods and services tax collections and a corporate tax cut that will cost the exchequer  ₹1.45 trillion.
The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) is in the process of hiring investment banker, legal adviser and asset valuer to execute the stake sale. “DIPAM would appoint an adviser and a valuer in November. The valuation report is expected to be submitted in 50 days,"" the second person cited above said.
A spokesperson for Shell India said it does “not comment on market speculation."" A New Delhi-based spokesperson for ExxonMobil said, “We do not comment on market rumours or speculation about our business plans. ExxonMobil continuously evaluates its global portfolio of businesses and opportunities for growth, restructuring or divestment, depending upon fit with its overall strategic business objectives.""
Requests for comment sent to Saudi Aramco, Rosneft, Kuwait Petroleum, Total and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. remained unanswered until press time on Sunday.
The companies are likely to bid for the government’s 53.3% stake in state-run BPCL either on their own or as part of a consortium.
“We expect significant interest for the government’s stake in BPCL. The company’s downstream business is quite promising and is the most professionally run organisation among oil marketing companies. It is a good bet for any company that plans to have a foothold in the Indian market,"" said the first person cited above.
The government plans to meet at least a third of its  ₹1.05 trillion disinvestment target by selling its stake in BPCL.
A core group of secretaries on divestment approved the privatization of BPCL on 30 September.
Technical bids by potential advisers, legal advisers and valuers for the privatization move are scheduled to be opened on 4 November and presentations by the eligible bidders for acting as an adviser for the privatization of BPCL would be held within one week of that. Financial bids of the shortlisted bidders will be opened shortly.
“Rosneft, which acquired Essar Oil, and BP Plc, which announced a 49% stake in oil marketing joint venture with RIL, is likely to bid. Kuwait Petroleum (bid for IBP, was shortlisted to bid for HPCL in 2003 and wants to acquire downstream assets in Asia), Total SA (to invest $800m in Indian gas sector), ExxonMobil, Shell (second highest bidder for IBP) and ADNOC may also bid for BPCL,"" Vidyadhar Ginde, an analyst at ICICI Securities, said in a 14 October report on BPCL’s privatization.
BPCL was nationalized in 1976 by an Act of Parliament after being set up in the 1920s as Burmah Shell, an alliance between Royal Dutch Shell and Burmah Oil Co and Asiatic Petroleum (India).
This is not the first time that a Bharatiya Janata Party-led government has mooted the privatization of BPCL.
A similar attempt in 2003 by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government was scuttled by the Supreme Court, which had then ruled that the privatization required parliamentary approval. The Narendra Modi government which enjoys a majority has repealed the legislation, clearing the way for the stake sale.
The government had earlier sold its stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd to state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd at a roughly 18% premium to prevailing prices. Analysts say the premium can be much higher in the case of privatization."

NBFCs Bond with World, Muthoot Fin Eyes $450m
Gold loan company Muthoot Finance is set to raise about $450 million in its maiden bond sale in the overseas market, reinforcing the fact that capital-starved non-banking finance companies (NBFC) are increasingly tapping global investors, The Economic Times reported citing three people with direct knowledge of the matter. The bonds will be sold to global investors including those from the US, what is known as 144A in market parlance. The papers will mature in three years. Muthoot Finance plans to use the proceeds for both refinancing and other business purposes. The issuance may open for subscription this week. Investment bankers have already conducted global roadshows in places like New York, London, Singapore, Los Angeles to galvanise investor response. The company has appointed Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered Bank for the proposed issuance as those banks are helping them to raise the money. The initial price guidance is not yet fixed by the investment bankers. The firm reported 8% rise in its net profit at  ₹530 crore in the April-June quarter this year. During the period, the group expanded its loans nearly 6% year-on-year to  ₹40,602 crore. Investors, many of whom are seen shying away from NBFCs, are attracted by Muthoot Finance as its loans are backed by good collaterals. The proposed bond sale is part of the company’s medium-term note (MTN) programme. Fitch Ratings has assigned a ‘BB+’ rating to Muthoot Finance’s $2 billion MTN programme with a stable outlook."
29,2019-10-28,BPCL,"Anadarko had originally offered a 20 per cent stake in Area-1 to BPCL but the state-owned firm bought only half of it and the rest was picked up by VideoconVideocon in 2013 sold the same stake to ONGC Videsh Ltd for $2.475 billion

NEW DELHI :
The government is looking into state-owned Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd's (BPCL) investments in a gas block in Mozambique and has not yet formally given its approval to the firm for further spendings, sources said.
Bharat PetroResources Ltd (BPRL), an exploration and production subsidiary of BPCL, had in August 2008 bought a 10 per cent stake in Area-1 Offshore of the Rovuma Block from the US energy major Anadarko Petroleum Corp for USD 75 million. That same month Videocon through its subsidiary acquired a 10 per cent stake in the same block for an equivalent block.
Sources privy to the development said Anadarko had originally offered a 20 per cent stake in Area-1 to BPCL but the state-owned firm bought only half of it and the rest was picked up by Videocon.
Videocon in 2013 sold the same stake to ONGC Videsh Ltd for USD 2.475 billion.
Sources said the government is looking into reasons why BPCL did not buy the entire 20 per cent stake offered to it by Anadarko. Also, why it did not get other state-owned firms like ONGC involved if it wanted the exploration risk to be shared by splitting the 20 per cent stake.
These inquests have led to the government not formally according approval to BPCL to invest a further USD 2.2-2.4 billion in the development of a giant gas field discovered in Area-1.
The proposal was reviewed by an informal ministerial panel headed by Home Minister Amit Shah in June this year.
The BJP-led NDA government since first coming to power in 2014 has been critical of the nearly USD 6 billion spent by the Indian public sector firms to take 30 per cent stake in the Rovuma Offshore Area-1 in Mozambique during the Congress-led UPA regime, as falling oil and gas prices did not justify such huge investments.
Besides buying Videocon's 10 per cent stake for USD 2.475 billion, ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), had bought another 10 per cent stake from project operator Anadarko of US for USD 2.64 billion.
It later gave 4 per cent out of the stake bought from Videocon to Oil India Ltd.
Sources said even the OVL deal had in the first term of Modi government come under the scanner following allegations that the company might have overpaid Videocon.
Videocon was in 2012 willing to sell its stake to OVL at a small premium to the price Thailand's PTT Exploration and Production paid for acquiring an 8.5 per cent stake in the same block from Cove Energy for £1.22 billion (USD 1.9 billion at the exchange rate prevalent at that time).
The 10 per cent stake, they said, was available to OVL for about USD 2.3 billion or so but the company a year later paid USD 2.475 billion to Videocon.
OVL had strongly refuted the allegations then and it isn't known what happened to that scrutiny.
Woodlands, Texas-based energy exploration company Anadarko, which was later acquired by Occidental, is the operator of the block. Other partners in Area 1 include Mitsui with 20 per cent stake, ENH (15 per cent) and PTTEP (8.5 per cent).
Gas from the block is to be converted into liquefied natural gas (LNG) for transportation by ships to markets like India.

28,2019-11-03,BPCL,"DIPAM has started the process to appoint advisors for the sale of entire government stake in BPCLThe government stake is worth over  ₹60,000 crore at the prevailing price of BPCL shares on the BSE

New Delhi: The government may consider two-phased disinvestment for public sector oil refiner and retailer Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), if the initial strategic sale of the entire 53.29% government stake in the company fails to get requisite response.
According to official sources, there is fear that no company, including global majors, may commit to invest close to  ₹1 lakh crore required to complete the transanction at one go. Thus, the government may sell half or around 26-27% of its share first and consider complete exit from BPCL at a later stage when the valuation improves after the fund infusion by the strategic investor.
The government has tried this model earlier during the strategic disinvestment of metal and mining PSUs -- Hindustan Zinc Ltd and BALCO. Then Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had retained minority shareholding in these PSUs after sale and change of management control.
""The strategic sale of BSNL would require investors to put in close to  ₹1 lakh crore. While large global oil corporations have the financial muscle to commit such kind of investment, nobody would like to take such a huge risk at a time when oil markets are subdued and there is a gradual shift in energy mix towards renewables and electric mobility,"" said a top official of oil PSU on condition of anonymity.
The Disinvestment Department (DIPAM) has started the process to appoint advisors for the sale of entire government stake in BPCL. While the mandate of advisors is to come up with fair valuation, identify investors and close the deal, sources said they might also present two scenarios -- one where 53.29% stake is sold to a strategic investor, and the other where strategic investor will pick up half of this and take the management control by virtue of having the largest shareholding.
In the second scenario, the government will continue with up to 26% holding in BPCL, a portion of which it might dilute when the strategic investor comes up with an open offer. It may also keep a portion for sale at a later stage at higher valuations after the investor pumps in money and lets it grow.
The government stake is worth over  ₹60,000 crore at the prevailing price of BPCL shares on the BSE. If the buyer has to further acquire 25 per cent share in an open offer as per the takeover code, the total amount will rise close to  ₹1 lakh crore. This is considered too high even by international standards.
On its part, the DIPAM is working out a plan to offload entire government equity to a strategic partner, possibly a large overseas oil entity, like Saudi Aramco, Total, ExxonMobil and Shell. But with the global oil market facing a slump with demand not growing despite supply squeeze, the appetite for a large acquisition becomes difficult.
While no Indian company looks like mobilising such huge funds for BPCL buy, industry experts indicated that companies from Russia and the Gulf could be targeted to get the necessary investment. This, sources said, could be done through government to government talks as most oil companies in the region are state-controlled.
BPCL could be an attractive buy for firms, ranging from Saudi Aramco to French energy giant Total, which are vying to enter the world's fastest-growing fuel retail market, where BPCL has significant presence.
Alternatively, the government could also keep other oil PSUs, like Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and OIL India, on a standby to go in for share buybacks in the event strategic sale to a private partner having little success.
BPCL operates four refineries at Mumbai, Kochi in Kerala, Bina in Madhya Pradesh and Numaligarh in Assam with a combined capacity to convert 38.3 million tonnes of crude oil into fuel. It has 15,078 petrol pumps and 6,004 LPG distributors.
The government proposes to raise  ₹1.05 lakh crore from disinvestment in this financial year. It had exceeded asset-sale targets of  ₹1 lakh crore in FY18 and  ₹80,000 crore in FY19."
27,2019-11-05,BPCL,"Proposals of several refiners to set up ethanol plants have failed to achieve financial closure due to an RBI ruleCentral bank regulations mandate that banks limit their exposure to 25% of their capital for connected parties

Mumbai: An ambitious project to convert thousands of tonnes of agricultural waste in the farmlands of northern India into biofuel and thereby lessen Delhi annual affair with toxic air pollution, a serious health hazard, has run into delays.
Several oil marketing companies such Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL), which had between 2016 and 2017 decided to set up 2G ethanol or bio-refineries, have failed to attain financial closure for the projects, with several lenders citing a recent Reserve Bank of India (RBI) directive that caps single borrower exposure limits by commercial banks.
Over the past few days, Delhi has witnessed a severe deterioration in its air quality, with burning of crop stubble by farmers in neighbouring states emerging as one of the key causes of air pollution. On Monday afternoon, Delhi's air quality index was at 438.
Proposed 2G ethanol plants were to offer a solution to this problem. 2G ethanol is produced using non-edible agricultural waste left over after harvesting. This can include corn cobs, rice straw, and wheat straw, among others, which is converted to cellulose which can later be fermented to form ethanol, which is turn can be blended with conventional fuel.
While IOCL was to set up one bio-refinery each in Haryana and Gujarat, HPCL had decided to set up one in Bathinda and BPCL in Odisha's Bargarh district. ""The plan to build these bio-refineries is on but the progress has slowed as despite guarantees from the OMCs for a 100% offtake for 10 years, today the bankers are not releasing the debt funding. For most plants, the permissions are in place but due to paucity of funds, the progress has slowed,"" said a senior official from one of the companies spoken above.
Emails sent to the OMCs did not elicit any response. Email sent to the ministry of petroleum and natural gas also went unanswered.
These plants were to come up at locations close to farmlands, in order to reduce the costs of transportation of the raw material to the refineries. OMCs planned to set up a blending refinery or depot close to the farmlands. ""Our plans to set up these bio-refineries are still in place. It's just that a high capex for us is a constraint in the sense that we would prioritize other projects which need high capex and attention at the moment. Each bio-refinery would need Rs1000 crore while capex for other projects is far higher,"" said another senior official from an oil marketing company.
Banks, on the other hand, say that while they are not opposed to lending to the oil marketing companies (OMCs), they are bound by a recent RBI directive which caps exposure to single borrower. The RBI’s large exposure framework restricts our exposure to a single borrower to 20% of our capital base,"" said a senior banker with a large public sector bank.
The RBI regulations, which came into effect on 1 April, also mandate that banks limit their exposure to 25% of their capital for connected parties.
According to the banker quoted above, most large banks, primary lenders to OMCs are close to this ceiling and therefore do not have much headroom. He added that the merger of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and HPCL last year has resulted in exposures in two separate entities being clubbed as one and therefore shrunk the space for additional lending.
in 2016, the large exposure framework seeks to reduce concentration risk in the banking industry, already saddled with bad loans. It aims to align with the standards on a supervisory framework for measuring and controlling large exposures issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).
government with an aim to reduce crude oil import and contain the oil import bill has been promoting ethanol production for India’s energy security. The new Biofuel Policy 2018 allows the use of other than molasses as feedstock to manufacture ethanol in the country. This includes sugarcane juice, agricultural waste, corn, surplus food grains, among others. The policy has fixed a target of achieving 20% ethanol blending with petrol by 2030. Internally, the government aims to achieve the first milestone of 10% ethanol blending with petrol by 2022."

24,2019-11-08,BPCL,"The state-owned Bharat Petroleum is being put on the block, but many expect another PSU, Indian Oil Corporation, to be the chief bidder

India’s Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said that the government has “no business to be in business"". Coming from a top minister, this is interesting, to say the least. State participation in business has remained high in India despite periodic avowals to privatize public sector units (PSUs)—a legacy of an Indian policy in the early decades of freedom, when the State wanted control of the “commanding heights"" of the economy. After liberalization, the government’s withdrawal from assorted businesses has proceeded only in fits and starts. Pradhan’s emphatic endorsement of this free-market agenda makes one wonder if the government indeed wants to offload its ownership of oil companies.
True, the state-owned Bharat Petroleum is being put on the block, but many expect another PSU, Indian Oil Corporation, to be the chief bidder. Pradhan, though, said that his statement was not just a slogan but a philosophy for him. Encouraging private competition in the oil sector would benefit consumers the most, he said, citing aviation and telecommunications as examples of the wonders of opening up.
If the Centre intends to withdraw from the oil sector entirely, it would be welcome. Privatization would turn the industry more efficient, reduce prices and spur innovation—so long as sufficient rivalry prevails. For this, foreign investment would have to play a role. Disinvestment needs to be seen as a programme aimed at better outcomes for the economy, and not
just as a revenue raising measure for the government to contain its fiscal deficit. What’s philosophy for Pradhan needs to become practice."

MUMBAI :
Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) has not yet received any official communication from the government on its plan to sell its 53.3% stake in public sector oil marketing company, N Vijayagopal, director (finance) said on Friday.
""The decision to privatise has to be taken at the level of the Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs and, as far as I know, that is yet to happen,"" Vijayagopal told reporters here. ""The company has not changed any business decisions in anticipation of the stake sale. If the government decides to sell its stake, we (management of BPCL) will be part of the process.""
On 20 October, Mint reported that Saudi Aramco, Rosneft, Kuwait Petroleum, ExxonMobil, Shell, Total SA and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company have had conversations with the government on bidding for the latter's stake in BPCL. A core group of secretaries on divestment approved the privatization of BPCL on September 30, while the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management is in the process of appointing a transaction advisor, legal advisor and an asset valuer.
Meanwhile, BPCL is seeing a decline in its diesel sales in line with other oil marketing companies, reflecting the widespread economic slowdown in India. The domestic diesel market, a key petroleum product used widely in the hinterland and supported by government subsidies, shrunk by 2.5% in the September quarter. BPCL's diesel sales fell by 2.4%, while petrol sales rose 6.7%.
For the first time, BPCL exported 200,000 tonne diesel in September with sales falling in the domestic market.
""In October, we expected diesel sales to pick up because of the festive season but growth was negative again,"" Vijayagopal said. ""We don't anticipate that diesel sales will pick up overnight.""
He said the company has decided to invite tenders for term contracts for diesel exports up to March 2020 and will sell 3-4 parcels of 200,000 tonnes each per month. Diesel exports are expected to be higher starting Q3 even as the domestic market lags.
BPCL reported a net profit of  ₹1709 crore in the September quarter, up 40% from the year-ago period. The gross refining margins - the weighted average difference between the cost of crude oil and realisations from sales of refined products - stood at $3.38 a barrel, compared to $5.57 a barrel in the year-ago period.
Total revenue decreased from  ₹82,924 crore to  ₹75,056 crore even as operating profit (EBITDA) rose to  ₹3246 crore in the September quarter. The company has completed  ₹4030 crore of its  ₹7950 crore capital expenditure target for the fiscal and has planned capital expenditure of  ₹12,000 crore for FY21.
BPCL commissioned 274 retail outlets in Q2FY20, taking its total to 15,177 outlets. The company said it is focusing its retail expansion in rural markets in eastern India where demand for petroleum products is growing the fastest. ""We now have a 15% market share in rural sales and we want to increase this to 24-25% in 4 years,"" Vijayagopal said. The company aims to open 1000-1500 new outlets every year for the next 3-4 years."
23,2019-11-10,BPCL,"The proceeds from govt disinvestment currently stand at  ₹12,995.46 crore with the inclusion of  ₹637.97 crore realised from IRCTC IPOMarket analysts believe the sale of the govt's 53.29% stake in BPCL could fetch at least  ₹57,000 crore, or 53.5% of the fiscal's disinvestment revenue target

The proceeds from government disinvestment currently stand at  ₹12,995.46 crore with the inclusion of  ₹637.97 crore realised from the initial public offer (IPO) of Indian Railway catering arm IRCTC, according to Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (Dipam) data.
During the current financial year 2019-20,  ₹12,995.46 crore have been obtained by the exchequer through disinvestment transactions so far. Prior to the IRCTC proceeds, the government had garnered  ₹12,357.49 crore from divestments.
IRCTC, which is one of the stellar performers among debut listing companies this year, closed trade on the BSE on Friday  ₹874 a share. It now commands a market capitalisation  ₹14,000 crore crore as against a valuation of  ₹5,120 crore ($721 million) it sought through the public offering.
The government's disinvestment target for the current fiscal is  ₹1.05 trillion. It is looking to divest up to 25% stake in another railway subsidiary — RailTel Corporation — through an IPO, and, according to sources here, this will hit the market around mid-January 2020.
Although a very small amount has been generated so far through divestments, market analysts believe the sale of the government's 53.29% stake in BPCL could alone fetch at least  ₹57,000 crore, or 53.5% of the fiscal's disinvestment revenue target.
The value of the government's stake in BPCL, Shipping Corporation (63.75%), ConCor (30%), NEEPCO (100%) and THDC (75%) could be about  ₹84,000 crore at current prices.
However, all strategic sell-offs have to be fast tracked to be able to go near the target, the analysts added."

21,2019-11-12,BPCL,"The move to allow all firms with a net worth of  ₹250 crore to set up fuel retail outlets aims to boost investmentThe change in the fuel retail policy will definitely lead to an increase in competition and the customers will benefit, IOC chairman said

In a significant move last month, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government opened up the fuel retail market by lowering the entry barrier.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved the review guidelines, which will allow all companies with a net worth of  ₹250 crore to set up retail fuel outlets.
Under existing rules, companies were required to invest at least  ₹2,000 crore in the petroleum sector to enter the fuel retail segment, which many believed, favoured state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs).
The Centre’s move will now allow even non-energy companies to sell petrol and diesel to consumers, but with a few riders—they can open multiple dealerships of more than one state-run OMC, but the outlets must be set up at different locations. Besides, the companies will have to install facilities for marketing at least one new-generation alternative fuel, such as compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), biofuels, or electric charging units. Apart from OMCs, any private entity can source and sell fuel from anyone.
The landmark decision comes amid a slump in fuel demand in September, and a fall in commercial vehicle traffic on highways, besides the consumption demand slump in a slowing economy. However, there was a rise in domestic cooking gas and petrol consumption.
Private sector oil companies such as Reliance Industries Ltd, Essar Oil Ltd and Shell India, have some presence in fuel retailing, but the segment is dominated by state-run OMCs such as Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd.
“The existing policy for granting authorization to market transportation fuels had not undergone any change for the last 17 years since 2002. It has now been revised to bring it in line with the changing market dynamics and with a view to encourage investment from private players, including foreign players,"" the government said in a statement.
In recent times, the Indian energy space has been witnessing growing interest from investors. While Adani Gas Ltd and Total SA plan to build a gas fuel retail network of 1,500 outlets along highways, the world’s largest oil producer, Saudi Arabian Oil Co. (Saudi Aramco), is also considering entering the fuel retailing market in India. That apart, other global energy majors, such as Rosneft, Kuwait Petroleum, ExxonMobil, Shell and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. are planning to acquire the government’s stake in BPCL.
“As far as pricing is concerned, existing companies are fairly efficient. Large multinational players are already present in the retail market. So, competition is already there,"" IOC chairman Sanjiv Singh had said last month. “But, the change in policy will definitely lead to an increase in competition and the customers will benefit.""
Experts welcomed the move. “The Indian retail fuel market is overarchingly dominated by PSUs, which control about 90% of the existing retail outlets and occupy the high-traffic sites at urban centres and highways. Accordingly, the decision...would allow an increase in market participation,"" said K. Ravichandran, senior vice-president and group head, corporate ratings, Icra in a statement.
IOC, the largest OMC in India with around 43% market share in fuel retailing, or 65,202 outlets, said on 31 October that diesel consumption grew by around 1% in the first six months of the current financial year.
“When we talk about gasoline (petrol), in the first six months, we saw growth of close to 9%, which is fairly good in spite of a reduced sale of auto vehicles. We are still seeing decent growth as far as gasoline is concerned,"" Singh added.
“While demand for petroleum products has been declining globally on account of increasing environmental concerns and thrust on electric vehicles, India continues to be a growth market, and thus a key market for international players,"" India Ratings and Research wrote in a 5 November report.
However, concerns remain. Indian businesses have been battling a demand slowdown and liquidity crunch, which resulted in the economic growth rate cooling to a six-year-low of 5% in the June quarter, and private consumption expenditure was at an 18-quarter-low of 3.1%.

19,2019-11-19,BPCL,"When asked specifically on its plan to acquire majority stake in BPCL whether solely or in a consortium, Saudi Aramco declined to commentAramco's lesser focus on BPCL disinvestment may be a cause of worry for the government that is betting big on the oil giant to takeover its entire equity in BPCL

NEW DELHI :
World's largest oil company Aramco is yet to make up its mind to participate in disinvestment of Indian fuel refiner and retailer Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) where government intends to sell its entire 53.29 per cent stake to a strategic investor.
Sources privy to the development said that Aramco, which kicked off the final phase of its $25 billion IPO on Sunday, is focused on Indian investment primarily to conclude the purchase of 20 per cent stake in Reliance Industries' oil to chemical division and expansion of its upstream business in high growth markets including India. Entering India with a large scale investment in a public sector oil refiner and retailer is not on the horizon as on now, sources said.
When asked specifically on its plan to acquire majority stake in BPCL whether solely or in a consortium, Saudi Aramco declined to comment.
Aramco's lesser focus on BPCL disinvestment may be a cause of worry for the Indian government that is betting big on the oil giant to takeover its entire equity in BPCL. 
In fact, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has indicated that BPCL disinvestment may be completed in current fiscal. While government is expected to launch a roadshow for BPCL disinvestment in key global markets soon, there is a strong belief that Aramco fits the bill perfectly with its sheer scale of operations and large size of the balance sheet.
""For Aramco, its huge IPO is of prime concern now. It is selling 1.5 per cent stake in the market that could fetch over $25 billion.Other things, including investments in key markets would come thereafter. Moreover, with BPCL disinvestment requiring investor to pump in close to  ₹1lakh crore (about  ₹60,000 crore for government's stake and balance for open offer), even a company of the size of Aramco will think twice,"" said an global oil and gas analyst who did not wish to be named on the issue.
Aramco in the past has remained upbeat about the prospect of investment in the Indian market, which is among the largest oil consumers in the world and where demand scenario is expected to remain firm next few decades.This mood has also reflected in the 658 page prospectus filed by the company in the run up to its IPO where apart from its intention to invest in RIL, it has said that company is focussing its downstream investments in areas of high-growth, including India.
Indian government is also looking at Aramco's investment in $60 billion oil refinery proposed in Maharashtra as well get its investment in oil marketing and retailing in the country.
""The bag seems too full for Aramco already and if at all a decision of BPCL stake purchase is taken, Aramco may join hands with some other Indian or overseas player to pick government of India's equity in the company,"" said the source quoted earlier.
Public sector Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has also not ruled out its interest for BPCL but is waiting for a green signal from the government to consider placing its interest. However, IOC may not have the financial muscle to for large stake buy and government does not want to add debt burden on PSUs. In such a scenario, analysts believe a possible collaboration between Aramco and IOC may work out. IOC also has started limited foray in Saudi Arabia by helping set up few fuel stations. However, government officials denied build up of any such collaboration at this juncture.
Government's stake is worth over  ₹60,000 crore at prevailing price of BPCL shares on BSE. If the buyer has to further acquire 25 per cent share in an open offer as per takeover code, the total amount with rise close to  ₹1 lakh crore. This is considered too high even by international standards.
On its part, DIPAM is working out a plan to offload entire government equity to a strategic partner, possibly a large overseas oil entity like Saudi Aramco, Total, ExxonMobil, Shell. However, with oil market globally facing a slowdown with demand not picking up despite supply squeeze, the appetite for a large acquisition becomes difficult.
BPCL operates four refineries at Mumbai, Kochi in Kerala, Bina in Madhya Pradesh and Numaligarh in Assam with a combined capacity to convert 38.3 million tonnes of crude oil into fuel. It has 15,078 petrol pumps and 6,004 LPG distributors.
The government proposes to raise  ₹1.05 lakh crore from disinvestment in the current financial year. It had exceeded asset-sale targets of  ₹1 lakh crore in FY18 and  ₹80,000 crore in FY19."

10,2019-11-21,BPCL,"At the current trading price of BPCL, the government's 53.29% stake is valued at a shade less than  ₹62,000 croreBPCL will give buyers ready access to 14% of India's oil refining capacity

NEW DELHI :
Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Thursday hinted that public sector firms such as Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) may not be allowed to bid for buying government stake in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), for which a buyer may have to shell out as much as  ₹90,000 crore.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had on Wednesday decided to sell the government's entire stake in the country's second-largest state refiner BPCL and India's largest shipping company Shipping Corporation of India (SCI). It also approved privatisation of Container Corporation of India while also giving nod to paring stake below 51 per cent in select public sector undertakings but without losing control.
""Since 2014, we have a clear vision that the government has no business to be in business,"" Pradhan told reporters here. ""We have examples of 2-3 sectors such as telecom and aviation where ushering in private participation has led to customers benefiting from price cuts, efficiency, and better service. And yesterday (on Wednesday), several reformist decisions were taken.""
BPCL will give buyers ready access to 14 per cent of India's oil refining capacity and about one-fourth of the fuel marketing infrastructure in the world's fastest-growing energy market.
It, however, will be sold after carving out Numaligarh Refinery from its portfolio and given to a pubic sector unit.
""Numaligarh refinery was set up as per Assam Accord and it will remain a public sector unit. Assam Chief Minister had requested Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) to retain public sector character of Numaligarh Refinery and that has been accepted,"" he said.
Pradhan, however, did not say if IOC or Oil India Ltd, which already has a stake in the refinery and also supplies crude oil to it, will take over the unit.
""The details have to be worked out,"" he said. ""Finance Minister (Nirmala Sitharaman) has stated that the privatisation of BPCL will happen this fiscal and we hope to adhere to the timeline.""
Asked if public sector units will be allowed to bid for the government's 53.29 per cent stake, he said: ""Nitty gritty and details of the disinvestment process will have to be worked out but when I say the government has no business to be in business, it is indicative of possible future course of action.""
At the current trading price of BPCL, the government's 53.29 per cent stake is valued at a shade less than  ₹62,000 crore. On top of this, the acquirer will have to make an open offer to buy an additional 26 per cent stake from minority shareholders for about  ₹30,000 crore.
Last year, the government had sold its entire stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) for  ₹36,915 crore.
Pradhan said the privatisation of BPCL was following the policy of ushering in greater competition in sectors that can sustain on their own.
Greater private participation, like in the telecom and aviation sector, will bring about efficiencies and better service to consumers, he said.
The CCEA had on Wednesday also approved the sale of an entire 63.75 per cent government holding in SCI and 30.8 per cent out of the government's 54.80 per cent stake in Container Corp of India (Concor).
Besides, the government will sell its entire holding in THDC India Ltd (THDCIL) and North Eastern Electric Power Corp Ltd (NEEPCO) to state-owned power generator NTPC Ltd, the finance minister has said.
The government holds 74.23 per cent in THDCIL and 100 per cent NEEPCO.
Parallelly, the Cabinet had also approved reducing government stake in select PSUs such as IOC to below 51 per cent while continuing to retain management control.
The management control will continue to be retained with the government after considering equity held by other state-owned companies in the divested firm.
The government, currently, holds 51.5 per cent in IOC and another 25.9 per cent through state-owned Life Insurance Corp of India (LIC), and explorers ONGC and Oil India Ltd (OIL), and the government can potentially sell 26.4 per cent for about  ₹33,000 crore.
A similar formula can also apply to ONGC and gas utility GAIL India Ltd.
The stake sales are critical for the government to meet its disinvestment target of  ₹1.05 lakh crore set for the current financial year.
At current prices, the government's 30.8 per cent stake in Concor is worth about  ₹10,800 crore, while stake sale in SCI will fetch just over  ₹2,000 crore.
BPCL operates four refineries in Mumbai, Kochi (Kerala), Bina (Madhya Pradesh) and Numaligarh (Assam) with a combined capacity of 38.3 million tonnes per annum, which is 15 per cent of India's total refining capacity of 249.4 million tonnes. After removing three million tonnes capacity of the Numaligarh refinery, the new buyer will get 35.3 million tonnes of refining capacity.
It also owns 15,177 petrol pumps and 6,011 LPG distributor agencies in the country. Besides, it has 51 LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) bottling plants. The company distributes 21 per cent of petroleum products consumed in the country by volume as of March this year and has more than a fifth of the 250 aviation fuel stations in the country.
The government is keen to get international energy majors such as Saudi Aramco, Total SA of France and ExxonMobil to operate in the downstream fuel marketing business so as to bring in greater competition.
Currently, 95 per cent of retail petrol and diesel sales and near 100 per cent of cooking gas (LPG) and kerosene sales are controlled by the public sector units.
As on March 31, BPCL reported cash and cash equivalents of around  ₹5,300 crore, against  ₹10,900 crore of debt maturing over the next 15 months.

The government has decided to promote divestment to boost professionalism. Numaligarh Refinery has been carved out of BPCL’s privatisation due to Assam Accord, Pradhan said today.
On Wednesday, Sitharaman had said the Cabinet has also cleared diluting the government's shareholding in select public-sector undertakings below 51% while retaining its management control.
Pradhan said the government also plans to slowly begin stake dilution in Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL). The Centre, however, will retain its management control in the company.
Besides BPCL, the Cabinet approved selling 30.8% stake in Container Corporation of India Ltd to a strategic buyer along with handing over the management control. The government currently holds 54.8% in the company. The Centre will also dilute its 63.75% stake in Shipping Corporation of India Ltd.
The government will sell its stake and transfer its management control in THDC India Ltd and North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd (NEEPCO) to state-owned NTPC Ltd. While THDC India is a 75:25 joint venture between the Centre and Uttar Pradesh government, the government owns 100% stake in NEEPCO at present."

Cube Highways wins third TOT bundle with  ₹5,011 crore bid
Road developer Cube Highways and Infrastructure Pte Ltd has emerged as the highest bidder in round three of road auctions under the toll-operate-transfer (TOT) model, although its price offer was marginally more than the reserve price set by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Mint reported citing two people close to the development. Cube Highways, which is backed by global infrastructure fund I Squared Capital and the International Finance Corp. (IFC), offered  ₹5,011 crore to the government for a 30-year concession period. This is against the initial estimated concession value (IECV), or reserve price, of  ₹4,995.48 crore set by the NHAI for the road bundle. The state-run highway developer had put up nine stretches of roads, totaling 566.27km across Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and Tamil Nadu, in the third round. It had deferred the deadline for bids twice—from mid-September to 31 October—as potential investors sought more time. National Infrastructure and Investment Fund and IRB Infrastructure Developers also bid for the assets, quoting  ₹4,230 crore and  ₹3,510 crore, respectively. Even before the bidding for the third round was completed, the NHAI started the process to invite expressions of interest for the fourth round of TOT auctions, as it seeks to meet divestment targets and raise funds for new projects. The NHAI, which is the nodal agency of the ministry of road transport and highways, has set an initial estimated concession value of  ₹4,170 crore for the fourth bundle. Bidding is expected to close by 14 January.

Varde Partners may invest  ₹ 1,000 crore in Altico Capital
In a day of mixed developments at stressed home financier Altico Capital, one of its three owners— Varde Partners, would lead the equity infusion of up to  ₹1,000 crore, while the company said its chief executive officer is quitting and would cease to be in that role as early as next week, The Economic Times reported. The company is likely to submit a resolution plan at the lenders’ steering committee meeting to be held next week. According to the plan, US-based Varde will repay the lenders in full and seek additional credit lines from them. The financier is also in advanced talks with SBI Capital. Further, the firm may seek another  ₹1,000 crore of new loans from lenders as it will collectively help finish all those stalled builders’ projects. To be sure, one of the existing investors in Altico bonds reportedly sold the debt recently at yields beyond 71%. Separately, Altico told BSE that CEO Sanjeev Agrawal has “tendered his resignation"" and that November 26 will be his last working day as chief executive. Abu Dhabi Investment Council, Clearwater Capital and Varde are the three sponsors of the property-focused financier. The US-based private equity firm owns about 22%, ADIC holds about 33% and the remainder is in the hands of Singapore-based Clearwater Capital. Altico’s credit exposure is yet to turn into a non-performing asset in bank books. The company has about  ₹800 crore of repayment liabilities until December. Its total outstanding debt stands at  ₹4,361.5 crore.
ONGC plans to raise $500 million via dollar bond sale
Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), India’s largest fuel explorer, plans to raise at least $500 million in a dollar bond sale as soon as next week to refinance part of its debt through cheaper funds, The Economic Times reported citing three people familiar with the matter. This is the state-owned company’s first sale of overseas bonds, although its subsidiary ONGC Videsh has raised dollar funds before. ONGC launched a $2 billion medium-term note programme in August, which allows the company to tap the overseas bond market when needed, subject to market conditions. The bonds are likely to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. The company’s capital expenditure over the past five years totalled  ₹1,45,915 crore and it plans to invest  ₹32,921 crore in the current financial year. If demand for the bond is strong, the company may choose to retain as much as $1billion, the people said. DBS Bank from Singapore, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Standard Chartered are some of the banks involved in the issue.
SBI raises  ₹ 3,800 crore via perpetual bond sale
State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s biggest mass-lender, has raised  ₹3,800 crore by selling perpetual bonds at 8.50% yield to several institutional investors, such as mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds, The Economic Times reported. The money raised will augment the bank’s Tier I capital ratio, likely easing pressure on the lender to raise cash soon through a qualified institutional placement (QIP). HDFC Mutual Fund is said to have bought a large amount of these bonds that are rated AAA/ Stable by Crisil. Nippon India Mutual Fund, Aditya Birla Mutual Fund, Edelweiss Mutual Fund and ICICI Primary Dealership were among the buyers. According to Basel III capital norms, the systemically important SBI needs to maintain a capital adequacy of 12.10%, which includes 8.60% of common equity, 1.5% of Tier I bonds like the perpetual debt raised by the bank on Wednesday and 2% of Tier II bonds. Capital adequacy at 13.59% was higher than required as of September. “With this sale, our capital adequacy improves further to 14%, which means we are more than 150 basis points above what is required by April 2020. This is a cost-effective way of raising capital compared to equity. We expect internal accruals to also add to capital; so there is no urgent need to dilute equity as of now,"" the official cited above said. Earlier this year, the bank had mandated Bank of America Merrill Lynch, CLSA, Kotak Mahindra Capital, and SBI Capital Markets to raise what was touted to be the largest QIP at about  ₹18,000 crore. However, the bank’s shares have fallen from a peak of  ₹372 apiece in July to  ₹329 on Wednesday.

The proposed sale will, however, exclude the strategic Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) in Assam, which will be later sold to another state-run firm, given India’s need to secure fuel supplies for security forces in the north-east.
“A carve-out has been made of NRL,"" she said. “It will be moved out of BPCL and will be retained by a government-owned firm, before disinvestment.""
A strategic investor will get access to BPCL’s refining capacity of 37 million tonnes per annum and around 15,000 retail outlets in the world’s third largest oil consuming nation. The company reported a profit of  ₹7,132 crore on sales of  ₹3.37 trillion in the year ended 31 March.
As part of a consolidation of state-run hydropower companies, the government will sell its 74.23% and 100% stake in THDC and Neepco respectively to government-controlled NTPC Ltd, India’s largest power producer.
Selling these assets will be key to the government meeting its ambitious target of generating  ₹1.05 trillion from asset sales in the current fiscal year. The government’s decision to slash corporate taxes to boost the economy and attract investments has left Sitharaman struggling to meet the year’s fiscal deficit target of 3.3% despite receiving a  ₹1.76 trillion windfall from the Reserve Bank of India.
The CCEA also approved the sale of the government’s 63.75% and 30.8% stake in SCI and Concor respectively, along with management control, to a strategic buyer.
The aggressive asset sales plan comes amid Asia’s third-largest economy growing at the slowest pace in six years in the June quarter.
The decision on BPCL comes in the backdrop of the government also opening up the fuel retail market by lowering the entry barrier and allowing all companies with a net worth of  ₹250 crore to set up outlets. The earlier rules required prior investments of  ₹2,000 crore for companies to enter the fuel retail segment, which many believed, favoured state-run fuel retailers, including Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, BPCL and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd. Private sector oil companies, such as Reliance Industries Ltd, Essar Oil Ltd and Shell India, have some presence in the fuel retailing space that is dominated by the state-run firms.
In recent times, the Indian energy space has been witnessing growing interest from investors. While Adani Gas Ltd and Total SA plan to build a gas fuel retail network of 1,500 outlets along highways, the world’s largest oil producer, Saudi Arabian Oil Co. (Saudi Aramco), is also considering entering the fuel retailing market in India. That apart, global energy majors, such as Rosneft, Kuwait Petroleum, ExxonMobil, Shell and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. are planning to acquire the government’s stake in BPCL.
State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), which accounts for 73% of India’s oil and gas output, acquired the government’s stake in HPCL for  ₹36,915 crore last year.
The government has already decided to privatize national carrier Air India and shut down state-owned trading companies in a signal that it will exit companies in non-strategic sectors.
Also, the government has decided to merge its twin state-run telecom companies—Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Mahanagar Telecom Nigam Ltd—in an effort to turn around the money-losing firms.
The strategy would also see the government look at ways to exploit the vast land assets of the two companies. In March this year, Power Finance Corp Ltd (PFC) completed the purchase of a controlling stake in state-run peer REC Ltd to create an $80-billion lending giant by assets. PFC paid  ₹14,500 crore to the Union government to buy a 52.63% stake in REC.
The Cabinet also approved the food ministry’s decision to import 120,000 tonnes of onions to improve the key kitchen staple’s domestic availability."

Trump said on 11 October that a deal could take as long as five weeks, and investors had initially expected a deal by mid-November.
Back home, the capital market regulator has tightened disclosure norms for reporting loan defaults, a move that will help investors draw an informed conclusion about a firm’s financial health and prevent a sudden erosion of their wealth when such an event is discovered—as was the case in recent instances.
Any default in repayment of principal or interest to lenders by listed companies which continues beyond 30 days from the pre-agreed payment date will have to be disclosed to shareholders within 24 hours of such an event, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in a statement after a board meeting on Wednesday.

8,2019-11-24,BPCL,"The CCEA had on 20 November had given a go-ahead for sale of govt's entire stake in BPCLThe process once completed will trigger invitation of price bids from potential acquirers

New Delhi: In part indication of timelines for privatisation of India's second biggest state oil refiner, the government has set a 50-day deadline for an outside 'asset valuer' to carry out the valuation of all assets of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), a process once completed will trigger invitation of price bids from potential acquirers.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had on November 20 given a go-ahead for sale of government's entire stake in BPCL, Shipping Corporation of India Ltd (SCI), power generator THDC India Ltd (THDCIL) and North Eastern Electric Power Corp Ltd (NEEPCO) to a strategic investor along with management control. It had also approved sale of 30.8 per cent out of its 54.8 per cent interest in Container Corp of India Ltd (Concor).
The stake sale will follow a two-stage process of first inviting expression of interest (EoI) from potential bidders who will after due diligence will be asked to submit price bids in the second part, officials said.
In the run-up to the decision, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) -- the department in finance ministry responsible for disinvestment in PSUs -- had on October 11 issued advertisements seeking transaction and legal advisors as well as asset valuers for the stake sale but masked the identity of the state-owned firm by merely saying they operate under administrative control of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, or Ministry of Power, or Ministry of Shipping or Ministry of Railways.
Soon after the Cabinet approval, DIPAM unmasked the identity of disinvestment targets by issuing 'corrigendum' to the October 11 Request for Proposals (RFPs).
The RFP wanted Asset Valuer to ""identify, describe and list all properties and assets, including intangibles"" and value them according to ""comparison method, income capitalisation, discounted cash flow, cost approach method or replacement valuation"" method.
It wanted the asset valuer to complete its ""valuation report within a period of 50 days from the date of issue of appointment letter "" in case of BPCL, according to RFP.
Last day for submission of bids for appointment as asset valuer was November 4.
Official said DIPAM may invite EoI from potential bidders pending receipt of valuation report but price bids will come in only after getting the valuation report.
A similar process will be followed for India's biggest shipping line SCI and country's largest onland cargo mover Concor, they said.
THDCIL and NEEPCO will be sold to state-owned NTPC Ltd based on valuation report of DIPAM advisers.
Three separate sets of advisors will be appointed for each of the firms for conducting the transaction, preparing legal documents and doing asset valuation.
DIPAM in the corrigendum said: ""Strategic disinvestment of state of Government of India in a CPSE may be read as 'Strategic disinvestment of Government of India shareholding of 53.29 per cent in BPCL (except its equity shareholding of 61.65 per cent in Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) and management control thereon) along with transfer of management control to a strategic buyer.""
The 61.65 per cent of BPCL shareholding in NRL along with management control will be transferred to ""a central public sector enterprise (CPSE) operating in the oil and gas sector"".
It said the government will see 30.8 per cent out of 54.8 per cent stake in Concor to a strategic buyer along with management control and all of government holding in SCI.

6,2019-11-25,BPCL,"GRM is what a refiner makes from turning every barrel of crude to fuelSubdued refining margins also had an impact on the second-quarter earnings of domestic OMCs

Mumbai: Higher than anticipated addition of capacity in 2019 may keep gross refining margins (GRM) of crude oil refiners suppressed for a few more months, said analysts. Against an incremental demand of 0.8mbpd (million barrel per day) an estimated 2.6mbpd of refining capacity came online in 2019.
GRM is what a refiner makes from turning every barrel of crude to fuel.
""In the absence of global recovery, we anticipate that GRMs would remain suppressed for a few more months in lieu of incremental refining capacity addition,"" said Motilal Oswal in a report today.
The report said Chinese teapot refineries have ramped up their utilization rate to 67% vis-à-vis 61% in October-November 2018 as the country increased crude oil import quotas for the former in 2019. ""The higher capacity addition in 2019 is also a response to the higher diesel demand post-implementation of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) norms 2020,"" it said.
IMO norms are tougher quality standards for fuel oil powering ships. Fuel oil, also called furnace oil, is a byproduct of crude oil distillation. It is used in ships, and for steam boilers in power plants and in industrial plants.
Under regulations issued in October 2016 by the IMO, ships must shift to fuel oil with sulphur content below 0.5%, effective January 2020, against the present 3.5%. This, it was believed, would help diesel cracks jump sharply giving GRMs a boost.
However, despite just 50 days left for the new IMO norms to kick in, diesel cracks have failed to revive in line with the expected $25-30 per barrel against $11 per barrel for November 2019 (year to date). During the second quarter of this fiscal, diesel cracks were at $14 per barrel.
""More importantly, the forward curve for diesel depicts an incapacitated scenario of a mere $14-$16 per barrel. ""We believe that as low GRMs persist, higher cost refiners would close their operations and SG GRM would revert to the long-term average of $5-6/bbl,"" the report added.
Subdued refining margins also had an impact on the second-quarter earnings of domestic oil marketing companies (OMCs) - Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd, and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd.
Despite Singapore gross refining margins improving $3 per barrel quarter-on-quarter to $6.5 per barrel, OMCs witnessed weakness in core refining margin with IOCL and HPCL seeing a $0.5 and 0.2 per barrel decline, while BPCL posted a $0.5 per barrel improvement year-on-year, driven by shutdowns and likely higher crude costs.
Adding to their woes was a weak 2.2% year-on-year growth in industry fuel consumption, reflecting an abysmal marketing volume growth for OMCs.
Marketing margins, however, brought some cheer, growing at 3.2%, 8% and 18% year-on-year for IOCL, BPCL and HPCL respectively and supporting earnings."
5,2019-11-26,BPCL,"Staff from IOC, ONGC, HPCL, MTNL, BSNL may join protestsBPCL employees plan to go on strike on 28 Nov against the govt’s decision to privatize the firm

MUMBAI :
Over 12,000 employees of state-run Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) who have threatened to go on strike on 28 November against the Union government’s decision to privatise the company may see workers’ unions of other public sector entities join them in solidarity.
Senior BPCL workers’ union functionaries told Mint that unions cutting across political affiliations from other public sector undertakings (PSUs) such as Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC), Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL), Indian Railways, Mahanagar Telecom Nigam Ltd (MTNL), and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) will join them in planned nationwide protests.
“If the government does not reconsider its decision on BPCL’s privatization, we would be joined by employees of other oil companies in our strike which will go on for multiple days,"" said Praveen Kumar P., general secretary of Cochin Refineries Employees Association, an affiliate of Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC). In an emailed response, a BPCL spokesperson said, “BPCL employee unions have given a strike notice that they plan to observe a day’s strike on 28 November. All efforts are being made to ensure that the refineries and marketing locations are running normal.""
As of 31 March, BPCL had 11,971 permanent and 22,267 temporary, contractual or casual employees. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on 20 November approved the sale of government’s entire stake in BPCL. As part of the privatisation process, potential bidders will have to submit an expression of interest (EoI) and after due diligence will be asked to submit price bids. The government has set a 50-day deadline for an outside “asset valuer"" to carry out the valuation of BPCL’s assets.
The privatisation of BPCL is expected to attract global energy majors, given that India is the world’s fastest-growing major oil market. The proceeds from the sale will also be crucial for the government to contain its fiscal deficit amid lower-than-expected goods and services tax collections and a corporate tax cut that will cost the exchequer  ₹1.45 trillion. The government plans to sell its 53.3% stake in the company which may fetch  ₹60,000 crore.
“We feel cheated by the government now. We had joined BPCL on the security of a government job but with privatization, our livelihoods are threatened. We are protesting for our rights,"" said a BPCL employee on the condition of anonymity.
BPCL was nationalised by an Act of Parliament in 1976 after being set up in the 1920s as Burmah Shell -- an alliance between Royal Dutch Shell, Burmah Oil Co. and Asiatic Petroleum (India).
This is not the first time that a Bharatiya Janata Party-led government has mooted the privatisation of BPCL. A similar attempt in 2003 by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government was scuttled by the Supreme Court, which ruled that the privatisation required parliamentary approval. The Narendra Modi government, which enjoys a majority, has repealed the law, clearing the way for the stake sale."

3,2019-12-02,BPCL,"Expectations from the Bharat Petroleum Corp.’s sale are high, and so is the potentialBPCL shares have risen sharply ahead of the deal. The news flow on divestment is key hereon

The government has appointed Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd as the adviser for the strategic sale of Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), according to a news report last week. The sale of its 53% stake in BPCL remains crucial for the government to meet the divestment target of  ₹1.05 trillion for FY20. At the current price of  ₹511.45, the stake sale can fetch about  ₹59,000 crore.
However, the government said BPCL’s 61.6% stake in Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) will be transferred to a public sector oil company, and will not be part of the deal. Even so, there are high expectations from the stake sale.
Analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd said: “In the event of privatization of BPCL (excluding its equity stake in NRL) through competitive bidding, we estimate BPCL to be valued at: 1)  ₹488/share based on 8 times FY20E EV/Ebitda, 2)  ₹630/share based on 8 times FY21E EV/Ebitda or 3)  ₹946/share based on asset-based valuation, where assets are valued on the basis of recent transactions and in case of refining replacement cost based on Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd’s upcoming Rajasthan refinery.""
EV/Ebitda is a measure of valuing firms. EV refers to enterprise valuation, and Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, a measure of profitability.
Of course, that’s a very wide range for valuation, although it’s fair to conclude that the potential is high. News reports suggest bidding interest will be high. In fact, BPCL shares have risen 40% so far this year in anticipation of the stake sale.
“The optimism on the bid will keep investors engaged at least for the next few months until clarity emerges,"" said an analyst with a foreign broking firm on condition of anonymity.
While the valuation BPCL may fetch will unravel over the coming months, much will also depend on how the government plans to execute the sale process.
“We see multiple benefits for the government from separate and targeted divestment of BPCL’s holding in key subsidiaries, JVs and investments, which are either unrelated to core downstream businesses, such as Bharat Gas Resources Ltd (holding company of gas JVs) and Bharat PetroResources Ltd, or have a distinct geographical presence, such as NRL, or are standalone refining JVs such as Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd,"" said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a report on 26 November.
The government can realize better value if BPCL sells these assets to other firms who are keen on expanding their presence in specific sectors such as gas, upstream or refining, added the Kotak report. This way, it can expect better valuations, compared to a composite value for all the company’s different parts.
And, finally, bidders will need assurance that the regime of free-market pricing for fuel stays. Last year, investors in state-owned oil firms got a shock when they were reportedly asked to sacrifice on marketing margins to help lower the cost of fuel in retail markets."
2,2019-12-11,BPCL,"As part of its strategy to divest stake in BPCL, the government on 21 November decided to carve out NRL from BPCLBPCL holds 61.65% stake in NRL, while Oil India holds 26% and the government of Assam 12.35%

State-run Oil India Ltd may pitch for full control of Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL), according to two executives aware of the development. NRL is a subsidiary of state-run Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL).
As part of its strategy to divest stake in BPCL, the government on 21 November decided to carve out NRL from BPCL. BPCL holds 61.65% stake in NRL, while Oil India holds 26% and the government of Assam 12.35%.
Oil India did not reply to an email sent on 6 December.
NRL was set up at Numaligarh in Assam’s Golaghat district, in accordance with provisions of the Assam Accord signed on 15 August 1985, and has been associated with the industrial and the economic development of the region.
The capacity of NRL is being expanded from the present 3 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) to 9 MMTPA at an investment of  ₹22,594 crore.
The expansion project is targeted to be completed in four years and expected to meet the refining requirements of the North-East region.
The expansion involves laying down a crude oil pipeline from Paradip in Odisha to Numaligarh and a product pipeline from Numaligarh to Siliguri. NRL enjoys the status of a Mini Ratna public sector unit.
“The Assam state government is keen on keeping NRL as it is central to the state. Oil India has also been lobbying hard to take full control of NRL. Citing security concerns, Oil India and the state government have together conveyed their willingness to the central government to acquire NRL,"" said a senior official from an oil marketing company and the first person cited above. He spoke on the condition of anonymity as he is not allowed to speak to the media.
Reports of the BPCL stake sale led to widespread agitations across Assam with the workers’ union in NRL holding regular protests outside the refinery. The refinery has 954 permanent and 2,000 temporary employees.
“It would be easier for the government to sell BPCL’s equity in NRL to Oil India as making it an independent entity is more complicated. NRL already exists as a separate entity; only the shareholding changes now,"" said an investment banker aware of the discussions and the second person cited above.
According to BPCL, as of 31 March, NRL’s net worth stood at  ₹5,551 crore. Last fiscal, NRL recorded revenue of  ₹18,511 crore, a growth of 16.25% over the previous year. Net profit fell to  ₹1,968 crore from  ₹2,045 crore in the previous fiscal year.
The company, in a bid to diversify, has entered the upstream business of exploration and production and is in the process of acquiring a 20% stake in Namrup Block from Oil India for which a farm-out agreement has already been signed."
1,2019-12-26,BPCL,"Air India, BPCL, Concor privatization unlikely to be completed by MarchThe likely shortfall comes in a year where tax collections have been below par amid an economic slump

DELHI :
The government is unlikely to complete the privatization of Air India Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Container Corp. of India Ltd (Concor) by end-March, leaving a  ₹40,000-50,000 crore hole in its budget.
This is likely to further impair the government’s ability to meet the fiscal deficit target of 3.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), in a year where both direct and indirect tax collections have been well below expectations amid an economic downturn that has hit a six-and-half-year low of 4.5% in September quarter.
“There is a lot of interest in the market among investors for the companies on offer. The transaction may also be completed successfully, but now it looks difficult that the money will reach the coffers before 31 March. That is a challenge,"" a finance ministry official said on condition of anonymity.
While four-five weeks may be sufficient for responding to the Expression of Interest documents which are under works, the prospective bidders may seek more time for due diligence, the official said. “If it triggers an open offer for minority shareholders as per Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) guidelines in the listed companies such as BPCL and Concor, again it will delay the process by another five to six weeks. Then the successful bidder will have to get clearance from Competition Commission of India, only after which it will transfer the money to government’s account,"" he added.
The government may still go ahead and show the expected disinvestment proceeds in the revised estimate of 2019-20 “to maintain the books"", the official said.
The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday urged the Indian government to improve its budgeting and enhance transparency in fiscal reporting.
“For example, a more accurate picture of the fiscal stance would better inform decisions regarding how much stimulus should be provided in a cyclical downturn. The government could increase its credibility vis-à-vis financial markets and enjoy more favourable borrowing conditions as a result. And greater fiscal transparency would also boost the ability of investors and citizens to make informed and efficient financial and economic decisions,"" the IMF said in its Article IV consultation report.
The cabinet on 20 November cleared the proposals for strategic disinvestments guided by the basic economic principle that the government should discontinue its engagement in manufacturing of goods and services in sectors where the competitive markets have come of age, and such entities would most likely perform better in private hands.
While the government plans to privatize Air India by selling its 100% ownership, it will divest its entire 53.29% stake in BPCL and 30.8% stake in Concor out of its current 54.8% stake.
It has set an ambitious disinvestment target of  ₹1.05 trillion for FY20, of which it has managed to garner only  ₹17,364 crore so far.
The government’s decision to slash corporate taxes to boost the economy and attract investments has left finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman struggling to meet the year’s fiscal deficit target despite receiving a  ₹1.76 trillion windfall from Reserve Bank of India.
IMF has estimated that India may miss the fiscal deficit target by at least 50 basis points."
0,2019-12-26,BPCL,"The government’s privatization plan might fail to meet this year’s target. But what matters more is the strategy revealed by its choice of firms up for sale—this is a cause for optimism

Just a few weeks ago, the government gave advocates of privatization reason to cheer by announcing the sale of its stake in several state-owned companies. For a dispensation that was seen as dragging its feet on this agenda in its previous term, it seemed like an “at last"" moment of relief. For a regime that sorely needed to shore up its finances to cover a drastic shortfall in tax revenue, its words were taken as a precursor to action. However, as Mint reported on Thursday, time for offloading equity has begun to run out and, going by the tardy progress on Air India, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), and Container Corp. of India Ltd (Concor), all slated to be wholly or partially hawked, the Centre looks likely to meet only about half its targeted  ₹1.05 trillion by the end of this fiscal year. Delays on disinvestment are not new and, while they could adversely impact fiscal health, observers also need to bear in mind that this is not only about raising money. What we also need to ask is whether the pattern of sell-off proposals has an underlying plan that could do the economy some good. On this, there is some cause for optimism.
The government has been clear that it will remain in the business of banking. Many believe that banks would perform better in largely private hands and this may well be true. However, so long as their balance sheets can be cleaned up, governance reformed and profitability restored, public ownership has some merit since it is a sector vital to our broad economic interests. While the government works on fixing banks, the debate on their privatization can wait. What’s noteworthy is that our broad template amounts to a rejection of the Chinese model of heavy state intervention in the economy, with state-owned firms at the commanding heights of strategic sectors even beyond finance, such as telecommunications, energy and engineering. India’s liberalization has let the private sector gain major shares of the latter three markets. Telecom is the most prominent example of that. Even in energy, state dominance would decline if BPCL is bought by a private business or group of investors. There have been some cases of one state-owned company buying another, but signals from the government suggest that its Indian Oil Corp. will not bid for BPCL. While expression of interest documents are still being prepared and an acquirer of majority control of BPCL may need to make an open offer to its minority shareholders, a delay in its sell-off should not raise doubts over the government’s intent in the energy sector. Fuel retailing is also to be opened up and private competition is likely to be good for the market.
Logistics is another sector where the Centre appears keen to make space for private players. The Shipping Corp. of India and Concor are on the sale list. This is an industry that could do with the efficiency gains of private management and, if it is transformed, it could play a role in aligning Indian logistics costs with those elsewhere in the world and thus aid other domestic ventures. The sooner it happens, the better. Pricing state assets is always tricky, but lessons learnt from this year’s listing of railway ticketing company IRCTC could come in handy. So long as the overall aim of the sell-off agenda is economic efficiency, it deserves support."
