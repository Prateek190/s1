82,2018-01-30,Nestle,"Nestle says it will sell pet care products in India, starting with premium packaged food for dogs

New Delhi: Here’s news to set the dogs drooling. After selling food products in packets to millions of Indians for more than a century, Nestle SA now wants to sell packaged food for canines in the country. 
New Delhi: Here’s news to set the dogs drooling. After selling food products in packets to millions of Indians for more than a century, Nestle SA now wants to sell packaged food for canines in the country.
The Swiss packaged food maker on Monday said it will sell pet care products in India, starting with premium packaged food for dogs. This is the first time Nestle has entered an entirely new business segment in India on its own since entering the market in 1912.
The firm has also incorporated a new entity, Purina Petcare India Pvt. Ltd, which will operate as a subsidiary of Nestle SA, and will be associated with Nestle India Ltd, the Swiss firm’s main business in India.
The new entity has launched one premium dog food product in India under the Supercoat brand. “The Supercoat range of complete and balanced food offers a wholesome combination of high quality natural ingredients free from added artificial colours, flavours or preservatives,"" the company said in a statement. The products will initially be sold through retail outlets across 12 cities in India.
Mint had on 16 February 2017 reported Nestle’s plans to enter the pet care market in India. 
Pet care is a relatively new business for Nestle globally. The Swiss multinational entered the segment after it acquired Ralston Purina in December 2001 and spun off the business as a separate entity—Nestle Purina PetCare Co. Besides food and nutrition products for dogs and cats, the company also sells specialized veterinary diet products.
In 2016, pet care as a business segment accounted for Swiss franc 12.1 billion out of Nestle SA’s total sales of Swiss franc 89.5 billion, according to the company’s annual report. The Americas are the largest revenue contributor to Nestle’s pet care business, generating revenue of Swiss franc 8.5 billion in 2016.
Pet care is a small industry in India. The size of the pet care market, including food and other pet products, in India stood at Rs1,712 crore in 2016. Mars Inc., Indian Broiler Group, Stylam Sydney, Cargill Inc and Himalaya Drug Co. are the key pet care product sellers in India.
“With estimated 19 million pets, the pet food industry in India shows huge potential and is expected to double in size in the next five years. There is an increasing awareness about pet nutrition largely driven by increasing digitization making it easier to gain knowledge and owing to the great efforts by leading veterinarians across the country,"" Purina Petcare India said.
Varindra Sewak, managing director, Purina Petcare India, said the company will bring its global portfolio to India, aiming to “become a significant player in the rapidly growing pet food category"". 
Globally, Nestle Purina’s brands include Beneful, Fancy Feast, Friskies and Purina One. It sells 16 products for dogs and 13 for cats. In the early 2000s, Purina had tried selling its products through distributors in India, but its efforts weren’t successful."
81,2018-02-15,Nestle,"Nestle India becomes the first listed 'pure-play food firm' to cross milestone in India as full-year sales rise 7.7%

New Delhi: Swiss packaged food company Nestle SA has finally joined the Rs10,000 crore sales club in India—more than a century after it entered the burgeoning market to sell Swiss condensed milk as a trader. 
New Delhi: Swiss packaged food company Nestle SA has finally joined the Rs10,000 crore sales club in India—more than a century after it entered the burgeoning market to sell Swiss condensed milk as a trader.
On Wednesday, its local entity Nestle India Ltd reported total sales at Rs10,135.11 crore for the year ended December 2017. The maker of Maggi noodles, Kit Kat chocolates and Nescafe instant coffee mixes follows a January-December accounting year.
Nestle, which began trading in India in 1912, is the first listed “pure-play food company"" to cross Rs10,000 crore in sales in India. While there are many packaged goods companies in India with more than Rs10,000 crore sales, Nestle India is among the very few to have crossed the mark with a pure-play food business. Among the listed firms, ITC Ltd’s food business was estimated at around Rs8,000 crore in fiscal year ended 31 March 2017 (FY17) and Britannia Industries Ltd reported sales at Rs8,684 crore in FY17. The country’s largest packaged goods company Hindustan Unilever Ltd and New Delhi-based Dabur India Ltd have much smaller food businesses. 
Among unlisted firms, Amul brand marketer Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd’s revenue stood at Rs27,043 crore in FY17, according to a company statement issued last year. Biscuit maker Parle Products Pvt. Ltd reported Rs9,331.42 crore revenue from operations in FY16, according to its filings with Registrar of Companies (RoC).
“It is extremely pleasing that we ended year 2017 on a strong note by reaching a historic milestone of over Rs10,000 crore in revenue, in a year where we had to adapt to significant changes in the external environment,"" Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director, Nestle India said in a statement on Wednesday.
Nestle India may well have crossed the Rs10,000 crore mark in sales a couple of years back, had its Maggi noodles not been slapped with a ban in 2015 over a health scare that caused an estimated half-a-billion-dollar dent to the company.
For the year 2014, Nestle India reported total sales at Rs9,854.84 crore. But sales dropped to Rs8,175.31 crore in 2015 after the Maggi noodles controversy. On 5 June 2015, India’s food regulator Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) asked Nestle to take Maggi instant noodles, its single largest revenue earner at the time, off retail shelves for alleged presence of monosodium glutamate and lead beyond permissible limits. Maggi was off retail stores for six months.
For the quarter ended 31 December, Nestle India reported a 59.6% jump in net profit, backed by higher volume. Profit for the quarter stood at Rs311.83 crore, as compared with Rs195.41 crore in the corresponding year-ago period.
Total sales increased 10.9% in the quarter to Rs2,589.64 crore. Sales in the domestic market rose 10.8% and export sales increased by 12.7%. On a comparable basis, Nestle India said, sales in the domestic market increased by 18.1% due to “increase in volumes including rebuild of Maggi noodles, supplemented by better underlying realizations coming from previous periods"".
According to the company, growth was on a base that was “impacted by withdrawal of high denomination currency notes in circulation"" in 2016. “These growth rates are adversely impacted due to lower reported sales by the change in structure of indirect taxes and reduction in realisations to pass on the GST (goods and services tax) benefits,"" Nestle India added.
For the full year, Nestle India’s total sales increased by 7.7% to Rs10,369.10 crore in 2017 backed by an 8.2% growth in domestic sales. Adjusting for accounting changes following the rollout of the goods and services tax, Nestle India said, the domestic sales growth is estimated at 11.8%.
“Nestlé is over a 105 years old in India and is building for the next 100 years. This is showcased by our continuous thrust on innovation and renovation with over 15 products launched last year,"" Narayanan said.
During the October-December quarter, the country’s largest packaged goods company Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) reported a 28% rise in net profit as sales rose 2.5% backed by an 11% growth in volume. Dabur India posted a 13% increase in net profit backed by a 13% volume growth.
On Wednesday, Nestle India shares rose 1.73%, or Rs123.60, to Rs7,260.10 while benchmark Sensex shed 0.42%, or 144.52 points, to end the day at 34,155.95 points. The results were announced after the close of trading."

New Delhi: Shares of Nestle India on Thursday surged over 5% on bourses after the company reported a 60% jump in its December quarter net profit and said its sales had crossed the Rs10,000-crore mark in 2017. 
The FMCG major on Wednesday reported an increase of 59.57% in its net profit to Rs311.83 crore for the quarter ended December 2017, led by volume growth. 
The company also noted that it has crossed the Rs10,000-crore sales mark in 2017, joining a select group of publicly-listed FMCG companies in the country which have crossed the milestone. 
Following the announcement, shares of the company on Thursday opened on a strong note and surged 5.23% to an intra-day high of Rs7,640 on the BSE. On NSE, the stock hit a high of Rs7,645, up 5.23% over its previous closing price. 
The net sales of the company during the quarter under review was up 10.91% at Rs2,589.64 crore, as against Rs2,334.78 crore for the corresponding period a year ago. Its net sales in 2017 soared 7.71% to Rs10,135.11 crore, against Rs9,409.60 crore in the previous year. 
HUL and ITC are among a few listed FMCG companies which have reported annual sales of more than Rs10,000 crore."
79,2018-02-16,Nestle,"Nestle India's December quarter results hold out promise of a good showing in 2018, barring another major disruption

Is this the year Nestlé India Ltd will fire on all cylinders? Investors seem to think so. If 2015 was taken away by the noodles controversy, 2016 went to demonetization and 2017 saw the initial chaos of the goods and services tax (GST) roll-out affect performance. All that is behind it. The company’s December quarter results hold out promise of a good showing in 2018, barring another major disruption. 
Is this the year Nestlé India Ltd will fire on all cylinders? Investors seem to think so. If 2015 was taken away by the noodles controversy, 2016 went to demonetization and 2017 saw the initial chaos of the goods and services tax (GST) roll-out affect performance. All that is behind it. The company’s December quarter results hold out promise of a good showing in 2018, barring another major disruption.
Most consumer goods companies reported an upswing in growth. So Nestlé India’s 18.1% comparable domestic sales growth is not unusual—Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s sales grew by 17%. Still, the fact that it is higher than the market leader’s growth is good news; Nestlé India attributed it to higher volumes and better realizations.
Due to changes in accounting post-GST, sales numbers are not comparable. The company’s reported sales rose by 15.6% while its material costs increased by 11.4%. While the numbers may change, once the low base effect fades, if sales grow ahead of input costs, then it’s still good for profitability.
Nestlé India had flagged rising material costs in its August 2017 analyst meet, but that does not seem to have affected margins. Government data shows that milk prices have indeed risen, but prices of other inputs such as sugar and coffee have declined while wheat flour has held steady. On a sequential basis, the gross profit margin has risen by 2 percentage points. That allowed Nestlé India to absorb a sharp increase in other expenses (most likely due to higher advertising costs) and its Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin rose by 22 basis points sequentially.
While its Ebitda rose by 26.7% over a year ago, lower depreciation and a lower tax rate saw its profit increase by 59.6%. The metric to focus on is the Ebitda margin, which seems to have stabilized at around 23%. If the company can maintain this and then get volume growth going, that would be good.
Parent company Nestlé SA too released its results this week, and while sales growth disappointed, one of its priorities for 2018 is to maintain volume growth. That should set the tone for Nestlé India’s priorities, and while the parent also talks about margin improvement, the two together make for a better combination in India.
Most consumer goods firms have talked about sales recovery in India’s urban markets and that augurs well for Nestlé India’s urban-centric product portfolio. If economic growth picks up as expected in 2018 and consumer demand also moves up, then it is reasonable to expect the company’s performance to improve.
Nestlé India’s shares were already expensive before its results were announced, trading at 47 times its forecast earnings per share for 2018, based on the mean of estimates polled by Reuters. Its shares still rose by 4.5% on Thursday—a day after the results were announced—partly due to good results but also reflecting a bounce-back from recent underperformance versus its peers (see chart). The jump in its shares signals hope its earnings growth may improve by more than expected in 2018, and investors need to see if the next few quarters lend strength to that hope."
78,2018-02-27,Nestle,"Nestle has divided India into 15 different clusters, each considered a different market, based on food preferences of local consumers in its hyperlocal push

New Delhi: Nestle India Ltd is adopting a hyperlocal model for marketing and distribution that the local entity of the Swiss packaged food company believes will help increase penetration and expand reach leading to faster growth. 
New Delhi: Nestle India Ltd is adopting a hyperlocal model for marketing and distribution that the local entity of the Swiss packaged food company believes will help increase penetration and expand reach leading to faster growth.
As part of this approach, Nestle has divided India into 15 different clusters—each considered a different market—based on food preferences of the local consumers. “There are many Indias in India. Each of them needs to be served differently,"" said Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director, Nestle India.
The company—which reported total sales of Rs10,135.11 crore for the year ended December 2017, backed by a 10.9% revenue growth in quarter ended 31 December 2017—is targeting double-digit volume growth in the coming quarters. 
In the cluster approach, the company has formed a separate team—comprising 10-20 people from sales, category marketing, supply chain and trade marketing—for each of the clusters. “Product placements, distribution, marketing and promotions for each cluster would be tailor-made based on insights from the ground. This would ensure better penetration in existing markets and help us expand into adjacent markets,"" Narayanan said, adding that even basic marketing and promotions could be different from cluster to cluster for one particular product.
Over a period, Narayanan said, Nestle could look at launching tweaked versions of one particular product for different clusters. “It has to make commercial sense. There could be different Maggi masalas for different clusters. However, having 15 different variants of one particular product may not make commercial sense,"" he said, adding that the company could look at launching a new variant of a particular product if it sees the variant has the potential of contributing 3-5% to the brand’s revenue over a period of two-three years. The cluster approach also gives Nestle India the scope to expand beyond its focus 100 top towns—a value-driven strategy that the company adopted after the half-a-billion-dollar Maggi noodles crisis in 2015. 
“While our focus will be on the top 100 towns, we need to expand beyond these markets to ensure sustainable growth for future. These may be smaller markets, but they will grow faster in foreseeable future,"" Narayanan said.
Nestle products used to reach around 5 million of India’s estimated 9 million retail outlets before the Maggi fiasco that broke on 5 June 2015. The product was off the shelves for about six months until 9 November 2015. After the crisis, its retail reach fell to around 3.5 million outlets.
The company started conceptualizing the cluster model towards the end of 2016, and adopted it fully beginning this year. Nestle’s products now reach around 4 million retail stores, out of which it reaches around 1.3 million directly. 
Nestle is not the first company to take a hyperlocal approach. Back in 2016, cigarette-to-noodles maker ITC Ltd adopted a similar strategy, but more focused on differentiated products for each cluster with the aim to roll out market-specific products that are relevant to a particular town, state or community with a potential to grow it nationwide over time, Mint reported on 17 June 2016. 
Nestle, which entered the pet care market in India, is planning to enter another new product segment in next 8-10 months. “It may not be a completely new business. It could be extension of an existing category. Premium coffee, category extensions in prepared dishes and snacks are among a bunch of things that are in the priority list,"" added the Nestle chairman. In the last couple of years, Nestle India launched about 40 products. 
“This year, we have already launched three new products. We’ll bring more products. With a global portfolio of around 2,500 products, the challenge is not what to launch, but when to launch,"" said Narayanan"
77,2018-03-09,Nestle,"Nestle's Maggi, which also offers products like taste-enhancer Masala-ae-Magic and ketchup, is changing the way it speaks to its consumers by making its advertising more inclusive and women centric

New Delhi: Maggi, the Nestle-owned brand which gave India its instant noodle obsession, has turned 35 years old. The food brand, which also offers products like taste-enhancer Masala-ae-Magic and ketchup, is changing the way it speaks to its consumers by making its advertising more inclusive and women centric. 
New Delhi: Maggi, the Nestle-owned brand which gave India its instant noodle obsession, has turned 35 years old. The food brand, which also offers products like taste-enhancer Masala-ae-Magic and ketchup, is changing the way it speaks to its consumers by making its advertising more inclusive and women centric.
The narrative is reflected in the new campaign of tastemaker Masala-ae-magic made by advertising agency Publicis India. The film Kuch acha pak raha hai revolves around a story of a mother and son, wherein the mother encourages her son to let his wife work after marriage. This campaign makes a simple yet profound point that just as recipes are changing, our relationships must change too. The larger thought of the campaign is in line with the evolving state of women in India where their voice is becoming prominent in society.
“Maggi is not just a product but it has become a part of our ethos. Food is emotional in nature and often the bedrock of many relationships. As cooking and culture changes, relationships are changing as well which are entwined with each other. As relationships change, the role of women is also changing in our society and from now onwards Maggi’s advertising will reflect that,"" said Bobby Pawar, managing director and chief creative officer at Publicis South Asia.
While the Masala-ae-Magic campaign is being promoted on television and digital, the instant noodle brand Maggi has opened its factories and kitchens for consumers. Nestle is executing a web series titled “From Our Kitchen To Your Kitchen"", featuring foodie duo Rocky and Mayur where consumers will be invited to learn about our products and how they are made. The first episode features the duo spending time and understanding how Maggi is made in the company’s manufacturing unit.
“Our consumers are seeking more information on our products than ever before, and this campaign will allow consumers to get the understanding they seek. Maggi aims to showcase the product journey, right from procurement of raw materials to manufacturing, and the role it plays in your diet. This campaign will leverage our 24x7 consumer engagement services team and our digital—www.maggi.in,"" said Maarten Geraets, general manager, foods, Nestlé India.
Maggi, as a brand, wants to become more transparent and engaging by continuously talking to consumers and seeking their feedback. 
According to brand expert Santosh Desai, chief executive and managing director of Future Brands Ltd, the Maggi brand has done well in India and women centric advertising which is also transparent seems like a reasonable strategy. “However, Maggi needs to find a sharp take on showing women as harbingers of change because it is being done by many brands in their own way. It is important to find some truth to it. Meanwhile, Maggi instant noodles has recovered from a major controversy and thus transparency is a sensible step but transparency is a two street so it is not just about being able to tell your story but also to listen to what consumers are saying,"" he said.
Desai also feels that going forward brand Maggi also needs to figure out how its product portfolio will look like in India. Unlike its global markets where soups and tastemakers dominate, Maggi in India is synonymous with instant noodles. “They have to ask if noodles are becoming wholesome and going into health space. Also, it is a good time to launch more products under the brand since food in India has become about excitement and experimentation. But their success will depend on whether the products are rendered for the Indian palate or not,"" he said."

Mumbai: Multinational consumer giants like Unilever Plc and Nestle SA typically trade at a discount to their Indian units, given the nation’s growth potential. They’ve become even cheaper after the selloff, prompting Credit Suisse to ask if stock values of their local subsidiaries will follow suit.
“Many large European and US consumer staple stocks have fallen about 15% from their peak last year,"" Arnab Mitra, an analyst at the brokerage, wrote in a note on Friday. “Indian consumer stocks that followed global peers on the way up have not seen a correction.""
For instance, Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s valuation premium over its Anglo-Dutch parent is significantly above the 10-year mean, which wasn’t the case even three months ago, the analyst wrote. Unilever’s one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio has dropped 20% from its peak of 23 times, while its Indian subsidiary is valued at a multiple of 55.
Nestle India Ltd trades at a trailing price-earnings ratio of 60.3 times, almost twice that of its Switzerland-based parent whose shares have tumbled 9% this year.
The rich valuations are being supported by management commentary about a rebound in rural consumption, Mitra said. This optimism could be cushioning the fall in valuations, for now, he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s shock cash ban in late 2016 damped farm incomes, while the roll out of the nationwide sales tax in July disrupted supply chains.
“Given the valuation premium, it is critical for companies to at least meet their earnings expectations for Fiscal 2019,"" Mitra wrote. Bloomberg"
75,2018-03-27,Nestle,"In a letter to food companies such as ITC, HUL, Dabur and Nestle, FSSAI said the food companies will also need to submit a 'fresh plan on the recall management'

New Delhi: Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), the country’s food regulator, on Monday said it has asked the top 200 food companies that have procured licences from the FSSAI headquarters to set up exclusive teams to manage food recalls if the situation arises in the future. 
New Delhi: Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), the country’s food regulator, on Monday said it has asked the top 200 food companies that have procured licences from the FSSAI headquarters to set up exclusive teams to manage food recalls if the situation arises in the future.
In a letter written to companies such as Kolkata-based ITC Ltd, the country’s largest packaged goods company Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), New Delhi-based Dabur India Ltd and Nestle India Ltd, the local unit of Swiss packaged food company Nestle SA, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India said the companies will also need to submit a “fresh plan on the recall management"". 
A copy of the letter has been reviewed by Mint.
The move is part of the food regulator’s plan to “implement food recall regulations across India"" that it notified in November 2017, putting the onus on companies by stating that the primary responsibility of implementing any recall lies with food companies, as it believes a recall is directly linked to “serious defects in the manufacturing process"". 
It outlined a 10-step process that companies will have to follow for a recall. 
The regulator has also asked companies to submit details of the food recall team within 30 days and the fresh recall plan within 60 days from 20 March, 2018.
The directive comes almost three years after FSSAI ordered Nestle India to recall Maggi instant noodles for alleged presence of monosodium glutamate and excess lead on 5 June 2015, which turned out to be the largest food recall in India ever. 
“As a responsible corporate citizen, we always abide by all relevant norms and regulations,"" a Nestlé India spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement.
According to the FSSAI letter, the food recall plan will be reviewed by FSSAI’s regional offices every time any of the 200 food companies applies for renewal of its licence.
“Recall is not a common thing in India. The regulator’s directive is part of preventive measures to assure consumers that companies make and sell safe food. This might have some cost pressure on companies, but that is not unjustified,"" said Rajat Wahi, partner (management consulting) at consulting firm Deloitte India."
74,2018-03-28,Nestle,"Nestle, Kraft Heinz and Unilever are expected to bid for GSK's Horlicks, which could fetch more than $4 billion, says report

London/New York: Food giants Nestle, Kraft Heinz and Unilever are expected to bid for GlaxoSmithKline’s Horlicks health nutrition business, which could fetch more than $4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, on the condition of anonymity. 
London/New York: Food giants Nestle, Kraft Heinz and Unilever are expected to bid for GlaxoSmithKline’s Horlicks health nutrition business, which could fetch more than $4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, on the condition of anonymity.
GSK has started a strategic review of Horlicks—a malt-based drink brand popular in India—and some of its smaller products, after buying Novartis out of their consumer healthcare venture for $13 billion on Tuesday.
The main asset on the block is GSK’s 72.5% stake in its Indian subsidiary GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare. The people cited earlier said the stake was worth $3.1 billion at current market prices but GSK wanted a premium in any sale.
They estimated the consumer health nutrition business, which also has smaller operations in Nigeria and Bangladesh, could fetch more than $4 billion. Nestle, the world’s biggest packaged food company, has previously told GSK privately of its interest in Horlicks on several occasions, the people said.
Nestle already owns the malt drink Milo, but it is not a big-seller in India. The Swiss company declined to comment. Unilever, the world’s largest tea company, and Kraft Heinz, which sells the powdered drinks Crystal Light and Kool-Aid, also declined to comment.
Horlicks is more than 140 years old with origins dating back to 1873, when two British-born men, James and William Horlick, first founded a company in Chicago to manufacture the drink. It was introduced to India by Indian soldiers who had fought with the British Army in the First World War.
Associated British Foods, which owns the malt drink brand Ovaltine, could look at the business to scale up in a key emerging market, the sources said, although the size of the GSK business could be a deterrent. An ABF spokesman declined to comment.
The Indian business has an enterprise value of about 29 times core earnings, said one of the people, meaning any deal premium will value it well above what many packaged food and drink brands fetch. The valuation is inflated by the high growth rates seen in the Indian market.
Nestle and Unilever could purchase the asset through their local Indian subsidiaries, Nestle India or Hindustan Unilever.
Other potential suitors might include Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Suntory, Mondelez International and JAB, the coffee business owner that recently agreed to buy Dr Pepper Snapple, one of the people said. Reuters"

The 145-year-old dietary nutrition brand that accounts for about 85-90% of GSK Consumer Healthcare Ltd’s sales in India could fetch a valuation of 4-4.5 times of sales (going by recent trends) considering the low growth scope of the brand, said Sachin Bobade, an analyst with Mumbai-based Dolat Capital Market. According to GSK statement, its nutrition products portfolio including Horlicks had total sales of $550 million in 2017.
However, Reuters estimated the valuation to be around $4 billion, citing unidentified people. The British drug maker on Tuesday said it has initiated a “strategic review"" of Horlicks and other nutrition products to support funding of its $13-billion buyout of Novartis’s stake in the global consumer healthcare joint venture formed in 2015.
Besides the Horlicks brand, GSK is exploring sale of its 72.5% stake in Indian subsidiary GSK Consumer Healthcare. “GSK needs the money to support the Novartis deal. Naturally, it would look to conclude the deal in foreign exchange. Global companies, with presence in both India and Malaysia, such as Unilever, Danone and Nestle are the most likely ones to fight for the brand. ITC, which is looking at a bigger presence in dairy, is the only Indian company that could look at buying Horlicks for multiple reasons. While a few others may be interested, they may opt out because of the deal size that could be 2-3 times of sales,"" said Sunil Alagh, chairman, SKA Advisors, and former managing director and chief executive officer of biscuit maker Britannia Industries Ltd.
 “Going by current market capitalization, the stake is worth close to $3 billion. And Horlicks accounts for about 85% of its total business in India. Besides India, Horlicks has small business in countries like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Malyasia,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst seeking anonymity.
A second analyst said that American companies such as PepsiCo Inc. and Coca-Cola Co. may bid as both are trying to expand presence in health and nutrition segment.
A possibility of pharmaceutical companies such as Abbott Laboratories looking at Horlicks cannot be ruled out, especially because the company already has a sizeable presence in nutrition space with Pediasure and Ensure, added a third analyst based in Mumbai, adding that Danone of France that has been struggling to find its feet in India and recently exited the dairy business to focus on nutrition may also look at buying Horlicks. Danone already has strong presence in nutrition supplement space in India with Protinex brand.
Nestle already has a presence in the health nutrition space in India with Milo. “We do not comment on market speculation,"" said a Nestle India spokesperson. Citing unnamed officials, Reuters on Tuesday reported that Nestle has previously told GSK :“privately of its interest in Horlicks on several occasions"".
Kraft Heinz, which acquired malt-based health food drink brand Complan from GSK in 1994, did not respond to Mint queries.
Spokespersons at ITC and Indian subsidiaries of Mondelez, Unilever, Coca-Cola and PerpsiCo said that they “do not comment on market speculations"" as a company policy or practice. Abbott, and Danone did not respond to Mint queries.
In India, Horlicks dominates the malt-based hot drinks market with a commanding 42.8% share (off trade volume), followed by Mondelez International’s Cadbury Bournvita with 12.6% and Boost with 10.6% (another GSK brand), according to data compiled by Euromonitor International."

Zurich: Nestle SA is getting a boost from US consumers spending more on their pets as economic expansion buoys household finances. 
Zurich: Nestle SA is getting a boost from US consumers spending more on their pets as economic expansion buoys household finances.
First quarter sales rose 2.8% on an organic basis, the Vevey, Switzerland-based maker of Purina Dog Chow and KitKat chocolate said Thursday. Analysts expected 2.5%. The shares rose 0.5% in Zurich.
Chief executive officer Mark Schneider is revamping the world’s largest food company around businesses like pet care, coffee and bottled water after jettisoning the US confectionery business and adding healthy food brands. These “deep"" changes take time, according to Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy, who expects organic growth to accelerate in coming quarters.
“After several disappointing quarters, Nestle was able to revert the trend and to deliver above market expectations,"" Bertschy said. “The start of the year looks good for Nestle.""
In the US, where Nestle generated about a third of its revenue last year, the pet-care business improved amid stronger demand for natural products and increased online sales. Globally, the business accounted for 14% of Nestle’s sales last year.
Nestle did not quantify the gains in the US but said that pet care recorded the highest organic growth of any of its main product categories in the first quarter, at 4.7%. Vontobel’s Bertschy said pet care was the main growth driver in the US, as it made up about 27% of sales in the country during the quarter.
The American confectionery unit, which Nestle has sold, still weighed on results in the quarter. The company has been wrestling with fast-changing preferences that include a shift to online sales and healthier snack options.
“A return to positive growth in the US is encouraging,"" James Targett, an analyst at Berenberg, wrote in a note.
In Asia, the timing of Chinese New Year supported revenue growth. Nestle reiterated its forecast for organic sales growth of 2% to 4% this year. Bloomberg"

Zurich: Swiss food giant Nestle announced Monday it will pay $7.15 billion for the rights to market Starbucks products around the world, outside of the company’s coffee shops.
The agreement gives Nestle, which owns the Nescafe and Nespresso brands, a strong platform for continued growth in North America, the company said in a statement.
“This transaction is a significant step for our coffee business, Nestle’s largest high-growth category,"" said Nestle CEO Mark Schneider in a statement.
“Both companies have true passion for outstanding coffee and are proud to be recognized as global leaders for their responsible and sustainable coffee sourcing.""
The deal does not include any of Starbucks’ coffee shops and cafes.
Around 500 Starbucks staff will join Nestle, the company added.
The deal will create a “global coffee alliance"", Starbucks president and CEO Kevin Johnson said.
The transaction, which needs approval from regulators, should be finalised by the end of 2018."
70,2018-05-09,Nestle,"Nestle will now sell 3 different brands of coffeeStarbucks, Nescaf and Nespresso

Just how many kinds of coffee can you have? For habitual drinkers, there’s good coffee, average coffee and awful coffee. Aficionados will say there’s the purest filter coffee preferably from Chikmagalur, there’s your usual cookie cutter coffee you get in the neighbourhood cafés and then there is Nescafe. 
Just how many kinds of coffee can you have? For habitual drinkers, there’s good coffee, average coffee and awful coffee. Aficionados will say there’s the purest filter coffee preferably from Chikmagalur, there’s your usual cookie cutter coffee you get in the neighbourhood cafés and then there is Nescafe.
Based on your tastes, you go to some lengths to prepare the first, walk into the nearest Café Coffee Day or Costa Coffee outlet to get the second and rustle up a quickie concoction of the third.
Not satisfied with such clear-cut definitions, Nestle, the world’s largest coffee company, is now paying Starbucks a huge $7.5 billion for the right to sell beans and pods from the world’s leading coffee chain. The press release from Vevey boasts that this will give “the company perpetual rights to market Starbucks consumer and foodservice products globally, outside of the company’s coffee shops."" Starbucks, though, will not be selling any Nestle products at its 28,000 odd outlets across the world including in such rapidly growing markets as China where it has 3000 stores in 135 cities.
Effectively, Nestle will now sell three different brands of coffee—Starbucks, Nescafé and Nespresso. 
The move seems driven by Nestle’s business compulsions. Coffee is a crucial ingredient of the food company’s product mix, accounting for nearly 20% of its sales. In the US, the business has been limping with the company’s Nescafe and Nespresso trailing leaders Starbucks, Folgers and Maxwell House. 
What’s worse, Euromonitor data reveals that Nestle’s Nescafe brand of instant coffees has lost market share in four of the past five years as consumers move towards more sophisticated coffee choices. In the US, Starbucks has three times the market share in coffee as Nescafe and Nespresso added together, though globally, the Swiss company dominates. There too, it has been feeling the heat of competition with JAB Holding, owned by the European billionaire Reimann family, challenging its top ranking in recent years after acquiring a series of well-known coffee brands like Douwe Egberts, Peet’s Coffee and Keurig Green Mountain. Nestle’s food business has also been under stress with the result that the company’s sales for 2017 were up a meagre 0.4% over the previous year, the slowest pace of sales growth in the last 20 years. So that’s clear then. In the face of mounting competition and slowing growth in its overall business, Nestle is trying to boost its coffee sales by tying up with Starbucks. 
Hang on though. It isn’t as simple as it seems.
Nestle has tied up with Starbucks to take on rival JAB. Effectively, that makes Starbucks a competitor to JAB as well. But here’s where it gets complicated. Starbucks already has a partnership with JAB for its K-cup pods, a coffee brewing system from Keurig Green Mountain, now owned by JAB. There are also indications that the two companies are looking to strengthen their arrangement. So, what we will have at the end of this new tie-up is a whole plethora of coffee brands, from companies that are rivals at times but partners at others. To an already bewildering menu of Irish Latte, Coconut Latte, Amaretto & Vanilla, Skinny Latte, Double Choc Mocha, Azera Americano and dozens more, add a Starbucks range as well. The proliferation of brands and their extensions can’t get any more confusing.
Of course, Nestle’s press statement goes on to explain everything most satisfactorily: “As a complete provider of coffee solutions, Nestlé will accelerate growth in out-of-home channels.""
Coffee solutions indeed!

New Delhi: Nestlé India Ltd, the maker of Maggi instant noodles, now wants to sell packaged breakfast cereals in India, a market where the majority of the 1.3 billion people still prefer a home-cooked breakfast.
The India unit of Swiss food company Nestlé SA. said in a statement on Wednesday that it will start selling Nestlé Breakfast Cereals from Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW), a joint venture between Nestle SA and American firm General Mills Inc., in India this year.
The Nestlé India board approved the proposal on Wednesday.
“We firmly believe breakfast is the most important meal of the day. We also believe eating a nutritious breakfast sets the tone for the rest of the day and acts as the foundation for a healthier future. The consumer need for breakfast choices is only growing and companies need to bring more options to satisfy this need. We are therefore pleased to be introducing Nestlé Breakfast Cereals in India. This business complements our current portfolio by combining our expertise in food and this category, globally,"" Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director, Nestlé India, said in a statement.
India’s breakfast cereal market is projected to touch Rs2,610 crore by 2020, according to market research firm Euromonitor International. The market grew 24% in 2015 to Rs1,440 crore.
According to Euromonitor, US-based Kellogg dominated India’s packaged breakfast cereal market with a 37% share (value terms) in 2015. 
PepsiCo India Holdings Pvt. Ltd, the local unit of American food and beverage maker PepsiCo Inc., had a 13.3% share (value), up from 9.5% in 2010, added Euromonitor.
PepsiCo, for the past few years, has been trying to sell Indian food items in a ready-to-cook packaged form. In March 2017, it had launched ready-to-cook idli, dosa, upma and khichdi, hoping to get more Indians to eat packaged breakfast.
But Nestlé will face a challenge from other firms in the breakfast category. 
In the past few years, a bunch of multinational and home-grown firms—including Bagrry’s India, Marico Ltd, ITC Ltd, MTR Foods and Dr Oetkers—have made inroads into the breakfast market with products such as muesli, oats, ready-to-cook packets for dosa, idli, uttapam and dhokla as consumer demand rises for healthier, ready-to-cook breakfast."

New Delhi: Nestle India Ltd, the local entity of Swiss packaged food maker Nestle SA., on Thursday reported a 38.22% increase in net profit for the quarter ended 31 March 2018, backed by lower cost of raw materials and other expenses. 
Net profit for the January-March quarter stood at Rs424.03 crore as against Rs306.76 crore reported in the year-ago quarter. Nestle India follows a January-December year for accounting.
Revenue from operations grew by 6.3% during the quarter ended 31 March 2018, backed by volume growth, to Rs2,757.24 crore from Rs2,591.94 crore in the corresponding year-ago quarter. Its revenue from domestic market grew by 6.26% and exports by 6.15% during the quarter under review.
Nestle India’s growth for the quarter, said its chairman and managing director Suresh Narayanan, is “backed by broad volume based growth across categories. This is in line with our strategy of broad based growth through increased penetration,"" Narayanan said in a statement.
According to the company, sales during the quarter were “adversely impacted due to lower reported sales by the change in structure of indirect taxes and reduction in realisations to pass on the goods and services tax (GST) benefits"". On a comparable basis, domestic sales growth is ‘estimated’ at 13.4%, added Nestle India.
“We are committed to a healthier future, and in line with our vision to introduce products rooted in nutrition, health and wellness, we will be adding breakfast cereals to our existing portfolio this year. This business complements our current portfolio by combining our expertise in food and this category globally,"" Narayanan said.

Calendar year 2018 was always expected to be a good one for Nestlé India Ltd. Those hopes have been met at least as far as March quarter results go. Gross margin improved 300 basis points year-on-year, helped by softer raw material prices, especially in the milk and milk solids segment. Net profit came in at Rs424 crore, higher than Street expectations.

Gross margin improved 300 basis points year-on-year, helped by softer raw material prices, especially in the milk and milk solids segment. Net profit came in at Rs424 crore, higher than Street expectations.
What’s more, the company has done better than peers in terms of volume growth. Domestic revenue growth on a like-to-like basis was 13.4%. Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd reckon Nestlé’s sales growth was largely by volume growth of about 10-11%. New launches and market share gains have helped the company report double digit volume growth, says Jefferies. As a result, Nestlé has outperformed other consumer goods peers who have reported their March quarter numbers such as Dabur India Ltd, Emami, Marico Ltd and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd, added the brokerage.
Little wonder then that investors gave a thumbs-up to March quarter numbers, pushing the stock to a new 52-week high during trading hours on Friday. The stock eventually closed 5.8% higher, which means what was a pricey stock earlier has become pricier now. Currently, the stock trades at a huge 59 times estimated earnings for 2018. But if Nestlé continues to impress with volume growth and margin expansion, it looks like investors won’t have to worry much about a bitter aftertaste. Most FMCG stocks in India enjoy high valuations, but few have backed it up with decent growth.
Sure, Nestlé’s March quarter was aided by a favourable base quarter. During the March 2017 quarter, Ebitda had declined 7.5% year on year. Still, compounded annual growth rate of 12% in Ebitda over last two years is “healthy and better than most peers,"" according to Kotak Institutional Equities. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Healthy sales momentum and an environment of generally benign raw material costs should mean a fairly strong 2018, reckons Kotak. The company plans to introduce breakfast cereals to its portfolio and analysts say Nestlé’s wide distribution reach should put it in a sweet spot to capture the market share in that space. New launches and promotions too should aid sales growth. As such, there seems to be reasonable support for the high valuations to sustain."

Its Nespresso coffee unit is also moving jobs to Spain and Portugal and will offer positions to 80 employees affected by that reorganization. The unit will open a site in Italy to work on developing boutiques.
Schneider is starting Nestle’s biggest restructuring program in Switzerland, reducing staff there by 5% after having faced pressure from investors such as Dan Loeb to cut costs. The strength of the Swiss franc in recent years has ramped up the company’s expenses.

New Delhi: Ferrero India Pvt. Ltd, the local unit of Italy-headquartered Ferrero Group, may expand its product offerings for the Indian market with the launch of 20 new confectionery brands, which it had acquired from the US unit of Swiss packaged goods company Nestle SA in January.
“We are exploring synergies of the sugar confectionery brands that we had acquired earlier this year. We may bring some of them to India. We want to expand our reach, go mass market with lower price points. There will be more variants of our existing brand, Tic Tac, and some more brands in the sugar confectionery space,"" Ferrero India managing director Stefano Pelle told Mint.
Ferrero had acquired the US confectionery business from Nestle for $2.8 billion in cash. As part of the transaction, it had bought the exclusive rights for the Crunch confectionery brand, besides picking up sugar brands such as SweeTarts, LaffyTaffy and Nerds, and chocolate brands Butterfinger, BabyRuth, 100Grand, Raisinets and Wonka.
“We are yet to finalize the brands and products that we would launch in India,"" said Pelle. The company is also working on doubling its distribution network to one million retail outlets within 18-24 months.
“That is our immediate goal. In the long-term, say, 10 years or more, we aim to cross $1 billion in sales from India,"" he added. While the family-owned group does not disclose revenue numbers, Pelle said Ferrero had already crossed sales of  ₹ 1,000 crore in India.
The Italian maker of KinderJoy candies, Nutella spread and Tic Tac breath mints, is also firming up plans to invest Rs2,000 crore over the next three years to make India a product development and export hub to feed its West Asian, Africa and South-East Asian markets. The company has invested about Rs1,500 crore since entering the Indian market in 2007.
As part of its plans to add new segments to its product portfolio, the company has tied up with London and Rotterdam-headquartered Unilever to make ice cream under its flagship Kinder brand for European markets. Unilever sells ice cream under Wall’s brand in India. 
Ferrero, which has so far played in the premium segment, will now look to build a portfolio which would cater to the masses. “We have Tic Tac in Rs10 and Rs5 price points. But we need more products in Rs10 and Rs20. We may not have chocolates at these price points. But we will have products at Rs10 and Rs20 in sugar confectionery. At present, we do not cover a big part of the market in India. Sooner or later, that has to be addressed,"" said Pelle.
India’s chocolate confectionary market is projected to grow at 8% per annum between 2016 and 2021 to reach Rs16,200 crore (on constant value) from Rs11,256 crore in 2016, primarily on the back of better retailing across rural areas, shows a study by consulting firm Euromonitor International.

“The market momentum continued to be favorable and I am pleased that we have sustained our broad based volume growth across categories. There is an improvement in margins due to favorable cost of commodities and cost efficiency programs. However, we are now witnessing headwinds in commodity prices,"" Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director, Nestlé India, said in a statement.
Revenue from operations grew by 8.6% during the quarter, helped by volume growth across categories, to  ₹ 2,698.40 crore from  ₹ 2,484.73 crore in the same quarter last year. Its revenue from domestic market grew by 8.5% and exports by 8%% during the quarter under review.
“The growth rates are adversely impacted due to lower reported sales by the change in structure of indirect taxes and reduction in realisations to pass on the GST (Goods and Services Tax) benefits. On a comparable basis, domestic sales growth is ‘estimated’ at 14.5% supported by increase in volumes on a base impacted by softer trading ahead of the rollout of GST,"" the company said in a statement.
According to Nestle India, its chocolate brand KitKat, instant coffee brand Nescafé and instant noodles brand Maggi continued to grow strongly during the period under review. The local unit of the Swiss packaged food company has also entered the breakfast cereal market with Nesplus and canned beverages with Nescafé ready-to-drink offerings during the immediate past quarter to boost presence in growing health and nutrition space.
“We are committed to a healthier future and are continuing to enhance the nutrition profile of our products by adding ingredients like whole grains, vegetables and micronutrients and have been reducing public health sensitive nutrients. We have also taken a pledge and announced our roadmap for reduction of sodium, sugar and fat in relevant categories. We seek to make our portfolio tasty and yet more nutritious for our consumers,"" the company said.

New Delhi: Nestle India Ltd’s instant noodles brand Maggi has attained over 60% market share and almost touched the pre-crisis level in value terms, said a top company official. However, volume-wise Maggi is still away from the pre-crisis period, when Nestle used to dominate the market with 75% market share.
“We are little over 60% (market share). In business terms, we are almost back to where we were (in terms of pre-crisis). In value terms, we are almost back there,"" said Nestle India chairman and managing director Suresh Narayanan.
He further said, “We still have some time to catch up that pre-crisis volume."" Presently, Maggi contributes around one-third of the total sales of the company. “Total contribution from the prepared foods (Maggi and Maggi franchise) is about 30%,"" said Narayanan in a media roundtable.
Nestle India had in 2017 crossed the  ₹ 10,000-crore sales mark.
Maggi was banned by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) in June 2015 for five months for allegedly containing lead beyond permissible limits, forcing Nestle India to withdraw the product from the market. Following legal battles, the popular noodles brand was back in the market in November 2015."

New Delhi: Nestle India Ltd is looking to position itself as a complete maker of packaged breakfast products and capitalise on this growing market by drawing in millions of Indians who still prefer freshly-cooked homemade breakfast.
“Nestle now becomes a breakfast company. We now have products that can be part of one’s breakfast,"" Suresh Narayanan, Nestle India’s chairman and managing director, said on Monday.
Narayanan was referring to the launch last month of breakfast cereal brand, Nesplus, adding to Nestle’s portfolio of coffee, yogurt, curd, oats, noodles and milk.
Nesplus has placed the Swiss packaged foods maker in competition with US-based Kellogg’s which has a 30% share of India’s breakfast cereal market. The local unit of US food and beverage maker PepsiCo has also been trying to crack the market with packaged local food items such as idli, dosa, upma and khichdi in ready-to-cook form.
India’s breakfast cereal market is forecast to expand to  ₹ 2,610 crore by 2020 from  ₹ 1,440 crore in 2015, according to market research firm Euromonitor International. Nestle India, in comparison, posted a revenue of  ₹ 10,135 crore in 2017.
Narayanan is hopeful Nestle will slowly crack India’s breakfast market to sync with its strategy of volume-led growth adopted after the local unit faced a crisis in June 2015 when the country’s food regulator banned its single-largest revenue earner, Maggi instant noodles, for alleged presence of monosodium glutamate and excess lead. It forced Nestle to remove Maggi from retail shelves for about six months.
“We are yet to reach the pre-crisis level. In terms of volume, we are about 10% below that level. In terms of market share, we have crossed 60%. We’ll still need some time to catch the pre-crisis level,"" he said. Maggi currently comprises about 30% of Nestle India’s annual sales.
Nestle India, which crossed the  ₹ 1-trillion mark in market capitalisation last month to emerge as the third-largest packaged goods company after Hindustan Unilever Ltd and ITC Ltd, said it is ready to “evaluate"" potential opportunities for acquisitions.
“So far, we have grown through the organic route and there are strong organic growth opportunities still left. But, if there is an interesting and manageable opportunity that fits into the company’s long-term growth strategy, we’ll certainly evaluate,"" Narayanan said.
He, however, didn’t say whether Nestle is evaluating GSK Consumer Healthcare’s malt-based health drink brand, Horlicks, or Kraft Heinz’s Complan, which are currently on the block.

Glaxo has sent out an information memorandum with preliminary details about the business to possible suitors, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private.

The sale has attracted interest from potential bidders including Nestle SA, PepsiCo Inc. and Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc, they said.
The UK drugmaker announced in March that it aims to complete a strategic review of Horlicks and other nutritional products by the end of this year. The company is assessing its 72.5% holding in India-listed GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Ltd as part of that process. Proceeds from a potential sale could be used to finance Glaxo’s $13 billion buyout of Novartis AG’s stake in their consumer-health joint venture.
Representatives for Glaxo and Nestle declined to comment. Spokesmen for Reckitt and Pepsi had no immediate comment.
Glaxo’s review of assets includes its 82% stake in the Dhaka-listed GlaxoSmithKline Bangladesh Ltd, as well as marketing rights to some consumer-health brands in other emerging economies including Malaysia, the people said. There’s no certainty the deliberations will lead to a transaction, and the parent company may yet decide to keep the businesses, they said.
Shares of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare have advanced nearly 9% in India trading this year, giving the company a market value of  ₹ 29,900 crore ($4.3 billion).

55,2018-08-23,Nestle,"As growth in Maggi noodles comes to more normal levels, Nestle India needs other categories to step upthe confectionery segment has done so in the first half

Nestle India Ltd’s beverages portfolio hit one out of the park in the first half of calendar year 2018 (H1 CY18). The Maggi noodles build-up continued to contribute, said the company, but a flattening market share gain suggests it is growing along with the market, or is slightly ahead. 
Nestle India Ltd’s beverages portfolio hit one out of the park in the first half of calendar year 2018 (H1 CY18). The Maggi noodles build-up continued to contribute, said the company, but a flattening market share gain suggests it is growing along with the market, or is slightly ahead.
The company’s annual analyst meet presentation breaks out critical variables such as volume growth, category-wise growth and market share figures for the first half of the year. The Maggi instant noodles’ sales rebuild, after they were banned and then reintroduced, is a closely watched metric. In the six months ended 30 June, Maggi’s market share in instant noodles was 59.1%, down 40 basis points from a year ago.
One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
However, the trailing 12-month market share as of 30 June at 59.7% is still higher compared to 58.7% a year ago. The market share gains have tapered and indicated that noodles’ growth is likely to mirror the market growth. Still, that’s nothing to scoff at. Sales of this category, which also includes sauces and soups, rose by 15% in the first half of the year, led by volumes.
Nestle India’s market share in instant coffee rose by 3 percentage points to 50.2% in the first half of 2018, which partly explains the sharp increase in sales growth to 23.1%. Its liquid beverage variants added to growth as well.
While the company’s milk and nutrition products—infant formula and baby foods, and milk products—will remain the largest contributor to sales, this segment’s growth is usually lower compared to its other segments. 
As growth in fast-growing categories such as noodles comes to more normal levels, Nestle India needs other categories to step up. Confectionery sales growth has stepped up in the first half.
New products or variants will continue to support the company’s aim to maintain double-digit growth. In the first half of 2018, new products’ contribution to sales was 3% compared to 2.8% a year ago. 
Nestle India will join a growing number of consumer goods companies, which realize that India is a country made up of many markets. For instance, some products could sell well in some states, but not in others. As these markets grow in size, large companies see merit in customizing some products or variants for these markets. What shape this takes for Nestle India needs to be seen.
While its sales machine seems to be humming along, commodity prices are helping it, too. The company’s commodity price index is down by 5.8% in the June quarter, from over a year ago.
The main risks for Nestle India at this point appear to be stiff competition in the three smaller categories, but ones that are growing ahead in sales growth. Spike in commodity prices is yet another risk. While the outlook for Nestle India’s growth appears positive, a 43% increase in the stock in the past six months indicates that it may already be priced in."

Zurich: Nespresso maker Nestle on Tuesday said it has sealed a deal to market the products of US coffee giant Starbucks around the world, outside of its cafes.
Swiss food giant Nestle, which also produces Nescafe instant coffee, had announced in May it would pay $7.15 billion (6.13 billion euros) for the rights to market Starbucks coffee globally. Under the deal, some 500 Starbucks employees in the US and Europe will join Nestle, the Swiss company said in a statement. 
“With Starbucks, Nescafe and Nespresso we bring together the world’s most iconic coffee brands,"" Nestle CEO Mark Schneider said. “The outstanding collaboration between the two teams resulted in a swift completion of this agreement, which will pave the way to capture further growth opportunities,"" he added. 
According to the statement, the deal will significantly boost Nestle’s portfolio in North America. Under Schneider’s leadership, Nestle has made coffee a key priority in its growth strategy, particularly in the US. Since the CEO took over in January 2017, the group has bought a majority stake in California-based high-end brand Blue Bottle Coffee and acquired Texan brand Chameleon Cold Brew.
Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said his firm is also set for a major boost under the deal. “Bringing together the world’s leading coffee retailer, the world’s largest food and beverage company, and the world’s largest and fast-growing installed base of at-home and single-serve coffee machines helps us amplify the Starbucks brand around the world while delivering long-term value creation for our shareholders,"" Johnson said."

Tokyo/Zurich: The company that brought you milk chocolate, Maggi instant noodles and Rocky Road ice cream is worried about your health. 
Tokyo/Zurich: The company that brought you milk chocolate, Maggi instant noodles and Rocky Road ice cream is worried about your health.
Nestle SA, the world’s largest food company, has joined the trend for personalized nutrition with a blend of artificial intelligence, DNA testing and the modern obsession with Instagramming food. The program, begun in aging Japan, could provide the Swiss company with a wealth of data about customers’ wellness and diet as it pivots toward consumers who are seeking to improve their health and longevity.
In Japan, some 100,000 users of the “Nestle Wellness Ambassador"" program send pictures of their food via the popular Line app that then recommends lifestyle changes and specially formulated supplements. The program can cost $600 a year for capsules that make nutrient-rich teas, smoothies and other products such as vitamin-fortified snacks. A home kit to provide samples for blood and DNA testing helps identify susceptibility to common ailments like high cholesterol or diabetes.
“Most of the personalized approach is driven by smaller companies, that’s why it was fairly limited,"" said Ray Fujii, a partner at L.E.K. Consulting in Japan. “Nestle is taking a further step. They’re trying to figure out the algorithm between the test results and the genetic information and what they recommend as a solution. If they could do it, it’s a very big step.""
Snacks to supplements
Nestle’s program is part of a change in direction for the 152-year-old company, which sold off its US candy unit this year amid falling demand for sugary treats. Nestle has made a spate of investments targeted at healthier options including vegetarian meal maker Sweet Earth Foods and meal-delivery service Freshly. The company bought Canadian dietary supplements maker Atrium Innovations in March for $2.3 billion, its biggest medical-nutrition purchase in more than a decade.
“Health problems associated with food and nutrition have become a big issue,"" said Kozo Takaoka, head of the company’s business in Japan, in an interview in Tokyo. “Nestle must address that on a global basis and make it our mission for the 21st century."" He said the wellness segment could eventually account for half of Nestle’s sales in Japan.
The investments come with the burgeoning interest in so-called nutraceuticals — food-derived ingredients that are processed and packaged as medicine or wellness aids -- among consumers that are increasingly skeptical about mass products. Nestle employs more than a hundred scientists in areas including cell biology, gastrointestinal medicine and genomics at the Nestle Institute of Health Sciences and has been developing tools to analyze and measure people’s nutrient levels.
“Decades in the future, all companies will probably have to be doing it,"" said Jon Cox, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux. “The industry has probably had a setback as consumers also want natural and less processed products while adding supplements is seen as artificial or creating Frankenstein food.""
Some nutritionists are skeptical that tailored diet plans based around supplements are useful and that they may have more of a psychological effect than a medical one.
“Nestle’s program is designed to personalize diets in ways unlikely to be necessary,"" said Marion Nestle, a nutrition professor at New York University who isn’t linked to the KitKat maker. “If we think something will make us healthier, we are likely to feel healthier.""
Genetics and AI
One of the early adopters among the food companies was Campbell Soup Co., which invested $32 million in 2016 in San Francisco-based startup Habit, which uses DNA and blood profiles to make diet recommendations, as well as offering nutritional coaching and tailored meal-kits.
Big Food is tapping expertise in AI and genetics to navigate a sea change in the way consumers make choices, which has upended businesses from transportation to television.
“In the 21st century, innovation is using the internet and AI to solve problems that our customers didn’t realize they had, or problems they had given up on,"" said Takaoka, who is famous in Japan for making the KitKat chocolate wafer an iconic local snack by adding green tea and other flavours.
He said big consumer companies can no longer rely on the power of their brands to woo a generation that grew up with e-commerce.
“They just search for things, they don’t pick the brand,"" he said. “When people talk about brand marketing, I’m just thinking ‘what’s that?’""
Kale smoothies
Hitomi Kasuda, a 47-year-old freelance writer, says drinking Nestle’s kale smoothie and other health drinks as much as four times a week helps her feel better about not eating enough vegetables. She gave up using the chat function on the app, but said she’s keen to get the DNA test.
“There’s probably a lot of things I don’t realize about my health that I can discover in a blood and genetics test,"" said Kasuda, who lives south of Tokyo in Yokohama. “Even if I feel healthy, I’d like to know more about the quality of my health.""
In his 2016 book “Nutrition for a Better Life,"" former Nestle chief Peter Brabeck-Letmathe proposed that personalized diet and health programs were the future of nutrition. “Using a capsule similar to a Nespresso, people will be able to take individual nutrient cocktails or prepare their food via 3-D printers according to electronically recorded health recommendations,"" he wrote.
Two years later, Japanese subscribers in the wellness program now drink nutrient-fortified teas dispensed in capsules using a product similar to Nespresso, Nestle’s trademark coffee machine.
“We’re getting consumer buy-in because we live in a hedonistic, me-first kind of world,"" said Peter Jones, a nutritional scientist at the University of Manitoba in Canada. “This is going to be the manifestation of the future. The one-size-fits-all platform is a thing of the past."""

London: Nestle, Unilever and Coca-Cola are among bidders for GlaxoSmithKline’s Indian Horlicks nutrition business, expected to fetch more than $4 billion, four people familiar with the matter said. 
Initial bids were due on Monday and the three consumer goods giants are seen as frontrunners for a business that offers a significant footprint in a fast-growing emerging market.
Even though Indian shoppers have lately been pressured by a currency devaluation and goods and service tax, the country’s growing population and rising wealth make it attractive for companies trying to offset weak growth in Western markets. 
It was not clear which other companies were bidding, although Reckitt Benckiser, a company eager to build up its consumer health operation, did not make an offer, two sources said. 
GSK, Nestle, Reckitt and Unilever declined to comment. Officials at Coca-Cola were not immediately available. 
Horlicks is a malt-based drink dating back to 1873, when two British-born men, James and William Horlick, founded a company in Chicago to manufacture it. It was taken to India by soldiers who had fought with the British Army in the First World War.
Sold as a bedtime drink in Britain, Horlicks has been developed into a much bigger brand by GSK in India. But the drugmaker started a review of that business and some smaller products, after buying Novartis out of their consumer healthcare joint venture for $13 billion in March. 
GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley, who took over last year, is looking to sharpen the focus of what is one of the world’s more diversified pharmaceuticals companies. 
The main asset on the block is GSK’s 72.5% stake in its Indian subsidiary GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, which is famous for Horlicks but also makes products including the chocolate-flavoured malt-based drink Boost. 
One source said Nestle was particularly well-suited to buy the business, as the world’s biggest packaged food company already owns rival malt drink Milo and has a big presence in India, which bodes well for synergies.
Nestle has told GSK privately of its interest in Horlicks on several occasions over the years, people familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this year. 
For Coke, buying the Horlicks business would mark another multibillion-dollar acquisition, following a deal to buy Costa Coffee for $5.1 billion last month.
GSK is being advised by Morgan Stanley and Greenhill.
The company sold its much smaller UK Horlicks business to Aimia Foods earlier this year for an undisclosed amount."

Geneva/Zurich: Nestle SA Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider took another step toward sharpening the food giant’s portfolio, putting the company’s skin-care business with sales of 2.7 billion Swiss francs ($2.8 billion) on the block.
The maker of Nescafe and KitKat said Thursday it opened a strategic review of its skin health unit that should be complete by mid-2019. A sale could fetch as much as 8 billion francs, estimates Alain Oberhuber, an analyst at MainFirst.
Nestle has been buying and selling businesses at an accelerated pace under Schneider amid pressure from activist investor Dan Loeb to focus on its main food and beverage businesses. Selling dermatological brands would dismantle a business that his predecessor Paul Bulcke touted as a promising new avenue of growth.
Loeb’s Third Point hedge fund has called on the company to increase shareholder returns. In a January letter, Loeb said Nestle’s foray into dermatology seems unrelated to its core business and should be unwound.
Nestle Skin Health makes products ranging from acne medicines to injectable skin fillers that compete with Botox. The unit, with sales of about 2.7 billion Swiss francs ($2.8 billion) last year, has been a weak spot for the company due to generic competition, and is cutting hundreds of jobs and closing sites.
“One of the CEO’s top priorities at the beginning of his mandate was to stop the hemorrhaging, which had been tolerated for some time,"" Jean-Philippe Bertschy, an analyst at Bank Vontobel AG, wrote in a note. The unit had engaged in “record value destruction in the past four years,"" and now Nestle is “executing like a metronome.""
Nestle shares rose as much as 0.6% in early trading. They’re little changed from where they were before Loeb announced his stake in June last year.
The business was built out of a joint venture called Galderma that Nestle formed with L’Oreal SA in 1981. Nestle paid L’Oreal more than $3 billion to buy the business out in 2014 and in the following months paid a further $1.4 billion to buy a portfolio of skin-care drugs from Valeant Pharmaceuticals.
This week Nestle agreed to sell Gerber Life Insurance to Western & Southern Financial Group for $1.55 billion as it considers such financial products outside its main business. The company also sold $8 billion of bonds to help fund its alliance with Starbucks Corp.

London: Drink companies Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Nestle were found to be the world’s biggest producers of plastic trash, a report by environmental group Greenpeace said on Tuesday.
Working with the Break Free From Plastic movement, Greenpeace said it orchestrated 239 plastic clean-ups in 42 countries around the world, which resulted in the audit of 187,000 pieces of plastic trash. The aim was to get a picture of how large corporations contribute to the problem of pollution.
Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soft drink maker, was the top waste producer, Greenpeace said, with Coke-branded plastic trash found in 40 of the 42 countries.
“These brand audits offer undeniable proof of the role that corporations play in perpetuating the global plastic pollution crisis,"" said Von Hernandez, global coordinator for Break Free From Plastic.
Overall, the most common type of plastic found was polystyrene, which goes into packaging and foam coffee cups, followed closely by PET, used in bottles and containers.
“We share Greenpeace’s goal of eliminating waste from the ocean and are prepared to do our part to help address this important challenge,"" a Coke spokesman said in a statement. The company has pledged to collect and recycle a bottle or can for every one it sells by 2030.
All three companies have made pledges about their packaging for 2025. Coke says all its packaging will be recyclable, Nestle says it will be recyclable or reusable and PepsiCo says it will be recyclable, compostable or biodegradable.
They are all also working to use recycled content in their packaging.
Nestle, the world’s largest food and drink maker, said it recognised the issue and is working hard to eliminate non-recyclable plastics. It said it was also exploring different packaging solutions and ways to facilitate recycling and eliminate plastic waste.

Zurich/London: Nestle SA is losing its highest-ranking executive in Asia as an opening for the top job at rival Unilever looms.
Wan Ling Martello, 60, is leaving at the end of this year to explore new opportunities and will be replaced by Chris Johnson, the Vevey, Switzerland-based company said Thursday. The shift comes as Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch maker of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, has spent almost a year looking for a replacement for Chief Executive Officer Paul Polman, sparking speculation Martello may be trying to line up that job.
It’s the highest-profile departure at Nestle since Mark Schneider became CEO last year, the first time in about a century that the world’s biggest food company gave the top job to an outsider. Schneider’s reign has been notable for an absence of management upheaval, as the CEO said last year he thought the company had the right people in the right places.
“We regret the departure of Wan Ling Martello, and are surprised by the choice of Chris Johnson,"" Jean-Philippe Bertschy, an analyst at Bank Vontobel AG, wrote in a note. “We believe that this represents a temporary solution to guarantee a smooth transition.""
Both Nestle and Unilever reported sales Thursday. The Swiss company’s rose 2.8% on an adjusted basis in the first nine months, matching analysts’ estimates, while revenue gained 4.5% at the Anglo-Dutch rival in the third quarter, a bit higher than the consensus.
Nestle rose as much as 0.8% in Zurich, with Unilever down 1.3% in Amsterdam.
Unilever, which began a search last year for a successor to the 62-year-old Polman, said nothing about the process on Thursday. Analysts have said the failure of a plan to consolidate Unilever’s headquarters in the Netherlands, following dissent from some UK shareholders, could accelerate his departure.
The latest numbers show that consumer goods companies are still struggling to raise prices amid pressure from discount retailers. But Martello is leaving her business zone in good condition. Her region is Nestle’s most profitable and fastest-growing, though the US-China trade war has cast a cloud over future prospects. She joined Nestle seven years ago, having formerly worked for Walmart Inc.
Nestle is promoting one of its longstanding executives as activist investor Dan Loeb says the company needs more outsiders. Third Point, Loeb’s firm, has invested about $3.5 billion in the Nescafe maker.
Martello is a US citizen but speaks Mandarin and Tagalog, having both Chinese and Filipino heritage. She also previously served as Nestle’s chief financial officer.
“We have viewed her as a change agent internally and something of a figurehead for a newer, more emerging-market and digital-savvy Nestle,"" wrote Martin Deboo, an analyst at Jefferies.
While Nestle’s China revenue is now growing at a mid-single-digit percentage pace, the escalating trade war threatens to damp consumption. Danone said Wednesday Chinese customs officials are becoming stricter on imports of foreign baby food, a business that both the French company and Nestle have expanded into.
Johnson is a 35-year veteran at Nestle and helped implement Globe, a program to monitor costs worldwide and boost efficiency. The promotion is a boon for him, as he was regarded as a candidate when the Nestle CEO job came up. The 57-year-old Los Angeles native, who has been heading human resources since August, also ran the Americas zone between 2011 and 2014, which was a “less-than-successful period,"" according to Andrew Wood, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “The departure of Wan Ling Martello is a big disappointment,"" he wrote. “Her departure leaves a hole that will be tough for Nestle to fill.""

New Delhi:  FMCG major Nestle on Thursday welcomed the Supreme Court’s order that allowed NCDRC to proceed with a three-year-old suit with regard to Maggi filed by the government only on the basis of laboratory test reports by CFTRI.
The apex court was hearing a case filed by the company against two interim orders passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) in a suit filed by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs seeking damages of  ₹ 640 crore.
The government had moved NCDRC after Nestle’s popular instant noodles Maggi was banned by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) in June 2015 for allegedly containing lead beyond permissible limits, forcing the company to withdraw the product from the market.
“Nestle India welcomes the orders passed by the Supreme Court in Maggi Noodles matter today (Thursday),"" the company said in a statement.
A bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud said the report from CFTRI (Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysuru), where the testing of the Maggi noodle samples was conducted, will form the basis for the proceedings.
According to Nestle, CFTRI “analysis results showed that samples (of Maggi Noodles) were compliant for lead and other relevant parameters"".
However, Nestle India added that “full details will be known only after receipt of the order by the company"".
The top court had earlier stayed the proceedings before the NCDRC after Nestle had challenged it.
The consumer affairs ministry had in 2015 filed a complaint against Nestle India before the NCDRC using a provision for the first time in the Consumer Protection Act.
On January 13, 2016, the Supreme Court had directed the NABL-accredited CFTRI to clarify if the results of sample tests on Maggi Noodles show lead and monosodium glutamate (MSG) levels to be within permissible limits.
The results were forwarded to the SC on April 11, stating that 29 tested samples showed lead levels within permissible levels."

Zurich: Nestle next month will start to drop plastic straws from its products and is working on biodegradable water bottles in a drive to reduce plastic waste, it said on Tuesday.
The steps are part of a campaign launched last year by firms including the Swiss group, the world’s biggest packaged food company, to make all packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025. 
They come amid a global crackdown on throw-away items that can languish for years in oceans and landfills.
Nestle said from February it would start using alternative materials such as paper and adopt designs to replace plastic straws and reduce litter.
Nestle’s bottled water unit Nestle Waters would increase the recycled PET, a type of plastic, content in its bottles to 35 % by 2025 globally and reach 50 % in the United States, with a specific focus on its Poland Spring brand. It would raise the recycled PET content for some European water brands to half by 2025. 
Nestle was developing new paper-based materials and biodegradable polymers that are also recyclable. “This could become a valuable option in places where recycling infrastructure does not yet exist and will not be available for some time,"" it said in a statement.
Nestle said it was collaborating with US-based Danimer Scientific to develop a marine biodegradable and recyclable bottle for its water business, and with PureCycle Technologies to produce food-grade recycled polypropylene, a polymer used for packing food in trays, tubs, cups and bottles.

43,2019-02-01,Nestle,"FMCG firms see higher demand with more money in your handsBudget may boost consumption in short term, but CEOs caution against staggering unemployment, stagnant incomes

NEW DELHI :
The fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry has welcomed the budget saying that the measures will help farmers and spur consumer spending among middle-class.
Dabur India chief executive officer Sunil Duggal said the budget would boost overall consumer confidence and play a catalyst for demand generation for branded consumer staples and consumer products.
The government's decision to allocate  ₹60,000 crore for MNREGA and another  ₹19,000 for construction of rural roads under Gram Sadak Yojana, coupled with the modest farm support scheme offering income support for marginal farmers tick all the right boxes when it comes to fuelling the rural and agrarian economy, Duggal said.
However, the upward revision in fiscal deficit target to 3.4% of GDP for 2018-19 and 2019-20 remains an area of concern, he said.
""The interim budget proposals should augur well for the Indian economy by providing a growth impetus through a boost in consumption as well as an inclusive framework designed to benefit agri and rural communities, unorganised sector workers as well the middle class,"" ITC managing director Sanjiv Puri said.
Marico's managing director and CEO Saugata Gupta said the host of measures to boost the agrarian economy through minimum support price and increased investment in the farmer scheme is a welcome move as it will benefit small and marginal farmers.
""Simplified tax assessment processes coupled with the increase in tax exemption for income upto  ₹5 lakh per annum for individual tax payers, will not only reduce the tax burden on the middle class citizens but also increase the tax payer base in India. It will additionally result in the rise of disposable income in the hands of consumers thereby augmenting consumption,"" he added.
FMCG major Nestle India expect measures announced will further accelerate domestic consumption.
Echoing the views, Godrej Consumer Products managing director and CEO Vivek Gambhir said, ""Overall, this is a 'consumption first' budget that will provide a much-needed thrust to growth in the FMCG sector. It re-emphasises the aam aadmi at the heart of the government's pro-growth, pro-reform agenda; maintaining the fiscal deficit, stimulating demand and building a sustainable growth platform.""
According to Jyothy Laboratories joint managing director Ullas Kamath, the decision of reducing the tax burden on the salaried individual's will boost the consumer sentiment thereby increase purchasing power.
""The balanced efforts taken towards the rural and the urban economy will help in boosting the demand supply chain of the country,"" he said.
The retail sector is also likely to benefit due to the budget feels Retailers Association of India CEO Kumar Rajagopalan.
""More money in the hands of middle class, thanks to the increase in basic exemption limit from  ₹2.5 lakh to  ₹5 lakh will be beneficial for retail as it will create a feeling of well-being, which is known to boost consumption,"" he said.
However, toy manufacturer Funskool India's CEO John Baby said the budget does not provide any impetus for manufacturing sector to create more employment."
42,2019-02-13,Nestle,"Nestle will start selling Starbucks labelled coffee beans, roast and ground coffee Nestle is building on this existing product range and taking it to new markets under the deal struck last May

VEVEY :
Nestle will sell Starbucks-branded coffee at grocery stores and online in Europe, Asia and Latin America from this month as it seeks to increase its lead over rivals such as JAB.
After last year's $7.15 billion cash deal for exclusive rights to sell the US chain's coffees and teas, Nestle will start selling Starbucks labelled coffee beans, roast and ground coffee and single-serve capsules for its Nespresso and Nescafe Dolce Gusto coffee makers.
These will be available at grocery stores and online in Belgium, Brazil, Chile, China, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain and Britain, with more markets following later this year, the world's biggest food group said on Wednesday.
Asked whether the launch of Starbucks Nespresso capsules would help Nespresso return to double-digit growth, Patrice Bula, executive vice president and head of strategic business units, marketing, sales and Nespresso, told a media briefing: ""Yes, I hope so, yes. We have huge ambitions.""
Starbucks, the world's biggest coffee chain, has been selling its coffee for use at home -- including a variety of roasts in whole beans, instant or ground versions as well as coffee pods for its Verismo brewers and JAB's Keurig K-Cup system -- across North America for years.
Nestle is building on this existing product range and taking it to new markets under the deal struck last May which allows Starbucks to focus on its cafes and Nestle, with its retail expertise, to bring Starbucks coffee to supermarket shelves around the world.
Under last year's deal Starbucks, which is expanding in China and finally ventured into coffee-obsessed Italy in September, will have its out-of-home business managed by Nestle, while continuing to sell its ready-to-drink products directly.

NEW DELHI :
Packaged foods and beverages company Nestle India on Thursday reported a 9.6% jump in net profit for the December quarter at  ₹342 crore, the company said in a filing to the stock exchange.
In the year ago period Nestle India, the maker of popular Maggi Noodles and Kit Kat chocolate, posted a profit of  ₹311.8 crore.
For the quarter ended Dec 31, Nestle India posted a 12% jump in total income at  ₹2972.5 crore up from  ₹2,652 crore in the same quarter of the previous year.
Domestic sales during the quarter increased by 12% supported by volumes and are broad based, Nestle said in its earnings release. However, export sales during the quarter remained flat due to lower exports to countries such as Bangladesh and United Arab Emirates, the company added.
Nestle also announced its full year earnings on Feb 14. Total income for the full year stood at  ₹ ₹11,551 crore, with annual net profit up 31% at  ₹1607 crore.
“There has been double-digit growth in almost all the categories, supported by a step up in demand generating activities including on new products,"" Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director, Nestlé India said of the company’s full year earnings and the quarter.

41,2019-02-14,Nestle,"Nestle plans to push further into plant-based alternatives for proteinNestle also said it’s accelerating its buyback to complete the 20 billion-franc program six months early

Nestle SA put its ailing Herta lunch-meat business up for sale as Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider tries to spur sales growth at the world’s largest food company through acquisitions and divestments.
The Swiss company’s shares rose as much as 3.7% to a record as it forecast improved sales and said that it expects to cede control of its dermatology unit by the middle of this year. After 14 billion francs ($14 billion) of deals in 2018, there’s no sign Schneider will stop nipping and tucking in his third year on the job.
“He’s outside of the longstanding culture within Nestle, which has given him ability to think with a slightly different perspective and act decisively,"" said Thomas Russo, fund manager at Gardner Russo & Gardner, which has held Nestle shares for 33 years. “And you see the evidence beginning to show.""
Revenue accelerated for the first time in seven years in 2018. The food company has been gobbling up smaller, faster-growing brands such as Blue Bottle Coffee and Sweet Earth as health-conscious consumers switch from mainstream labels to niche brands. Nestle, under pressure from activist shareholder Dan Loeb to boost returns, also forecast 700 million francs of restructuring costs this year amid the shake-up.
The company plans to push further into plant-based alternatives for protein as it considers selling Herta, a business with sales of 680 million francs. The field is quickly expanding as Danone adds more almond-based milks and Unilever bought The Vegetarian Butcher, a Dutch maker of meat substitutes. Nestle has been developing the Incredible Burger, which is made out of soy and wheat protein.
“With these portfolio changes, the strategic picture of the group becomes much clearer than one to two years ago, with our focus on food and beverage and nutritional health,"" Schneider told reporters at Nestle’s headquarters in Vevey.
One obstacle is deflation in Europe, Japan and Australia, which contributed to the weakest annual gain in pricing in more than a decade. Nestle will need to raise prices without turning off customers as Schneider seeks to return to mid-single-digit sales growth by next year. Growth was 3% in 2018.
Share buyback
Nestle also said it’s accelerating its buyback to complete the 20 billion-franc program six months early. Still, Schneider told reporters the company isn’t excluding further M&A.
“Acquisitions could easily be financed,"" he said. “We have strong cash generation, and one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry.""
The CEO said portfolio adjustments aren’t over. Investors have called for the sale of Nestle’s US frozen-food business, which had flat sales in 2018.
“Consumer behaviors change in food and beverage, and we want to bet on areas that are growing fast,"" he said.
Following criticism by Loeb that the board lacks consumer-goods expertise, Nestle proposed Dick Boer, former CEO of Dutch grocer Ahold, and Dinesh Paliwal, CEO of Harman, the car-stereo maker that was sold to Samsung, as new directors."
39,2019-02-19,Nestle,"Between 2016 and 2018, Nestle India saw 39 new brand launches in the aftermath of the Maggi banThe firm recently launched a bittergourd-flavoured yogurt, after it forayed into the breakfast cereals market last year

New Delhi: Nestlé India, the local arm of Swiss food and beverage company Nestlé, is working on two or three dozen new products in existing and new categories, even as the maker of Maggi noodles continues to consolidate its portfolio in India, a top executive of the company said on Monday.
These launches will be rolled out over the next few years, in line with the Gurgaon-headquartered company’s move to diversify its portfolio beyond its core Maggi and Nescafe brands.
“Going forward we will be aggressive (on new launches),"" Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director, Nestlé India, said at the company’s research and development centre in Manesar, Haryana, on 18 February. “At least two to three dozen projects are on the anvil,"" he said, without giving a timeline for these launches.
The company recently launched a bitter gourd-flavoured yogurt after its entry into the breakfast cereals market last year.
Nestlé has been on an innovation spree after facing a crisis that saw its popular brand of Maggi noodles being banned across India. The company has since pushed for diversification of its portfolio. As a result, its product launches have seen a spike.
Between 2016 and 2018, Nestle India saw 39 new brand launches in the aftermath of the Maggi ban. Of these, 11 products were subsequently discontinued, according to an August 2018 investor presentation by the company.
Analysts remain largely positive about new products being rolled out by the company. “Nestlé has typically been conservative when it comes to innovation in India as it has traditionally focused on the bottom line. However, that has been changing over the last few years as it is investing in new products,"" said an analyst on condition of anonymity. “Some blockbuster products will be good for the company,"" he added.
Nestlé, which has rolled out new products such as premium chocolates, dips and spreads, breakfast cereals, nutrition bars, and ready-to-drink milk beverages in the last two years, has also recalibrated its distribution to reach more consumers.
Nestlé is cautious and could also discontinue products that are facing weak consumer demand, even as it pushes new products. “For 2019, we can also look at a bit of consolidation,"" Narayanan said.
Higher advertising and marketing spending also dragged down margins at the company, which stepped up efforts to back its new and existing brands. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Ebitda margins dipped by 361 basis points on higher brand spending. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. For the full year of 2018 marketing and advertising spending for the company was 6-7%.
Narayanan said brand support would continue as Nestlé sought to ramp up the contribution of new products in its overall portfolio.
On 18 February, Narayanan also announced the launch of a new India-specific website AskNestle.com. This will be rolled out as a platform to get “scientifically validated information on nutrition and recipes"", he said.
For now, the website will work as “an information dissemination platform and going forward it could morph into something bigger that we could link up with our own e-commerce intentions,"" he added."

A 25 percent slump in the share price of Billionaire Aloke Lohia’s Indorama Ventures Pcl doesn’t have analysts worried. Instead, the stock is now rated the best equity buy among Thailand’s largest companies.
Bangkok-based Indorama, with products ranging from Nestle SA packaging to materials for Zara clothing, is forecast to surge 49 percent within a year based on the gap between the current share price and consensus 12-month target among 19 analysts.
The company announced or completed acquisitions in Brazil, Nigeria, the U.S., Germany, Egypt and India in the past five months to diversify supply and boost margins, which have been squeezed on many chemical products because of higher feedstock costs. Shares lost about a quarter of their value since early October, when margins on ethylene in North Asia were near the narrowest in about three years, and have lagged the broader market as investors assess spreads in the chemicals industry.
“With its global footprint, the company is well-positioned to manage margins, which are resilient in the U.S. and Europe, even though they are iffy in the Asia segment because we don’t know what China is doing,"" said Maria Lapiz, managing director at Maybank Kim Eng Securities (Thailand) Pcl in Bangkok.
“Share price recovery will be predicated by spreads,"" she said. If its spread stays relatively resilient, that may lead to investors revisiting its business model, she added.
Indorama shares closed Monday at 46.25 baht, down 25 percent from Oct. 3. Maybank Kim Eng’s 12-month target is 79 baht.
“Indorama remains our preferred pick in chemical space, premised on seasonal heavy demand for polyester chain products, a broad polyester chain up-cycle being in progress, and a strong profit growth profile,"" Suppata Srisuk, an analyst at Bualuang Securities Pcl, said in a report today. “Supply tightness (particularly in Europe and North America) should continue to buffer polyester chain product spreads.""
Only two other firms among Thailand’s largest 50 listed companies, Energy Absolute Pcl and Banpu Pcl, score a 12-month return potential of more than 30 percent. The average upside among SET 50 Index companies is 13 percent. It’s 16 percent for the Bloomberg Asia Pacific Chemicals Index, which has 93 members.
Indorama is expected to report fourth-quarter results this week.
Lohia set up his company in 1994 in Thailand, where he has permanent residency. It now operates factories globally, under a strategy of localized manufacturing to serve regional markets.

37,2019-02-25,Nestle,"The survey of 16 major corporations by nonprofit group CDP found that many are working to lower their carbon emissionsExamples include AB InBev's efforts to develop a variety of barley that needs less water and Unilever adjusting its detergent formulas

BERLIN :
Companies behind some of the best-known consumer products — from soaps to sodas — are beginning to factor climate change into their business equation, according to a report published Monday.
The survey of 16 major corporations by nonprofit group CDP found that many are working to lower their carbon emissions, prepare for the effects of global warming on their supply chain and respond to growing environmental consciousness among customers.
Examples include brewer AB InBev's efforts to develop a variety of barley that needs less water and Unilever adjusting its detergent formulas so they work at the lower ""eco"" temperature settings on modern washing machines, the London-based group said.
""We were surprised how much these companies were aligning themselves with changes in consumer preferences,"" said Carole Ferguson, the report's lead author.
This includes chasing trends such as veganism, a small but growing factor in the market that's driven by people who shun animal products for ethical or health reasons, but also because meat and dairy have a large carbon footprint. PepsiCo's recent acquisition of Health Warrior, a maker of plant-based nutrition bars, is a typical example where a large company has snapped up a small brand to fill a niche it didn't yet cover.
Such purchases help companies bolster their green credentials at a time when they're beginning to feel the heat of climate activism. Consumer goods account for about a third of greenhouse gas emissions, meaning companies that make them play a key role in efforts to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.
But manufacturers like Nestle, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble also face growing scrutiny from investors who want to know what business risks they face from climate change before deciding whether to buy their stock, Ferguson said.
CDP ranked the companies surveyed according to how strongly their business is threatened by climate change, what they are doing to prepare for it and how much information they disclose to the market.
""Climate change is going to be disruptive to revenues and costs,"" Ferguson told The Associated Press. ""What I would want to know as an investor is what kind of strategy they have going forward.""
In general, CDP found that European makers of fast-moving consumer goods are ahead of U.S. rivals in preparing for climate change — a disparity also seen in other sectors, such as automotive or oil and gas. France's Danone came first in the food and drinks sector, while Kraft Heinz came last out of nine; similarly Paris-based cosmetics company L'Oreal ranked second in the household and personal care sector, against New York-based rival Estee Lauder, which came last out of seven.
Possible reasons for this disparity include stricter regulation from the European Union, Ferguson said.
Consumer concern over plastic waste recently spurred strict new EU rules on packaging, the report noted.
""Product labelling and carbon footprinting is on the horizon,"" the authors added.
CDP, which was once described as ""the most powerful green NGO you've never heard of"" by Harvard Business Review, isn't alone in suggesting it's time for companies to publish data on climate risks.
Influential business weekly The Economist recently proposed that voluntary climate-related guidelines for listed companies drawn up by the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors global financial system, should be made mandatory.

ZURICH :
Nestle is looking to take a bite of the fast-growing vegan foods market with a range of plant-based burgers, saying its recipes could compete for taste with traditional beef patties.
The world's biggest packaged foods group, known for KitKat bars and Nescafe instant coffee, is trying to defend its place in consumers' shopping carts by making products healthier, with less salt and sugar, and by introducing ranges more in line with modern eating habits.
Demand for meat-free foods is rising fast. Last year total U.S. retail sales of plant-based meat substitutes grew more than 23% to exceed $760 million, according to Nielsen sales data analysed by The Good Food Institute, a non-profit organisation promoting plant-based alternatives.
Food makers also say their latest offerings are tasty enough to tempt more meat eaters' palates.
""Many consumers recognise that less meat in their diet is good for them and for the planet, but plant-based meat alternatives often do not live up to their expectations,"" Nestle said in a statement on Tuesday.
It says its meat-free burgers, to be launched in several European markets this month under the Garden Gourmet ""Incredible Burger"" brand and made from soy and wheat protein with beetroot, carrot, and bell pepper extracts, tasted almost exactly like traditional beef burgers.
In the United States the group will start rolling out a plant-based range dubbed ""Awesome Burgers"" under its Sweet Earth brand from this autumn.
Underscoring the meat-free trend, fast-food chain Burger King and Silicon Valley startup Impossible Foods on Monday announced the rollout of their vegetarian ""Impossible Whopper"" in 59 stores in and around St. Louis, Missouri.

Earlier this month, the local arm of the Swiss consumer goods company had announced that it would seek approval of its shareholders every five years for royalty payments to its parent company after receiving investor and proxy firm feedback on the issue.
Accordingly, it reviewed its royalty payout to make it more inclusive. The company added that while its General Licensing Agreements (GLAs) are reviewed periodically by the audit committee, “the resolution has been modified to provide for shareholder approval every five years in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.""
The resolution seeking shareholder nod for future payments was included as part of its agenda during the company’s upcoming 60th annual general body meeting scheduled on 25 April, the company had said in a filing to the stock exchange on 14 April."

In an attempt to prove how durable their smartphone is, Redmi by Xiaomi launched the Redmi Note 7 in space. The smartphone was nestled in a custom built case on to a gas balloon. According to the video released by Xiaomi, the custom rig rose as high as 35 km into the atmosphere with a temperature of -60 degree C. After the balloon exploded, the smartphone made its descent back to the surface of the earth.
According to GizChina, the 3D printed frame was designed to protect the handsets at that high altitude. The smartphone was found to be unscathed after its touchdown.
Redmi has previously tried proving the durability of the smartphone in several video commercials. In one of the videos posted on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, a person was shown hammering a nail in a block of wood using the smartphone's display. Unsurprisingly, the smartphone survived the abuse.
The Redmi Note 7 clicked several pictures in space to show off its 48MP rear-facing sensor. The pictures were shot with Redmi Note 7's watermark, to further add credibility to these images.
Whether the smartphone was actually launched into ""space"" is still up for debate. It did reach the stratosphere, which starts at roughly 20 km around the equator. NASA states the outer space starts at about 100 km.
This version of the Redmi Note 7 is different from the Indian variant. The Indian variant comes with stripped down specifications, including a 12MP+2MP camera setup at the rear. The Redmi Note 7 Pro, however, includes the same 48MP primary sensor found within the Chinese variant."

NEW DELHI :
Fast moving consumer goods company Nestle India on Tuesday reported a 9.2% jump in net profit for quarter ended March 31, 2019 at  ₹463.2 crore up from  ₹424 crore it reported in the year ago period.
Revenue from operations were up 9% for the quarter at  ₹3003 crore up from  ₹2757.24 crore in the corresponding year.
Nestle India follows a January-December year for accounting.
During the quarter the company faced headwinds on account of higher input costs. 
""Nestle saw gross margin compression after five quarters as gross margins dipped by 57bps YoY. This was due to some inflationary pressure in commodities such as milk, we expect tactical pricing actions from Nestle to counter inflationary pressures,"" Jefferies analyst Varun Lohchab said in a note dated May 14.
“We have continued on the track of volume led growth with our iconic brands like Maggi, Kitkat and Munch delivering strong performances. The market momentum remained strong, while the input costs have witnessed hardening,"" Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director, Nestlé India said in a statement.
Nestle's results come as somewhat of a relief amid a rural slowdown as reported by most other consumer goods firm in the March quarter.
That’s because compared to other firms such as Dabur and HUL, Nestle's exposure to rural markets is less. “Nestle saw strong domestic sales growth of 10.2% which was volume led Nestle grew ahead of HUVR during the quarter...contrary to the commentary of other consumer goods companies, Nestle highlighted that market momentum remains strong,"" Lohchab added.
For the quarter, domestic sales at Nestle India increased by 10.2% supported by volume growth; while export sales declined 8.9% due to lower coffee exports to Turkey, the company said.
The company also announced that it plans to expand its products portfolio in to the organic foods market within categories such as milk and nutrition products. These launches will happen over the next coming months, the company said in its statement.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin declined by 83 basis points to 24.4%. A basis point is 0.01%.
Still, it is encouraging that the extent of decline in the Ebitda margin was lower compared to the December quarter. Some analysts said that advertising spends growth may have been relatively lower during the March quarter.
The company’s gross margin declined during the quarter, due to higher raw material costs. Overall, this meant Ebitda increased at a slower pace of 5.4% to  ₹729 crore. Nonetheless, strong other income growth and a decline in depreciation costs led to 9% growth in pre-tax profit to  ₹713 crore.
In the past one year, the Nestlé India stock has gained around 8%, though it has fallen in this calendar year. Currently, it trades at nearly 52 times estimated earnings for the year till December 2019, based on Bloomberg data. Valuations are not particularly mouth-watering.
Sure, Nestlé India’s better urban reach could well put the company in a sweet spot at a time when the rural market is slowing. However, new product launches are crucial for revenue and earnings growth.
The company said it will be launching organic food products in the “milk products and nutrition"" category in the coming months. Investors would do well to watch the progress on this front."

Zurich: Nestle SA has entered exclusive negotiations to sell its skin health business to a consortium led by EQT Partners and Abu Dhabi's ADIA in a deal worth 10.2 billion Swiss francs ($10.12 billion), it said on Thursday.
The proposed transaction with private equity firm EQT and a unit of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority was expected to close in the second half of 2019, pending regulatory approval, it said.
Nestle will provide an update on how it will use the proceeds and its future capital structure at that time, the world's biggest packaged food group said in a statement.
Nestle shares were indicated 0.6% higher in pre-market activity.
Reuters and the Financial Times had reported on Wednesday that EQT was putting the finishing touches to the deal.
Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider put the skin health unit up for sale last September as the group moved to ditch underperforming businesses in an effort to fend off criticism from an activist investor who wanted an overhaul.
Nestle Skin Health, which sells Cetaphil and Proactiv skin care products, Restylane wrinkle fillers and prescription dermatology medicines, had sales of 2.8 billion Swiss francs last year.
Nestle created the unit in 2014 when it bought out L'Oreal's stake in their Galderma joint venture.
Under former Chief Executive Paul Bulcke, skin treatments were part of Nestle's push into higher-growth health products to counter a slowdown in its traditional food business.
But the unit has performed poorly, leading to one-off costs and restructuring.
EQT and ADIA had faced competition from rival buyout funds and some industry players including a consortium of Advent and Cinven, as well as U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co Inc and European fund PAI Partners, sources had said.

28,2019-05-17,Nestle,"Narayanan was addressing reporters on company’s entry into organic productsThe company, however, bucked the trend of a slowdown because of its lower exposure to rural market

NEW DELHI :
A below normal monsoon this year could further dampen demand for consumer companies in India’s hinterland apart from putting pressure on prices of agro-based commodities, Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director at fast moving consumer goods Nestle India said on Friday.
Narayanan was addressing reporters on company’s entry into organic products.
Commenting on the prediction made by private forecaster, Skymet earlier this week that hinted towards a lower-than expected rainfall this year, Narayanan said that, “if it is true that monsoons will be less than optimal there will definitely be a dampening effect as far as rural demand is concerned, we have already started seeing some of those manifestations.""
This is also likely to impact agro-commodity prices going forward.
“What’s also happening is that in terms of agro-commodities the trend is clearly going upwards. This will exacerbate If the monsoon are not as good as predicted,"" Narayanan said.
Nestle India posted strong volume numbers in its quarterly earnings earlier this week in contrast to the weak numbers posted by other consumer goods makers on account of a slowdown in demand, especially in rural markets.
The company, however, bucked the trend of a slowdown because of its lower exposure to rural markets.
For quarter ended March 31, 2019, the company that sells popular noodle brand Maggi, and Kit-Kat chocolates reported a 9.2% jump in net profit at  ₹463.2 crore. Revenues were up 9% to  ₹2,982 crore.
“Yes, there have been issues in terms of credit flows in the market, and aberrations because of particular channels not doing well,"" Narayanan said.
“Nestle has come out stronger than its peer groups on volume growth as about 25% of our sales are in rural India and 75% are in urban markets and urban growth rates for us have consistently been maintained,"" Narayanan said as he announced the company’s foray into organic foods.
The company is set to roll out an organic variant of Ceregrow, its children’s cereal brand, as it anticipates an emerging demand for such products going forward.
The local arm of the Swiss food and beverage company that has been on a product launch spree over the last few years to widen its portfolio and reduce dependence on a single category, has also worked on procuring organic millet, rice, wheat and milk that is likely to help the company speed up the launch of more organic products in the near future.
“The shift to organic is a worldwide trend now but I think for India it is something relatively nascent,"" Narayanan said.
Going ahead, the company will add more organic products to its portfolio, Narayanan said without divulging details. “This is the beginning. We would look at ways and means of expanding our portfolio in organic,"" he said.
According to consumer insights firm Mintel, 39% of Indian consumers it surveyed said they actively look for organic claims on packaged food and drink product labels. The share of new launches with organic claims in the market here is still very small. In 2017, Mintel noted that 10% of new packaged food launches claimed to be organic; in 2018 the percentage share of such launches dipped to 7%.
However, in a note dated May 14, Jefferies’s analyst Varun Lohchab, said: “Though we like Nestle’s focus on diversifying the portfolio and being ahead of the curve, we believe that these launches will remain niche."""
27,2019-06-03,Nestle,"Nestle and Lay’s entered the rankings on the back of better distributionAyurveda goods firm Patanjali slowed down in its reach among Indian households

NEW DELHI :
Nestle’s Sunrise coffee and PepsiCo-owned Lay’s chips entered consumer research firm Kantar’s brand footprint ranking for the first time in 2018 backed by better distribution and higher frequency of consumption among households. The findings of the research firm were released recently. The annual rankings by the research firm are based on Consumer Reach Points (CRPs), which are an outcome of the number of households buying a brand and the number of times (frequency) they bought it.
Kantar noted that its 2018 rankings—that are largely dominated by home-grown brands—saw an uptick in the frequency of purchase of local-origin (brands marketed by a foreign manufacturer, but originated in India) and foreign brands. In 2018, the rankings had 14 global brands, however, seven of these brands saw their rankings improve by 2 percentage points at least. ""This suggests that there is a minor shift towards global brands among consumers,"" Kantar noted.
Parle continued to be the leading brand in Kantar’s rankings for fast moving consumer goods, and the most frequently bought across Indian households, followed by Amul, and hair care brand Clinic Plus and Britannia.
Nestle and Lay’s entered the rankings on the back of better distribution.
“Lay’s did it on the back of strong penetration growth, while Sunrise managed to do it on the back of growing frequency,"" Kantar noted.
However, in the year that saw some brands increase their household reach, Ayurveda goods firm Patanjali slowed down in its reach among Indian households.
The Baba-Ramdev backed firm that clocked a stupendous reach among Indian households since it first entered Kantar's rankings in 2016, touching 45% penetration rate in 2017 or reaching out to half the households in India. By 2018, however, Patnajali’s penetration among Indian households stood at 49%. Kantar defines penetration as the percentage of households buying a brand at least once.
""Panatjali’s CRP, slowed from its break neck speed in 2018,"" Kantar said. In fact, in 2018, Patanjali also lost its spot as the top growing brand in terms of reach to households, the research firm added.
“It is a base effect. They are still growing, but the growth percentage is not as high because the base is big,"" said K Ramakrishnan, managing director and country head at Kantar India. While it reached more households, there was only a marginal increase in the frequency in 2018, he added.
However, Patanjali still managed to add more households in the given year, coming in at number 20 in Kantar's rankings for 2018.
As of 2018, Patanjali’s CRP stands at 915 million, and Kantar estimates that brand could reach the one-billion-mark by next year, if it continues to grow at the same pace."

MUMBAI :
The slowdown in consumer demand notwithstanding, India remains one of the fastest growing markets for Mondelez International, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of chocolate confectionary, ready-to-eat snacks and beverages, with revenues of $26 billion.
“We have seen double digit growth in the last three years, where 80% of the growth in the snacks segment will be in developing markets, and India will play a critical role in that,"" Dirk Van de Put, chairman and chief executive, Mondelēz International said in an interview.
“Globally we are a biscuit, candy and chocolate company. Barring chocolate, we would like to be big in the other segments in India. The growth there is higher, but the base is too small currently,"" he added.
At present, out of its total global revenues, India contributes about $1 billion, largely driven by Dairy Milk chocolates, a segment where it has been a market leader for a long time.
Mondelez’ competitors in India include Swiss food and drinks giant Nestle S.A., Italy’s Ferrero SpA and homegrown Parle Products Pvt. Ltd. While Mondelez claims it has a 65% share of India’s  ₹12,090-crore ($1.73 billion) chocolate confectionary market, Dairy Milk accounts for 42% of the chocolate market.
Nestle India reported a 9.6% jump in net profit for the December quarter at  ₹342 crore. In the year-ago period, the maker of KitKat chocolates posted a profit of  ₹311.8 crore. For the quarter ended 31 December, Nestle India posted a 12% jump in total income at  ₹2972.5 crore up from  ₹2,652 crore in the same quarter a year ago.
Homegrown dairy and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) major Amul reported a 13% increase in turnover at  ₹33,150 crore in 2018-19.
Challenges remain in expanding the business beyond chocolates. “In the chocolate segment, which is our core strength, we are trying to attract more health conscious customers through innovation,"" said Van de Put. “For instance, we have recently launched a new variant of the popular Dairy Milk chocolate with 30% lower sugar content.""
Mondelez’s efforts to promote new segments comes amid a slowdown in demand for most FMCG companies across segments. Hindustan Unilever (HUL), India’s largest listed consumer packaged goods firm by sales, reported a slowdown in volume growth last month.
The FMCG major reported 13% growth in net profit, while volume growth dropped to 7% in the March quarter, compared to the double-digit growth over several quarters. Its profit reached  ₹1,538 crore for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, compared to  ₹1,351 crore in year-ago period. While volume growth fell, the Ebita (earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization) margin was up by 90 basis points.
HUL’s earnings are the bellwether for India’s FMCG sector, helping gauge consumer demand and monitor sentiment.
The effect has been observed across all FMCG companies that have released their fourth quarter results. Biscuit maker Britannia Industries Ltd also saw a soft fourth quarter with 7% year-on-year volume growth. Vatika Shampoo-maker Dabur India Ltd also saw its net profit fall by 6.5% from a year earlier to  ₹371.5 crore. “We don’t look at our businesses by quarter. For us, long-term growth is more important and we have done reasonably well so far. In a country like India, making these predictions (about slowdown), can go horribly wrong,"" said Deepak Iyer, managing director, Mondelez India.
To gain market share Mondelez is exploring mergers and acquisitions, as well as strategic investments in consumer startups. “Globally, there have been a number of areas where we are better off making acquisitions, where the company has some technology or an understanding of the consumer that we don’t have,"" Van de Put said.
In India, “investing in startups, as well as mergers and acquisitions are all on the table. We will do it as and when the right opportunity presents itself, and makes strategic sense for us,"" Iyer added."

ZURICH :
Nestle SA has found a way to create chocolate without adding any sugar, relying on leftover material from cocoa plants for sweetening as consumers look for natural and healthier fare.
The food company is using a patented technique to turn the white pulp that covers cocoa beans into a powder that naturally contains sugar. This fall in Japan, Nestle will start selling KitKat bars with 70% dark chocolate under the new recipe, which doesn’t include any added sugar, the Vevey, Switzerland-based firm said. Until now, the pulp has never been used as a sweetener for chocolate, and usually it’s mostly thrown out.
Nestle could use the same process to make milk or white chocolate in the future, Alexander von Maillot, head of Nestle’s confectionery business, said in a phone interview.
The food and beverage industry is under pressure from consumers and governments alike to make healthier products amid rising obesity and diabetes rates. Nestle’s move may bolster its position as a leader in the industry, and it comes three years after finding a way to alter the structure of sugar to boost its sweetening power.
The world’s largest food company plans to use the pulp technique for other confectionery brands in additional countries next year.
“Using pulp makes it a more premium chocolate,"" von Maillot said. “Sugar is a cheap ingredient.""
Nestle’s new 70% dark chocolate will have as much as 40% less sugar than most equivalent bars with added sugar. Nestle’s existing dark chocolate KitKats have 12.3 grams of sugar per serving.
“The sugar reduction is incidental, not a focus,"" von Maillot said. “It’s more about a novel way to produce chocolate and use the best of the cocoa pod."""
23,2019-07-22,Nestle,"The HC order comes in a suit filed by Nestle against Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Limited which was applying the mark ‘A+’ to cheese slices in combination with their brand name ‘Amul’

NEW DELHI :
The Delhi high court has vacated a single judge bench order which had restrained Nestle from using ‘a+’ mark on products other than milk and dahi in a suit filed by Nestle against Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Limited which was applying the said mark ‘A+’ to cheese slices in combination with their brand name ‘Amul’.
The order was passed by a division bench comprising Justice G.S. Sistani and Justice Jyoti Singh on 10TH July.
The suit pertains to the trademark ‘A+/a+’ used by the parties. The suit was filed by Nestle to restrain Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Limited from using the trademark ‘A+’ with or without any prefix or suffix in respect of cheese, packaged milk or any other milk products.
Nestle is selling milk and dahi (yogurt) under the sub-brand ‘a+’ in conjunction with their brand ‘Nestlé’; while the Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Limited were applying the said mark ‘A+’ to cheese slices in combination with their brand name ‘Amul’.
Nestle had preferred an appeal against the single judge bench order which had directed the parties to maintain status quo and sought for an interim injunction against the defendants from using the mark ‘A+’ in milk or milk products. It had alternatively sought vacation of the impugned order which restricted it from using their mark ‘A+/a+’ for goods it is registered for.
The single judge bench had ordered: “In view of the above, the order dated 30.05.2012, is made absolute and both parties are directed to maintain status quo about the use of sub-brand “A+"" in relation to the respective goods that the parties were manufacturing as of the said date, during the pendency of the Suit. ""
“The Single Judge has incorrectly applied the parameters for granting interim reliefs. The single Judge while doubting a prima facie case in favour of the plaintiffs has proceeded to pass interim orders nonetheless. Interestingly, no appeal has been preferred by the defendants. The defendants have been unable to show as to how any interim order could have been passed against the plaintiffs. The judgments relied upon by the defendants could have come to their aid provided they had themselves approached the court, which is not the case. Thus, the alternative prayer of the plaintiffs is liable to be allowed. Accordingly, the appeal is partly allowed. The impugned order, to the extent it directs the plaintiffs to maintain status quo about the use of ‘A+/a+’ in respect of goods being manufactured on 30.05.2012, is set aside. It is clarified that the order directing status quo against the defendants remains unaffected,"" the division bench order reads."
22,2019-08-02,Nestle,"Maggi is currently manufactured at three plants in India with lines dedicated to the instant noodle brandThe new plant will come up in Gujarat

New Delhi: The local arm of Swiss consumer goods company Nestle will invest  ₹700 crore initially over the next two years to set up a new plant for Maggi noodles, nearly four years after the brand was hit by its worst food crisis in the country.
The construction of the plant will commence soon in Gujarat, the company informed stock exchanges on Friday. This will be Nestle’s ninth factory in India.
“The state-of-the-art, environmentally sustainable factory for Maggi noodles will involve an initial investment of nearly  ₹700 crore over the next two years,"" the company said in the statement.
This makes it the company’s first such investment in dedicating a new manufacturing facility for production of the instant noodle brand, after a nationwide ban in 2015 hit sales. India’s food regulator banned the sale of Maggi noodles for almost six months over allegations that the packaged food product contained more than permissible levels of lead and MSG. This forced Nestle to withdraw stocks of Maggi across India. However, the brand was relaunched later that year.
At present, Maggi instant noodles are manufactured at three plants in India with lines dedicated to the instant noodle brand. Two more plants partially produce Maggi. The new plant in Gujarat will further help boost the brand's sales.
Last year, the company announced that Maggi had attained over 60% marketshare since its withdrawal in 2015. Before the crisis, Maggi commanded a 75% share of the instant noodles market. It, however, touched its pre-crisis level mark in terms of value last year.
Maggi competes with ITC’s Yippie Noodles in India.

20,2019-08-06,Nestle,"At a time when the Nifty FMCG has declined 5% so far this calendar year, the Nestle India stock has risen nearly 8%In the backdrop of the consumption slowdown in the economy, Nestle India’s June quarter performance appears commendable

MUMBAI :
In the Indian consumer staples world, investors of Nestle India Ltd, the company popular for its Maggi noodles, are a happy lot. At a time when the Nifty FMCG has declined 5% so far this calendar year, the Nestle India stock has risen nearly 8%.
This is after taking into account the 4% gain in the share price since it announced its June quarter results. One reason for the optimism is that the company’s revenue growth in the June quarter was encouraging. Nestle India follows a January to December financial year and the June quarter was the second one for the company.
Domestic revenue, accounting for nearly 95% of total revenue, increased 13% over the same period last year to Rs2,835 crore. Putting it in perspective, domestic revenue had risen 10% in the March quarter. To be sure, in the backdrop of the consumption slowdown in the economy, Nestle India’s June quarter performance appears commendable. According to ICICI Securities Ltd, domestic volume growth was 11% compared with 9.3% during the March quarter and continues to be best in India consumer staples.
“This outperformance was as expected given its predominantly urban portfolio, which is the least impacted (as yet) from the ongoing consumption deceleration,"" pointed out the brokerage firm in a report on 4 August.
The company said growth was helped by a combination of volume & mix, positive influence of sales to canteen stores department (CSD) and sale of surplus fat. On the other hand, export revenue fell 14% year-on-year due to lower coffee exports to Turkey. Overall, it helped that contribution from exports was relatively much smaller.
Gross profit margin, however, contracted 132 basis points year-on-year to 58%, due to sharp increase in milk prices. This, in turn, weighed on net earnings. Net profit increased about 11% to Rs434 crore. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The company has pointed out that the environment continues to be challenging with headwinds in commodity prices and softer demand conditions. It will be interesting to watch whether these factors impact profitability, going ahead. In any case, the Nestle India stock trades at a high price-to-earnings valuation of nearly 60 times estimated calendar year 2019 earnings. As such, investors seem to have factored in a good portion of the brighter picture in he price, leaving little room for meaningful upside in the near term."

Investors will find Britannia Industries Ltd’s June quarter results unappetizing. True, consumer staples firms are facing a demand slowdown and, as such, expectations from the company were not running high. Still, Britannia’s Q1 performance is disappointing, with growth being much lower than peers. To add to that, the management’s commentary on demand outlook was discouraging.
“Britannia management all but ruled out a quick recovery in demand, with its commentary being sharply weaker than we have heard from other consumer packaged goods (CPG) managements,"" said analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities in a review report.
In a post-earnings conference call, the management said: “If the consumer is thinking twice before buying even a  ₹5 product, then obviously there is some serious issue in the economy."" In that backdrop, it’s hardly surprising that Britannia’s shares have fallen by 3% since it announced its Q1 results on 9 August.
Perhaps, the most disappointing aspect is the subdued domestic volume growth of 3%, a marked deterioration from the past few quarters. Consolidated revenue growth of about 6% appears discouraging, missing Street expectations.
“We are surprised by the growth divergence between Britannia (biscuits) and other players (categories). It is worth noting that (1) Nestle (F&B play akin to Britannia but much more urban centric) reported strong 12%+ growth driven by chocolates and noodles, and (2) Dabur (rural play) reported 10% volume growth despite rural weakness,"" said Kotak’s analysts.
On the profitability front, growth slowed further with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization declining by 69 basis points year-on-year to 14.6%. Even though revenue growth rates fell, some costs, such as employee and other operating expenses, rose as much as 11%.
Additionally, the consumption slowdown woes are likely to continue. Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said: “Britannia’s earnings trajectory is witnessing a sharp slowdown from the past given the low hanging fruits of market share gain in biscuits and overall cost savings are captured in the base."" In a report on 12 August, it added: “While we like attempts to build categories for future, they would remain margin and ROCE dilutive in short term. Consensus expectations and valuations remain rich relative to actual delivery."" ROCE is return on capital employed.
So far in FY20, Britannia’s shares have shed nearly 19% of their value, underperforming the Nifty 200 index. Still, with valuations at about 47 times estimated earnings for FY20, investors may not be tempted to bite the stock."

Chennai: The FMCG sector is unlikely to touch double-digit growth but will not have a degrowth as witnessed by some other sectors like automobile, Nestle India chairman & managing director Suresh Narayanan said.
He noted that there will be ""period of low growths"" for the FMCG industry but with ""decent single digit"", and the company would not be much impacted from the slowdown as its play in the rural areas is relatively less as compared to other players.
Rural markets contribute 20-25% of Nestle’s sales presently.
""As far as the economic climate and the FCMG trend are concerned, the numbers are speaking of a decline. Analysis of the data, not only the corporate results but if you also look overall Nielsen projected numbers, total FMCG growth is going southwards,"" said Narayanan in a media round table.
He added that unlike other sectors as automobile etc, FMCG would not have a degrowth as it deals with essential items and the average ticket size of sale is lower as compared to others.
""Yes, double digits will be hard to come by. You will not start seeing great encouraging results from the FMCG sector,"" he said.
But, the kind of issues faced by some other sectors may not get necessarily replicated in this sector because it still has a lot of fairly essential low payout, low budget items that are important for daily consumption, he added.
Growth in FMCG sector could be from modest double digit to decent single digit but not the kind some other sectors as automobile are witnessing, Narayanan said referring to the negative growth in some sectors.
He was however hopeful of FMGC sector getting back with double-digit growth in an year.
""As various people are talking about economic stimulus etc, monsoon looks like surfeit rather than a shortfall and hopefully it translates into a better agricultural situation. Automatically, there would be positive sentiments,"" he added.
Besides, Nestle, which is among the top three listed FMCG companies of India, was considering a ""selective price increase"" of some of its products as the commodity prices are increasing.
""At the moment commodities are growing northwards. Agri commodities like milk are strengthening , wheat and oil prices are growing..overall there will be a pressure on the overall pricing,"" said Narayanan.
He however ruled out an immediate price hike because the company is concentrating on volume growth.
""We do try and see how much we mitigate going forward. Since our core strategy is penetration-led volume growth we will try to keep the priceline.. if commodity prices goes up, then we may have to look at selective price increase,"" he said.

The FMCG growth rate for the first half of 2019 is around 12%, which is lower than the previous forecast of 13-14%, the report said.
In 2018, FMCG sector had a growth rate of 14%. The sector is estimated to have around  ₹4.2 trillion sales.

Mumbai: Shares of Colgate-Palmolive (India) Ltd traded flat on Tuesday on the National Stock Exchange, having risen 5% on Monday.
In an introductory meeting on Friday, a few analysts met the new managing director, Ram Raghavan, and came back fairly enthused.
“We like Raghavan’s plans to drive category growth (increasing usage in rural and not just driving penetration) and premiumisation agenda,"" said analysts from ICICI Securities Ltd in a report on 13 September.
Raghavan highlighted that growth was back on the agenda. Here, even as profitable growth is important, revenue growth will be the priority.
The competitive intensity remains high in the toothpaste category and Colgate has suffered due to this, losing market share over the last few years. Particularly, competition from Patanjali Ayurved Ltd’s products has hurt Colgate.
“We see him possibly doing a lot more in the naturals and premium spaces while simultaneously strengthening the core franchise,"" pointed out analysts from JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd in a report on 13 September.
The company is set to launch black-coloured toothpaste with bamboo charcoal, as part of its strategy to focus more on the naturals segment. It has, however, highlighted that the naturals and premium categories are not mutually exclusive.
While, a new management has instilled confidence, concerns remain.
“The danger we see is that of the Street extrapolating the Nestle experience here though one cognises that it takes quite a bit to change things on the ground. Nestle’s stock has doubled since Suresh Narayanan took charge even as earnings per share (ex-Maggi crisis impact) is up just 40-45% (trailing twelve months vs CY14),"" said JM Financial analysts.
At the same time, it’s not as if Colgate’s valuations are comforting. Currently, Colgate shares trade at around 41 times estimated earnings for this financial year, which is pricey. Going ahead, investors will allocate brownie points on improvement in market share."

A surprise corporate tax cut will lay groundwork for “second order benefits"" for India’s economy over the next several months or even years, while providing a favorable backdrop for broader stock selection, according to BNP Paribas Securities India Pvt.
The brokerage has re-balanced its “quality list"" of stocks again after having made adjustments a day before the Indian government reduced corporate tax rates on Sept. 20. This time around it added companies ranging from large-cap stocks such as Britannia Industries Ltd. to smaller names including Manappuram Finance Ltd., Abhiram Eleswarapu, head of equity research at BNP Paribas Securities, wrote in a note published on Sept. 24.
“The rally in stocks after the tax reduction has provided immediate money in the hands of investors,"" he said by phone. “It provides confidence that the government is willing to do whatever it takes and will provide equity investors a chance to broaden the basket of stocks.""
India’s surprise tax cut came after economic growth in the April-June quarter slumped to its lowest level in six years, hitting the nation’s smaller stocks the hardest. While the implied valuations of 10-15 Nifty stocks are still at a premium to historical averages, the medium and smallcap indexes are still below their means, according to the BNP report.
Since the tax cut, mid cap stocks have jumped 9% while small cap names gained 7%. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has climbed 8.3% in the last three sessions.
The gains show that the “first round impact"" of the tax cut on company earnings has been factored in, according to Eleswarapu.
Here are the key insights from the report
-Overweight India; retain Sensex target of 40,500 by December which is 3.6% above Tuesday’s close
-Tax cut to widen fiscal deficit by about 0.75% of GDP though it could be partly recovered through higher collections, divestment

5,2019-09-30,Nestle,"However, Suresh Narayanan says demand in short-medium term needs to be closely watchedNarayanan's commentary on overall demand comes amid a softening in growth for consumer goods makers who have been complaining of sluggish sales, especially in rural markets

Ludhiana: Nestle India Ltd., chairman and managing director Suresh Narayanan on Monday said that the ongoing festive season is expected to be good for consumer goods companies at large, but warned that the company is still keeping an eye on short-to-medium term consumption trends that have been a drag on sales of everything from cars to packaged food products. Addressing the media in Ludhiana on Monday, Narayanan said that overall demand sentiment is yet to improve but the recent round of corporate tax reductions will help boost earnings of corporates in India and stimulate investment cycle in the country.
“People are looking forward to the festive season. There is a bump that companies will get…for me, what needs to be watched is the short-to-medium term which is really the next six months,"" Narayanan said. “I have no reason to believe that the festive season will not be a good one but this alone will not be an answer to the longer-term secular issues of consumption that seems to be foremost in the minds of industry people,"" he added.
Narayanan's commentary on overall demand comes amid a softening in growth for consumer goods makers who have been complaining of sluggish sales, especially in rural markets. In fact, in July this year, market researcher Nielsen lowered its 2019 growth forecast for FMCG sector to 9-10% from its previous forecast of 11-12%, citing macroeconomic factors such as slowing growth and the impact of a deficient monsoon that it added had led to a sharp slowdown in rural demand.
Narayanan added that the FMCG sector has clearly seen strains and that ""the levels of growth have come down"". While the overall demand sentiment has not dramatically changed, the government’s recent move to slash corporate taxes will help stimulate capex and investment cycle in the country, he added.
In the last few months, the government has taken several measures to arrest the ongoing slump in demand, by taking measures directed at easing liquidity; late last month, the finance minister also announced a reduction in corporate tax rates in a boost to companies in India.
“The way corporate tax works is that it works below operating profits so this is really something that is likely to translate in terms of better earnings for companies and therefore for shareholders,"" he said hailing the move as a step in the right direction.
Nestle India is set to announce results for its third quarter on 8 November as India Inc goes into earnings season. The commentary from companies this earnings season could help gauge the impact of the current consumption slowdown in the market.
Commenting on this year's monsoons so far Narayanan said this year's surplus rains could bode well for rural incomes and help keep commodity prices in check. India has so far received above-average monsoon rains, a Reuters news report said on Monday allaying concerns around a deficit rainfall this year. This will likely help aid rural incomes and revive demand. ""This year looks like we are headed for a pretty torrential monsoon and if this translates into a better agriculture cycle--together with whatever tax steps have been taken, I would hope there is a relenting of the agro-commodities where we are seeing a lot of stress,"" he added.
This, he added, will help shore up demand over the next few months.
There could be investment and commodity-led stimulus for consumption and the earnings effect of the corporate taxes that could also have an impact on consumption.
""I certainly see some of the benefits of these three accruing to the consumer goods space.""
Nestle that sells breakfast cereals, packaged milk, and chocolates currently draws 25% of its sales from rural markets. Narayanan added that over the next two to three years the company hopes to draw 30-35% from India’s hinterland by expanding more rural specific price points and widening its distribution to reach more households.
For the quarter ended June 2019, Nestle India reported 10.83% per cent in net profit to  ₹437.84 crore. Net sales during the quarter were up 11.35% at  ₹2,982.83 crore. To be sure, Nestle India follows January-December as financial year.

ZURICH :
Nestlé SA plans to return as much as $20 billion to shareholders by 2022 and indicated an appetite for acquisitions to help chief executive officer (CEO) Mark Schneider sustain faster growth and better profit margins.
Flush with cash after the $10 billion sale of a dermatology unit earlier this month, the Swiss food giant said Thursday that it will start a new share buyback program in January and may complement it with special dividends over the next three years. It’s also reorganizing its stagnating bottled-water business, which may exit underperforming brands.
Schneider is wrapping up his third year at the head of the food giant, during which Nestlé’s market value has increased by almost $80 billion. The maker of Nescafe and KitKat bars has bought more than 20 companies under the CEO, the first outsider to gain the position in almost a century. He’s axing about 4,000 jobs involved in frozen-food delivery in the US and helped put the company on track for savings of 1.9 billion francs ($1.9 billion) this year.
Nestlé signalled it’s sharpening its M&A focus further as it unveiled a new management group that will seek out growth opportunities, to be led by Sanjay Bahadur, a 37-year corporate veteran who has been head of acquisitions for the past decade and finance director for greater China before that.
Nestlé said it would prefer to make investments to expand its main businesses, and it would scale down the buyback target if any sizeable acquisitions pop up.
Schneider said that guidance shouldn’t be interpreted as a signal that any big acquisitions will happen, and it’s just to clarify Nestlé’s strategy in case “something very large and extraordinary were to happen.""
“With acquisitions, it always takes two sides,"" Schneider said, speaking on a call with reporters. “It takes a willing buyer and a willing seller, and it all has to happen on terms that are prudent and meaningful for us, so we’ll need to see.""
Schneider gained a reputation as a dealmaker at his former employer, Fresenius SE, where he transformed the German company into Europe’s largest operator of private health clinics through more than 30 acquisitions.
The CEO is under pressure to sustain Nestlé’s growth momentum. Third-quarter sales growth decelerated slightly to 3.7% as pricing declined, especially in coffee. Nestlé said the softness in pricing is temporary, due to a tough comparison, and it expects improvement this quarter and into 2020.
Shares of Nestle fell as much as 2.3%, paring the gain this year to 28%.
Chief financial officer Francois-Xavier Roger has repeatedly said that Nestle would be comfortable letting its debt rating drop to a single A if an investment opportunity arises. Standard & Poor’s rates Nestle AA-, while Moody’s has it at Aa2. “I expect a bigger acquisition,"" said Alain Oberhuber, an analyst at MainFirst Bank. “The question mark is on timing."""

2,2019-11-11,Nestle,"Company was less affected by slump in demand, given its relatively higher exposure to affluent urban consumersA slower rate pace of growth in other expenses helped Ebitda performance

Nestlé India Ltd reported impressive domestic revenue growth of 10.5% year-on-year for the September quarter. Analysts estimate this came on the back of 9% volume growth, which is easily the best when compared to other consumer firms. For perspective, volume growth of Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd, Dabur India Ltd and ITC Ltd (cigarettes) stood at 5%, 7%, 4.8% and 3%, respectively.
Nestlé India is relatively less impacted by the current consumption slowdown, given its relatively higher exposure to affluent urban consumers, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients.
“Nestlé ’s stronger growth also indicates market share gains and a strong core portfolio. The aggressive pace of new innovations, success of new launches, and an improvement in demand environment could further accelerate its growth momentum,"" said analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.
Despite the good showing, the company’s shares fell 2.5% after the results were announced. What gives?
To start with, volume growth was more or less along expected lines and was, therefore, factored into the share price. Besides, while revenue growth did not disappoint, profit margins were weak. Gross profit margin declined by 214 basis points year-on-year to 57.3%.
“The quarter witnessed higher commodity prices, particularly in milk and its derivatives, which are likely to continue in the near-term,"" said Suresh Narayanan, chairman and managing director of Nestlé India, in a press release. Some of this was offset by a decrease in other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.
Analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd expect that the impact on margins from input cost inflation will be partially mitigated by the price hike in infant food products in 3Q CY19, cost efficiencies (like in 3Q) and a high base for 4Q CY18 (when the company had increased ad spends). Nestlé India follows a January-December fiscal year.
As pointed out earlier, the company’s impressive growth and much more is factored into its share price. The Nestlé India stock trades at around 60 times estimated earnings for calendar year 2020, after having risen more than 25% so far this year."

NEW DELHI :
Sales of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) on the internet are expected to touch $4 billion by 2022, contributing 5% to overall sales of packaged consumer goods sold in the country, market researcher Nielsen said on Wednesday.
Currently, e-commerce contributes 2% or $1.2 billion to the overall sales of FMCG.
Nielsen sees e-commerce’s contribution to sales growing on the back of growing smartphone penetration, increased data consumption, and efforts by large companies to make their products available online.
Interestingly, the contribution of modern trade to FMCG sales will reach 10% by 2022, growing incrementally from the current 9%, Nielsen noted comparing the two sales channels. During the same period the share of traditional trade is set to shrink to 85% from the current 89%.
The uptick in FMCG sales online has led the research firm to start tracking sales of such goods on the internet, as increasingly more companies such as Hindustan Unilever, Dabur India Ltd, Nestle India, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd., among others, have set up teams to sell their brands online.
“India’s FMCG industry is now making its presence felt in the e-comm channel - appealing to consumers’ need for convenience, and in sync with increasing smartphone and internet penetration,"" said Prasun Basu, South Asia Zone President, Nielsen Global Connect. “Nielsen India has launched a specific E-Trak index that will now measure FMCG consumer offtake in the e-comm space to give a complete picture of the changing marketplace"", he said. This will help manufacturers and marketers get data, information and insights that can be further used to hone their e-commerce channel sales strategy.
For now, Nielsen will track sales of 11 FMCG categories online in the top metros. These include refined oils , biscuits, packaged atta, vermicelli and noodles, spices, iodised salt, salty snacks, washing powder, packaged tea, toothpaste and utensil cleaners.
In its preliminary research on the market, Nielsen noted that online shoppers in the country’s top metros were showing higher instances of online shopping making 6% of all FMCG purchases through e-commerce. Amongst these, foods is the biggest contributor with 44%, followed by personal care (40%) and household care (13%).
In its September quarter earnings call, Mohit Malhotra, chief executive officer at New-Delhi based Dabur India Ltd said that e-commerce posted a growth of greater than 63%, taking its overall contribution to sales to 2.2% for the maker of Vatika hair oil and Real Juices. Earlier this year the company also rolled out a range of children’s hair care products only available online.
Last year, the local arm of Swiss packaged goods company Nestle India, launched its breakfast cereals online first. In fact, its popular Maggi brand was relaunched on Snapdeal in 2015 when the crisis-hit brand made a comeback.
However, Nielsen said that e-commerce is currently being used as an additional channel and not cannibalising other channels. “All channels continue to grow, buying behaviour differs across channels,"" the report added."
16,2019-12-12,Nestle,"Nestle has denied the benefit of tax reduction to customers in contravention of the provisions of Section 171 (1) of the CGST Act 2017Nestle has been asked to deposit the amount within 3 months

NEW DELHI :
The National Anti-Profiteering Authority (NAA) has ordered FMCG major Nestle to deposit  ₹73.15 crore with Consumer Welfare Fund for not passing GST rate reduction benefit to consumers.
Reacting to the order, Nestle India said it would consider appropriate action after studying the same.
The NAA, which has been set up to examine complaints of not passing benefits to consumer under the Goods and Services Tax (GST), rejected Nestle India's claims that it has passed on benefits of  ₹192 crore by reducing maximum retail price.
The authority said ""there is no evidence that the Respondent (Nestle) has reduced his prices commensurate with the tax deductions"" and has ""even increased the same in respect of a number of products"".
""The above amount of  ₹192 crore has also been wrongly calculated by the respondent by applying arbitrary methodology and hence the above claim made by the respondent is incorrect,"" the NAA said in its order.
The authority also dismissed Nestle's claims that it was not practical to pass on benefit at stock keeping unit (SKU) level, additional benefits were passed through other SKUs at the same category level.
Terming the claim as ""wholly illegal and unreasonable"", the NAA said, Nestle was bound to pass on the benefits to the buyer who had purchased or wanted to purchase a specific SKU and could not have passed the same to another buyer who had purchased a different SKU.
Based on facts, the NAA said, ""the profiteered amount is determined as  ₹89,73,16,384"".
Accordingly, the authority directed Nestle to reduce prices and deposit an amount of  ₹73,14,83,660, which has been arrived at after deducting  ₹16,58,32,723 that the company has already deposited with the Consumer Welfare fund (CWF) of the Central and concerned state governments as the recipients are not identifiable.
Reacting to the NAA order, Nestle India said in a regulatory filing that the information regarding passing of GST rate benefit together with substantiations has been provided to the authority.
""However, we are disappointed that the NAA has not accepted the methodology adopted by us to pass on the GST rate reduction benefit,"" it said.
The company further said, ""We are studying the order passed by the NAA and will consider appropriate action as advised"".
The FMCG major further said, ""In the absence of specific rules on profiteering for rate changes affective November 15, 2017 and January 25, 2018 impacting our products, Nestle India adopted the spirit of GST law by adopting a reasonable, pragmatic and market sustainable approach to pass commensurate GST rate reduction benefits"".
The benefits largely have been passed on by way of reduction of MRP or by way of increase in grammage.
In SKUs where it was not practical to pass on the benefits, such as in Nescafe single serve packs of  ₹2 or Maggi noodles Rs-5 packs, the benefit has been passed on other pack sizes within the same product category, it added.
""In some situations where the benefit could not be passed on instantly by reduction in MRP or increase in grammage, the amount was set aside to be subsequently passed on and was not reckoned wither in our sales or profits,"" Nestle India said. PTI RKL BAL"

14,2019-12-16,Nestle,"Some of the FMCG majors like Hindustan Unilever, Procter & Gamble India and Nestle were found to have profiteered from the lower tax regimeRestaurateurs came second, followed by entertainment and media firms

NEW DELHI :
Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms have topped the list of customers complaints list for over-charging ever since the new indirect tax regime Goods and Services Tax (GST) was rolled out on 1 July 2017.
Restaurateurs came second, followed by entertainment and media firms.
As per official data, as many as 42 consumer complaints were registered against various FMCG companies with many of them found to be not passing the benefits of lower tax rates.
As GST rates were cut across various categories in the GST Council meetings to reduce tax incidence on consumers, the companies were expected to pass on the benefit by lowering prices in proportion to the rate reduction.
It was, however, found that many companies had not passed on the benefit of lower tax and indulged in profiteering. Complaints were later filed against them and the GST anti-profiteering watchdog National Anti-profiteering Authority (NAA) took up the cases.
Some of the FMCG majors like Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), Procter & Gamble India (P&G) and Nestle were found to have profiteered from the lower tax regime.
In the latest case, the NAA last week ordered Nestle to deposit  ₹73.15 crore with Consumer Welfare Fund for not passing GST rate reduction benefit to consumers. The FMCG major has, however, said that it will consider appropriate action after studying the same.
Experts said that it is very difficult for FMCG companies to assess the exact impact of the lower tax given that they have multiple similar products in one category.
Moreover, they sell products for as low as  ₹2 for a shampoo pouch and when the rate is lowered they are not in the position to exactly assess the impact on price. Even if the assessment is done and it is found that the price should be lower by 30 paise, transaction becomes difficult as currency of that amount is not available.
""Because of multiple products of similar kind it is difficult for FMCG companies to arrive at a particular price. There are very small units like toffee selling for Re 1. In this case it will be very difficult to arrive at net impact of rate cut,"" said Amit Bhagat, Partner, Dhruva Advisors.
Besides FMCG, many restaurants are also facing complaints with 14 cases being lodged. Two complaints were filed against sanitary ware firms. Media and entertainment firms have six complaints against them."
13,2019-12-18,Nestle,"Last week, NAA said Nestle’s methodology of passing reduction in the tax was arbitraryOn December 12, the Maggi instant noodle maker was fined  ₹73.15 crore by the NAA for failing to pass on the benefits of GST to consumers.

Mumbai: Nestle's chairman and managing director Suresh Narayanan said it is a challenge to pass on the benefits of good and services tax (GST) to consumers on smaller sized packs priced around  ₹2 or  ₹5 as there is no practical methodology for such price points.
On December 12, the Maggi instant noodle maker was fined  ₹73.15 crore by the National Anti-Profiteering Authority (NAA) for failing to pass on the benefits of GST to consumers.
“There is no existing methodology and we told them (NAA) pragmatically what we can do in terms of price and grammage changes. But there are products which are priced at  ₹2 and  ₹5. For such products, the benefit is  ₹25 paise or  ₹50. We don’t have those different coins. How will I pass on these benefits even if I want. Therefore we gave (the benefits) at the overall product level because for the smaller packs, it is very difficult,"" Narayanan said on the sidelines of the CII’s National FMCG Summit ‘Growth Wapsi: Revving Up FMCG Growth’.
However, he said that the company respects the order and would examine its next course of action. Last week, NAA, which deals with customer complaints regarding not receiving tax cut benefit, said Nestle’s methodology of passing reduction in the tax was arbitrary. It had rejected the company’s claims that it has passed on benefits of  ₹192 crore by reducing maximum retail price.
""It is very unfortunate despite all the evidence provided to them (NAA) in terms of changes in grammage and prices, we have received this order. As a company we are very transparent, we went to the authority voluntarily saying that we have some part of the GST money that we are not able to pass on. So where should we deposit this money. That’s how the discussion started,"" Narayanan said.
Narayan also said the company has seen a steady performance in the last one despite the slowdown in the consumption across the country particularly in the rural areas. “As far as we are concerned we are fairly stable. If some of measures that the government is contemplating leads to more money in the hands of the consumers, and hopefully it should lead to improvement. I hope this happens sooner than later,"" he said.
While the company has not seen a major impact in its sales so far because of the rural slowdown, Narayan said it could get affected if market “goes more bad from here""."

11,2019-12-26,Nestle,"Maker of Nescafe and Munch chocolate adds ready-to-eat poha and upma to take on local home-grown consumer goods companies, diversify portfolioThe Indian arm of Swiss food and beverage firm launched the products earlier this month, with packs starting at  ₹20

Maggi, the flagship brand of the Indian arm of Swiss food and beverage company Nestlé, famed for its instant noodles, is going ethnic with ready-to-eat poha and upma.
The move is expected to help the maker of Nescafe Coffee and Munch chocolate compete with local home-grown consumer goods companies such as MTR Foods, iD Fresh Food and Gits.
Nestlé India launched the products earlier this month, with packs starting at  ₹20.
The launch is in line with the company’s efforts to diversify its portfolio, and keep apace with new launches. It has introduced 61 new products for the Indian market since 2016.
“With the advent of modern lifestyles and changes in consumer behaviour, Maggi has expanded its offering in the ready-to-eat segment in India with the launch of Maggi Ghee Tadka Upma Express, and Maggi Masala Onion Poha Express, providing convenience and taste to our consumers, especially millennials,"" said Nikhil Chand, director, foods and confectionery, Nestlé India.
The products have been launched in a phased manner. In the first phase it was launched in Delhi, Gurgaon, Mumbai, Pune, Indore, Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, Chand said.
The upma and poha will be sold under its popular Maggi brand that falls under its prepared dishes and cooking aids’ category.
The category also includes Maggi ketchup, a variety of spice mixes used to cook Indian dishes, apart from instant noodles and contributes about 29% to the company’s domestic business, according to an August 2019 investor presentation.
India’s ready-to-eat market is split between home-cooked meals and packaged preparations, but is largely fragmented. That’s because Indians typically prefer freshly cooked preparations, such as hot idlis, paranthas, eggs or poha, rather than relying on packaged foods. But growing urban consumers have prompted companies, such as PepsiCo and Marico, to launch packaged masala oats and instant upma mixes among other such items.
Consumers often seek authenticity in taste when it comes to packaged food options, said P.C. Musthafa, CEO, iD Fresh Food, which sells south-Indian staples such as idli and dosa batter. Consumers in India, he said, are unwilling to compromise on taste for convenience. “They are also more likely to pick formats and flavours familiar to them,"" he added, explaining the popularity of ethnic meals that have been launched over the past few years.
The entry will help Nestlé leverage and play in a largely unorganized breakfast market, said Abneesh Roy, senior vice president, institutional equities, Edelweiss Securities. “The brand recall of Maggi and Nestlé’s wide distribution are likely to work in its favour."" But taste will be a key determinant, as Marico is also testing this category via Saffola in Delhi, he added.
The company’s push to launch new products comes at a time when it has stepped up efforts to diversify its portfolio amid changing consumer preferences and its own experience with the ban on Maggi Noodles in 2015, which resulted in the product being shelved for a few months. The company has since been on an innovation drive, launching new variants of Maggi noodles, relaunching beverage brand Milo, and adding more upscale chocolates to its offerings."

Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) major Nestlé India Ltd’s investors are a happy lot. So far in 2019, the company’s shares have appreciated as much as 32%. In comparison, the Nifty 100 index has increased at 11%. Nestlé India’s relatively higher exposure to urban consumers has kept sentiments upbeat for the stock.

“The company has been able to sustain the growth momentum because inflationary factors have aided growth in baby foods, steady new launches under Maggi continue to aid growth and margin has expanded steadily led by better growth in premium offerings and cost operating leverage,"" pointed out a report from SBICAP Securities Ltd on 19 December.
But the stock’s meaningful outperformance vis-à-vis the broader markets also mean valuations capture a good share of the optimism. Currently, the stock trades at 61 times estimated earnings for 2020, based on Bloomberg data.
The company follows a January to December financial year. Though Nestlé India has been growing faster than some of its peers, growth rates are slower than what valuations suggest. For the nine months to September (9MCY19), revenue has increased by about 10% year-on-year (y-o-y) to  ₹9,164 crore. Within this, domestic revenue, which accounts for almost 95% of overall revenue, increased by 11%, while revenue from exports has declined. During the period, the company’s net profit increased 18% on the back of faster growth in other income and lower depreciation costs.
Going ahead, new launches should support revenue growth. Under the Maggi brand, the company has also introduced ready-to-eat poha and upma. “We don’t know yet how this will play out, but it is understandable that Nestlé would look at Indian cuisine for incremental growth,"" said Nitin Gupta, analyst, SBICAP. “While this is a difficult category, it helps here that Nestlé has a strong brand recall.""
In 9MCY19, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margins declined y-o-y, primarily owing to higher raw material costs. Analysts said, to boost volumes, the company has taken limited price hikes. “Focus on volume growth and new launches will limit scope for margin expansion, which will keep the earnings growth trajectory muted versus consensus expectation, in our view,"" wrote Varun Lohchab, equity analyst, Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd, in the September quarter results review report."
