Mumbai: India’s largest packaged consumer products firm by sales, Hindustan Unilever Ltd on Tuesday became the country’s eighth company to cross Rs3 trillion market capitalisation after its shares surged over 70% in the last one year. 
Mumbai: India’s largest packaged consumer products firm by sales, Hindustan Unilever Ltd on Tuesday became the country’s eighth company to cross Rs3 trillion market capitalisation after its shares surged over 70% in the last one year.
In intraday, the stock touched a fresh record high of Rs1,388.45 on the BSE, up 1.56% from its previous close with a market cap of Rs3.01 trillion. However, the stock pared some its gains and closed at Rs1,381.30 on BSE, up 1.04% from its previous close. The Sensex index fell 0.21%.
Earlier, seven companies have crossed this landmark—Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), HDFC Bank Ltd, ITC Ltd, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Housing Development Finance Co. Ltd and Oil & Natural Gas Corp. Ltd.
Currently, RIL is India’s most valued company with a market capitalisation of Rs5.85 trillion, followed by TCS and HDFC Bank at Rs5.46 trillion and Rs4.93 trillion, respectively.
“We believe HUL will be a key beneficiary of an uptick in consumption growth led by cyclical recovery and a pick-up in rural markets. Factors like a supportive base and normalisation of trade channel should also help,"" brokerage firm CLSA said in a 4 January report.
“Recent cuts in GST on daily use items like detergents and skincare benefit nearly half of HUL’s portfolio which should improve volume growth as well as drive premiumisation. There however may be some pain in 3QFY18 due to tax changes but the benefits should be visible thereafter,"" the report added.
CLSA has retained its outperform rating on the stock and increased its target price to Rs1,515 from Rs1,460 a share.
Of the 47 brokers tracking the HUL stock on Bloomberg, as many as 28 recommended a “buy"" rating, four asked its investors to “sell"" the stock and 15 have a “hold"" rating.
The company will announce its December quarter earnings on 17 January. According to 14 Bloomberg analysts’ estimates, the firm may post a net profit of Rs1,168.90 crore, while net sales will be at Rs8,419.70 crore.
According to a 9 January ICICI Securities report, it expects gross margin of the company to expand 60 basis points and expect earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margin to expand 110 bps year-on-year. Ebitda and net profit are expected to increase 18.4% year-on-year and 25.1%, respectively."
77,2018-01-17,Unilever,"Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), India's largest consumer packaged goods firm, will announce its results for the December 2017 quarter today

Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd, India’s largest consumer packaged goods firm, will announce its results for the December 2017 quarter on Wednesday. Markets are anticipating growth in HUL’s revenues and volumes, given that the company surpassed Rs3 trillion in market cap in Tuesday’s trading session.  
Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd, India’s largest consumer packaged goods firm, will announce its results for the December 2017 quarter on Wednesday. Markets are anticipating growth in HUL’s revenues and volumes, given that the company surpassed Rs3 trillion in market cap in Tuesday’s trading session. 
Urban versus rural growth
HUL’s results on Wednesday will demonstrate if consumer firms are seeing a recovery in demand, particularly in rural areas. Key numbers to look out for include HUL’s underlying volume growth (UVG) and the management’s comments on how rural markets have grown versus urban markets. With the Union budget coming up—the last before the 2019 general elections—these results will show whether calls for rural sops are justified, given how sluggish growth in rural incomes and demand has remained. 
Low base effect
Equities brokerage firms are expecting spectacular numbers from all FMCG firms because of this quarter’s base effect—demonetisation severely reduced all consumer firms’ revenues and bottomline in the December 2016 quarter. 
Crude prices
Meanwhile, rising prices in crude and crude-linked inputs (such as light liquid paraffin and other oils) has been flagged off as a concern for FMCG margins in several brokerage reports. While crude prices will affect everyone in the industry as it directly influences costs of packaging and transportation, markets will look for management commentary from HUL on how it plans to manage input cost pressure and where prices of the crude commodities basket will move in the future. 
Ayurvedic products 
Given the surge of demand for “natural"" and Ayurvedic products (largely led by Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali), markets will look for performance of HUL’s naturals brands and variants, particularly the newly launched Lever Ayush that is now available across the country. 
Premium products
Finally, markets will expect management commentary on how HUL’s focus on premiumization is paying off. A long-standing trend to help improve margins, premium products have seen maximum growth in India’s FMCG market as incomes rise across the country and companies prefer to focus on the segment as well. HUL’s home care segment has been heavily depending on growth in premium products like Surf Excel, a trend that is expected to continue."
78,2018-01-17,Unilever,"Hindustan Unilever says it remains fully committed towards ensuring that all benefits arising from GST rate cut are fully passed on to the consumers

New Delhi: Anti-profiteering investigator Directorate General of Safeguards (DGS) has a sent a notice to consumer goods maker Hindustan Unilever Ltd for alleged profiteering under the goods and service tax (GST) regime. 
New Delhi: Anti-profiteering investigator Directorate General of Safeguards (DGS) has a sent a notice to consumer goods maker Hindustan Unilever Ltd for alleged profiteering under the goods and service tax (GST) regime.
DGS has previously launched investigation into five other businesses for allegedly not passing on the benefit of tax reduction to consumers in the new indirect tax regime that kicked in from 1 July. 
An HUL spokesperson confirmed receiving the DGS notice and said the company was fully committed towards ensuring that all benefits arising from reduction in GST rates are fully passed on to the consumers. 
“We have received a notice on 16 January from DG safeguards and we are in the process of ascertaining the full details. We will respond to the same stating our position,"" said the spokesperson. 
HUL also said it has communicated to trade asking them to pass on the benefits to consumers. 
“We have accelerated our networks covering more than 800 stock-keeping units (SKUs) to reduce prices and increase grammage in case of price point packs and most of these have already landed in the market. List of key SKUs with lower prices and increased grammages is available on our website. In addition, HUL has also been communicating the price reductions or increased grammages through advertisements in more than 10 languages,"" said the spokesperson.
Concerns of profiteering is a worry for policy makers who are keen to see that the tax reform benefits the common man. However, officials admit that the legal provisions in GST laws dealing with profiteering are not foolproof as there is nothing that prevents producers from raising the price in a free market economy, claiming higher input costs. The drive against profiteering is set to test the robustness of the law. Experts argue that regulatory action against profiteering is more in the nature of price regulation than of taxation. 
“Unless the concerned commodity is one that is statutorily subject to price regulation by way of maximum price ceiling, it would not be possible to effectively use the current mechanism to ensure that benefit of reduced tax is passed on to the end customer,"" said Manoj S.R., a New Delhi-based lawyer. 
“Anti-profiteering is not a foolproof law. However, the actions of companies have to be benchmarked against reasonableness. Competition in the market will ensure to a great extent that the tax benefits are passed on to consumers,"" said a tax official, who asked not to be named. 
Hardcastle Restaurants Pvt. Ltd, which runs McDonald’s restaurants in west and south India, department store chain Lifestyle International Pvt. Ltd and a Jaipur-based trading company are among the firms issued notices under the anti-profiteering provision so far, Mint reported on 30 December.
If the Directorate General of Safeguards finds a business guilty of profiteering, the NAA can order it to reduce prices or return to the buyer an amount equal to the tax not passed on. A profiteering business will have to pay 18% interest on the tax reduction not passed on to consumers. It can also attract a penalty and could cost a business its registration."
76,2018-01-17,Unilever,"Hindustan Unilever revenue climbed 4.1% in December quarter as India's largest FMCG company widened the gap with competition including from Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Ayurved

Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd.’s revenue climbed 4.1% in the third quarter as India’s largest consumer-goods company widened the gap with competition including from yoga guru Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali Ayurved Ltd. 
Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd.’s revenue climbed 4.1% in the third quarter as India’s largest consumer-goods company widened the gap with competition including from yoga guru Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali Ayurved Ltd.
Revenue at the Indian unit of Unilever rose to Rs8,740 crore ($1.4 billion) in the three months through December, the Mumbai-based company said in a statement Wednesday. That exceeded the Rs8,430 crore average estimate of 14 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Net income increased to Rs1,330 crore, beating analyst estimates.
Ramdev on Tuesday predicted Patanjali will overtake Unilever in India next year. While Unilever has faced intense competition across its segments from detergents to skincreams from local companies building their brands using yoga and spiritual leaders and offering natural and ayurveda-based products, the latest quarterly results show the multinational will not easily sacrifice its lead.
Hindustan Unilever responded to the local competition by taking its Lever Ayush brand of ayurveda-based products, which includes soaps, toothpastes and skincare creams, national last year.
Patanjali, which on Tuesday said it’s partnering with e-commerce companies including Amazon.com Inc. and Flipkart Online Services Pvt to sell its products online, expects to double revenue to about Rs20,000 crore in the year ending 31 March, according to Bloomberg Quint. Hindustan Unilever is estimated by analysts to post a revenue of Rs36,100 crore in the same period.
Over the past few years, Patanjali has expanded its portfolio of products to include almost all the segments Hindustan Unilever operates in the country. Ramdev has said earlier he’s an “unpaid ambassador"" at Patanjali. Bloomberg"
75,2018-01-18,Unilever,"Hindustan Unilever is just a short burst away from overtaking ITC in the market, an indication of how its fortunes have changed for the better

With so much noise in Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s (HUL’s) results, it is better to step back and see the big picture. The company management says demand is recovering, but still maintains a cautious stance, saying give it a quarter or more before one can call it a trend. That may seem overcautious from an investor’s standpoint. The worst was behind us in the September quarter, and the December quarter results give no reason to turn sceptical. 
With so much noise in Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s (HUL’s) results, it is better to step back and see the big picture. The company management says demand is recovering, but still maintains a cautious stance, saying give it a quarter or more before one can call it a trend. That may seem overcautious from an investor’s standpoint. The worst was behind us in the September quarter, and the December quarter results give no reason to turn sceptical.
Now, HUL’s 11% volume growth indeed has a base-induced bump due to demonetisation in the year-ago quarter. Still, the September quarter volumes rose by 5% compared to a 1% decline a year ago. And the December quarter’s 11% growth is off a base of a 4% decline. While both are not comparable, it does appear as if growth has strengthened. It is natural to expect volume growth to settle down in subsequent quarters.
The 17% underlying domestic consumer business growth came despite price cuts after the government cut GST (goods and services tax) rates from 28% to 18% on several fast-moving consumer goods. HUL’s financials show that its input costs as a percentage of sales declined sequentially. Although crude oil-related input costs may have turned expensive, it does not seem to have affected the company yet. This could also be attributable to a better mix.
HUL’s confidence is visible in the step-up in advertising expenses, which rose as a percentage of sales sequentially. That and higher employee costs and other expenses contributed to a slight decline in its Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin sequentially, falling by 69 basis points to 19.6%. Since the year-ago quarter’s profit after tax but before exceptional items fell by 15.8%, the December 2017 quarter’s 52.2% growth should be seen in that light.
The company’s volume growth will settle down to more normal rates in the coming quarters, although mid-FY19 will again see some base effect-linked volatility due to GST. Even if HUL’s steady-state volume growth settles in the 5-7% range, that will take it back to levels it last saw in FY16. That is a good start. Overall, expectations are that FY19 will see the economy recover and the government will take steps to give a boost to the rural economy. That could lead to a recovery in rural consumption, which should benefit the likes of HUL.
The company’s shares have risen by a fifth over six months ago as investors have been expecting the recovery, visible in its results. HUL’s shares have also done much better than peer ITC Ltd, which has been weighed down by a high tax burden and an unfavourable policy environment. HUL is just a short burst away from overtaking ITC in the market, an indication of how its fortunes have changed for the better."
74,2018-01-19,Unilever,"Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) has earmarked Rs119 crore in Q3 to be paid to the Consumer Welfare Fund

Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s decision to set aside money to compensate consumers for excess tax charged by it has set a precedent for other companies.  
Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s decision to set aside money to compensate consumers for excess tax charged by it has set a precedent for other companies. 
India’s largest packaged consumer goods maker earmarked Rs119 crore in the December quarter to be paid to the government because it could not immediately lower prices after the goods and services tax (GST) on several products was reduced on 15 November.
The company has offered to release the money to the Consumer Welfare Fund, run by the department of consumer affairs. 
HUL received a notice for alleged profiteering this week, PTI reported on Tuesday. The government has set up an anti-profiteering authority to ensure that tax cuts are passed on to consumers and the benefits are not quietly pocketed by companies.
Other large companies are now considering making similar provisions as HUL because they were unable to cut prices immediately following the GST reductions, tax experts say. 
“What HUL made as a provision is more from an audit perspective to make sure they do not show this money as profit but as payment to be made to the government,"" said Anita Rastogi, partner at auditor PwC India. 
Under GST rules, the central government notified in June last year that any excess profit a manufacturer makes by charging a higher price should be credited to the Consumer Welfare Fund. But there is little clarity on how this transfer should happen and under what circumstances. 
“If money is collected (by a company as profit) without passing on the tax benefits, then it will go to the consumer, and if not possible, then the Consumer Welfare Fund,"" Sachin Menon, partner and head, indirect tax, at auditor KPMG, said in an interview. “However, guidelines governing this are yet to be issued.""
Hardcastle Restaurants Pvt. Ltd, which runs McDonald’s restaurants in west and south India, department store chain Lifestyle International Pvt. Ltd and a Jaipur-based trading company are among firms issued notices under the anti-profiteering provision so far, Mint reported on 30 December. 
“Actions were initiated immediately but it takes time,"" Srinivas Phatak, chief financial officer at HUL, said on Wednesday at a briefing on the company’s December quarter earnings. “There are always pipeline stocks. We advised modern trade retailers to pass on the rate reductions, and these were passed very quickly. Our distributors reached out to more than a million retailers, asking them to pass on the benefits."" 
HUL is now waiting for instructions from the government on what to do with the money it has set aside. 
Given the ambiguity in anti-profiteering definitions and rules, HUL said it decided to be proactive and voluntarily declared to the Central Board of Excise and Customs that it estimated Rs119 crore worth of benefits should have gone to its consumers. Other companies may do the same. 
“HUL has said that it was not able to pass on all benefits immediately, so other companies would have faced the same issue,"" Rastogi said.
Most large packaged consumer goods makers, and other companies as well “have started to hold board meetings to figure out how to deal with this situation before the DGS (Directorate General of Safeguards) issues them a notice"", she said. 
This could mark the beginning of a large influx of money in the Consumer Welfare Fund that was set up in 1992 to create consumer law chairs at universities, set up Grahak Suvidha Kendras, run projects for consumer awareness, and contribute to state governments’ consumer welfare funds.
According to the latest annual report of the department of consumer affairs, the government provisioned Rs15.50 crore for the fund in FY2016-17 and Rs6.01 crore had been used until 31 December 2016."

71,2018-03-14,Unilever,"Hindustan Unilever has offered another tranche of Rs36 crore of GST benefits for January to the government

New Delhi: FMCG major Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) on Wednesday said it has offered another tranche of Rs36 crore of goods and services tax (GST) benefits for January to the government, taking the total to Rs155 crore since the tax rates were revised on 15 November last year. 
New Delhi: FMCG major Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) on Wednesday said it has offered another tranche of Rs36 crore of goods and services tax (GST) benefits for January to the government, taking the total to Rs155 crore since the tax rates were revised on 15 November last year.
The company said while the revised GST rate was initiated immediately on 15 November, 2017, there was a lag on account of time required to change artworks on various products, order packing material, production and ensuring availability in stores. “Hence, it was not possible to immediately pass on the benefit of the November 15 GST rate reductions to the end consumers,"" HUL said in a statement.
To address the issue, company representatives had met government officials in December last year during which HUL had offered to deposit the GST benefits on a monthly basis with the government until transition is completed or until it is informed by the government of an alternative action. 
Out of Rs36 crore for January, a significant portion include benefits accrued on stocks, which were lying with HUL’s distributors during the time of transition on 15th November 2017, the company added. 
“With this third tranche, the total combined (HUL plus distributors) GST benefits offered by the company on its own accord to the government, amounts to Rs155 crore,"" it said. 
HUL further said the benefits accruing directly to it which needs to be passed on to consumers, have come down significantly from that in November and December as most of the company’s revised pricing networks have now landed in the market. 
For the 15-30 November, 2017 period, HUL said the estimated amount was Rs60 crore and it had offered to deposit the amount into the consumer welfare fund. 
“In the absence of clear legal provisions on this subject, the request was forwarded to the Director General of Safeguards. The company is awaiting advice from them so that it can deposit the cheques at the earliest,"" it added."

Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) said on Thursday that non-executive chairman Harish Manwani will retire after the company’s forthcoming annual general meeting .  
Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) said on Thursday that non-executive chairman Harish Manwani will retire after the company’s forthcoming annual general meeting . 
Sanjiv Mehta, who is currently chief executive officer and managing director of the company, will take over as interim chairman in addition to his existing roles.
Manwani is the India unit’s longest-serving non-executive chairman, having been in the position since 2005. During his tenure as chairman, Manwani oversaw a period of sustained growth, with the business nearly tripling in size, and HUL reinforcing itself as one of India’s most admired firms, the company said in a note.
Manwani joined HUL as a management trainee in 1976 and joined the HUL board in 1995 as a director responsible for the personal products business. In 2005, he was appointed to the Unilever executive committee as president-Asia, Africa, Middle East, and the role later expanded to include central and eastern Europe. From 2011 to 2014, he was chief operating officer of Unilever. 
One of the most successful leaders of HUL, Manwani strongly believes that the challenges businesses face today can only be addressed through the “4G sustainable growth model"" of competitive, consistent, profitable and above all, responsible growth. This model has been central to the company’s business strategy in India.
“Harish leaves behind a legacy that few will be able to match. He has lived the values that make HUL such a great company. Through his passion, commitment and endless energy, he leaves a lasting impact on the business. I will personally miss his leadership and wise counsel,"" said Mehta in a statement.
Mehta’s appointment will be an interim arrangement until the company identifies a new chairman. Last month, market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India had accepted most of the recommendations made by the Kotak Committee to improve governance standards in listed Indian firms. This includes separating the post of chairman and managing director. The HUL board will ensure compliance with the new regulation of separation of the two positions by April 2020."
69,2018-04-13,Unilever,"Hindustan Unilever has asked the Bombay HC to  restrain former employees Suyash Chauhan, Hemal Jain and Kishor Patil from using the data relating to manufacturing of its products

Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) has dragged three of its former employees to the Bombay high court for allegedly stealing data related to manufacturing of its products and other confidential information. 
Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) has dragged three of its former employees to the Bombay high court for allegedly stealing data related to manufacturing of its products and other confidential information.
India’s largest packaged consumer goods firm has asked the court to restrain the three former employees—Suyash Chauhan, a former managing director of Unilever Nepal Ltd; Hemal Jain, a former head of customer development at HUL’s center of excellence and Kishor Patil, a former sales and customer manager—from using the data.
On 27 March, the court allowed HUL to engage EY to carry out an audit to investigate the data theft and directed the consulting firm to submit its report to the court within two weeks. It also gave the respondents in the case three weeks to file their reply and restrained them from using or sharing the confidential data. The court will next hear the matter on 17 April.
“I find from the record that not only have defendant Nos 2 (Jain) and 3 (Patil) obtained bill of material and other confidential information, but have also disclosed and shared the same with Defendant No 1 (Chauhan) at a time when Defendant No 1 was no longer in employment with the Plaintiff and had no right or entitlement to access such information,"" observed Justice S.J. Kathawala in the 27 March order. He further said that any usage of or sharing the confidential information is bound to cause irreparable injury to the company. 
 Typically, bills of material contain critical data such as recipes, ingredients, quantity and other materials used to manufacture products.
HUL, which was represented in the court by Raj Panchmatia, a partner at the law firm Khaitan & Co., and senior counsel Birendra Saraf, argued that the stolen information was available to only select personnel of the company on a need- to-know basis. Panchmatia declined comment.
The maker of products such as Surf Excel detergent powder and Dove soap has alleged that Chauhan and Jain have incorporated two companies—Destiny Endeavours Pvt. Ltd and D. Endeavours Fulfillment Pvt. Ltd—to serve brands through a wide and extensive wholesale and retail coverage.
On 27 March, the court also directed the respondents to disclose all the details of confidential and proprietary information they may have in their possession, either in physical or electronic form. It asked the court receiver to take possession of all confidential documents, personal laptops/external hard disks and other devices where such information could be stored.
A HUL spokesperson confirmed these developments and said that the company has sacked two of these employees for breaching policies on information security.
“During the company’s internal investigation, these employees were found to be sharing the company’s confidential information with another ex-employee, who is also a party to the suit,"" the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
An emailed query to Destiny Endeavours did not elicit any response. Senior counsel Kevic Setalvad, who is representing the defendants, said the investigation report by EY has not come and declined to discuss anything else.
On Thursday, shares of Hindustan Unilever Ltd rose 0.33%, or Rs4.65, to Rs1,413.55 on the BSE. Benchmark Sensex ended the day 0.47%, or 160.69 points, higher at 34,101.13."
67,2018-05-15,Unilever,"Hindustan Unilever reported a net profit of Rs1,351 crore in Q4FY18 against Rs1,183 crore a year ago

Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), India’s largest consumer packaged goods company by sales, on Monday beat analyst expectations to post a 14.2% rise in March quarter net profit. HUL reported a net profit of Rs1,351 crore in the January-March quarter, against Rs1,183 crore a year ago. 
Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), India’s largest consumer packaged goods company by sales, on Monday beat analyst expectations to post a 14.2% rise in March quarter net profit. HUL reported a net profit of Rs1,351 crore in the January-March quarter, against Rs1,183 crore a year ago.
The maker of Knorr soups and Dove soaps attributed the performance to trade conditions that have normalised after the debut of goods and service tax (GST) and higher consumption. This is in contrast to the overall declining consumer confidence in the March quarter. Sales at Rs9,003 crore were up 2.5% from Rs8,773 crore a year ago. However, comparable domestic consumer sales grew by 16%, the company said in a press statement. 
Comparable sales number includes excise duty, other net input taxes from reported sales of March 2017 and GST refunds to the sales of March 2018 quarter. A Bloomberg poll of 21 analysts had estimated the India unit of Anglo-Dutch consumer goods maker Unilever Plc to post a fourth quarter profit at Rs1,333 crore and revenues at Rs8,898.40 crore.
Sales growth was driven by underlying volume growth of 11%, the company said. 
In the year-ago quarter as well, volume growth was 11%, but then the base for the company in the earlier December quarter had contracted by 4% due to demonetization. 
Meanwhile, the RBI’s Consumer Confidence Index fell in March quarter to 95.1 points after showing some improvement in the December 2017 round where it stood at 96.9 points. 
“Trade conditions have normalized and pipelines have now stabilised. We are also seeing a gradual improvement in demand,"" said Srinivas Phatak, chief financial officer and executive director of finance and information technology at a press conference in Mumbai.
Volume growth was broad-based and also led by rural, which is again growing ahead of urban in many parts of the country, said Sanjiv Mehta, managing director and CEO, HUL. Mehta, however, was reluctant to call it a trend and said the company would wait for a couple more quarters to see whether it’s sustainable.
Rural has grown ahead of urban even for peers like Dabur India Ltd and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) which announced their earnings earlier this month. For Dabur, rural demand growth at 9% outpaced urban growth at about 7%. At GCPL, rural grew at 7-8% compared to its overall domestic volume growth of 6%.
Consumer companies are optimistic of seeing consumption recovery with volume growth in double digits in 2019, a phenomenon last witnessed in fiscal 2012. Both GCPL and Dabur expect about 10-12% volume growth in fiscal 2019 from the previous year.
The quarter saw HUL step up on its advertising and promotions, spending 25% more than what it did in the year-ago quarter. “Despite a step-up in competitive intensity, we have delivered another strong performance for the quarter and the year. Growth and improvement in profitability have been sustained through a combination of winning innovations and a relentless focus on operational efficiencies,"" said chairman Harish Manwani, who is due to retire this year.
In the March quarter, comparable growth was driven by the home care portfolio which includes its detergents business and accounts for close to a third of its overall revenues growing 21% and personal care portfolio which accounts for nearly half of its overall revenues (13%). Its foods and beverages segments grew by 10% and 14% each respectively. 
The fast-moving consumer goods sector and Hindustan Unilever already command a price-to-earnings multiple of 53.06 and 63.18 times trailing 12-month earnings each respectively, compared to the broad market’s 24.32 times.
On Monday, shares of Hindustan Unilever fell 0.09% to Rs1,504.95 on BSE while the benchmark closed flat at 35,556.71 points. HUL results were announced after market hours."

After clocking a double-digit 11% volume growth in the December quarter, the Street was expecting Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s (HUL) volume growth for the March quarter to tone down to around 7%. After all, the base in the third quarter was low with a 4% de-growth in the year-ago period, while volumes had grown 4% in the year-ago March quarter. 
After clocking a double-digit 11% volume growth in the December quarter, the Street was expecting Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s (HUL) volume growth for the March quarter to tone down to around 7%. After all, the base in the third quarter was low with a 4% de-growth in the year-ago period, while volumes had grown 4% in the year-ago March quarter.
But despite the higher base effect, the company reported an 11% growth in volumes again.
“Hindustan Unilever is clearly executing at a much higher level than peers. We believe this is partly because it was perhaps the best prepared for GST (goods and service tax) and hence has made the most of this tailwind for the organized sector players,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients. GST is short for the goods and services tax.
Besides, its advertising expenses increased by a fourth for the March quarter, suggesting HUL’s confidence in the operating environment.
The home care segment performed well, which helped the company’s overall profit growth as well. The segment recorded double-digit volume growth and a robust 31% growth in its earnings before interest and tax (Ebit). Ebit of the personal care segment increased at a much slower pace of 8%.
Overall, HUL’s Ebitda increased at a healthy 24% year-on-year to Rs2,048 crore, while Ebitda margin rose a smart 240 basis points to 22.5%. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
So far, so good. But the key thing to figure out is whether HUL’s results indicate that underlying demand has improved. A look at the results of other fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms suggests that is not the case. According to Kotak, volume growth trends reported by sector peers for the March quarter have been mixed.
Of course, even though HUL has done better than most peers, its valuations too are stretched. Most FMCG stocks have outperformed the benchmark Sensex in the past one year and the company’s shares are no exception to that trend.
The HUL stock trades at a pricey valuation of almost 60 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year, based on Bloomberg data. But it is at least growing earnings at a decent pace, and the March quarter results could well offer some support to valuations from a near-term perspective.
What’s more, the good run on the volume front may continue. After all, the June 2017 quarter volume growth was flat. Trade sentiment remained cautious, particularly in the run-up to the GST implementation, the company had said last year at the time of announcing June-quarter results.
With the base favourable for the current quarter, investors will now follow the extent of outperformance that HUL can deliver. However, crude oil prices have risen and input costs will start pinching more. That may take some sheen away from earnings in the coming quarters."
65,2018-05-17,Unilever,"Hindustan Unilever has caught up with ITC dramatically in the past year: a year ago, ITC's market cap was 60% ahead, the gap has shrunk to merely 2.4%

Cigarette-to-soap maker ITC Ltd’s shares rose 1.5% on Wednesday, even though its March quarter net profit just about met Street expectations. Worse, revenues were 11% lower than Bloomberg consensus estimates. It’s not that there were any hidden gems in the company’s results; rather, there is a fancy for consumer sector stocks in the markets currently. 
Cigarette-to-soap maker ITC Ltd’s shares rose 1.5% on Wednesday, even though its March quarter net profit just about met Street expectations. Worse, revenues were 11% lower than Bloomberg consensus estimates. It’s not that there were any hidden gems in the company’s results; rather, there is a fancy for consumer sector stocks in the markets currently.
In fact, ITC is only enjoying a rub-off effect; other consumer goods stocks are doing far better. Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), ITC’s nemesis in the market cap tables, has caught up dramatically in the past year, as the chart above shows. A year ago, ITC’s market cap was 60% ahead; the gap has shrunk to merely 2.4%.
There have been earlier occasions in 2018 when the gap has narrowed, though not to this extent. HUL is on the verge of overtaking ITC at this point, for the first time after it ceded the pole position back in 2005.
The divergence in the performance of the two stocks is sort of reflective of differing fortunes in terms of volume growth. HUL’s growth of 11% was far ahead of estimates, while ITC’s growth, or the lack of it, remains a concern. ITC does not provide volume details but Dolat Capital Market Pvt. Ltd estimates a 2-4% decline in cigarette volumes during the March quarter. From an investor’s perspective, this amounts to small mercy, as it compares favourably with a 5% estimated decline in volumes in the December quarter.
ITC has said that volume growth is getting affected by the large pictorial warnings. And while the worst of harsh taxes may be behind it, policy-related concerns may continue to weigh on growth.
The silver lining is that in ITC’s case, while its revenues may have been lower than expected, there are signs of improvement in its business segments, leading to better profitability sequentially in most of its divisions.
The cigarettes business, which accounted for as much as 87% of ITC’s total segment Ebit, saw a 7% improvement as against the December quarter. Ebit is earnings before interest and tax.
ITC’s consumer goods business did well with comparable sales growth of 11.3% over a year ago, but it was lower than HUL’s 16% growth. Although this segment’s Ebit growth was impressive, this could change once ITC begins to invest heavily in growing the business, which is its main priority. Still, analysts say that ITC’s consumer goods business Ebit of nearly 3% is rather encouraging.
On a sequential basis, its margins were down slightly but this was chiefly due to a decline in the agricultural exports segment margins."
64,2018-05-17,Unilever,"At the close of the Sensex, HUL mcap stood at Rs339668.68 crore while ITC's mcap was at Rs340449.83 crore

Mumbai: After 13 years, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) on Thursday reclaimed, albeit for some time, the spot of India’s most-valued consumer packaged goods maker, edging past ITC Ltd which has held that position all this while. 
Mumbai: After 13 years, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) on Thursday reclaimed, albeit for some time, the spot of India’s most-valued consumer packaged goods maker, edging past ITC Ltd which has held that position all this while.
Shares of HUL, India’s largest consumer-goods company by sales, rose after the company reported better-than expected volume growth for the March quarter (Q4). In intraday HUL surpassed ITC mcap. However on closing basis HUL erased gains following fall in the local equity markets. In intraday HUL mcap was at Rs343164.39 crore while ITC mcap stood at Rs342452 crore. However, at closing basis HUL mcap stood at Rs339668.68 crore while ITC’s mcap closed at Rs340449.83 crore.
ITC has held the position of India’s biggest FMCG company by market cap since February 2005.
HUL reported a net profit of Rs1,351 crore in the January-March quarter, against Rs1,183 crore a year ago. Sales at Rs9,003 crore were up 2.5% from Rs8,773 crore a year ago. A Bloomberg poll of 21 analysts had estimated the company to post a fourth quarter profit at Rs1,333 crore and revenues at Rs8,898.40 crore.
The company attributed the performance to trade conditions that have normalised after the debut of goods and service tax (GST) and higher consumption.
Sales growth was driven by underlying volume growth of 11%. In the year-ago quarter as well, volume growth was 11%, but then the base for the company in the earlier December quarter had contracted by 4% due to demonetisation.
“The volume growth has surpassed all expectations with mature categories like home delivering very strong double digit volume growth. While the sustenance of such high volume growth seems challenging but considering low base for the next two quarters HUL volume growth trajectory will continue to be very strong,"" said PhillipCapital in a note to its investors.
“We have upgraded our estimates for FY19/FY20 on improving volume growth prospects. Because of its robust distribution model and wide product portfolio, HUVR is best-placed to harness growth arising from the informal sector becoming formal. With strong volume and value growth, it will trade at premium valuations"", the report added. The brokerage firm has maintained a buy rating on the stock and increased its target price to Rs1,670 from Rs1,585 a share.
ITC on Wednesday said its net profit in the March quarter rose 9.86% from a year ago to Rs2,932.71 crore as margins expanded. Gross revenue from sales rose only 3.56% to Rs17,933.48 crore, which the company attributed to subdued demand and disruptions in supply chain.
The cigarette segment contributed Rs3,505.76 crore of pre-tax profit compared with Rs3,258.76 crore, up 7.57% year-on-year. According to Edelweiss, cigarette sales by volume were down 1-2% y-o-y in the March quarter. In the December quarter too, cigarette sales by volume had contracted by an estimated 5%
“ITC’s core cigarette segment continues to witness pressures on volume growth following the price hikes taken by the company (to offset GST-related hikes). The company continues to be largely dependent on cigarettes for its profits; thus growth will remain muted until volumes revive. Other segments of the company are yet to show traction that may aid the company beat estimates. As such, our expectations from the company in terms of profit growth remains contained,"" said Kotak Securities in a note to its investors."
63,2018-06-20,Unilever,"On Monday, HUL and the defendantsSuyash Chauhan, Hemal Jain and Kishor Patil jointly filed consent terms in the court to end the dispute

Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) has settled a dispute with three former executives it sued in March on charges of stealing critical data relating to recipe, ingredients and manufacture of several products. 
Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) has settled a dispute with three former executives it sued in March on charges of stealing critical data relating to recipe, ingredients and manufacture of several products.
On Monday, HUL and the defendants—Suyash Chauhan, a former managing director of Unilever Nepal Ltd; Hemal Jain, a former head of customer development at HUL’s centre of excellence; and Kishor Patil, a former sales and customer manager—jointly filed consent terms in the court to end the dispute.
“Both the parties have filed the consent terms,"" said justice S.J. Kathawala in his oral order, adding, “Data in the devices of the respondents that were collected by the court receiver will be deleted in the office of EY in the presence of all the parties. The process needs to be completed on or before 25 June,"" HUL had hired EY to investigate the issue.
“The ex-employees approached the company for an out-of-court settlement. The company agreed to settle the matter,"" said an HUL spokesperson in an email response to a Mint query. “Accordingly, consent terms were entered into and filed with the hon’ble high court. The terms of the settlement are confidential and we cannot comment on the same,"" he further added.
An emailed query to Destiny Endeavours, a company started by Chauhan and Jain, did not elicit any response. When contacted, Srishti Ojha, founder of boutique law firm Verist Law, who is advising Jain and Chauhan in the dispute, confirmed the out-of-court settlement.
The maker of Lipton Tea and Surf Excel had filed the case on 23 March in the Bombay high court for allegedly stealing data related to manufacturing of its products and other confidential information. 
Mint first reported the dispute on 13 April.
HUL said the former executives were in possession of so-called bill of material containing critical and confidential HUL data such as recipe, ingredient, quantity and other materials used to manufacture its products. 
This was proprietary information not available in the public domain, the company claimed. 
On 27 March, the court had allowed HUL to engage EY and directed it to submit its report within two weeks. It also gave the respondents three weeks to file their replies and restrained them from using or sharing the confidential data."

Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) has increased its firepower against copycats more than ever before, and smaller players are feeling the heat, be it small businesses in Assam, Gujarat, Jodhpur in Rajasthan or Jalpaiguri in West Bengal. 
Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) has increased its firepower against copycats more than ever before, and smaller players are feeling the heat, be it small businesses in Assam, Gujarat, Jodhpur in Rajasthan or Jalpaiguri in West Bengal.
India’s largest packaged consumer goods company is suing smaller consumer goods makers more aggressively to prevent them from using identical trademarks, logos or even description to save its brands. 
The company has filed about 30 cases, almost one case every week since the beginning of the year, to restrain the copycats from manufacturing and marketing identically packaged products.
“We are aggressive in protecting our intellectual property rights (IPR) and take prompt action whenever our rights are violated by third parties,"" said an HUL spokesperson. “Whenever we become aware of any infringing activity, we promptly take appropriate action.""
In May, the local subsidiary, Unilever PLC, approached the Bombay high court against HMT Detergents, a company based out of Himatnagar, a small town about 88km from Ahmedabad. 
The Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company alleged that the soap and detergent powder maker was infringing its mark, “Wheel"", by using an identical layout, placement of features and artwork for its brand “Toofan"".
On 31 May, HMT Detergents sought an out-of-court settlement and agreed to stop marketing its washing powder and bar under the identical packaging.
Likewise, Indore-based Parmeshwari Ice Cream Pvt. Ltd was taken to court for its alleged infringement of HUL’s “Cornetto"" ice cream brand. 
The local ice cream maker, which sold its frozen desserts under the similar “Corretto"" brand, subsequently lost the case on May 22 and paid damages of  ₹ 3 lakh. 
When contacted, Zahur Hasanji, owner of HMT Detergent, said HUL was too big for it to fight the case and, hence, the company decided to settle the dispute. An email query to Parmeshwari Ice Cream did not elicit any response till press time. 
HUL has been relying on multiple sources, including consumers, stockists and third-party investigators, to find out about companies looking to cash in on its brands. 
“We haven’t seen a company of HUL’s size being so aggressive with smaller companies. Now, it is not only taking legal action against small companies, but is also going behind third-party manufacturers, who may have supplied bottles or other packaging material. This is very surprising,"" said Vishal Maheshwari, managing partner of law firm VM Legal, who has represented a few companies on such disputes.
According to Maheshwari, in many cases, HUL has accepted out-of-court settlements, but the message has been loud and clear—do not repeat such violations. In most cases, it has also sought damages of  ₹ 2-10 lakh. 
According to Hindustan Unilever, the thought behind the recent moves is that the infringers should not go unpunished. “It is often found that despite an injunction, after some years a counterfeiter reverts to illegal practices. Imposition of financial obligation acts as an additional deterrent,"" said an Hindustan Unileverspokesperson in an emailed response. 
The aggressive move is not only to protect its brands, but also to protect its faltering market share across various categories. 
Between 2012 and 2017, eight of India’s top 12 brands have ceded 40 basis points to two percentage points in market share, either in volume or value, Mint had earlier reported, citing researcher Euromonitor. 
The report says two HUL brands, Brooke Bond and Surf, were among the top brands, which had witnessed a decline. 
“Major companies such as HUL are facing the heat not only from smaller and regional brands, but also from the sudden rise of Patanjali,"" said Alpana Parida, managing director at brand strategist DY Works.
 “They have similar formulations, equally good packaging and a better final-mile distribution network. This has also contributed in the aggression to protect their turf and suing companies for any infringement of IPR. Consumers are not as brand-loyal as they used to be and smaller companies that are more nimble-footed are eroding the market share in many categories for MNCs,"" Parida added."
61,2018-07-16,Unilever,"Hindustan Unilever'srevenue increased 16%,driven by an underlying volume growth of 12%

Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), India’s largest listed consumer packaged goods company, said that it continues to see a gradual improvement in demand as consumers bought more of its products. 
Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), India’s largest listed consumer packaged goods company, said that it continues to see a gradual improvement in demand as consumers bought more of its products.
Net profit grew 19% to  ₹ 1,529 crore in the three months ended 30 June from  ₹ 1,283 crore a year ago. 
Adjusted for the goods and services tax (implemented from 1 July 2017), revenue rose 16%, the company said in a press statement, without giving details. The revenue growth was driven by an underlying volume growth of 12%, it said.
A Bloomberg poll of 15 analysts had estimated profit at  ₹ 1,540.3 crore and revenue at  ₹ 9,669.1 crore.
“HUL Q1FY19 performance was in-line with the expectation with 22% growth in the bottom-line. The highlight of the quarter was sustenance double digit volume growth at 12% in the domestic business,"" said Kaustubh Pawaskar, an analyst at brokerage Sharekhan.
The India unit of Anglo-Dutch consumer goods maker Unilever Plc reported volume growth ahead of the market. “If we look at the last 12 weeks, then volume for overall market are in the vicinity of 5-5.5% and Nielsen reported growth is 6-6.5%. We believe it has bottomed out but the question is when will it be back to the full potential that exists in our country,"" said chairman and managing director Sanjiv Mehta while addressing the press at its Mumbai headquarters.
Even as the market saw crude prices firming by 35% over the preceding quarter and experienced currency-led inflation, it managed to widen margins. HUL’s operating profit margin expanded 100 basis points (bps) to 21% in the quarter from a year earlier. The improvement was on account of lower cost of goods sold, judicious pricing and savings and refunds from goods and services tax and excise duties. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. “Crude volatility and currency-led inflation are key risks going ahead and we will continue to manage our business dynamically while driving operational efficiencies,"" said Mehta.
To be sure, the macroeconomic environment is worsening. Retail inflation is at a five-month high in June at 5% against 4.87% in the preceding month. The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) Consumer Confidence Index in May was at the same level as March showing no improvement. This is worse than what it was in December.
All the same, rural continued to grow ahead of urban for the second quarter in a row, Mehta said.
In the June quarter, growth was driven by its homecare portfolio which grew 20% on a comparable basis. The personal care and beauty portfolio and food and refreshment segments grew 14% on a comparable basis. The growth was driven by brands like Fair & Lovely, Pond’s, Dove, Pears, Kissan and Knorr.
During the June quarter, the company increased its advertising and promotion spends by 27.4%, spending more on new launches as well as supporting its large brands.
The company has extended Lever Ayush brand into packaged foods with the launch of millet-based upma, khichdi and pongal in Tamil Nadu. HUL has also extended its Brylcream brand into men’s grooming products for beards and moustache in an exclusive partnership with Amazon. The range is available online only.
Meanwhile investors in anticipation of good numbers drove the stock price up 0.73% to close at  ₹ 1,753.85 whereas the broader BSE Sensex shed 0.60% at 36,323.77 points. The bellwether for India’s consumer economy announced its earnings after market hours."

New Delhi: In the perfection-obsessed world of beauty marketing, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL)-owned skin care brand Dove said it will not digitally enhance images of models in its advertisements in India. The global practice being introduced in India is in line with the brand’s “Real Beauty"" positioning launched in 2004 when it started featuring real women in its ads. 
New Delhi: In the perfection-obsessed world of beauty marketing, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL)-owned skin care brand Dove said it will not digitally enhance images of models in its advertisements in India. The global practice being introduced in India is in line with the brand’s “Real Beauty"" positioning launched in 2004 when it started featuring real women in its ads.
Noting that beauty is a source of confidence and not anxiety, the company said it has rolled out ‘No Digital Distortion Mark’ under which it is committed to showing real women without airbrushing their images in all its ads across print, outdoor, in-store, digital and social media platforms. Genuine pictures will be used in Dove’s ads for deodorant, soaps, shampoo and conditioners. 
All branded content of Dove will show the ‘No Digital Distortion Mark’ beginning with the brand’s deodorant campaigns and by January 2019, it will be incorporated into all static imagery which will clearly state that the image is not distorted.
“It’s a proactive measure from Dove to ensure that women and young girls should not feel the pressure to look a certain way and fit into a pre-defined notion of beauty,"" said Sandeep Kohli, executive director-personal care, HUL.
According to ‘Dove Girls Beauty and Confidence Report (2017)’, 76% of Indian women believe it is critical to meet certain beauty standards and 71% cited increasing pressures from advertising and media to reach an unrealistic standard of beauty as a key force in driving appearance anxiety. Dove has been running a self-esteem project since 2004 and it said that in India, it works with the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts to build self esteem in thousands of young girls.
HUL’s Kohli believes brands with purpose have served their company well, translating into sales and growth. 
“Dove, both globally and in India, is a faster growing brand in our portfolio. For us, being purposeful is one of the key drivers of this growth,"" he added.
Globally, brands like online retailer Modcloth have taken a pledge not to digitally modify models’ photos, while US-based department store Target has run non-edited ads of women swimwear for all body types. Aeropostale’s sister brand Aerie has been running ad campaign ‘Real Aerie’ using untouched images of their models such as gymnast Aly Raisman, actor Yara Shahidi, singer Rachel Platten, and model Iskra Lawrence since 2014. However, in India, there has been no step in this direction so far.
Samit Sinha, managing partner, Alchemist Brand Consulting, feels that it is an appropriate decision by Dove as it aligns with Dove’s core value of real beauty and it will only enhance the brand’s image in India. 
“With digital and social media platforms where peer-to-peer communication is happening, it is pertinent for brands to walk the talk or be ready to face the ire of consumers who can call a brand out on their unvalidated claims,"" he said.
Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, believes there has been over-emphasis on one’s physical appearance, especially owing to peer pressure and anxiety caused by the desire to project a certain image on social media platforms. “While I think what HUL is doing is commendable and impactful, it is only a flash in the pan since most of the beauty marketing still harps on the idea of perfect beauty which needs to change,"" he said."

HUL, which already sells ice creams under the Kwality Wall’s, Magnum and Cornetto brands, has signed an agreement with Vijaykant Dairy to buy ice cream and frozen dessert business of the company along with its front-end distribution across Karnataka, Maharashtra, Goa and Kerala where the company has presence.
The proposed acquisition, HUL said in a statement, is in line with its strategic intent to strengthen its position in the rapidly growing ice cream and frozen dessert market in India. “Ice Creams and Frozen Desserts is an exciting category and we see great potential for growth. We believe the acquisition will complement our existing portfolio of Kwality Wall’s,"" said HUL chairman Sanjiv Mehta in a statement.
The transaction is subject to fulfilment of certain conditions and the parties will work together to complete this over the next few months, HUL added.
Vijaykant Dairy, which started business in 2004 in Karnataka and gradually spread wings across Maharashtra, Goa and Kerala, will continue to pursue its dairy business after the sell off is complete. “Vijaykant Dairy will manage the business until the transaction is completed, and will also continue to manufacture for HUL for an agreed period of time,"" HUL said.
“HUL is already a strong number two player in ice cream and this acquisition will help in closing the gap with Amul. HUL will bring its distribution muscle and analytics capability to Adityaa,"" said Abneesh Roy, analyst with Edelweiss Securities.
Market research firm Euromonitor International, in an April 2015 study, estimated India’s ice cream market to grow to  ₹  6,198 crore in 2019 from  ₹  4,160 crore in 2014. Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation’s Amul is the largest selling brand with an estimated 32% share. Besides Amul, other home-grown brands such as Mother Dairy, Vadilal, Kwality Wall’s and Havmor have prominent presence.
This is not the first acquisition by HUL in the ice cream space. It had entered the segment by acquiring Kwality Wall’s in phases starting 1994 when it bought the trademark. Some home-grown ice cream makers have sold to private equity players and foreign companies.
In November 2017, South Korea’s Lotte Confectionery Co. Ltd acquired Ahmedabad-based ice-cream maker Havmor Ice Cream Ltd for  ₹  1,020 crore. In the past, Malaysian PE firm Navis had bought into Nirula’s (2006).
On the other hand, premium ice cream brands have been looking at Indian market. While Nestle-owned Mövenpick and Arizona-based Cold Stone Creamery stepped into the market in 2015, Häagen-Dazs and London Dairy have been present in the market for quite a few years."

ITC Ltd, the diversified cigarettes-to-shampoo company, pushed the envelope on inclusivity with the launch of Braille packaging for its health and hygiene brand Savlon on the second Thursday of October, which is observed annually as the World Sight Day.
“When you think about it, it’s a simple idea,"" said Sameer Sathpathy, chief executive officer, personal care, ITC. “It also fits well with the antiseptic brand’s preposition that it’s caring and thinking about the consumer,"" he added.
Yet, there are not even a handful of products in India that offer Braille packaged products. “May be we will now see other companies follow suit with similar initiative,"" said Piyush Pandey, chief creative officer, Ogilvy India, the advertising agency for Savlon. A case in point is Savlon’s earlier launch of Healthy Hands Chalk Sticks which infused chalks with soap granules making hand wash fun for children. “The product is now in great demand in other international markets,"" said Pandey.
One of the reasons for the low adoption of Braille in packaging could be the added cost. “Braille packaging adds to costs,"" a 2013 article in The Pharmaceutical Journal by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, a professional membership body for pharmacists and pharmacy in Great Britain, said while reviewing Braille packaging in UK since its implementation following an EU directive in 2004 which mandated pharmaceutical companies to have Braille on their packaging.
All the same, Savlon’s pricing has not changed with the new packaging, said Sathpathy who is hopeful of the brand becoming a Rs500 crore brand in the next 2-3 years. 
Savlon is present in the antiseptic liquid market which is pegged to be  ₹ 650 crore; hand wash —  ₹  600 crore and has also entered in the sanitizer category, which is pegged at  ₹ 70-80 crore, according to data from market research firm Nielsen. 
The brand competes with Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s Lifebuoy which is a  ₹ 2,000 crore brand and Reckitt Benckiser India’s Dettol.
Also for the visually impaired the change is helpful. “It helps us to save time when looking into our cabinets for an antiseptic as we are more prone to small injuries than the average person,"" said Suhas Karnik, general secretary, National Association for the Blind (NAB) who is hopeful that this launch will help create awareness and attention to the issues of the visually impaired. 
According to the 2011 census data, 10 million people are visually impaired or have some eye ailments and disorders. However, this number is under-reported, claimed Karnik estimating it to be at 20-30 million people at least. However, there are no studies that tell us how many people can read Braille in India, said Karnik."

54,2018-11-29,Unilever,"One place where Hindustan Unilever's reign has not expanded much over the decades is the Indian kitchen. With Horlicks, it has a chance for redemption

Unilever Plc is in exclusive talks with GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) to acquire Horlicks, reported the Financial Times. If the deal happens, it will be Unilever’s most ambitious acquisition in India after its subsidiary Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL)—then known as Hindustan Lever Ltd—acquired Tata group’s soaps and personal care businesses in the 1990s. A natural assumption is that HUL will be the vehicle for this takeover, although it will only become clear after a deal is announced. Unilever may acquire GSK’s stake in locally listed GSK Consumer Healthcare Ltd, which sells Horlicks and other brands in India, and then merge the company with HUL. 
Unilever Plc is in exclusive talks with GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) to acquire Horlicks, reported the Financial Times. If the deal happens, it will be Unilever’s most ambitious acquisition in India after its subsidiary Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL)—then known as Hindustan Lever Ltd—acquired Tata group’s soaps and personal care businesses in the 1990s. A natural assumption is that HUL will be the vehicle for this takeover, although it will only become clear after a deal is announced. Unilever may acquire GSK’s stake in locally listed GSK Consumer Healthcare Ltd, which sells Horlicks and other brands in India, and then merge the company with HUL.
Why Horlicks? One place where HUL’s reign has not expanded much over the decades is the Indian kitchen. Sure, it does have tea, coffee and ketchups in its portfolio, but it missed opportunities such as instant noodles, breakfast cereals and dairy products. It may have had its reasons for staying away, but with Horlicks, it has a chance for redemption.
Unilever’s food and refreshments business contributes 38% of revenue (and this is after several divestments in recent years); in HUL’s case, the segment contributes only 18% of revenue.
Acquiring GSK Consumer can take its contribution up to 28%. It will also add to profitability. HUL’s foods segment profit margin was 16.9%, compared to GSK Consumer’s Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin of 31.4%. Of course, the price paid for the business will determine if the addition to sales and profitability will be worth it. Then, there’s the cost savings from elimination of overlapping functions. But that is for later to analyse, when the deal is announced.
What about the business logic though? Horlicks does target parents (mothers, mostly) and children. That’s an audience HUL is also familiar with. But Horlicks is a health food drink, competing with other products such as Complan, chocolate syrups such as Hershey’s and nutrition products from pharmaceutical companies such as PediaSure. This takes it into uncharted territory.
Horlicks is also chiefly a one-trick pony, with very little success in its attempts to extend to products such as noodles or biscuits. That’s an area that HUL may do well to correct.
Then, there is this question of Horlicks operating in a slowing market for health drinks, its ability to compete with newer products, especially from pharmaceutical companies, and whether it provides any real health benefits.
While the narrative has been that Horlicks will find it difficult to hold its ground, GSK Consumer’s September quarter results give reason for a rethink. Sales rose by 14.4% in value terms and 13.7% in volume over a year ago, which is healthy by itself and also when compared to its peers in the FMCG universe.
OPINION | Horlicks may not be such a sweet deal
What explains GSK Consumer’s growth if the market is indeed slipping away? Higher sales of sachets, or small price packs, is one reason. Sure, it also invested 11% of sales behind advertising but margins were good too, so it can continue to do that. In a new owner’s hands, Horlicks could turn out to be more valuable. But there is that matter of the asking price and whether it will prove to be worth it."

GSK said it is buying Tesaro for $5.1 billion (€4.5 billion), while Unilever is spending €3.3 billion to acquire the drinks unit, whose brands include iconic night-time hot drink Horlicks.

GSK said it is buying Tesaro for $5.1 billion (€4.5 billion), while Unilever is spending €3.3 billion to acquire the drinks unit, whose brands include iconic night-time hot drink Horlicks.
“The acquisition of Tesaro will strengthen our pharmaceuticals business by accelerating the build of our oncology pipeline and commercial footprint, along with providing access to new scientific capabilities,"" GSK chief executive Emma Walmsley said in a statement.
Earlier Monday, Unilever said its deal was for GSK’s business in India, Bangladesh and 20 other predominantly Asian markets, as it looks to profit from increased popularity of health foods in high-growth emerging markets.
“GSK’s health drinks portfolio is the undisputed leader...in India, with iconic brands such as Horlicks and Boost and a product portfolio supported by strong nutritional claims,"" Unilever said.
Horlicks has a long history in India—which accounts for almost 90% of the GSK arm’s turnover in Asia—having been introduced there in the 1930s.
“Horlicks products have been an everyday staple in South Asian households across generations,"" Unilever said, adding GSK’s health drinks portfolio has grown by double digits in the last 15 years.
“Despite this, the category still remains under-penetrated in India,"" it said.
Unilever’s acquistion is the first since Paul Polman announced his retirement at the helm of the consumer products giant last week, after a failed plan to move the firm’s headquarters from London to the Netherlands.
Speaking of the oncology deal meanwhile, Tesaro chief executive Lonnie Moulder said the “transaction marks the beginning of a new global partnership that will accelerate our oncology business and allow our mission of delivering transformative products to individuals living with cancer"".
Boston-based Tesaro is “an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company devoted to providing transformative cancer"" treatments, according to a joint statement with GSK."

However, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) may get to mitigate its tax outgo in subsequent years, given that part of the deal value will be on the goodwill the asset brings to its books, said experts.
As part of the deal announced on Monday by GlaxoSmithKline and Unilever Plc, their Indian units—GSK Consumer Healthcare Ltd and Hindustan Unilever Ltd—will merge by the end of 2019.
This part of the transaction will not be taxable, but GlaxoSmithKline’s subsequent sale of its 5.7% stake in the merged entity will be.
A GlaxoSmithKline press statement announcing the deal said that the 133.7 million HUL shares it will receive after the merger will have a value of  ₹ 23,000 crore. India taxes LTCG tax at 10%.
However, HUL, through which the deal is being executed, will be able to amortize, in subsequent years, the goodwill that part of the transaction value will be attributed to, said Girish Vanvari, founder of advisory firm Transaction Square.
The premium paid over an intangible asset’s book value can be amortized in subsequent years as per the Income Tax Act, 1961, said Ved Jain, former president, Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.
However, GlaxoSmithKline has not specified a timeframe for monetizing the shares in the merged entity.
“Following completion of the transaction, currently expected by the end of 2019, GSK intends to sell down its holding in HUL. Such sell down will be in tranches and, at such times as GSK considers appropriate, taking into account market conditions,"" said GlaxoSmithKline. The companies did not divulge further details on how the sale will be executed.
An official with the income tax department, requesting anonymity, said the authority will wait for more information on the transaction before taking a decision. “We take decisions in such matters only when there is clarity on the definite contours of the transaction. The proposed merger will only get completed by end of 2019.""
Earlier, the tax department had proactively guided Walmart Inc. in meeting its tax obligations on its purchase of a 77% stake in Flipkart for $16 billion.
In May, the department had sought to sensitize the parties about the implications of the tax law provisions on the deal.

New Delhi: Ahead of the Union Budget, FMCG major Hindustan Unilever CMD Sanjiv Mehta Thursday pitched for reducing corporate tax rate and redressal of technical glitches and procedural matters of the goods and services tax (GST). He said that the taxation burden for multi-national corporations (MNCs) can be reduced by “bringing down their corporate tax rate at par with the rate applicable in neighbouring countries"". While GST has proven to be a game changer and is positively impacting taxation practices, “transitional issues need to be rectified fast, covering both technical glitches and procedural matters,"" he added.

While GST has proven to be a game changer and is positively impacting taxation practices, “transitional issues need to be rectified fast, covering both technical glitches and procedural matters,"" he added. He was speaking at CII’s national conference on ‘MNCs and India: Creating Mutual Value’.
In February this year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley lowered corporate tax rate to 25 per cent for businesses with turnover up to  ₹ 250 crore. However, for businesses with over  ₹ 250 crore turnover, 30 per cent tax remains.
The minister will present the interim Budget for 2019-20 fiscal on February 1, 2019.
Mehta, who is also Chairman of CII National Committee on MNCs, said that restrictions on the royalties paid by Indian subsidiaries to their parent companies has been a major concern for MNCs in the recent times.
Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has reduced the royalty payment to 2 per cent on listed companies, which is adversely affecting sentiments of Indian subsidiaries to list in the country’s stock exchanges, he said.
“The distinction created between listed and unlisted companies can discourage participation by foreign companies in the country, thereby adversely affecting transfer of advanced technology, research and development in India by the foreign companies,"" he added.
Further, he also suggested the government to relax local sourcing norms under single-brand retailing.
“Certain restrictive clauses like sourcing norms have undermined the realisation of full benefits of the measure,"" Mehta said, adding that there was a need for harmonisation of Indian standards in line with the global standards when it comes to the regulatory and policy environment in the context of MNCs.
Talking about intellectual property rights (IPR), he said, issues are being faced in the form of inadequate effective enforcement mechanism of rules and limited resources are leading to rising application backlog.
He said that India remains high on the global business radar and it is the right time for India to leverage upon it through a stable and progressive business environment.
“India has the potential to be the engine of growth for the global economy for years to come. If we maintain the momentum, we could be a USD 6-7 trillion economy by 2030, and if we bend the curve we could be a USD 10 trillion economy by 2030,"" he added."

New Delhi: The GST anti-profiteering watchdog, National Anti-profiteering Authority (NAA), said on Monday consumer goods maker Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) has allegedly profiteered to the extent of  ₹ 383 crore after the large scale goods and services tax (GST) rate cut last November. 
New Delhi: The GST anti-profiteering watchdog, National Anti-profiteering Authority (NAA), said on Monday consumer goods maker Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) has allegedly profiteered to the extent of  ₹ 383 crore after the large scale goods and services tax (GST) rate cut last November.
An order from the NAA posted on its website said that, after allowing for certain deductions, the confirmed amount of tax benefit that the company has not passed on to consumers was assessed at  ₹ 383 crore. NAA asked HUL to deposit  ₹ 223 crore in central and state consumer welfare funds as the company had proactively deposited  ₹ 160 crore with the central consumer welfare fund, set up under the anti-profiteering laws.
The NAA order indicates vigilance on the part of the authorities in ensuring that the benefit of tax cuts are passed on to consumers. 
In response to an emailed query, a spokesperson for HUL said the company was reviewing the NAA order. “We will explore all possible options,"" said the statement. The spokesperson said HUL has always held GST as a progressive reform which will benefit consumers and the industry at large. “In the absence of set rules and guidelines on profiteering, we have gone by the spirit of the law, and we passed on the entire benefit received under GST to consumers—either through reduction in prices or through increase in grammage. HUL has since suo moto deposited  ₹ 160 crore ...into the government’s consumer welfare fund,"" said the spokesperson. HUL also said it has kept the government informed of the approach and the manner it had adopted in passing on GST benefits to consumers. 
Abhishek Jain, a tax partner at EY, said that allowing adjustment where the benefit of GST is passed on through increased grammage is a positive for the industry. 
The anti-profiteering law requires businesses to pass on the benefit of tax cuts as well as tax rebates to consumers. It, however, is not a perfect law as businesses always have the right to increase prices in a free market. Besides, there are no guidelines for companies to follow in ensuring that the benefit of tax rebates and rate reductions on raw materials are passed on to consumers at the right measure across all final products.

Mumbai: The Bombay high court has allowed Amul to air its ice cream advertisements, but only after deleting content over which frozen desserts maker Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) had raised objections, including shots of vanaspati (vegetable oil) flowing in a cup with frozen dessert written on it. The court rejected Amul’s contention that its TV commercials (TVCs) did not denigrate frozen desserts. 
Mumbai: The Bombay high court has allowed Amul to air its ice cream advertisements, but only after deleting content over which frozen desserts maker Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) had raised objections, including shots of vanaspati (vegetable oil) flowing in a cup with frozen dessert written on it. The court rejected Amul’s contention that its TV commercials (TVCs) did not denigrate frozen desserts.
Amul owner Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd (GCMMF) had challenged an earlier single bench order that had ruled it guilty of disparaging frozen desserts. Consumer goods company HUL owns Kwality Wall’s brand and is the market leader in the frozen dessert category.
Amul’s ice cream ad campaign, launched in March last year, emphasized the difference between ice-creams (made from milk fat) and frozen desserts (made from vegetable oil). These definitions are according to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India norms.
“The appellant (GCMMF) would be free to use the said TVCs after deleting the portion which has been found to be disparaging the product frozen dessert,"" said a division bench of Bombay High Court comprising Justices B.R. Gavai and Riyaz I. Chagla.
The division bench had passed an order on 13 December that was uploaded on the Bombay high court website on 26 December. 
Amul’s ads urged customers to choose ice-creams over frozen desserts, claiming that the latter was made with vanaspati. Soon after the launch of the campaign, HUL filed a lawsuit in Bombay high court asking for Amul to be stopped from airing the ads and seeking damages. 
HUL argued that as Kwality Wall’s was the largest frozen dessert brand in India, it was directly hit by Amul’s ads though the commercials did not refer to it by name.
In June 2017, a single-judge bench of Justice S.J. Kathawalla granted HUL’s plea for an injunction against the advertisements. Amul challenged the order in the division bench. 
The division bench took the view that the single bench order was a blanket injunction that could not have been granted and held that the TVCs in their entirety could not be said to be objectionable. The bench held that GCMMF was free to use the first seven out of a total of 10 snapshots in each of the two TVCs.
Vishal Maheshwari, co-founder of V.M. Legal Advocates, who is representing Amul in the case, confirmed the development but refused to divulge details citing confidentiality. HUL declined to comment on the developments. 
“India is not just one country, but a lesson in diversity. While urban India is now grappling with pollution and infrastructure issues, and hence failing healths, they are much more concerned about the food and ingredients that go into making it,"" said Tina Jain Mehta, founder of Mumbai-based boutique branding agency Pineapple Consulting. “In sharp contrast, Bharat is in a state of euphoria as more brands/choices are available to them and they are in a mood to experiment"

New Delhi: Hindustan Unilever, which entered the water purifier segment over a decade ago with a mass market offering, is driving its water purifier portfolio towards premiumization, top company officials told mediapersons on Thursday. The company is phasing out the models in the low-cost gravity segment as part of the exercise. The company had called for a press conference to discuss its December quarter earnings. 
New Delhi: Hindustan Unilever, which entered the water purifier segment over a decade ago with a mass market offering, is driving its water purifier portfolio towards premiumization, top company officials told mediapersons on Thursday. The company is phasing out the models in the low-cost gravity segment as part of the exercise. The company had called for a press conference to discuss its December quarter earnings.
“In water purifiers, we are realigning our portfolio strategy towards premium devices while phasing out the gravity segment,"" a company release posted by the company on micro blogging site Twitter said. HUL markets its purifiers under the ‘Pureit brand. It offers air purifiers also under the same brand name. 
A gravity water purifier is a cheaper solution to clean water of impurities and does not need electricity to operate. Most such purifiers come for less than  ₹ 5,000 whereas premium offerings come for well over  ₹ 10,000.
Water purifier is  ₹ 3,500 crore market in India and has several competitors including Kent, LG, Tata Swach, Havells, Bajaj, Forbes Aquaguard and AO Smith. 
Robust volume growth of 10% and selective price hikes propelled the December quarter net profit of Hindustan Unilever, the maker of Dove soaps and Sunsilk shampoos, 9% year-on-year to  ₹ 1,444 crore on a standalone basis. The company said it expected demand to be stable in the near term.
Revenues from sale of products at the largest listed fast-moving consumer goods company in India came in at  ₹ 9,357 crore, up 12.4%.
The company undertook price hikes to the tune of 2-3%, the company’s management told mediapersons during a press conference. Detergents and skin care categories had seen price hikes during the quarter. Domestic consumer growth was 13%, the company officials said.
Margins at the level of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization came in at 21.4%, an improvement of 170 basis points. In absolute terms, EBITDA was  ₹ 2,046 crore, rising by a healthy 22%. The company said it was focused on volume growth and improving margins."

Premium valuations notwithstanding, shares of Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) have gained 11.5% after it announced its September quarter (Q2) results, compared to a 4% rise in the Nifty. HUL Q3 results should help maintain the positive momentum. Volumes during the December quarter increased 10%. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, commendable considering the growth comes on a high base. Growth in the earlier four quarters was aided by demonetisation and goods and services tax (GST) disruptions in the base year.

This is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, commendable considering the growth comes on a high base. Growth in the earlier four quarters was aided by demonetisation and goods and services tax (GST) disruptions in the base year.
Revenue growth stood at 11.3%. Excluding exports, the 13% growth in the domestic business slightly lagged some estimates, reflecting lower-than-expected price realizations. Analysts had assumed price hikes during the quarter were higher. Even so, that does not amount to a major upset.
Importantly key business segments continue to see good growth momentum, helped by steady demand from rural areas and growing sales of premium products. Home care—which includes the detergents business and accounts for close to a third of HUL’s overall revenue—grew by 14.8%. Beauty and personal care—which generates nearly half of overall revenues—grew 11%, primarily driven by premiumization of the product portfolio. The food and refreshment segment also did well, registering a growth of 9.9%.
The healthy growth in volume and cost rationalization measures helped the company expand its profitability margins by 170 basis points to 21.4%. Raw material costs, while volatile, have eased towards the end of the quarter. One hundred basis points equal one percentage point.
The management said the demand environment should be stable in the near term, with its focus remaining on volume-led growth. The government’s focus on rural areas and the expected thrust to rural spends ahead of the elections should aid HUL. Approximately, 40% of the company’s revenue comes from rural areas.
Further, the amalgamation (expected to be completed in the coming quarters) of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Ltd should give a fillip to HUL’s foods business, providing a significant growth lever.
For investors focused on the earnings trajectory in the near term, much will depend on raw material costs and how HUL handles them. While crude and palm oil rates eased from the highs in 2018, prices of other consumables used in tea and toothpaste have remained firm."

Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), India’s largest household goods company, said quarterly profit rose 9% from a year earlier, the slowest pace in seven quarters. 
Mumbai: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), India’s largest household goods company, said quarterly profit rose 9% from a year earlier, the slowest pace in seven quarters.
Net profit rose to  ₹1,444 crore in the three months ended 31 December from  ₹1,325 crore in the year earlier. That was in line with the  ₹1,455 crore average profit estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg. Sales revenue rose 12.42% to RS 9,357 crore.
The company, which sells everyday brands such as Lux soaps, Pepsodent toothpaste and Kissan jam, reported a 10% volume growth in the quarter, indicating stable consumer demand. HUL’s earnings—usually the bellwether for India’s consumer goods companies—also helps gauge demand and monitor consumer sentiment. 
Chairman and MD Sanjiv Mehta said the company is keeping a close watch on the macroeconomic environment and “will respond with agility"". He expects demand to remain stable in the near term. 
HUL is in the process of completing the purchase of GlaxoSmithKline Plc’s Indian consumer business for R 31,700 crore in an all-stock transaction that will give it brands such as Horlicks, Boost and Viva. HUL’s management on Thursday said it hopes to complete the acquisition by the end of 2019.
The company is in the process of seeking approvals from stock exchanges and the Competition Commission of India. The management said it would apportion costs of the acquisition over the next couple of quarters. In the December quarter, restructuring expenses were  ₹46 crore and acquisition and disposal-related costs were  ₹16 crore.
Mehta said the rural market is growing 1.3 times faster than sales in urban areas.
“The very fact that the governments in many states were forced to waive the farm loans, that is certainly indicative of that. Even rains started well but many pockets in the country didn’t receive average rainfall,"" Mehta.
“The important factors are wage rates because not all are farm owners and wage rates have to move up to have more money in the hands of farmers. Also, the government had put in the intent of MSP and whether that gets effectively implemented in the market or not is yet to be seen."""
40,2019-01-21,Unilever,"The challenge is to cross the 6.5-7.5% growth chasm to an 8-9% rate, says HUL chairman and MD Sanjiv MehtaIn the consumer goods business, general trade would adopt more tech and turn more modern, said Mehta

Mumbai: For far too long, India’s economic growth has remained trapped in a range, give or take a couple of percentage points. How does it break out of this range and soar to the levels that China has achieved? India’s largest consumer goods maker, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), has a one-line answer: implement agricultural reforms.
The company, whose financial performance is often seen as a proxy for the Indian consumer sentiment, on Friday posted a 9% increase in net profit in the December quarter, its slowest pace in the last seven quarters. According to HUL chairman and managing director Sanjiv Mehta, the frenetic infrastructure building of the last few years has helped manufacturers quickly reach remote parts of the country and boosted demand and this would accelerate if agricultural reforms were to follow.
“I think the challenge for the country is to cross the chasm, between the 6.5 and 7.5% growth that we have been delivering in the recent past, to the 8-9% kind of growth rate or, importantly, the kind of growth that China delivered over a 20-year period, which was double-digit growth..."" Mehta said in an interview at the HUL headquarters in Mumbai’s Andheri on Friday. This chasm can be crossed, he added, when India believes it needs to make rural India a very clear part of the economic growth story through “very clear agricultural reform"".
“Agricultural reforms will result in agricultural wages going up, agricultural total income going up, and not just relying on feeding MSPs (minimum support prices), where also effective implementation can be a question mark in different parts of the country,"" Mehta said.
The Central Statistics Office on Monday released the first advance estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) for 2018-19, which show that the Indian economy is likely to grow at 7.2% in the year ending 31 March. The estimate indicates a potential deceleration in economic activity during the October-March period.
“We are very pleased with the investments, which is happening in infrastructure. We have very clear evidence that in any village where infrastructure gets created, the market starts growing 1.3x-1.5x to the previous growth rate,"" said the chairman and managing director of HUL.
Despite headwinds such as demonetization and the goods and services tax, HUL’s revenue has steadily grown in the last two years.
October-December was the fifth consecutive quarter in which HUL’s revenue grew in double digits, despite the high base of the previous years. After it announced its September quarter results, the company’s stock gained by 11.5% against a 4% rise in the benchmark Nifty index.
Mehta hopes better sense will prevail amid rising nationalism across the world.
“So, when you move from a creed nationalism to an ethnic nationalism, then you become more parochial. Everyone starts looking at it from their national interest. I would believe that sanity should prevail,"" said Mehta.
India’s resilience will be backed by its inherent strengths, which revolve around consumption, and the fact that the country has not yet taken the shape of an export behemoth, said Mehta.
“We are a country where 60-70% of our GDP is driven by consumption, and most of it is domestic consumption; and if there is a trade war between the US and China, it will have an impact because we are part of the global ecosystem, but you look at it from India’s lens, it should not have as big an impact as it should have on many other countries,"" he said.
In the consumer goods business, general trade would adopt more technology and become more modern, he predicted.
“The general trade will remain the biggest channel in the country for the years to come. But, general trade will also get reinvented. Signs of retailing will come into general trade. Technology will come into general trade. It will get wired up to an increasing extent and you will get into a stage where general trade will be able to have assortment and cater to the needs of neighbouring shoppers in a far bigger way than they have ever done,"" he said.
And if that happens, that “will be the redemption going forward""."
39,2019-01-21,Unilever,"The threat from upstart Patanjali has faded and in the words of HUL chairman Sanjiv Mehta, the rise of Patanjali has only brought the best out of his companyThe acquisition of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Ltd will not only give it ownership of brands such as Horlicks and Boost, but also strengthen HUL's foods and refreshment segment

Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) today is in a far stronger position than it has been in the last three years. The threat from upstart Patanjali has faded and in the words of HUL chairman Sanjiv Mehta, the rise of Patanjali has only brought the best out of his company. Mehta said the acquisition of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Ltd will not only give it ownership of brands such as Horlicks and Boost, but also strengthen its foods and refreshment segment, where HUL was lagging behind its nearest competitor ITC Ltd for a long-time. If the regulatory approvals are received on time, the combined businesses of HUL and GlaxoSmithKline Consumer will be  ₹45,000crore from next year. Edited excerpts from an interview:
Growth seems to be pretty good, given the high base.
It might be worthwhile to just pause and reflect, not just on the last few quarters, but the last six years of HUL, and that tells you a much more bigger story. We have grown our delta (incremental) turnover in the last six years by  ₹12,400 crore. If it was a separate company, with  ₹12,400 crore, it could perhaps be the largest FMCG company. If you look at our profits or Ebitda, we have more than doubled in the last six years. And, because of our performance during tough times, the market has re-rated us... Now, we have a market cap, which is in upwards of $50 billion. If you look at it from that context, it has been a great journey for HUL and these last six years, you have seen two consecutive years of drought, demonetization and introduction of GST (goods and services tax).
What are the new areas of interest to HUL? I remember at the GSK merger conference, you had said this will give you an opportunity to understand the health segment well...
Again, if I just stop and give you a flavour of how we have grown the business...what are the key pillars of our business. First, we focused and strengthened our core, then you constantly renovate and innovate, you build the brand equity, you focus through multi-year brand engagement activities. You make it contemporary every year.
Second, is market development. Over the years, we have created several categories. Market development is a science. What we call seed, accelerate and explode. Where the penetration is less than 10%, we seed it... once the penetration moves from 10% to 20%, we accelerate the development, and once it crosses 20%, then we press the pedal hard and explode it. So, it is a very clear science that we have built.
The third is premiumization that I explained to you.
Fourth, is our focus on cost. Anything that does not add value to the consumer or company, we weed it out. And, while we may be big, we have the soul of a small company.
So, when you look at the acquisition of GSK Consumer, we firmly believe it is very strategic and transformative.
We are the number one beauty and personal care, homecare company by a distance and, now, adding the GSK Consumer Health portfolio to our business will make us one of the biggest food and refreshment businesses in the country. Now, why are we excited about Health Food Drink (HFD) as a country. If you look at our country, four out of 10 children are malnourished. Nine out of 10 children do not get the micro-nutrients that’s required and still the penetration of HFD in the country is about 25%. And then, in many ways, GSK Consumer Health and Unilever, we come from a very similar background. We have been in the country for many decades with similar purpose and values. They have built a great category. This is a category of nearly  ₹8,000 crore and, in that, they are by far the market leaders with great brands—Horlicks, Boost, Maltova, Viva—and when you look at them from any lens in terms of most trusted brands in the country, you will have many brands from HUL in that list.
Similarly, you will always have a brand like Horlicks featuring in it. Now for us, it is a very strategic and transformative deal. It gives us the scale, it gives us the capabilities and skills that GSK Consumer possesses in the whole domain of HFDs. There are not many good properties in HFDs to acquire, which are as good as GSK and we had an eye on these for years. We are so pleased that we have been able to get this deal...
We are talking about a combined entity of about  ₹45,000 crore business next year.
How will you grow the size of the business?
Our objective is very clear that we would want the combined sum of foods and refreshment business to be bigger than the sum of two parts.
I am saying that the challenge for us from the merger is that the combined business of GSK consumer business and our foods and refreshments business should become bigger than the sum of two parts. That will happen when we will be able to leverage scale and synergies of both the companies and then it will be a vertical take-off.
Economists have started to talk about an impending slowdown in the US and the European markets. Do you think, if an economic slowdown indeed happens, India will be resilient?
I would believe so for certain very clear factors, because our share of global trade is very small. We are not an export-driven country. We are a country where 60-70% of our GDP is driven by consumption and most of it is domestic consumption. If there is a trade war between the US and China, it will have an impact, because we are a part of the global ecosystem. But if you look at it from India’s lens, it should not have as big an impact as it should have on many other countries."
38,2019-01-25,Unilever,"December quarter volume growth came in at 7% year-on-year, consistent with what was seen in the September quarterVolume acceleration may have got a boost from its naturals portfolio toothpaste, Vedshakti

Colgate-Palmolive (India) Ltd’s investors are a happy lot so far this fiscal year, with the company’s stock price rising by 25% to  ₹1,321.90, outperforming the Nifty FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) index.
The December quarter (Q3) results announced on Thursday have also not brought many unpleasant surprises. The company, famous for its Colgate brand of toothpastes and other oral care products, rinsed out a satisfactory quarter, broadly meeting expectations.
December quarter volume growth came in at 7% year-on-year, consistent with what was seen in the September quarter. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities were expecting a volume growth of 5% .
In the base December 2017 quarter , Colgate’s volume had increased by 12% on a favourable base. “This implies that there is improvement in volume growth compared to earlier quarters when the company was struggling to grow on a favourable base,"" pointed out analysts at Dolat Capital Market Pvt. Ltd.
Volume acceleration may have got a boost from its naturals portfolio toothpaste, Vedshakti. “The intensity from Patanjali Ayurved Ltd has reduced comparatively in recent quarters, giving Colgate a breather,"" said an analyst who did not want to be named. Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali is a key competitor in the naturals segment for Colgate.
However, not everyone is impressed with Colgate’s volume growth. The company’s growth rate is improving, but it is still below FMCG leaders such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), says Naveen Kulkarni, senior head of research at Reliance Securities Ltd. HUL had reported volume growth of 10% for the December quarter.
Overall, Colgate’s revenue for the December quarter increased by 6% over the same period last year to about  ₹1,100 crore. Realizations have been impacted because of promotional offers such as the buy-2-get-1 scheme for some products.
On the brighter side, Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin increased by 120 basis points to 28.6%. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Ebitda performance was helped by a decline in employee costs and the relatively slower pace of increase in advertising and other expenses. Better operating performance and a much slower rate of growth in depreciation costs meant Colgate’s pre-tax earnings rose by 12% year-on-year to  ₹282 crore.
Colgate’s share rose almost 1% on Thursday, a generally upbeat day for the markets. The stock has already appreciated by a good measure. That also means it isn’t available cheap, trading at 43 times estimated earnings for the next fiscal year, according to Bloomberg data. Some bit of the optimism is also on account of investors being gung-ho on the broad consumption theme playing out.
More particularly, Colgate will have to continue to be persistent on volume growth and improving market share for valuations to sustain at these elevated levels."

New Delhi: Lifebuoy, the hygiene brand from Hindustan Unilever (HUL), is serving hygiene lessons to people through ‘Swasthya Chetna Thalis’ at the ongoing Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj. The thalis come with an etched message of ‘Kripaya Pehle Sabun se Haath Dhoyein’ (loosely translated to ‘Please wash your hands with soap first’) urging people to wash hands before eating. The call to action is the brand’s way of telling people that the simple act of washing hands can prevent many illnesses that spread by touch.
“Lifebuoy aims to harness the power of small actions that can unlock big differences. Like the simple act of handwashing can ensure measurably better health for the whole family, we hope a simple reminder right before someone eats food can trigger a meaningful increase in the habit of washing hands before eating,"" said Harman Dhillon, general manager of skin cleansing at HUL.
Along with the Kumbh Mela, the largest congregation of human beings in the world, Lifebuoy said it is also taking this idea to 35 other religious congregations that serve food to devotees, with an estimated annual footfall of 200 million.
During the 2013 Kumbh Mela, the country's largest consumer goods company along with creative agency Ogilvy & Mather had tied up with over 100 dhabas and hotels at the mela site to serve rotis that are stamped with ‘Lifebuoy se haath dhoye kya?’ (loosely translated to ‘Have you washed your hand with Lifebuoy?’).
“Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies continue to be the biggest spender during Kumbh Mela,"" said Shekhar Banerjee, managing partner, Wavemaker India.
Many consumers that visit Kumbh Mela come from the media dark regions of the country, noted Banerjee, giving deeply penetrated brand categories to connect with them mostly through innovative on-ground activations.
“That is why categories such as FMCG, telecom and automobiles tend to leverage this festival to connect with a completely new set of consumers,"" he added."

When a panel of state finance ministers led by West Bengal’s Amit Mitra brought out an early version of the goods and services tax (GST) law in November 2016, it introduced a provision that was not there in a previous draft released in June that year.
The provision said in just over 100 words that businesses have to pass on tax benefits to the consumer by way of a ‘commensurate’ cut in prices of goods and services, or face a penalty. When the rules were firmed up in 2017 before the roll-out of the tax reform in July, the scope of the anti-profiteering measure got significantly widened to include a harsh and unforgiving chastisement for defaulters—de-registration of the erring company. Today, anti-profiteering is a key compliance area for businesses with regulatory rigor and potential litigations."
35,2019-03-07,Unilever,"The company’s market cap has increased 6.9 times in the last four years to  ₹72,740 croreEffective April 2019, Britannia will become only the third fast-moving consumer goods firm in the index

What is the best thing to have happened since sliced bread? Whatever it is, Britannia Industries Ltd appears to be partaking some of it, going by the dramatic increase in its market capitalization over the past few years. The company’s market cap has increased 6.9 times in the last four years to  ₹72,740 crore and, with this, it has catapulted itself into the bellwether Nifty 50 index. Effective April 2019, Britannia will become only the third fast-moving consumer goods firm in the index, after industry heavyweights Hindustan Unilever Ltd and ITC Ltd.
In the past, investors saw Britannia as a bread-and-butter business, which was growing steadily. Now, product introductions and rising premiumization are driving higher-than-industry growth. With consumers shifting to higher value-added products, Britannia has positioned itself well with new launches. The company has been introducing newer variants of its biscuits and entering fresh categories, such as croissants. It has also been expanding its cakes menu.
All this has seen its revenue expand. Its December quarter revenue stood at  ₹2,827.40 crore, compared to  ₹2,558.3 crore in the year-ago period. The increase in sales of value-added products has also boosted margins. The Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin rose from 14.79% in December 2017 quarter to 15.79% in the latest quarter.
Lately, though, the Britannia stock has been experiencing a bumpy ride from its peak of  ₹3,467 in August 2018. It is already down 12.7% to  ₹3,027. Analysts attribute investors’ concerns to slowing revenue growth. Its year-on-year revenue growth rate has slowed in the December quarter to 10.5%. In contrast, revenue growth in the year-ago period stood at 12.9%.
Part of the reason for the stock’s stagnation is concerns over its ability to drive further margin expansion. Raw material prices have been stable largely due to the drop in food prices. “One of the big concerns is food inflation. Rising raw material prices will tend to impact margins,"" says Naveen Kulkarni, head of research at Reliance Securities.
A larger concern is the rich stock valuations, due to higher demand for consumer goods stocks. In March 2015, Britannia’s one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio used to be about 35 times. Currently, it is 51.8 times, which is 48% higher. Unless it can bake healthy growth rates in the future, investors might soon find the stock unappetizing."
34,2019-03-07,Unilever,"The company’s Twitter handle tweeted about the Red Label Kumbh Mela ad which features a son trying to abandon his elderly fatherThe message didn’t go down well with Twitterati who targeted the multinational for being insensitive and disrespectful

NEW DELHI :
Kumbh Mela, the world’s largest religious and spiritual event, is an assured marketing congregation for brands. However, the recently concluded event turned out to be a bitter experience for Hindustan Unilever (HUL) which was caught in a Twitter storm over its campaign for tea brand Red Label.
The company’s Twitter handle tweeted about the Red Label Kumbh Mela ad which features a son trying to abandon his elderly father until his conscious tells him otherwise. The tweet stated that
'KumbhMela is a place where old people get abandoned, isn't it said that we do not care for our elders? Red Label encourages us to hold the hands of those who made us who we are. Watch the heartwarming video; an eye opener to a harsh reality.'
The message didn’t go down well with Twitterati who targeted the multinational for being insensitive and disrespectful towards Hindu customs and started attacking the company using#BoycottHindustanUnilever. HUL’s competitor and promoter of Patanjali Ayurved Ltd Baba Ramdev also jumped in and accused HUL for ridiculing Hindu religion and customs and for being profit driven.
“Their only agenda is to make the country poor economically and ideologically. Why should we not boycott them? For them everything, every emotion is just a commodity. For us parents are next to Gods #BoycottHindustanUnilever,"" Ramdev tweeted.
The hashtag #BoycottHindustanUnilever gained momentum through the day and started trending forcing HUL to withdraw and moderate the tweet which sparked the debate. The company sprung into action and tweeted the ad with a relatively neutral message stating 'RedLabel encourages us to hold the hands of those who made us who we are. Watch the heart-warming video #ApnoKoApnao'
“Through the Brooke Bond Red Label campaign, our intention is to urge people to take care of the elderly. We do not intend to hurt the sentiments of people, and have modified the tweet which could have been inadvertently misconstrued,"" said a HUL spokesperson in an emailed response to Mint.
According to Saurabh Uboweja, chief executive at management consulting firm Brands of Desire, the tweet was a blunder from one of the largest FMCG companies in the world. “It violates the most fundamental principle of brand building. You cannot build your own equity by reducing the equity of your consumers, in this case by making them appear insensitive, reducing their prestige and hurting their self esteem,"" he said.
However, Uboweja is quick to add that the tweet might not really have a huge impact on the sales of their consumer brands barring Red Label tea. “Except the marketing elite and a few thousand people on Twitter, most consumers won’t even know this happened. More importantly, consumers don’t easily recognize the owners of consumers brands. This would surely hurt their corporate brand, especially in the eyes of their own people and other key stakeholders directly impacted by the HUL brand,"" he added."
33,2019-03-12,Unilever,"Advertising experts believe that the backlash is solely driven by political motives and the sheer size of the company involvedThe campaign message of bringing people together and showing how colours can be an equalizer in society

NEW DELHI :
In a poll-bound and politically charged India, brands are learning to tread with caution, especially in communicating their message. Ahead of general elections scheduled to begin on 11 April, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) has found itself snared in a couple of controversies for its tea brand Red Label Kumbh Mela campaign and, more recently, for the detergent brand Surf Excel.
With over 9 million views on YouTube, the Holi spot ‘Rang laaye sang’ (loosely translated to colours that bring us together) which features an innocent bond between a little Hindu girl and a Muslim boy, has been targeted for Love Jihad vilification on social media platforms.
The campaign message of bringing people together and showing how colours can be an equalizer in society resonated with the netizens but not with the troll army which made #BoycottHindustanUnilever and #BoycottSurfExcel trend. However, there is an emerging parallel narrative on the micro-blogging platform with people standing up for the brand tweeting with hashtags #stopdivisiveness.
HUL said it stands by the campaign adding that in the last decade, the brand has advertised on the philosophy of ‘Daag Acche Hain’ (Dirt is Good). In its various campaigns, the brand has championed ‘doing good’ by showing kids getting dirty while playing, and in the process, demonstrating empathy for the less privileged, respect for elders, loyalty, caring and many other values.
“This is true of our current campaign as well—the Surf excel #RangLaayeSang campaign embodies the brand’s ‘Daag Acche Hain’ philosophy, and captures how the colours of Holi can be a force for good, melting differences and bringing people together. In the advertisement, you see two innocent children who demonstrate friendship and bonding in the true spirit of the festival. This reflects the true ethos of India as a caring, plural and secular society,"" said an HUL spokesperson in an email to Mint.
Advertising experts believe that the backlash is solely driven by political motives and the sheer size of the company involved. “It’s a charged atmosphere in the country which is fuelling such backlash and once elections are over I don’t think the same ad would generate such a furore. Surf has tapped into this mood with full understanding that by creating such an ad they would be putting themselves at the centre of the discussions in the country,"" said Shamsuddin Jasani, group managing director, Isobar South Asia.
With a high recall, in the next three to six months the sales of brand Surf Excel is expected to go up as more people come out in support of the brand, noted Jasani.
Jitender Dabas, chief strategy officer, McCann Worldgroup India believes that there’s a clear pattern when it comes to trolling which often picks on people or brands that have mass popularity.
“But if the brand is built over time on having a point of view on issues then it is important to not bow down to such trolling. While it is important for brands to be sensitive to people’s emotions and not go wrong in understanding the cultural nuances, that doesn’t mean that brands should play safe and not stand for their convictions,"" he said.
Dabas pointed out that while the Red Label Kumbh ad (more so an accompanying tweet which highlighted how some people abandon their elderly parents at Kumbh) perhaps went wrong in correctly representing what the holy festival stands for; the Surf Excel campaign is a shining example of how brands should take exemplary stances and stick by them.
“As the Nike-Kaepernick ad episode shows us even in a polarised society if you stick by the brand conviction you are likely to win brand loyalty, respect and stronger support of consumers,"" he added, in reference to HUL standing up for its Holi ad."
32,2019-03-15,Unilever,"Unilever appoints Nitin Paranjpe as COO, elevates HUL CMD Sanjiv Mehta as president of the company's South Asia operationsNitin Paranjpe and Sanjiv Mehta join Unilever HR head Leena Nair in Unilever Leadership Executive team (ULE)

Mumbai: Indian executives continue to work their way up Unilever Plc's leadership ladder, with the Anglo-Dutch company on Thursday elevating Nitin Paranjpe, 56, who heads its foods and refreshments business, as its chief operating officer (COO), the second Indian after Harish Manwani to hold the position.
Simultaneously, the company included Sanjiv Mehta, chairman and managing director of Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), into its Unilever Leadership Executive team (ULE), making him the third Indian in the exclusive 11-member body that runs the €51 billion consumer goods maker.
Mehta will join Leena Nair, chief human resource officer, and Paranjpe. In addition to being part of the Unilever leadership team and CMD of Hindustan Unilever, Mehta will be the president of the company’s South Asia operations.
ULE is Unilever’s top executive team and includes C-Suite executives such as heads of finance, human resources, research and development, marketing and supply chain, besides chiefs of key markets such as Europe, North America and North Asia.
The latest promotions are a continuation of a decades-long trend of executives from its successful Indian operation taking up top leadership roles at its parent. Prior to Manwani, Manvinder Singh Banga served as president for global foods, home and personal care. Banga, a former HUL chairman, was also part of ULE.
Manwani, the longest serving non-executive chairman of India’s largest household goods maker, retired in 2018 after being in that position for 13 years. He was also the first ever COO of Unilever.
Prior to his current elevation, Paranjpe was managing director and chief executive of HUL from 2008 to 2013, before becoming president of Unilever’s foods and refreshments division. Hanneke Faber, president of Europe, will replace Paranjpe as president of foods and refreshment.
“Today’s increasingly fragmented consumer, channel and media environment requires us to operate with more speed and agility than ever before. With his deep knowledge and experience of our markets, Nitin is ideally placed to work with me and the Unilever Leadership Executive to drive our performance and help deliver our growth ambitions,"" Unilever CEO Alan Jope said in a statement.
Sandip Ghose, a former managing director of Nepal Lever, a unit of Hindustan Unilever, and now executive president of Birla Corp., remembers Paranjpe as a people’s person.
“He has been a very mature professional. I remember there was a massive protest in Kerala against HUL products and he happened to be working there. The way he handled the situation showed his ability to be level-headed during a crisis. When it comes to working with people, he is not someone who would be brash,"" Ghose said in a phone interview.
In his role as president, Paranjpe led the company’s investments in the foods business and was responsible for growing its ice cream, tea and foods categories. He also divested Unilever’s spreads business last year.
Today, the foods segment accounts for 40% of Unilever’s business. However, though its revenue has dropped from €22.44 billion in 2017 to €20.22 billion in 2018, its operating income from the segment has risen from €8.85 billion to €12.53 billion."
31,2019-03-20,Unilever,"One of the big concerns for HUL is whether volume growth will continue to meet or beat expectations as Indian economy slowsThat said, synergies from the completion of the HUL-GSK merger is something that HUL investors can look forward to

For some time, defensive stocks, such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), were among the firms investors preferred. But now a risk-on trade is happening at a time when HUL begins to feel the heat of slacking GDP (gross domestic product) growth. In the past one month, the stock has been under stress, falling 2.2% in contrast to a 9.47% rise in the Nifty 500 index. And, valuations are sky-high at 59 times estimated FY19 earnings, which itself makes a case for a correction.
One of the big concerns for the stock is whether volume growth will continue to meet or beat expectations as the Indian economy slows. HUL has been showing strong double-digit volume growth for the past five quarters due to the benefits it garnered from the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST). In the December quarter (Q3), volumes climbed 10% year-on-year. But they may be tapering off. “Industry demand appears to be somewhat moderating,"" CLSA said in a note to clients. “This is mainly due to a weak macro environment (moderation of GDP growth, wage inflation, etc.).""
Near-term volume growth is also likely to be impacted by a higher base.
“Organic growth may be a little lower than what it was in the past few quarters. There were some benefits of a lower base. Hence, the same kind of growth continuing might be a slight challenge,"" said Naveen Kulkarni, head of research at Reliance Securities Ltd.
Further, against upbeat margins in the June (Q1 FY19) and September (Q2 FY19) quarters, HUL reported lower margins of 21.9% in Q3 FY19. Even though it did well to rein in costs while increasing product prices, pressure from rising raw material costs has been evident.
Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities see a steady demand environment, but no meaningful acceleration just yet. In a report the firm noted: “The recent fall in crude price is a tailwind though P&G-led competitive-intensity in detergents will keep a check on margin expansion. We expect HUL to continue to deliver steady growth, but do not see room for earnings upgrades."" 
P&G is Procter and Gamble Hygiene and Health Care Ltd.
To be sure, the company continues to focus on ramping up sales of high-margin products. It’s also focusing on cost rationalization. Besides, the synergies of its merger with Glaxo Smithkline Consumer Healthcare Ltd are yet to kick in. This is expected after December 2019, on completion of the HUL-GSK merger.
Still, concerns weigh in the short run. HUL’s stock is up 29.8% in the past one year and, as mentioned earlier, valuations are high. Analysts say the company lacks triggers that can propel the stock forward for now. Hence, watching the coming quarter closely is critical to see if volume growth and margins continue to remain firm."
30,2019-03-25,Unilever,"Fitch has cut India GDP growth forecast for FY20 to 6.8%—a mere reflection of the slowdown in auto and FMCG sectorsHeavyweights in both the industries—Maruti Suzuki and Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) have a lacklustre outlook on sales

""No winter lasts forever; no spring skips its turn,"" said Hal Borland, a US writer and naturalist. But as far as the Indian economy’s prospects go, it seems to be a prolonged winter this time around, with spring nowhere in sight.
Fitch Ratings has cut India GDP growth forecast for FY20 to 6.8% from 7% in December.
Of course, India isn’t alone. Fitch has lowered growth forecasts for 15 countries, and has cut its global growth forecast for 2019 to 2.8% from 3.1% earlier.
For India, the revision in GDP growth forecast is a mere reflection of the slowdown in several industries such as automobiles and consumer goods. What’s more, there have already been telltale signs of weakness in consumption demand in India.
“A consumption slowdown is underway and a part of it was led by the liquidity crunch in the NBFC (non-banking financial company) space and its impact has been lingering,"" said Tanvee Gupta Jain, chief India economist at UBS Securities India Pvt. Ltd. “The UBS India-Financial Conditions Index suggests growth momentum could remain sluggish in the March quarter and real GDP growth could range from 6.2% to 6.5% year-on-year, versus 6.6% in the December 2018 quarter.""
For instance, carmaker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd reported flat sales for February compared to those a year earlier. News reports suggest Maruti Suzuki has cut production for this month by as much as 27% year-on-year.
Sales of tractors and two-wheelers have been weak, too.
Likewise, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) major Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) recently put a check on analysts’ expectations.
“There is some concern on demand as industry growth rates are moderating. This is in contrast to the earlier quarter, where commentary was that demand conditions are stable,"" CLSA analysts said in a note to clients on 15 March, based on their interaction with the HUL management. Analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd say their research suggests sustained demand weakness across the consumer durables space, with increased cashback schemes resulting in some volume offtake.
“The data suggests this cyclical slowdown could extend until the June 2019 quarter, before it starts to recover,"" said Jain. Economists at Nomura concur. “The latest prints of concurrent indicators seem to suggest that the March quarter will mimic the December quarter, but with deterioration also spreading to services, industrial and investment demand. This is also corroborated by Nomura’s proprietary leading indicator, which points to a continued moderation,"" economists at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a note on 21 March.
The hope, of course, is that the situation will improve after the general election results are out and the new government takes charge. “Consumption-linked data might get worse in the interim before it improves. We may be in the last two quarters of a consumption slowdown,"" said Sahil Kapoor, chief market strategist at Edelweiss Professional Investor Research.
As pointed out earlier, one of the main reasons for the slowdown in consumption demand is the liquidity crisis at NBFCs that started when Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) defaulted last year.
“The flow of funds from the corporate bond and commercial paper market into the NBFC space is slowing down decisively from around 25% per annum CAGR (compound annual growth rate) over FY14-18 to an expected rate of around 8% per annum over FY18-21,"" said Ritika Mankar Mukherjee, senior economist at Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd. This means NBFCs are lending at a slower pace and that too at higher rates, as they pass on the increase in their cost of funding. 
To be sure, the Reserve Bank of India is expected to do its bit to boost consumption. UBS’s Jain foresees a cumulative repo rate cut of 75-100 basis points (bps) in this cycle. This includes the 25 bps easing announced in February. But then, transmission of reduced rates by banks is easier said than done, as pointed out in a Mark to Market column. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.
Also, as Nomura’s economists point out, “Fiscal and monetary policies are turning expansionary but are unlikely to change the near-term trajectory.""
Apart from domestic growth concerns, the Indian economy has to contend with the global slowdown, which is hurting exports.
Again, the farm income support scheme of  ₹6,000 a year for around 120 million households could help increase rural consumption, but only to a limited extent. In short, there’s no magic wand. It could be a few quarters for this measure to yield the desired results.
Despite this, consumption-focused stocks, especially FMCG, continue to trade at expensive valuations. But sooner or later, a cocktail of these heady mixes will prove to be nauseous, at the least giving valuations a reality check."

28,2019-05-05,Unilever,"Hindustan Unilever’s volume growth of 7% for the March quarter isn’t disappointingThere is a hope that the new government will give a fillip to the economy

There is a consumption slowdown in the country and Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s (HUL’s) March quarter results reflect that.
Still, in the land of the blind, the one-eyed is king. This may be apt to describe HUL’s volume performance. The fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company’s volume growth of 7% was better than its peers, and well within the expected range of 6-8%. On the other hand, Dabur India Ltd’s volume growth was 4%, missing Street expectations. Similarly, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd’s volume growth of 1% is rather poor.
There is a consumption slowdown in the country and Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s (HUL’s) March quarter results reflect that.

On the other hand, Dabur India Ltd’s volume growth was 4%, missing Street expectations. Similarly, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd’s volume growth of 1% is rather poor.
However, the best news pretty much ends there for HUL. The company confirmed that rural demand, which outran demand growth of urban areas, is now slowing to grow at a similar pace as urban regions. “Perhaps, if things were improving in April, management commentary would not have been so gloomy,"" said an analyst, requesting anonymity.
“At the end of the day, it depends on the money in the hand of the consumer,"" said HUL’s management in a post-results press conference. “The evidence of two-wheelers slowing down clearly corroborates to the economy slowing down.""
Interestingly, HUL and other FMCG firms hope demand conditions would improve after the new government is elected. “There is a hope that the new government will give a fillip to the economy and how that plays out remains to be seen,"" pointed out the analyst quoted above.
The probability of the hopes materializing is not without risks. Plus, investors should stay tuned to how the monsoon performs this year. For now, lack of disappointment in the March quarter results may well keep the stock in favour.
HUL shares have declined 3.3% since its December quarter results were announced. In comparison, the Nifty 50 index has gained 7.4% during the same time.
The company’s revenue in the March quarter rose by 9.3% year-on-year to  ₹9,945 crore, largely in line with Street expectations. The home care, and foods and refreshment segments performed well, clocking 12.9% and 10.4% growth, respectively. Growth in the beauty and personal care segment was comparatively slower at 7.3%.
HUL saw 83 basis points improvement in its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin to 23.3%. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The Ebitda margin expansion came despite an increase in overall raw material costs. The company kept a lid on its employee costs, and advertising and promotion expenses to compensate for higher input costs.
Still, HUL’s valuations are frothy, what with the shares having outperformed the Nifty 50 index in the past one year. Valuations at nearly 50 times estimated earnings for FY20 look rich, especially in light of the management commentary on the demand slowdown."
27,2019-05-07,Unilever,"Management commentary of FMCG companies suggests the worst is far from overInsufficient income growth, low sentiment, liquidity crunch are culprits for growth slowdown

India’s famous consumption story is going awry. At least that’s what March quarter results of some large fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies show. Volume growth numbers fell substantially for these companies, with Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) reporting a mere 1% growth in the domestic branded business volumes. A bigger worry was the low-spirited management commentary, which suggests that the worst is far from over.
“When a generally measured management like Hindustan Unilever’s uses the term ‘recession’ in its comments in the post-results presser, it generally isn’t a one-quarter blip,"" pointed out analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities in a report on 4 May. On Friday, HUL’s management had said, “While FMCG is recession resistant, it is not recession proof.""
Management commentary from GCPL and Dabur India Ltd wasn’t inspiring either. These two companies harped on the need for further fiscal stimulus to boost demand.
HUL’s volume growth for the March quarter was 7%, a drop from the double-digit growth seen for the previous five quarters. Dabur India’s volume growth was only 4%, while Britannia Industries Ltd reported a 7% increase in volumes.
In general, firms have emphasized about the slowdown in rural demand. Farm incomes have taken a beating. There is low consumer confidence. Plus, there’s the liquidity crunch that everyone seems to be coping with. Given these factors, the message seems clear: improvement in demand is not expected to happen quickly.
According to Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd, the rural stimulus of direct income transfer to farmers announced by the government in the February 2019 budget will get fully rolled out only post- elections in June. “After that, we expect a minimum lag of 3-4 months for any impact to show up on consumption and company revenues. Thus, we do not expect any recovery in 1H FY20 and the earliest possibility of a pickup will be in 2H FY20,"" said Credit Suisse analysts in a report on Monday.
In another report, commenting on the overall consumption slowdown, Kotak pointed out, “An analysis of macro (household savings data) and (2) micro (sector and company volume data) suggests that households may have gradually reduced consumption due to insufficient income growth.""
“The next (possibly same) government may have its task cut out to revive flagging economic growth. We believe a combination of (1) monetary stimulus and (2) structural reforms may help revive growth over time. The current slowdown may not be a mere cyclical one, as is generally believed,"" added Kotak.
Meanwhile, expensive valuations of most FMCG stocks show investors don’t seem to be factoring in the near-term demand slowdown concerns adequately. The Nifty FMCG index trades at 34 times one-year forward earnings, according to Bloomberg data. As far as the markets are concerned, FMCG stocks are still recession proof."
26,2019-05-07,Unilever,"After reporting strong volume growth over the past few quarters, the FMCG companies reported subdued numbers for January to March 2019A moderate rural demand, liquidity crisis in the market and the adverse impact of a delayed summer led to lower growth

New Delhi: A consumption slowdown dampened sales in the March quarter at some of India’s largest consumer goods firms, as a slow offtake of goods in rural markets and an elongated winter forced companies to report moderate volume growth.
India’s largest FMCG firm Hindustan Unilever Ltd., biscuits maker Britannia Industries Ltd., along with Dabur India Ltd., Marico Ltd and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd., announced their fourth-quarter earnings earlier this month. After reporting strong volume growth over the past few quarters, the companies reported subdued numbers for January to March 2019.
Top executives at these firms acknowledged that a moderate rural demand, liquidity crisis in the market and the adverse impact of a delayed summer led to lower growth.
India’s largest consumer goods firm, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) on Friday reported 7% volume growth for the quarter ahead of its peers, but this was its slowest growth in six quarters. Revenues at the maker of Lux soaps and Surf Excel detergent were up 9.3% to  ₹9,945 crore and its profit jumped by 13.8% to  ₹1,538 crore.
The company’s managing director and chairman Sanjiv Mehta said the company witnessed moderation in the general trade and wholesale channels. ""And if I look at it from the lens of geography, then moderation is more pronounced in rural markets,"" Mehta added. HUL, which has been seeing rural markets grow at a faster pace than urban markets, said “rural growth has come on the same level as urban,"" indicating a reversal of the trend.
Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL), which sells the popular Cinthol soap and Good Knight mosquito repellent, posted a mere 1% increase in domestic volumes; while its net profit was up 51% at  ₹935.24 crore during the quarter. “It has been a relatively weak quarter for us,"" Vivek Gambhir, MD and CEO, GCPL, told investors over a post-earnings call. “Our India business remained soft on account of a general slowdown in staples consumption, on liquidity pressure that we saw in the channel, and the adverse impact of the delayed summer for much of our portfolio, particularly soaps and household insecticides.""
These numbers come days after research and insights firm Nielsen had lowered its annual growth projection for India’s fast moving consumer goods market to 11-12% for 2019, a downward revision from its earlier projection of 13-14% after it observed a “significant softening of rural growth trends.""
The trend was visible across categories.
Biscuit maker Britannia reported a 7% jump in domestic volumes, largely in line with street expectations, while its profit for the quarter was up 11.82% at  ₹294.27 crore.
However, the maker of Good Day and NutriChoice biscuits said it had witnessed softening of consumer demand for its products over the last two quarters. “In the last two quarters, we've seen a certain slowdown in our overall growth… from September (ish) to this quarter, we are seeing a slowdown of about 5%, 500 basis points overall, in the categories that we operate in,"" the company's management said in an earnings call on 2 May. A large part of that slowdown is in rural markets, the management noted. Varun Berry, managing director, Britannia, added that while rural continues to outgrow urban, growth rates in both markets have come down from the levels that they were six months ago.
On Tuesday, Jyothy Laboratories, posted a 6.3% jump in volume for the fourth quarter. However, the company that sells Ujala fabric whitener and Margo soaps said that rural markets that contribute close to 35% of the company’s sales have decelerated in the last two quarters. As a result, consumers are downtrading to lower pack sizes, said Ullas Kamath, joint managing director, Jyothy Laboratories Ltd.
In the north, a delayed summer also hit sales at FMCG companies.
Dabur India Ltd, the maker of Real juices and Vatika hair oil, posted a 4.7% rise in consolidated revenue for the quarter at  ₹2,128.19 crore, with a 4.3% growth in domestic volume—its lowest in seven quarters."
25,2019-06-07,Unilever,"At an annual investor meet, the company said it has been harnessing data over the last few years to better predict, capture and fulfil consumer demandHUL said net sales more than doubled over the last decade to  ₹37,660 crore

New Delhi: India’s largest consumer goods firm Hindustan Unilever Ltd on Friday reiterated the use of technology and data at the company that will continue to help drive growth for the maker of Lux soaps and Knorr soups.
“With disruption becoming par for the course, we observe different retailer and distributor’s business models and a non-linear consumer journey. To be at the forefront of such a changing ecosystem, we continue to put a big thrust on leveraging technology and data-led decision-making,"" the company said at its annual investor meet presentation in Mumbai, on 7 June.
The company has been harnessing data over the last few years to better predict, capture and fulfil consumer demand, via augmented decision making, and automation. Some of these initiatives include connected store programs such as 'Humara Shop' that helps neighbourhood stores go online, and initiatives like 'Shikar' and 'Samadhan' that are apps designed for retailers for direct ordering and fulfilment. “Our connected stores program is now coming of age as we are creating a complete eco system across shoppers, stores and retailers covering demand generation, capture and fulfilment,"" the company said as part of its ‘Re-imagining HUL’ programme in the presentation. More recently, HUL also said it is working on developing niche digital skills in leaders and upgrading the digital skills footprint of employees across the organisation.
The meet, said Jefferies’ analyst Varun Lohchab, “highlighted the company's superior execution and lead over peers in terms of adoption of technology in a holistic way across the value chain right from gathering consumer insights, demand generation and fulfilment.""
In the presentation, Hindustan Unilever also outlined its business for the year, while top management gave a commentary on consumer demand in the market.
HUL said net sales more than doubled over the last decade to  ₹37,660 crore. It added that over the last six years, categories such as hair care, tea, coloured cosmetics, and laundry were ""outstanding performers"". Turnover of its hair care segment where the company owns brands such as Dove, Sunsilk, and Tresemme among others, nearly doubled between FY13 and FY19.
Apart from that, the company highlighted its future growth plan with its continued focus on its core portfolio that comprises of 40% to 45% of its business; and creating future categories by driving penetration in categories such as coffee, face wash, and hair conditioners.
The company also emphasised its focus on developing the naturals portfolio. The company’s naturals portfolio that comprises of brands such as Ayush Lever is growing twice of HUL's overall average, the company noted.
Interestingly, HUL that has over the last few years strengthened its presence in key categories of hair care and packaged foods via acquisitions of hair oil brand Indulekha, Adityaa ice cream, and its buyout of British company GSK's consumer business in India said it will continue to leverage M&A to expand its portfolio.
Speaking to analysts, the company's top management also gave an outlook on consumer demand in the market that has remained tepid over the past few quarters on the back of slowing rural demand.
The company expects softness in demand to continue in FY20. However, on the more recent government initiatives such as setting up new cabinet committees to drive growth and create jobs, the management added. ""The government initiatives clearly signify that the government is looking to focus on growth. In few quarters, one should see positive impact of the initiatives that are being taken,"" analyst Abneesh Roy, at brokerage firm Edelweiss, said in a note on the company’s analyst meet."
24,2019-06-10,Unilever,"HUL is firmly on track on its digital transformation strategy, much ahead of its peersCurrent slowdown in consumption could mean muted demand and this may weigh on volume growth

Analysts have come back feeling assured after attending Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s (HUL’s) annual investor meet on Friday. The management reiterated its Re-imagining HUL theme and strategy. Re-imagining HUL is the company’s digital transformation programme, which is broadly aimed at leveraging technology to evaluate and cater to consumer needs better.
“Overall, HUL’s strategy has remained consistent over the past 2-3 years. Execution of strategy keeps getting better and the company is firmly on track for digital transformation, much ahead of its competition,"" pointed out Kotak Institutional Equities.
Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd wrote in a report on 7 June, “The key theme for 2019 Investor day (like 2018) was the emphasis on the role of data and digital as the third biggest strength for the company after brands and people.""
HUL’s growth strategy includes focus on strengthening the core (around 40-45% of company’s business), create categories of the future and drive premiumization.
According to its presentation, the company has increased its Ebitda margin by 7.4 percentage points over the last 10 years to 23% in FY19. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Over FY13-FY19, the hair care, colour cosmetics, laundry and tea segments have performed well. These categories have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 11%, 15%, 10% and 10%, respectively. Market share gains have been robust in the hair care and tea segments.
But as analysts at Kotak say, there’s a lot to like in HUL, except valuations. Indeed, at the current market price of  ₹1,852.50, the stock trades at 56 times estimated earnings for FY20, based on Bloomberg data. These valuations suggest investors have great expectations from the future. While the company may end up performing well on revenue and margins, growth in margins can’t be expected to be spectacularly high off the current base. Indeed, HUL told analysts that margin expansion potential is lower vis-à-vis recent years.
Besides, the company isn’t immune from the vagaries of the economy. The recently concluded March quarter saw the economic slowdown rub off on its volume. HUL’s volume growth last quarter at 7% was the slowest in the past six quarters.
Of course, the ongoing consumption slowdown could well translate into muted demand for the company. Volume growth could be adversely impacted on account of muted rural demand and liquidity pressures in the trade channel.
True, investors will have to watch for the gains from the GSK Consumer Healthcare acquisition from a medium-term perspective. However, in the interim, given already stretched valuations and the uninspiring demand outlook, the case for meaningful upsides in HUL’s valuations is thin."
23,2019-06-18,Unilever,"The likelihood of a better-than-expected monsoon in the second half is also expected to shore up demandMumbai-based brokerage firm Edelweiss suggested that volumes at the consumer staples firms will see an uptick in the second half of FY20

India’s consumer goods majors will have to wait till the second half of the current financial year for a pick up in demand, benefiting from government measures to revive the rural economy and the likelihood of normal rains, said a report released on Monday.
The report by Mumbai-based brokerage firm Edelweiss suggested that volumes at the consumer staples firms will see an uptick in the second half of FY20.
“We estimate consumer staples’ volumes to perk up in H2 FY20 led by the NDA (National Democratic Alliance government) introducing stimuli to revive the rural economy; extension of the PM-Kisan scheme across farmers, as well as pension scheme for small traders to put money in the hands of consumers,"" Abneesh Roy, senior vice-president (research), Edelweiss Securities, said in the report
He added that the likelihood of a better-than-expected monsoon in the second half is also expected to shore up demand.
India is still gauging the impact of monsoons on which rural demand is largely hinged. The south west monsoon started late and was on a sluggish note earlier this month, but rains are expected to strengthen in August and September, according to the India Meteorological Department Edelweiss said that monsoon remains a key variable as forecasts so far have indicated the likelihood of El Nino in the first half of the monsoon season. “However, a strong second half may be able to compensate for the loss,"" the report added.
Volume growth in the first quarter of FY20 is likely to remain soft: “We estimate soft volume growth for most consumer goods companies in Q1 FY20....high base of Q1 FY19 will also play a role in the same,"" it noted.
The report said rural growth—that is still treading ahead of urban—is likely to further slow down before it accelerates again, slipping from 1.15 times urban growth to grow at par with urban markets. Across sectors, such as automobiles and consumer goods, companies have been reporting subdued demand. This was especially pronounced in the fourth quarter of FY19, as a slow offtake of goods in rural markets and a prolonged winter saw fast-moving consumer goods companies report moderate volume growth.
“Seasonal pangs, liquidity tightening and soft macros added fuel to fire, exacting toll on volume growth,"" the report added.
For the quarter ended 31 March, 2019, Hindustan Unilever, India’s largest consumer goods firm, reported 7% volume growth—ahead of its peers, but its lowest in six quarters. Godrej Consumer Products posted a mere 1% increase in domestic volumes, while Dabur India Ltd did slightly better at 4.3%.
Companies said they are waiting for a strong monsoon. Biscuit maker Parle Products said it will wait till the end of July to watch for any uptick in demand. “The trend of the slowdown will persist till the end of monsoon, once you have good rains then propensity to spend will increase,"" said Mayank Shah, category head, Parle Products, which draws over 50% of its sales from the hinterland.
The newly-formed NDA government is set to announce its first full budget on 5 July. “The immediate move will be to expand stimuli, especially in rural areas,"" the report said."

MUMBAI :
Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) said women will fill at least 50% of the managerial positions at India’s largest maker of household goods by 2022.
“We believe that our employees’ contributions are richer because of their diversity and we want to help them feel free to bring their authentic selves to work every day,"" Sanjiv Mehta, chairman and managing director at HUL, told shareholders during the company’s 86th annual general meeting held in Mumbai on 29 June.
HUL, through its Project Shakti programme, has nearly 110,000 women micro-entrepreneurs across 18 states boosting the distribution reach of the company’s brands. It provides livelihood opportunities to women in rural India where they are trained by Hindustan Unilever executives on sales and distribution.
The contribution of women to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) is 18%, according to a May 2018 study by McKinsey Global Institute. This is one of the lowest levels in the world.
Women account for only 25% of India’s labour force. More than 70% of the potential GDP opportunity comes from increasing women’s participation in the labour force by 10 percentage points, the report said.
The consumer goods company has also set up a digital council comprising a cross-functional team of leaders who are designing the agenda of ‘Reimagining HUL’ consisting of more than 80 experiments that are underway at present.
“By 2030, India will have a large cohort of ‘Generation Z’ consumers with ubiquitous internet, smartphones, and digital media. As they start earning, they will actively use technology-enabled consumption models and have a big influence on the consumption behaviour of their households,"" said Mehta.
Mehta, who took over the reins of HUL after Harish Manwani’s retirement last year, detailed the company’s five-pronged strategy that includes driving purpose into brands and enhancing societal impact, innovating for the future, building a future-fit organization, nurturing talent in the new age, and re-imagining its business across the value chain by leveraging data and technology.
“We now have a full-fledged end-to-end digital transformation programme for the business that will redefine the way we work. Our people data centre picks up real-time consumer signals and identifies business opportunities that are used as inputs to craft brilliant mixes,"" said Mehta.
More than nine out of 10 Indian households use one or more of HUL’s products, Mehta said, and maintained that the company is harnessing the power of data and artificial intelligence to understand potential trends, customized solutions, augment decision-making and build a feedback loop.
“Our internet of things (IoT) powered digital factories are helping us leverage installed capacities. Automated warehouses, robotics and guided vehicles are helping with stock accuracy, reducing truck loading time and raising the level of customer service,"" told shareholders."

Singapore/Mumbai: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Hindustan Unilever Ltd. are among at least 100 Indian companies that may need to sell shares worth billions of dollars after the government proposed to raise the minimum public shareholding.
Companies must increase shares held by the public to a minimum 35% from 25% at present, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her maiden budget, asking the market regulator to “mull"" the proposal.
The rule may result in equity sales of about  ₹3.9 trillion ($57 billion), creating a supply overhang on the market that’s trading near a life-time high, according to analysts including Centrum Broking Pvt. The proposal may have another side-effect: it could prompt domestic units of multinationals, who don’t rely on local funding, to delist from exchanges.
“The detail to watch out for is the time allowed to meet this new rule,"" said Rajiv Singh, who heads broking at Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. “This will mostly impact multinationals and state companies, but in the long term, it will help get more retail money in equities."" There are at least 40 state companies with public holding lower than 35%, he said.
Adequate liquidity
This isn’t the first time the government has forced founders to reduce their holdings to boost liquidity. In June 2010, the regulator gave companies three years to a ensure a minimum public float of at least 25%. That spurred share sales of at least $1 billion in June 2013 alone from companies including property developer DLF Ltd. and JSW Energy Ltd.
Exchanges globally have also introduced free-float rules to ensure liquidity for investors in a publicly traded stock. And index compilers such as MSCI Inc. take into account the percentage of shares available to investors when determining a stock’s representation in stock gauges.
“Timing and applicability need to be closely evaluated -- we don’t want this to be another forced sale,' said Vivek Gupta, partner and national head at KPMG in India.
Shares in Wipro Ltd. slumped 4.2%, the most since March 8. Coal India Ltd. slipped 3.7% and TCS ended 3.6% lower on Friday.

MUMBAI :
TVS Capital Funds on Tuesday announced the second close of  ₹1,100 crore for its third private equity fund, raised solely from domestic investors.
TVS Shriram Growth Fund 3, which is jointly sponsored by the TVS Group and the Shriram Group, has a target corpus of  ₹1,000 crore, with a green-shoe option of  ₹500 crore.
Of the green-shoe option, the fund got subscriptions worth  ₹100 crore and expected commitments worth another  ₹150 crore in the near future, it said. The fund had reached the first close of  ₹832 crore in October.
“We have remained pragmatic in selecting investments opportunities across stages, venture growth, classic growth with control investing wherever possible, and late stage growth. As markets have developed, early stage investments have ideally been replaced by venture growth, which is also a part of our strategy as we look to back experienced entrepreneurs,"" said Gopal Srinivasan, managing director and chairman, TVS Capital Funds.
“The fund would focus on sectors such as financial services, business services, and niche consumption segments,"" he said.
The fund, which was founded in 2007 by Srinivasan, a third generation entrepreneur from the TVS Group, was later joined by D. Sundaram, former vice-chairman and chief financial officer of Hindustan Unilever Ltd.
The latest fund raise pegs TVS Capital’s cumulative assets under management at  ₹1,664 crore, making it one of the larger managers of rupee denominated mid-market growth private equity capital in India. Most of its limited partners are Indian family offices, high net-worth individuals, and financial institutions and developmental financial institutions of the government.
“The sponsors and the sponsor group have committed about 20% of the target corpus. Similar commitments have been received from domestic financial institutions. Family offices have shown significant interest and an extremely positive response committing about  ₹700 crore in the fund,"" said Srinivasan.
So far, the third fund has already deployed 13% of its target corpus of  ₹ 1,000 crore with an investment of  ₹100 crore in LEAP India, a supply chain solutions provider to logistics firms, and  ₹30 crore in Mumbai-based Suryoday Small Finance Bank.
The PE firm raised its first fund of  ₹600 crore in 2009, followed by a second of  ₹600 crore in 2012. The firm has completely exited the investments made out of its first fund, but has reached the halfway mark on exits from the second fund.
From the second fund, it had made investments in the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd, Indian Energy Exchange Ltd, RBL Bank Ltd, City Union Bank Ltd, Wonderla Holidays Ltd, and Nykaa.com.
With four completed exits, the second fund has been able to return the entire original capital back to its investors, while making nearly six times returns in its most recent exit from Nykaa, a popular online and omnichannel beauty products platform.
“The second fund is on course to return a two times multiple on the invested capital to its clients partners. We aim to implement learnings from our second fund and build on the success of Fund 2 to make even better returns for our client partners,"" said Srinivasan."

New Delhi: Cigarettes to packaged consumer goods conglomerate ITC Ltd on Friday reiterated its plans to expand its fast-moving consumer goods business by adding newer segments under its portfolio and even looking at strategic acquisitions, the company said during its 108th annual general meeting in Kolkata.
“To accelerate growth in the FMCG businesses, the endeavour is not only to fortify the existing categories towards delivering industry leading performance but also to foray into newer categories and sub-segments. This would be supported by multi-dimensional investments as well as strategic opportunities for acquisitions,"" ITC’s Sanjiv Puri told shareholders during his maiden AGM address as the chairman of the company.
The move is in line with ITC’s efforts to reduce its dependence on the tobacco business riddled with excessive taxing and regulation, and instead build a large stable of consumer goods brands to compete with the likes of Hindustan Unilever, PepsiCo and Britannia.
For the year ended March 2019, ITC posted a net revenue of  ₹44,415 crore, with profit after tax of  ₹12,464 crore. For the same year, the revenue for its FMCG-others business, including branded packaged foods, personal care stationery products, lifestyle retailing, incense sticks and matches stood at  ₹12,505.28 crores.
To be sure ITC already sells packaged foods, personal care, and stationery under its consumer goods portfolio, spanning brands such as Aashirwad, Sunfeast biscuits, Yippie noodles, B Natural juices, Vivel soaps, Bingo chips and incense sticks. Last year, the company also forayed into dairy products. Over 50 products were launched last year to strengthen existing categories and enter newer segments, the company said.
“In the last two to three years, ITC has expanded its FMCG portfolio by foraying into new segments. This includes the luxury ‘Fabelle’ Chocolates collection, dairy & dairy beverages under the ‘Aashirvaad Svasti’ and ‘Sunfeast Wonderz’ brands, frozen foods from the ‘ITC Master Chef’ collection, skincare with the premium ‘Dermafique' among others.
As a result, newer FMCG businesses contribute 25% to ITC’s segment revenue; while EBITDA for the segment jumped over 50% to  ₹688 crore in FY19, the company said on Friday. Some of its key brands also achieved scale. In the last financial year, its packaged foods brand Aashirvaad touched  ₹4,500 crore in sales; Sunfeast is over Rs.3,800 crores; Bingo! became a  ₹2,500-crore brand.
The company, said Puri, is also scaling its manufacturing infrastructure, by “investing in building state-of-the-art manufacturing infrastructure across the country to rapidly scale up the FMCG businesses..."" This includes the creation of 20 Integrated Consumer Goods Manufacturing and Logistics (ICML) facilities that will aid the company with economies of scale, freshness and close-to-market distribution.
ITC’s consumer goods reach six million retail outlets today, a network it will continue to expand, according to Puri. “Substantive investments are being made in expanding this network and in developing alternate and emerging channels such as modern trade, on-the-go, food services, end-to-end cold chain, e-commerce and so on.""
ITC Ltd had earlier set a target of achieving  ₹100,000 crore in revenue from the sale of fast-moving consumer goods by 2030."

Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) on Tuesday reported a 15% increased in its June quarter net profit, driven by higher revenue and a fall in raw material cost. Total revenue from sale of products and domestic consumer business grew 7% in the reporting quarter.
Net profit for the quarter was at  ₹1,755 crore, up 14.9% from  ₹1,528 crore a year ago. A Bloomberg poll of 18 analysts estimated HUL’s net profit at  ₹1,715.80 crore, and revenue at  ₹10,170.90 crore.
Revenue from operations rose 6.7% year-on-year to Rs9,984 crore, while cost of materials consumed fell 6.5% from a year ago to  ₹3,161 crore.
Operating margin improved of 250 basis points. In absolute terms, EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) was rose 18% to  ₹2,647 crore in April-June.
The company said margin expansion was driven by improved mix, leverage in operating and advertising spends and savings agenda.
""HUL has delivered a resilient performance driven by expansion of our consumer franchise, improvement in portfolio mix and sustained growth in margins. Our focus on strengthening the core, leading market development & premiumisation, driving channel transformation and building brands with purpose, continues to serve us well,"" said Sanjiv Mehta, chairman and managing director HUL.
In the June quarter, growth was driven by its home-care portfolio which grew 10% on a comparable basis. The personal care and beauty portfolio and food and refreshment segments grew 5.6% on a comparable basis.
During the June quarter, the company's advertising and promotion spends rose a tad--0.7%--from a year ago.

16,2019-07-23,Unilever,"HUL’s volume growth moderated to 5%, suggesting that slowdown is the new normalCompany’s Ebitda margin was better than the Street’s expectations, but sustainability is key

Consumer staples company Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) was treading on a slippery slope in the June quarter. Underlying volume growth of 7% for the March quarter, a drop from the double-digit growth seen in the earlier five quarters, mirrored the consumption slowdown in the economy. Another quarter down the line, volume growth has further moderated to 5% for the June quarter, signalling that the slowdown is the new normal.
Plus, also do remember that volume growth in the base June 2018 quarter was high at 12%. As such then, June quarter volume growth is marginally lower than Street expectations and therefore, not shocking.
Here’s the interesting bit though. The company’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) performance was far better than expectations. Reported Ebitda margin increased as much as 250 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
According to HUL, on a comparable basis, after adjusting for the accounting impact of Indian Accounting Standard 116 on leases, Ebitda margins have expanded by 150 basis points to 26%. A better product mix, flattish advertising and promotion expenses year-on-year, and a decline in other operating expenses helped Ebitda performance.
The outcome: HUL’s reported Ebitda of  ₹2,647 crore came in ahead of Bloomberg’s consensus Ebitda of  ₹2,474 crore. Overall, profit before tax and exceptional items, increased by 13.5% to  ₹2,556 crore.
Within the beauty and personal care segment, performance of personal wash products was relatively muted during the June quarter. On the other hand, the home care, and foods and refreshment segments delivered a decent performance.
Going ahead, whether margins continue to improve or even sustain is the moot question. Investors will watch that closely in the coming days, considering the demand outlook remains little changed.
The company says near-term demand will remain subdued given the macroeconomic conditions. “In terms of market point of view, the rural market, which was growing ahead of urban, is growing at par with the urban market,"" the management pointed out at the press conference. To be sure, the company had highlighted this during the March quarter results as well.
The HUL stock’s performance on the bourses does show that investors have taken the consumption blues into cognizance. So far this calendar year, the stock has declined by 7%. On the contrary, the Nifty 100 index has increased by nearly 3%.
Nonetheless, HUL’s valuations remain pricey. Currently, the stock trades at 51 times estimated earnings for FY20. Even so, from a near-term perspective, it is possible that margin performance may keep sentiments upbeat for the stock.
Plus, the company also seems to be benefiting from the so-called TINA (there is no alternative) factor, thanks to the lack of decent alternatives in the Indian market. As such then, sentiments for the HUL stock could well remain resilient."
18,2019-07-23,Unilever,"Analysts are expecting Ebitda margin to expand about 50-100 bps on a year-on-year basisIt’s worth noting that expectations are running low with the Street looking at a further moderation in volume growth

Mumbai: When consumer staples giant, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) announced its March quarter results on 3 May, its volume growth had dropped to a six-quarter low. Another quarter down the line, investors will keep a close eye on the volume growth. It’s worth noting that expectations are running low with the Street looking at a further moderation in volume growth.
“We expect HUL's volume growth to moderate further to about 5-6% from 7% last quarter,"" said analysts from Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in a report on 3 July. Kotak Institutional Equities estimates HUL’s underlying volume growth at 6% for the June quarter.
Interestingly, Dabur India Ltd’s volume growth showed a remarkable improved to 9.6% for the June quarter. In the March quarter, the same parameter for Dabur was at a subdued 4%. Needless to say, as far as HUL goes, any beat on the volume front will cheer investors.
As always, management commentary on demand conditions remain of primary importance, especially the rural consumption outlook. While announcing the March quarter results, HUL had said, rural demand, which outran demand growth of urban areas, was slowing to grow at a similar pace as urban regions.
Further, according to Credit Suisse, the soaps category is likely to be the drag for HUL, while home care is still likely to lead growth. In general, analysts are expecting earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margin to expand about 50-100 basis points on a year-on-year basis. One basis points is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
A Bloomberg poll of analysts has pegged HUL’s June quarter revenues at about  ₹10,171 crore and net profit at  ₹1,716 crore. This represents about 9% and 12% improvement in revenues and net profit, respectively, on a year-on-year basis.
So far this calendar year, the HUL stock has declined by 7.5%. Despite that, the shares trade at a pricey 51 times estimated earnings for financial year 2020."

Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), India’s largest listed consumer packaged goods firm by sales, saw a further slowdown in its volume growth in the June quarter, because of weak consumption, particularly in rural areas.
HUL saw its net profit, driven by higher revenue and a fall in raw material cost, jump by 15% to  ₹1,755 crore.
However, volume growth hit a seven-quarter low at 5% in the June quarter.
In the previous quarter, HUL had registered volume growth of 7%.
The company’s revenue from operations rose 6.6% year-on-year to  ₹10,114 crore, while the cost of material consumed fell 6.5% from a year ago to  ₹3,161 crore.
Its domestic consumer growth improved by 7%. Though volumes continued to fall, margins improved by 150 basis points on the back of improved operating and advertising spends.
Its advertising and promotions rose by just 0.7% from the year-ago period.
“Volume is likely to remain subdued in the short-term. We expect demand to be soft in the coming months as well. While consumption in the rural areas is growing, it is not growing as fast as it should be,"" Sanjiv Mehta, chairman and managing director, HUL, said at a press conference.
HUL has delivered a “resilient performance driven by expansion franchise, improvement in portfolio mix and sustained growth in margins"", despite the overall slowdown in the market, said Mehta.
Growth during the reporting period was primarily driven by its home-care portfolio, which grew 10% on a comparable basis.
The personal care and beauty portfolio and the food and refreshment segments, grew 5.6% on a comparable basis. However, its personal wash segment witnessed muted demand, while its home-care segment recorded double-digit growth.
“We believe the second half of the year would be better than the first half. The measures introduced by the government in the Union budget will take some time to translate into results,"" Mehta said.
The company also announced that it has received approval from its shareholders and creditors for the proposed merger with GSK Consumer Healthcare. Subject to approvals from the National Company Law Tribunal, the integration is likely to be completed by the end of 2019.
“We do not operate from quarter to quarter. We work on a long-term plan. We have robust a pipeline and we will continue to launch and relaunch our brands,"" Mehta said.
In the June quarter, Pond’s Men range of facial cleansers and moisturisers and FAL Ayurveda face-wash and facial kits were launched.
“Because of the liquidity issue, overall consumption has been under pressure. There has been a slowdown across all categories in the fast moving consumer goods industry. Given the slow pace of demand in the rural sector, maintaining a volume growth of even 5-6% would be tougher in the coming months,"" said an analyst who did not want to be identified."

MUMBAI :
Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) will soon hire distributors to sell private-label brands owned by its retail unit through neighbourhood stores, as billionaire Mukesh Ambani aims to boost the contribution of the company’s consumer business, two people aware of the development said.
RIL will sell its store brands across categories such as staples, food, home and personal care and general merchandise, the people said on condition of anonymity. RIL sells these products through its retail stores under brand names such as Best Farms, Good Life, Masti Oye, Kaffe, Enzo, Mopz, Expelz and Home One.
Ambani, India’s richest man, wants to reduce the company’s reliance on the energy business. He expects the consumer businesses to contribute nearly as much to RIL’s overall earnings as the energy and refining businesses by 2025. As part of this strategy, RIL is taking on online retailers such as Amazon and Flipkart in the e-commerce segment and the likes of Hindustan Unilever Ltd and ITC Ltd in the offline segment.
“RIL is planning to appoint FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) distributors on a trial basis,"" said one of the two people cited above.
“A network of FMCG dealers will help RIL meet the logistics and delivery needs from online channels,"" said the second person cited above. RIL did not respond to an email sent on Friday.
After its fiscal first-quarter earnings on 19 July, RIL executives told investors that the company’s telecom arm, Jio, is likely to roll out its new commerce/kirana initiative and the fibre-to-the-home business this fiscal.
According to the people cited above, the commercial launch of these services is scheduled at the company’s annual general meeting on 12 August.
In the past, RIL has often chosen its annual meetings to make strategic announcements and release new products. While the JioPhone was launched at the 2017 AGM, 2018 saw the launch of JioPhone 2 and the unveiling of JioGigaFiber.
In April, Reliance Retail began testing its food and grocery app among a select group of users, largely comprising its employees. The company has also on-boarded local kirana stores in metro cities to receive orders from customers.
Reliance Retail operates neighbourhood stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets, wholesale, specialty and online stores. RIL has also initiated a pilot for assisted e-commerce at Jio Stores wherein store staff will take orders and the customer can collect/return orders from a Jio Store, RIL told analysts in a presentation on 19 July.
For its e-commerce venture, RIL has signed up local merchants offering them an O2O (online-to-offline) marketplace, a business model pioneered by the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Under the O2O model, a consumer searches for the product or services online but buys it through an offline channel.
RIL plans to consolidate merchants under an e-commerce platform. The merchants, in turn, will cater to the demand. This will help the company save costs and enter areas currently outside the traditional purview of e-commerce companies."

MUMBAI :
The last time Hindustan Unilever (HUL) launched a new detergent was 32 years ago, when its market-leading brand Surf was unseated by low-cost rival Nirma. Now it’s ready with another, this time in the premium segment.
HUL, India’s largest packaged goods firm by sales, is set to roll out detergent brand ‘Love & Care’, a new India-focused product, a top company executive said. It will be launched across top 30 cities in India this week. The new brand is created for washing premium fabrics like silk, fine cottons and chiffon among others, and would be positioned in the premium category, Priya Nair, executive director, HUL said.
The new launch is also part of the company’s ongoing ‘premiumization’ strategy in the laundry category that already has brands such as Wheel, Surf, Sunlight, Rin and Comfort. HUL’s last new detergent product was Wheel to take on Nirma.
“We have delivered both volume-led and profitable growth (detergent business). We are well-placed in the country with the kind of portfolio we have. Therefore, our focus now is how do we create a new segment that caters to consumer needs. The launch of Love & Care expert fabric care is one part of the strategy to continue to drive premium brands,"" Nair said in an interview. HUL’s other detergent brands are Rin, Surf Excel and Sunlight.
Home care—comprising detergents and household care products like Domex and Vim—is HUL’s second-largest business segment, generating around 35% of its overall sales. In the quarter ended 30 June, the home care business posted 10% sales growth.
India’s laundry care market continues to be dominated by HUL and rival Procter & Gamble, despite stiff competition from regional and local FMCG firms. HUL is the market leader in the laundry care segment and its three brands - Surf Excel, Rin and Wheel—each generate sales of over  ₹1,000 crore, according to data provided by the company.
However, in the lower end of the market, local brands such as Ghari, owned by Rohit Surfactants Ltd, has remained a dominant player. This year, Future Retail introduced an affordable liquid detergent brand Voom with an eye to take on HUL and P&G in the low-end segment.
Targeted at affluent Indians, Love & Care will be available at modern retail outlets and on e-commerce platforms. The company has already roped in fashion designer Manish Malhotra as the brand ambassador.
“We are continuously looking at how we can evolve our portfolio. India has immense potential for the laundry category and is still an underdeveloped market. So, the opportunity is quite substantial. We will keep innovating as we see emerging consumer needs,"" Nair said."
11,2019-08-27,Unilever,"For some packs, the price cuts are as steep as 20-30%HUL has reduced prices in the range of 4-6% for Lux and Lifebuoy soaps

New Delhi: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) has cut prices of its Lux, Lifebuoy and Dove soaps in the past month, passing on the benefit of cheaper inputs, as India’s largest consumer goods company aims to win customers amid stiff competition and weak demand.
“HUL does selective and judicious price changes across its portfolio in the normal course of its business. Given that the commodity prices are expected to remain benign for a certain time period, we have taken price reductions in the range of 4% to 6% in Lux and Lifebuoy portfolio, while it may be higher on certain packs in order to pass on the benefits to the consumers,"" a company spokesperson said on Tuesday.
For some packs, the price cuts are as steep as 20-30%.
Lifebuoy and Lux are among the highest selling soap brands in India’s  ₹20,960 crore toilet soap market, according to research firm Euromonitor, and contribute significantly to HUL’s beauty and personal care segments. Lifebuoy is India’s biggest selling soap brand in terms of household penetration, according to researcher Kantar.
Within personal care, soaps are the biggest category, which means the bulk of Indian households buy them. However, despite its market leadership, the maker of Dove, Pears, Ayush and Lux soaps faces stiff competition from rivals including Godrej Consumer Products Ltd, Wipro Consumer Care and ITC Ltd.
In a conference call with investors after its quarterly earnings announcement last month, the company’s top management indicated that price reductions were underway in its soaps portfolio, as it sought to pass on the right value equation to shoppers, expecting commodity prices to remain weak.
“I talked about looking at the future outlook of commodities and, given the budget changes, we have taken certain decisive actions from a pricing point of view. You will see that in July, both in Lux and Lifebuoy,"" Srinivas Phatak, chief financial officer and executive director (finance and information technology) at HUL said in an earnings call in July. “We have taken price reductions across the board in the range of about 4% to 6%, whereas in the case of certain packs, you will also see a steep reduction in price.""
Beauty and personal care segment that comprises personal wash, skin care, hair care, oral care, colour cosmetics and deodorants contributed 46% to overall revenue, according to HUL’s 2018-19 annual report.
Intensifying competition, the current demand environment and low costs have prompted these changes, an analyst at a brokerage firm said. “Lifebouy and Lux are witnessing stiff competitive intensity in terms of market share loss in a benign commodity environment,"" HDFC Securities analyst Naveen Trivedi wrote in a note last month.
Trivedi added that this has prompted the company to slash prices and rework strategy for the two brands that could launch new products in the near term.
During the quarter ended 30 June , the company rolled out Lux Botanicals and Pears Naturale nationwide, in line with the popularity of the naturals category among shoppers.
HUL’s soap price cut comes at a time when demand for packaged consumer goods remains subdued.
In its April-June update, research firm Nielsen noted that non-food categories such as salty snacks, biscuits, spices, toilet soaps and packaged tea led the slowdown during the quarter.
HUL has been witnessing modest demand in its beauty and personal care segment too.
The company said that in the June quarter, sales in its beauty and personal care portfolio grew at a modest 4%, trailing growth in other segments such as foods and refreshments, and home care. “Within beauty and personal care, personal products’ performance was steady, while personal wash witnessed a muted delivery, particularly in the popular segment,"" said the company.
In personal wash, the demand for the popular segment was soft, while that for premium brands remained steady, HUL said in its investor presentation for the quarter.
Edelweiss analyst Abneesh Roy noted that HUL’s move is “the right strategy in our view, considering soaps volumes are soft and palm oil prices continues to remain lower on year-on-year basis, although have picked up lately"".
The move will help HUL gain market share from unorganized and some of the smaller players, Roy said on Tuesday.
Interestingly, even as the company cut prices of soaps, it increased prices of face washes by 4-14% across Pears, Dove, Ponds and Fair & Lovely brands in July, according to a 27 August report by Kotak Institutional Equities."
10,2019-09-17,Unilever,"CII will ask the government to consult industry executives and define what will be categorized as single-use plasticsA nationwide ban on plastic bags, cups, small bottles, straws is expected next month as part of PM Modi's efforts to reduce use of pollution-causing, single-use plastic

NEW DELHI :
Companies in India will seek exemptions from the government's planned ban on certain plastic items, fearing the move will disrupt supply chains and raise costs ahead of a festive season, according to sources and an industry document seen by Reuters.
India is likely to impose a nationwide ban on plastic bags, cups, small bottles, straws and some types of sachets next month as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to reduce use of pollution-causing, single-use plastic.
But the plans have stoked fears among consumer firms, which, use plastic in packaging for everything from sodas and biscuits to ketchup and shampoo.
""This has created an existential issue for multiple sectors,"" said the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), a lobby group, in a two-page draft note, seen by Reuters, which is likely to be finalised and sent to the government in the coming days.
The CII will ask the government to consult industry executives and define what will be categorized as single-use plastics, while also pitching for some exemptions, according to the note.
It says small-sized plastic bottles used for pharmaceutical or health products should be exempted as there is no alternate available. Sachets made from so-called multi-layered packaging should also not be banned, as that could disrupt supplies of key products such as biscuits, salt and milk, the CII draft says.
A senior Indian government official said several industry representations were being reviewed, but the aim was to ""get rid of the menace of plastic pollution"" without causing disruption.
In an Independence Day speech on Aug. 15, Modi urged people and government agencies to ""take the first big step"" on Oct. 2 towards freeing India of single-use plastic.
India lacks a system for management of plastic waste, but environmentalists have hailed Modi's move, saying it will help combat plastic waste that chokes rivers and drains.
A ban on certain plastics from Oct. 2, however, will come just weeks ahead of big Hindu festivals for which business plans are laid out far in advance because they typically see a sharp rise in consumer purchases.
Two industry sources said Amazon.com Inc, which uses plastics in its packaging, has been concerned that a possible ban could disrupt its operations ahead of festivities, and during its mega annual discount sale that starts Sept. 29.
In recent weeks, executives from Coca-Cola Co, PepsiCo and consumer goods seller Hindustan Unilever have been part of industry delegations that met government officials to express concerns and discuss alternate packaging solutions, according to a person with direct knowledge.
Coca-Cola said in a statement that all its primary packaging does not consist of single-use plastic. Pepsi said its target was to make 100 percent of its packaging recyclable, compostable, or biodegradable by 2025. Hindustan Unilever did not respond to a request for comment.
Amazon did not respond, but has previously said that it plans to replace single-use plastic in its packaging by June 2020.
""The ban has ramifications for all sectors like food processing, dairy, garments, toys,"" said Jayesh Rambhia of All India Plastic Manufacturers Association, which has 22,000 companies as members. ""People, and companies, are pulling their hair today."""
9,2019-10-07,Unilever,"A combination of stagnating incomes, dearth of jobs and erratic rainfall has hurt low-income rural householdsBoth Godrej and Dabur said they are focusing on regional markets with specific ad campaigns to attract shoppers

New Delhi: It’s been months since Phool Bai, the wife of a daily wager from Nateran village in Madhya Pradesh’s Vidisha district, last purchased toothpaste. The shop from which she purchases her monthly household supplies has stopped selling goods to her family on credit over past dues, forcing her to cut down to the bare essentials.
In India’s rural hinterland, Phool Bai’s story isn’t unique. Thousands of vulnerable low-income households are falling back into extreme poverty. They are at the heart of a rural demand slump witnessed by packaged consumer goods makers. India’s villages account for more than 35% of overall FMCG sales.
A combination of stagnating rural incomes over the past two years, dearth of jobs in villages and erratic rainfall has hurt rural households that are mostly dependent on farm income for survival.
“From biscuits to chips to mosquito repellents, retailers are reporting lower sales and are unwilling to stock up,"" says Aaveg Jain, a distributor for companies such as ITC Ltd, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd, Himalaya, and L’Oreal in the Ganj Basoda town of Vidisha. Daily orders have steadily declined and the fall is most significant for premium products, “basically anything which costs over  ₹10 per packet,"" Jain said.
FMCG companies corroborate his claim. Rural consumers are picking smaller sized packs of detergent bars, hair oils, and washing powders and going easy on buying staples and household goods such as biscuits, cooking oil, soaps and atta, research firm Kantar said in a July report, adding that they were rationing on such items. A liquidity crunch in the market is also forcing traders and stockists to seek longer credit periods.
Jyothy Laboratories Ltd, the maker of Henko and Mr White detergent and Margo soap, said it has ramped up production of smaller pack sizes of its dishwashing bars and detergent powders for rural markets. “Over the last three quarters we have already moved to the smaller stock keeping units— ₹10 is selling faster than  ₹100,"" said Ullas Kamath, managing director at the company, adding that cash-strapped consumers are moving to weekly rather than1 monthly pack sizes of detergents and soaps. “Consumers, in rural, are buying only as much as is required,"" he said.
Vivek Gambhir, MD at Godrej Consumer, agrees. “If shoppers were buying five soaps earlier they are managing with 4.5 soaps now,"" he said. The company makes the popular Godrej No.1 and Cinthol soaps.
Over the past two quarters, Dabur India Ltd, too, has rolled out smaller pack sizes of  ₹10 across its range of oral care, hair oils and juices and even expanded direct distribution in villages in India to counter consumption slowdown and stimulate demand.
“Our rural business actually grew by around 13% in the last quarter on back of a lot of initiatives that we had taken to increase our rural reach and also launch a lot of accessible price points, which has done well for us and the strategy has given us dividends going forward,"" CEO Mohit Malhotra said in the June quarter earnings call. Dabur sells brands such as Babool toothpatse and Vatika hair oil and draws 45% of its business from the hinterland.
In an effort to push sales, companies are resorting to micro-marketing. Both Godrej and Dabur said they are focusing on regional markets with specific ad campaigns to attract shoppers. In the last two quarters, Dabur has rolled out advertisements in south India featuring local celebrities to promote its hair oil brands.
In August, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, India’s largest consumer goods maker, slashed prices of soap brands Lifebuoy and Lux by 4-6%, prompted by benign commodity costs and cooling demand.
Companies such as Wipro Consumer Care & Lighting and Godrej are pushing promotions on toilet soaps too.
“Consumers are definitely down trading. They are continuously looking for offers and discounts and we are also seeing trends that consumers are moving to some cheaper, localised brands,"" said Mohan Goenka, director of Emami Ltd that sells Navratna oil and Zandu balm, adding that the slowdown was happening across urban and rural markets but was more pronounced in rural ones.
“The biggest pinch is happening on Fair & Handsome cream which is a discretionary product and not something important in their life; while cooling oil brand Navratna continues to do well in rural markets,"" said Goenka.
Research firm Kantar, which tracks household consumption of fast-moving consumer goods, observed that shoppers are stretching their purchases for longer. “When there is a tight situation, people don’t stop consuming. They stretch what they have a little bit more,"" said K. Ramakrishnan, managing director, Worldpanel Division, South Asia, Kantar.
In the last few years, rural markets were growing 3-5 percentage points faster than urban markets for FMCG companies on account of increasing affordability and availability, Nielsen said in a quarterly demand forecast in July.
However, in its last monthly update on the sector, it noted that growth in rural markets was slowing down at double the rate of urban; this has brought rural growth closer to urban growth in the second quarter of the current year."

Mumbai: Macro-economic inflation data along with the second quarter financial results are expected to turn the Indian equity markets volatile during the coming week.
The Indian rupee's movement against the US dollar in the backdrop of Brexit and impact of rising geo-political tensions in the Middle East and its effect on crude oil prices may also affect the investor sentiments.
Hindustan Unilever, ACC, Multi Commodity Exchange of India, Wipro, Mindtree, Cyient, TVS Motor, Ambuja Cements, Reliance Industries and several others are likely to announce their Q2 earnings results during the week, starting 14 October.
""Developments over the missile strike on Iranian tanker, Narendra Modi-Xi Jinping summit in Chennai and Brexit issue will sway the investor sentiments,"" said Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.
""Over the next few days, few heavyweights will be announcing results, which could keep the markets volatile,"" Khemka said.
According to Vinod Nair, Geojit Financial Services' Research Head, the preview analysis of Q2 result is muted due to no real increase in demand and prices, which may impact the market performance during the month.
""The August IIP data, which declined to — 1.1%, indicates that the risk of slowdown is likely to reflect in Q2 corporate earnings,"" Nair said.
On Friday, official data showed that contraction in manufacturing activity slowed India's factory output growth to (-)1.1% in August from a 4.6% rise reported in July.
The growth has hit the 81-month low.
""The markets will react to the poor August IIP number,"" said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities. Release of RBI MPC minutes and China Q3 GDP number, both due on October 18, would also be watched closely, Jasani said.
Macro-economic data point of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for September will be released on 14 October. The balance of trade data for September will also be released during the week.
""Dismal IIP numbers suggest pressure on the rupee and more rate cuts coming,"" said Sajal Gupta, Head, Forex and Rates, Edelweiss Securities. The rupee might appreciate a bit within an expected range of 70.60 to 71.30, Gupta added.
On technical charts, the NSE Nifty50 remains in an immediate uptrend. ""The Nifty holding above the 50-day SMA and bouncing back this week, the bulls do seem to have an upper hand, at least for the short term,"" Jasani said.
""Further upsides are likely once the immediate resistance of 11,363 is taken out. Crucial supports to watch for resumption of weakness is now at 11,158,"" he said."
7,2019-10-13,Unilever,"Weakness in sentiment, stress in agriculture segment have continued to affect rural demand, say analystsHUL may witness tepid growth in sales volume in Q2 amid subdued demand in the rural markets

Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), India’s largest listed consumer packaged goods company by sales, may witness tepid growth in sales volume in the fiscal second quarter amid continued subdued demand in the rural markets.
Volume growth at HUL, which makes Surf Excel detergents and Ponds personal care items among others, has slowed in the past seven quarters. Sales volume grew 5% in the June quarter even as net profit rose 15% to  ₹1,755 crore.
The company is scheduled to announce its September quarter earnings on Monday.
“As rural growth falls behind urban, volume (growth of HUL) is likely to decelerate to around 4%,"" SBICap Securities Ltd said in a report.
“Weakness in sentiment and stress in agriculture segment have continued to affect rural offtake,"" it said.
However, it also pointed out that even though demand remains weak, it is not at “an alarming rate.""
According to the report, HUL’s premium portfolio has also seen deceleration but fared relatively better and continues to maintain or grow its share.
Consumer firms in India have been reeling under weak market sentiment, aggravated by a slump in demand in rural areas, a liquidity crunch and irregular monsoons in vast swathes of the country.
“We expect HUL’s revenue to grow 7% on a year-on-year to  ₹9,880 crore, with underlying domestic volume growth of 6% in the second quarter of financial year 2019-2020,"" said Krishnan Sambamoorthy, vice-president (institutional research and consumer sector), Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd in a report.
The report attributed the overall slowdown to the ongoing liquidity concerns, succession of drought and floods during the monsoon season in large parts of the country, and muted initial response to the festive season.
According to analysts, recent incentives by the Union government including capital infusion in state-run banks to tide over the current liquidity issue as well as lowering of corporate tax rates will begin to show a positive impact in the coming quarters.
“We are not assuming any benefits of the corporate tax reduction in 2QFY20 as many companies would have paid advance tax,"" Sambamoorthy said. Edelweiss Research estimates HUL’s volume growth to slip to 3% in the September quarter. “Second quarter of financial year 2019-2020 is likely to mark the slowest volume growth for consumer goods companies since the first quarter of 2017-2018 which was impacted by GST (goods and consumer tax)-related destocking,"" Edelweiss said in a report.
Mint reported on 9 October that FMCG firms are expected to record another tepid quarter of volume growth as they continue to face headwinds both in rural and urban markets.
On an average, analysts expect packaged consumer goods firms to register revenue growth between 6.4% and 9.3% while recording volume growth between 3% and 6%, according to estimates by several brokerage firms, the report said."
6,2019-10-15,Unilever,"That things have not deteriorated on the volume front should bring relief to investorsOn the flip side, HUL has said that rural market growth is now only 0.5 times that of the urban one

When Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) announced its March quarter results, its underlying volume growth had dropped to a six-quarter low of 7%. This measure worsened to 5% in the June quarter, in keeping with the slowdown the economy is going through. For the September quarter, volume growth has stayed steady at 5%.
The fact that things have not progressively deteriorated on the volume front should bring relief to investors. Moreover, HUL’s volume growth in the year-ago quarter was in double digits at 10%, which means the 5% growth last quarter came off a fairly high base.
HUL’s results come at a time when consumer firms are showing some pain in the numbers. For instance, Avenue Supermarts Ltd, which runs the DMart supermarket chain, saw below-expected revenue growth.
“Bajaj Consumer Care Ltd reported flat volume growth on a flat base. HUL’s 5% volume growth versus our 3% expectation is a decent performance, given the current broad-based slowdown,"" said Abneesh Roy, executive vice president (research) at Edelweiss Securities Ltd.
Of course, some analysts were expecting growth rates to stabilize after the drop in the preceding two quarters. “Companies that saw growth moderation in the June quarter (such as HUL, ITC and Britannia) will likely report a stable quarter whereas companies like Dabur that delivered robust growth in 1QFY20 will likely see growth taper a bit,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities had said in a preview note.
Overall, HUL’s September quarter revenue growth came in at 6.7% over the same period last year to  ₹9,852 crore, broadly in line with Street expectations. The home care business, which accounted for 34% of total revenues, put up a good show, registering a revenue growth of 9.4% year-on-year. This was helped by consistent growth in the fabric wash category. Foods and refreshment segment revenues increased by 8.4%, while the beauty and personal care segment saw revenue growth of 5.3%.
Yet again, HUL’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin expanded. On a comparable basis, Ebitda margin increased by 200 basis points after adjusting for accounting impact of Ind AS 116. According to the company, margin expansion was driven by improved mix, benign commodity price movement in large segments and HUL’s savings agenda. “Margin expansion, however, would sustain given a benign raw materials basket as well as cost-savings programme,"" said Roy of Edelweiss.
On the flip side, HUL has said that the rural market growth is now only 0.5 times that of the urban one. At the time of announcing its March quarter results, the company had said that rural demand, which had earlier outrun demand growth of urban areas, was slowing to grow at a similar pace as urban regions.
Apart from the slowdown in rural demand, valuations are also demanding. At  ₹2,014, the HUL stock trades at about 51 times estimated earnings for FY21, based on Bloomberg data."

New Delhi: State Bank of India on Monday re-entered the elite club of top-10 most valued domestic firms by market valuation after a gap of two weeks.
The bank had on October 1 lost its spot to Bajaj Finance in the coveted club of top-10 most valued domestic companies.
Bajaj Finance had replaced SBI as the 10th most valued firm then.
At close of trade on Monday, SBI's market capitalisation (m-cap) was at  ₹2,27,979.20 crore, which is  ₹2,899.12 crore more than that of Bajaj Finance  ₹2,25,080.08 crore valuation on the BSE.

4,2019-10-16,Unilever,"Rising affluence among households key to Unilever’s growth in the country, says chairman of local unitFor Unilever, India is the largest market in volume terms and the second largest in value terms

New Delhi: India could become the largest market for Unilever as affluent Indian households, a young population, and improved retail penetration drive consumption, said Sanjiv Mehta, chairman and managing director of Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), the local unit of the Anglo-Dutch company.
“For Unilever, India is the largest market in volume terms and the second largest in value terms. We clearly see a day when we would become the largest market for Unilever in the world,"" Mehta said at an industry event in New Delhi on Wednesday.
Mehta said the company is betting on India’s changing consumption pattern as more low-income or poor families manage to escape their circumstances and move up the income scale, fuelling consumption of products ranging from soaps to packaged foods. Rising affluence is key to Unilever’s growth in India, he said.
India is still a large value market with a large number of households still spending on low-priced products such as  ₹5-10 packets of biscuits and sachets of shampoos.
“The big inflection point happens when a large chunk of people move from the bottom of the pyramid to the lower middle class and from the middle class to the upper end of the middle class. Today one in four...could be termed as upper middle class and above but by 2030 we clearly see one in two being in that area,"" he said.
India is also a large general trade market, which means that households still visit local stores to buy their daily needs.
“In India, we have 10 million stores, so for 100 million people food on the table depends on kirana or neighbourhood stores. We cannot afford to let them bypass us. Today technology allows us to connect them and bring the science of retail to them,"" Mehta said.
HUL has been harnessing data over the past few years to better predict, capture, and fulfil consumer demand. Some of these initiatives include programmes such as ‘Humarashop’, an e-commerce platform that helps neighbourhood kirana stores to sell their products online.
The maker of Lux soaps and Kissan jams and ketchup is the country’s largest packaged consumer goods firm. For the year ended 31 March, HUL generated sales of  ₹38,224 crore.
Mehta’s statement on Wednesday reiterates former Unilever chief executive Paul Polman’s comments on the Indian market. In 2017, Polman said India could well be on track to become the company’s largest market. Polman, however, did not specify a timeline.
Interestingly, Mehta’s comments come at a time when Indian households are shying away from spending on everything from cars to biscuits amid a general slump in demand. This has hurt packaged consumer goods makers.
HUL, which reported its September quarter earnings earlier this week, said it has not seen an uptick in demand.
For the September quarter, HUL’s revenue rose 6.7% to  ₹9,852 crore from a year earlier. Sales volume rose just 5% in the period as demand cooled, especially in rural India. “On an overall market basis, the slowdown has happened more in rural areas than in urban. During good times, rural growth used to be 1-1.5 times the urban in the last four-five years. Now it has come down to half of the urban growth,"" he said.
Despite the challenging market environment, HUL has delivered a resilient performance and sustained margin improvement, Mehta said, adding that the near-term outlook for demand in rural India continues to remain challenging.

2,2019-12-04,Unilever,"Currently, e-commerce contributes 2% or $1.2 billion to the overall sales of FMCGNielsen sees e-commerce’s contribution to sales growing on the back of growing smartphone penetration, increased data consumption, and efforts by large companies to make their products available online

NEW DELHI :
Sales of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) on the internet are expected to touch $4 billion by 2022, contributing 5% to overall sales of packaged consumer goods sold in the country, market researcher Nielsen said on Wednesday.
Currently, e-commerce contributes 2% or $1.2 billion to the overall sales of FMCG.
Nielsen sees e-commerce’s contribution to sales growing on the back of growing smartphone penetration, increased data consumption, and efforts by large companies to make their products available online.
Interestingly, the contribution of modern trade to FMCG sales will reach 10% by 2022, growing incrementally from the current 9%, Nielsen noted comparing the two sales channels. During the same period the share of traditional trade is set to shrink to 85% from the current 89%.
The uptick in FMCG sales online has led the research firm to start tracking sales of such goods on the internet, as increasingly more companies such as Hindustan Unilever, Dabur India Ltd, Nestle India, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd., among others, have set up teams to sell their brands online.
“India’s FMCG industry is now making its presence felt in the e-comm channel - appealing to consumers’ need for convenience, and in sync with increasing smartphone and internet penetration,"" said Prasun Basu, South Asia Zone President, Nielsen Global Connect. “Nielsen India has launched a specific E-Trak index that will now measure FMCG consumer offtake in the e-comm space to give a complete picture of the changing marketplace"", he said. This will help manufacturers and marketers get data, information and insights that can be further used to hone their e-commerce channel sales strategy.
For now, Nielsen will track sales of 11 FMCG categories online in the top metros. These include refined oils , biscuits, packaged atta, vermicelli and noodles, spices, iodised salt, salty snacks, washing powder, packaged tea, toothpaste and utensil cleaners.
In its preliminary research on the market, Nielsen noted that online shoppers in the country’s top metros were showing higher instances of online shopping making 6% of all FMCG purchases through e-commerce. Amongst these, foods is the biggest contributor with 44%, followed by personal care (40%) and household care (13%).
In its September quarter earnings call, Mohit Malhotra, chief executive officer at New-Delhi based Dabur India Ltd said that e-commerce posted a growth of greater than 63%, taking its overall contribution to sales to 2.2% for the maker of Vatika hair oil and Real Juices. Earlier this year the company also rolled out a range of children’s hair care products only available online.
Last year, the local arm of Swiss packaged goods company Nestle India, launched its breakfast cereals online first. In fact, its popular Maggi brand was relaunched on Snapdeal in 2015 when the crisis-hit brand made a comeback.
However, Nielsen said that e-commerce is currently being used as an additional channel and not cannibalising other channels. “All channels continue to grow, buying behaviour differs across channels,"" the report added."
1,2019-12-16,Unilever,"Some of the FMCG majors like Hindustan Unilever, Procter & Gamble India and Nestle were found to have profiteered from the lower tax regimeRestaurateurs came second, followed by entertainment and media firms

NEW DELHI :
Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms have topped the list of customers complaints list for over-charging ever since the new indirect tax regime Goods and Services Tax (GST) was rolled out on 1 July 2017.
Restaurateurs came second, followed by entertainment and media firms.
As per official data, as many as 42 consumer complaints were registered against various FMCG companies with many of them found to be not passing the benefits of lower tax rates.
As GST rates were cut across various categories in the GST Council meetings to reduce tax incidence on consumers, the companies were expected to pass on the benefit by lowering prices in proportion to the rate reduction.
It was, however, found that many companies had not passed on the benefit of lower tax and indulged in profiteering. Complaints were later filed against them and the GST anti-profiteering watchdog National Anti-profiteering Authority (NAA) took up the cases.
Some of the FMCG majors like Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), Procter & Gamble India (P&G) and Nestle were found to have profiteered from the lower tax regime.
In the latest case, the NAA last week ordered Nestle to deposit  ₹73.15 crore with Consumer Welfare Fund for not passing GST rate reduction benefit to consumers. The FMCG major has, however, said that it will consider appropriate action after studying the same.
Experts said that it is very difficult for FMCG companies to assess the exact impact of the lower tax given that they have multiple similar products in one category.
Moreover, they sell products for as low as  ₹2 for a shampoo pouch and when the rate is lowered they are not in the position to exactly assess the impact on price. Even if the assessment is done and it is found that the price should be lower by 30 paise, transaction becomes difficult as currency of that amount is not available.
""Because of multiple products of similar kind it is difficult for FMCG companies to arrive at a particular price. There are very small units like toffee selling for Re 1. In this case it will be very difficult to arrive at net impact of rate cut,"" said Amit Bhagat, Partner, Dhruva Advisors.
Besides FMCG, many restaurants are also facing complaints with 14 cases being lodged. Two complaints were filed against sanitary ware firms. Media and entertainment firms have six complaints against them."
0,2019-12-19,Unilever,"HUL’s investors appear to have taken note of the lack of improvement in the demand situationStock of HUL has fallen by almost 12% from its 52-week high intraday price of  ₹2,190 on 7 November

Mumbai: The Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) stock shed more than 2% in the past two trading days after its parent Unilever Plc. cut revenue growth guidance. This means volume growth outlook may be at risk for one of India’s top consumer staples’ firms. Unilever cut its revenue growth forecast for 2019 to below 3%.
“While it is tough to back-calculate HUL’s growth, it is reasonable to assume that it would have slowed down more than the average slowdown of about 150 basis points for Unilever,"" analysts from Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a 17 December report. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
“This would imply revenue growth of below 5% for the December quarter and volume growth of about 3%,"" added Credit Suisse.
For perspective, these numbers are sequentially lower. For the September quarter, HUL’s total operating revenue increased by 6.7% from a year earlier. At the same time, volume growth, which had dropped to a seven-quarter low of 5% in the June quarter, remained steady at the same rate for the September quarter.
“For Q3FY20, we now expect low single-digit volume growth (about 2-3%),"" said SBICAP Securities Ltd.
Commenting on the overall market conditions, the company’s management recently told Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd’s analysts, “The company doesn’t see a sharp demand turnaround for another two quarters."" The management also added that rural demand has seen a slight sequential slowdown.
Note that in its September quarter earnings presentation, the company had said rural market growth is only 0.5 time that of the urban one.
Additionally, demand conditions for fast-moving consumer goods companies have not recovered as expected.
“With inflationary food items and rising telecom tariffs, the consumers’ spending power appears to have faded. This is why we see higher price offs in the market now,"" point out SBICAP analysts in a report on 17 December. Price-offs refer to price promotions.
Meanwhile, HUL’s investors appear to have taken note of the lack of improvement in the demand situation. Small wonder, the company’s shares have declined by almost 12% from its 52-week high intraday price of  ₹2,190 per share seen on 7 November.
But this doesn’t bring much respite on the valuation front. According to Bloomberg data, at the current market price of  ₹1,928.55, the HUL stock trades at 57 times estimated earnings for FY20, which is still steep. Investors will wait for signs of demand pickup in the coming days but optimism on this runs low at the moment."
