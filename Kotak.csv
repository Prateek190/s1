Mumbai: Tata Opportunities Fund-backed auto components maker Varroc Engineering Ltd plans to go public and has hired investment banks to advise it on the share sale, said two people aware of the development.
Founded in 1990, Aurangabad-based Varroc supplies exterior lighting systems, power trains, electrical and electronic parts, and body and chassis parts to passenger car and motorcycle makers in India and abroad.
“Varroc had been in talks for an initial public offering (IPO) for a while and they have appointed investment banks Kotak Mahindra Capital and Credit Suisse to manage their initial share sale. They plan to soon file their draft red herring prospectus with an eye on going public sometime this year,"" said one of the two people cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to the media.
According to the second person, the proposed IPO could be a mix of a primary fund raising and a secondary share sale.
“Tata Opportunities Fund is likely to sell part of its stake through the IPO, while the company will look to raise funds to invest in the business. The exact quantum of these are yet to be finalized,"" he said. He too requested anonymity.
Tata Opportunities Fund invested Rs300 crore in Varroc in 2014. It holds a significant minority stake in the company.
Credit Suisse declined to comment on the development. An email sent to Kotak Mahindra Capital did not elicit any response. “The company is not in a position to comment on the queries,"" said a spokesperson for Varroc Engineering in an email response to queries from Mint.
The Varroc group has 37 manufacturing facilities, 12 engineering centres, 13,500 employees and 760 engineering experts in 10 countries, according to the company’s website. Varroc claims to be the number one two-wheeler automotive component supplier in India.

In 2015-16, Varroc earned a consolidated profit of Rs245.5 crore, down from a profit of Rs303.8 crore in the previous year.
Varroc derives almost 39% of its revenue from the North American market, while India and Europe contribute around 30% and 23% respectively, data from the company’s filings show.
Varroc’s plans to go public follow a record year of fund-raising. In 2017, 36 companies raised Rs67,147 crore through the IPO route, while in 2016, 26 companies raised Rs26,493.8 crore through IPOs. Varroc is not the only auto component maker that is planning to tap the buoyant IPO market.
Last month, auto component manufacturer Sandhar Technologies Ltd filed its draft papers with market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to raise Rs300 crore through an IPO. Apart from a fresh issue of equity shares worth Rs300 crore, the public offering comprises of an offer for sale of 8 million shares by private equity firm GTI Capital."

Davos: Pitching for a nuanced message at the World Economic Forum (WEF) to present India as an open economy which cares for interest of domestic as well as global audience, Kotak Mahindra Bank managing director Uday Kotak on Monday said the country needs to position itself as a statesman and not just a salesman. 
Davos: Pitching for a nuanced message at the World Economic Forum (WEF) to present India as an open economy which cares for interest of domestic as well as global audience, Kotak Mahindra Bank managing director Uday Kotak on Monday said the country needs to position itself as a statesman and not just a salesman.
Kotak, who is at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, said it is a very big opportunity for the country to demonstrate the new India that is being built. “Also, we must understand that following our prime minister, US President Donald Trump is also coming to Davos with his ‘America First’ policy and he is coming after cutting corporate tax rates and after making big corporates bring back jobs and profits to America,"" Kotak told PTI in an interview.
“Therefore, we need to get our messaging right when Trump is likely to talk about how Americans are making America great again. So India needs to say here that we are welcoming the world and we are building a new India,"" he said.
Kotak, who set up one of India’s most successful new age banks and has been expanding it into a major financial sector conglomerate including through acquisitions, said Davos is a big opportunity for India this year and “India needs to position itself in a statesman position and not in a salesman position here"".
Referring to Chinese Premier Xi Jinping’s opening plenary address last year at Davos, he said, China took a position last year that it was an open platform for the world economy. America is now championing America First, so India needs to position itself uniquely, he said.
“We need to tell the world we are an open economy but at the same time India has aspirations to build a new India. We need to articulate that we need the world’s investments but at the terms that make sense to us and to everybody else,"" he said on expectations from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s opening plenary on Tuesday.
“We need to give a message that is nuanced between where Trump is likely to position himself and where China positioned itself last year. India is no longer a salesman to the world and we need to position ourselves as the statesman now,"" he said.
Kotak said the government leaders and chief executives from India need to brand and market the country’s great story at Davos while understanding the subtle difference between sales and marketing. “I’m sure our prime minister is the best person in presenting a great branding of India and in marketing our success story,"" he said.

171,2018-04-11,Kotak,"Some analysts see Axis Bank as a potential acquisition target of Kotak Mahindra Bank, but others continue to prefer Axis Bank to ICICI Bank

Mumbai: Shares of Axis Bank Ltd on Tuesday gained 5.4%, the most in more than five months, on speculation that India’s third largest private lender could be a potential acquisition target after its board accepted managing director Shikha Sharma’s plea to cut her fourth three-year term to seven months. 
Mumbai: Shares of Axis Bank Ltd on Tuesday gained 5.4%, the most in more than five months, on speculation that India’s third largest private lender could be a potential acquisition target after its board accepted managing director Shikha Sharma’s plea to cut her fourth three-year term to seven months.
Sharma, who joined Axis Bank in 2009, will now step down on 31 December. Her fourth term as managing director and chief executive was originally set to end in June 2021.
“Our assessment suggests that Axis Bank will have to look for an external CEO. We believe this presents a great opportunity for Kotak Bank to acquire one of the largest liability/retail asset franchises,"" Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
Shares of Axis Bank touched a 16-month high of Rs627.50 on 23 January, but have eroded 13% since then.
In an interview to Bloomberg in November, Kotak Mahindra Bank managing director Uday Kotak had said the bank was open to acquisitions.
“We are pretty open to acquisitions as long as they make strategic sense, are value-accretive and are a good cultural fit,"" Kotak said.
According to Nomura, at current prices, the deal would be more than 40% accretive to the EPS/BPS (earnings per share/book value per share) of Kotak Bank.
“This should make it possible for Kotak Bank to offer some premium to Axis Bank shareholders to make the deal attractive to Axis Bank minority shareholders,"" Nomura analysts said, adding that the deal would be more than 25% accretive for Kotak Bank even after paying a 10-30% premium for Axis Bank.
A Kotak Mahindra Bank spokesperson said the bank does not comment on rumours and speculation. An Axis Bank spokesperson did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said it continues to prefer Axis Bank to ICICI Bank Ltd.
“We recommend a positive outlook for the stock. The stock has corrected 11% in the last three months vs ~3% correction for the broader market index,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note on Monday.
“We believe this captures a fair amount of bad news in the Mar ’18 quarter. If indeed the bank undertakes a clean-up exercise, we believe the H2FY19 outlook and beyond should improve dramatically,"" Jefferies added.
Larger rival ICICI Bank also saw its shares rise 3% on Tuesday, taking respite from rating agency Fitch Ratings’ comments on Monday that the bank’s rating is underpinned by relatively strong capitalization and profitability, and its core capitalisation would remain strong even if the Videocon loan in question were completely written off. 
The ratings agency, however, said the allegations did pose “reputational risks"" to the bank. 
The allegation relates to a loan to Videocon Group, whose controlling shareholder co-founded a separate company with the husband of ICICI Bank’s CEO Chanda Kochhar. A significant portion of the loan has since become non-performing."

HDFC Bank Ltd remained country’s most valuable bank with a market capitalization of Rs5.04 trillion.
Investors buying shares of Uday Kotak-promoted lender Kotak Mahindra Bank due to a continued improvement in business growth, stable asset quality with net non preforming assets of 1% ratio and negligible restructured assets. Investors also expects that going ahead its non banking operations will continue to give robust growth in future.
“Kotak Bank has undoubtedly proven its competitive edge over its private sector peers with higher fee income, superior asset quality management and effective management of financial business arms. It continues to witness moderation in SMA-2 balance, which clearly suggests a stable trend on asset quality front. Looking ahead, we expect strong traction in earnings to continue owing to robust growth in loan book, moderate credit cost and healthy margins,"" said HDFC Securities in a 19 January note.
Of the 37 brokers tracking the Kotak Mahindra Bank stock on Bloomberg, as many as 26 recommended a “buy"" rating, four asked its investors to “sell"" the stock and 7 have a “hold"" rating.
Shares of SBI along with other public sector banks fell after Punjab National Bank on 14 February reported that it detected fraudulent banking transaction at one of its branches in Mumbai.
After the PNB fraud came to light, SBI shares declined nearly 10%, while Nifty PSU Bank index slumped 18.4%. Since then many banks reported exposure to this fraud and police arrested various public sector bank employees and top management of private sector.
SBI stock had already been under pressure after the bank reported a surprise loss of Rs2,416 crore for December quarter as its bad loans and provisions spiked.
“SBI earning for December quarter underscores the challenges in asset quality albeit moderation in the pace of NPL accrual. The group would benefit from the NPL resolution underway through insolvency proceedings. However, the overhang from stressed assets not recognised as impaired, headwinds to margin outlook in the near term, and moderation in growth imply protracted time for the group to deliver normalised level of earnings and profitability,"" said brokerage firm IIFL Institutional Equities in a 12 February note.
Of the analysts covering SBI stock, 42 have a “buy"" rating, six have a “hold"" rating, while two have a “sell"" rating, shows Bloomberg data."

Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd has asked the dedicated bankruptcy court conducting insolvency proceedings against Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd to include it in the list of “assenting"" lenders in favour of the resolution plan submitted offered jointly by JSW Steel Ltd and AION Capital Partners Ltd.
On Tuesday, senior counsel Darius Khambata, representing Kotak Mahindra Bank, said the bank, an unsecured financial lender to Monnet Ispat and Energy, was among the dissenting unsecured financial creditors until now but would now want to be an “assenter"", or part of the lenders who have approved the resolution plan.
“We are an unsecured financial creditor with a claim of around Rs73 crore. However, if we become an ‘assenter’, we may get to recover around Rs3-3.5 crore,"" said Khambata. “This will not change anything in the resolution plan that has been submitted since the resolution plan has been passed by about 98% majority approval from the committee of creditors,"" he added.
After hearing arguments, the division bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) comprising B.S.V. Prakash Kumar and Ravi Kumar Duraisamy directed the bank to file an affidavit in this regard and posted the hearing for 25 April.
The bench observed that any decision on a change in Kotak Mahindra Bank’s status after the 270-day deadline and submission of the plan to NCLT could set a precedent.
“The admitted claims towards Monnet Ispat & Energy are about Rs11,400 crore, while the liquidated value of the company stands at around Rs2,365 crore,"" argued Ravi Kadam, senior counsel representing the resolution professional in the matter.
“The lenders stand to take around 75% haircut in the matter,"" he added.
At the beginning of the month, the tribunal had directed the resolution professional of Monnet Ispat and Energy to include the claims of ICICI Bank (Rs486 crore), IFCI Ltd (Rs158 crore) and Standard Chartered Bank (Rs147 crore) in the steelmaker’s bankruptcy proceedings.
Monnet Ispat is part of the first lot of 12 large non-performing loans referred by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for early resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) last year.
A consortium of AION Capital Partners and JSW Steel Ltd has made a binding offer for Monnet Ispat which was approved by the committee of creditors. AION Capital holds a 70% stake in the consortium while JSW Steel holds the rest.
If the plan gets approved by the Mumbai bench of NCLT, this will be the second resolution plan from the so-called first list of RBI. On 17 April, NCLT Kolkata had approved the resolution plan submitted by Vedanta Ltd for Electrosteel Steels."

Market sentiment would also be driven by Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data for the manufacturing and services sectors due this week. 
“Going ahead, the focus would be on corporate earnings, bond yields (US as well as in India) and crude price. While better-than-expected results in IT and couple of banks have kept the market sentiment high, weak numbers from other sector stocks in coming days could lead to downside for the market,"" said Sanjeev Zarbade, vice president-PCG Research, Kotak Securities. 
Major companies scheduled to declare their earnings this week include HDFC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HCL Technologies, Hero MotoCorp, Tata Power, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Power and Bank of Maharashtra. 
Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd would also remain in focus on Monday as the company’s result came in after market hours on Friday.

Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd Monday reported an over 15% jump in March quarter net profit, boosted by higher net interest income and other income. 
Net profit for the quarter stood at Rs1,124.05 crore against Rs976.48 crore a year ago, the bank said. A Bloomberg poll of 11 analysts had expected the bank to post a net profit of Rs1,170.20 crore. 
Net interest income (NII), or the core income a bank earns by giving loans, increased 19.4% to Rs2,579.75 crore, versus Rs2,161.37 crore last year. Other income stood at Rs1,151.63 crore, up 14.86% from Rs1,002.65 crore a year ago. 
Uday Kotak, who has been re-designated as managing director and chief executive officer, said the profit growth would have been even higher, had it not been for the one-time hit of Rs82 crore related to employee costs from change in gratuity limits. 
Provisions and contingencies rose 14.8% to Rs306.91 crore from Rs267.37 crore a year ago. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, they rose 44.24% from Rs212.77 crore. 
Kotak said overall provisioning costs, which fell to 56 basis points in the previous fiscal from 61 basis points a year before, is expected to fall further. However, this will also depend on the movement in the bond market. 
Gross non-performing assets rose to Rs3,825.38 crore at 31 March from Rs3,578.61 crore in the same quarter last year. 
The bank reported an improvement in asset quality. 
As a percentage of total loans, gross NPAs stood at 2.22% compared with 2.31% in the previous quarter and 2.59% in the year-ago quarter. Net NPAs were at 0.98% in the March quarter compared to 1.09% in the previous quarter and 1.26% in the same quarter last year. 
On the overall stressed assets situation, Kotak said his group is keen on participating in the auctions of companies under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, but the focus will be on ensuring that such participation will yield a fair risk-return ratio. 
Kotak Realty Fund, along with Cube Highways, has submitted a bid for Jaypee Infratech, one of the 12 cases referred for insolvency proceedings following the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) directive last year. 
Kotak said in cases where banks have received a single bid, the value of that bid is close to liquidation value. However, one must not rule out the resolution of assets via liquidation."
166,2018-05-03,Kotak,"This week, sentiment for Kotak Mahindra Bank shares got a further boost after the company reported better-than-expected results for its consolidated operations

As if Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd’s shares hadn’t outpaced peers by a big-enough margin already, the stock added another 4% to the tally on Wednesday. Investors just can’t have enough of it, and analysts have had no option but to play catch-up. For instance, Nomura had a “neutral"" rating with a target price of Rs1,150 until 1 May. It has now upgraded to a “buy"" rating with a 12-month target of Rs1,400.

It has now upgraded to a “buy"" rating with a 12-month target of Rs1,400.
This week, sentiment for the lender’s shares got a further boost after the company reported better-than-expected results for its consolidated operations. The March quarter results showed the group’s subsidiaries shouldered the growth in profits while the core banking operations continued to thrust forward, more or less insulated from the bad loan mess some other private sector banks are grappling with. Kotak Mahindra Bank is now the second-most valuable lender in the country, in terms of its market capitalization. 
Consolidated profit rose 27.4% for the fourth quarter, driven by asset management, capital markets and insurance business of the group. 
The share of Kotak Mahindra Bank in total consolidated profit fell to 65% for fiscal year 2018 (FY18) from 69% in the previous year. 
Indeed, what made the market relook at valuations at the group level was the bumper performance by its insurance business. The insurance operations reported a profit growth of 36% for FY18 and the embedded value was pegged at Rs5,824 crore. The group’s other big subsidiaries that include the asset management business and investment banking business also performed well.
On a stand-alone basis, the bank missed Street estimates on net profit growth, which came in at 15% for the quarter as one-time employee expenses ate into profits. Core operating metrics remained robust with net interest income and other income growing 19.4% and 15%, respectively. Asset quality that has set Kotak Mahindra Bank apart from others continues to do so.
Analysts believe that given the strong consolidated performance, the valuation multiples do not look expensive. Besides, with rumours of an acquisition of Axis Bank Ltd refusing to die, the possibility of inorganic growth is another reason investors are excited. What can go wrong?
For Kotak Mahindra Bank, loan growth came from commercial vehicles and unsecured lending, which grew more than 40%. The growth in consolidated profits was led by the capital markets and securities business, which can be cyclical. This leaves the door open for volatility in earnings in FY19 and investors would do well to keep a check on their appetite."

New Delhi: Kotak Mahindra Bank, which hinges its communication on diversity and progress, is back with a new campaign featuring Bollywood actor Ranveer Singh talking about social inclusivity. The ad, which promotes digital bank service 811 launched in March last year, talks about how our society often discriminates people on the basis of religion, caste, creed, sexual orientation and abilities.
Made by advertising agency Cartwheel Creative, the 30-second long spot shot at the iconic Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in Mumbai, captures real life nuances. The protagonist of the story is ‘the bench at the railway station’ and Singh dons the role of the bard (sutradhar). The story voices similarities between Kotak’s 811 service and a bench at a railway station which provides services to everyone irrespective of where they come from. 
811 allows people to open a zero-balance digital bank account which gives up to 6% per annum interest to every citizen of the country. The account can be opened through an app without physically visiting the bank branch. 
“We saw a unique opportunity to reinforce our pride in India’s diversity, as well as our unstinting support for people from all walks of life with this outing, and we grabbed it with both hands. We believe that a digital India is a truly democratic India, and 811 can and must play a vital role in the financial ecosystem, enabling every single Indian to access and use cutting edge banking products and services,"" said Karthi Marshan, chief marketing officer, Kotak Mahindra Group.
811 targets first time banking customers who find it difficult to deal with a conventional bank set-up (mostly teenagers and first jobbers), differently-abled or people left out by society for a wide variety of reasons.
Kotak has always hinged it’s communication on diversity and progress with a belief that big brands have the ability and opportunity, and therefore the responsibility to help mould attitudes. 
“For instance, when the bank was launched, we challenged conventional notions by talking about creating wealth for the daughter’s education and the son’s wedding instead of the opposite. More recently, to announce the merger with ING Vysya Bank, we launched a campaign titled Kona Kona Kotak, that celebrated the varied and diverse stories of progress from across the country,"" added Marshan.
The current campaign which is currently being promoted across television, cinema, outdoor, print as well as other leading digital video platforms.
“The theme of inclusivity came naturally since the product in itself is pre-inclusive. Also, the divisive climate we are living in it was only relevant and appropriate to highlight inclusivity. To amplify this message further we decided to involve Ranveer Singh who, in a way, is an outlier,"" D Ramki, co-founder, Cartwheel Creative. 
According to Robby Mathew, chief creative officer at advertising agency FCB Interface the Kotak ad is different ad which will add immense value to the brand. 
“I loved the way it is shot and the choice of Ranveer Singh as the face of this service is perfect as he’s a bit of an odd ball himself and stands out in any situation,"" he said. 
However, Mathew feels that the television commercial is slightly exaggerated in terms of narrative.
“I don’t think banks are non-inclusive unlike certain restaurants and pubs where you have to dress a certain way to gain access. Kotak might be trying to break the clutter in banking sector advertising, which is mostly about interest rates, minimal balance and convenience, by taking a high round,"" he added."

New Delhi: The insurance sector wants to be part of India’s road growth story. In a meeting held by Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari with bankers in Mumbai on Friday, Kotak Mahindra Bank chief executive officer Uday Kotak signalled the sector’s eagerness. 
A senior government official on condition of anonymity said: “Uday Kotak, along with LIC (Life Insurance Corporation of India) chairman said they were keen on exploring opportunities in post-construction lending for highway projects. Both insurance and highway projects have the basic characteristic of being long-term projects with investment returns by 15-25 years and can be gelled easily."" 
Gadkari liked the proposal and further possibilities are likely to be explored to bring in insurance sector investments, said the official on condition of anonymity.
Another proposal that caught the attention during the discussion was the “One Bank, One Project"" mooted by State Bank India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar. 
“At present, a consortium of 10 or more banks finance projects and in case one raises objection, the project is scrapped. Under the proposed arrangement, either one bank will be financing the project or a maximum consortium of two banks will finance the project, with the lead bank being given powers to take all financial decisions,"" said the official quoted before.
The move comes at a time when banks have become cautious about investing in infrastructure projects because of growing bad debts and their past experience with BOT (built-operate-transfer) projects in the roads sector. 
The meeting was attended by managing directors of several banks including Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank, SBI, Punjab National Bank, ICICI Bank, RBL Bank and the chairman of LIC. 
Gadkari said the country’s roads sector has shown a great growth in the last four years. The first three months of the current fiscal year contributed 12% to gross domestic product, showing its immense potential. 
“I have told bankers that I can give them a secured business of  ₹ 5-7 lakh crore,"" Gadkari added. 
The minister told banks that if they don’t come forward with investments he will consider approaching foreign investors."

According to Bloomberg analyst estimates, the bank was expected to post a profit of  ₹ 1,208.50 crore.
Net interest income (NII), or the core income a bank earns by giving loans, was up 15.02% to  ₹ 2,582.90 crore versus  ₹ 2,245.55 crore last year. Other income grew 28.4% to  ₹ 1,164.59 crore.
Provisions and contingencies surged 130.5% to  ₹ 469.63 crore in the quarter from  ₹ 203.74 crore a year ago. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, they increased 53% from  ₹ 06.94 crore.
Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose marginally 4.6% to  ₹ 3,899.45 crore at the end of the June quarter from  ₹ 3,726.62 crore in the same quarter last year. Slippages during the quarter declined 46% to  ₹ 321 crore against  ₹ 594 crore a quarter ago.

The Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd stock was punished after its June quarter results were announced. The stock plummeted nearly 4% intraday on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and ended Thursday’s session down 3.8% in a flat market. 
The Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd stock was punished after its June quarter results were announced. The stock plummeted nearly 4% intraday on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and ended Thursday’s session down 3.8% in a flat market.
The reason: the private sector lender’s provisions for bad loans more than doubled in the June quarter compared to the year-ago period. This was apart from mark-to-market provisions of around  ₹ 210 crore. The bank registered a 130.5% year-on-year spike in provisions, while sequentially they went up 53%.
Consequently, it missed Street expectations on the net profit front. Stand-alone net profit during the quarter increased 12% year-on-year to  ₹ 1,024.94 crore, but was well below Bloomberg analysts’ estimates of  ₹ 1,208.50 crore.
On the positive side, Kotak Mahindra Bank’s loan book saw a healthy year-on-year growth of 24%. This was led by the high-yielding corporate banking and commercial vehicles segment. However, loan growth in its small and medium enterprises segment was subdued. Net interest margin fell a bit to 4.3% from 4.35% in the previous quarter.
Asset quality was stable. Both gross and net non-performing assets declined both sequentially and from a year ago.
On a consolidated basis, the private sector lender’s net profit increased 17% year-on-year to  ₹ 1,347 crore. However, some analysts expressed concerns over the performance of the bank’s NBFC (non-banking financial company) subsidiary, which continues to be subdued.
Despite the earnings miss, investors have little reason to feel dissatisfied. Earlier this week, the bank’s stock hit a 52-week high of  ₹ 1,417 on NSE. On a year-to-date basis, the stock has outperformed the Nifty Bank Index by giving 33.5% returns. During the same span, the sector index was up 4.9%. Also, the lender has posted better returns than peers (see chart). No wonder then that out of the 38 broking houses tracking this stock, 30 have a “buy"" and four have a “hold"" rating.
The problem lies in Kotak Mahindra Bank’s valuation, which, at a one-year forward price-to-book multiple of 5.23 times (stand-alone), makes it one of the most expensive banking stocks. Valuations like that come with sky-high expectations, leaving the door wide open for disappointment."

Sticking with financial stocks and not chasing returns has helped Axis Asset Management Co. to ride the wave of volatility in Indian markets that has hammered many of its competitors.
The Axis Bluechip Fund is up 25% over the past year, beating nine index funds and 35 other actively managed portfolios to the mantle of India’s top performing large-cap fund, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its biggest holdings - HDFC Bank Ltd., Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. Housing Development Finance Corp. and Tata Consultancy Services - have contributed more than three quarters of gains on the S&P BSE Sensex Index this year.
“Our portfolio tilt toward very high-quality stocks has helped us ride out the market volatility,"" Shreyash Devalkar, senior fund manager at Axis, which has $12 billion in assets, said in an interview. The fund exited some smaller companies in December after a gush of inflows lifted valuations, he said.
Gains in Indian equities this year have been lopsided as investors sought safety in the biggest stocks amid headwinds from a brewing trade conflict and elevated prices of oil, India’s top import. A selloff in stocks of medium and smaller-sized companies was made worse by stringent margins requirements imposed in June. That’s left those smaller firms trading near the biggest discount to the Sensex in two years, according to Bloomberg data.
Axis expects a boost in government spending in India’s countryside ahead of next year’s general elections to benefit companies able to capture improved consumer demand. The government this month raised minimum assured prices for crops like cotton and rice to boost rural incomes and spending. “We are tracking earnings closely to see how consumer demand is panning out,"" he said, without naming the stocks he’s watching.
New Record
The Sensex is up more than 8% this year, surpassing a previous all-time high reached in January, after turmoil in the first quarter dragged equities into a correction. Despite the rebound, volatility may remain elevated amid uncertainty over international politics and in the run up to next year’s national ballot, Devalkar said.
Rising crude prices and its impact on public finances remains a cause for concern, he said. Brent oil held above $72 per barrel, up about 45% from a year ago, fueling concern inflation will quicken. India is the world’s third-biggest oil user and relies on imports to meet about two-thirds of its fuel requirements.
Prior to his fund’s outperformance over the past 12 months, Devalkar’s fund lost about 3.6% in 2016 compared with a 3% gain in the NSE Nifty 50 Index that year."

Mumbai: Blackstone Group LP, the world’s largest alternative asset manager, has picked banks for India’s first real estate investment trust listing, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The US company and local partner Embassy Group selected firms including Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., said the people. The REIT listing would raise about $1 billion, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
Axis Bank Ltd., Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc and JM Financial Ltd. have also been picked for the transaction, the people said. A representative for Blackstone declined to comment.
A successful deal could encourage new offerings from India’s cash-starved property firms, which are still recovering from sweeping policy changes and struggling to access liquidity. The Blackstone REIT, which comprises properties that count Microsoft Corp. and Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc as tenants, would also be a crucial test after much-hyped infrastructure trusts failed to gain traction in the Indian market.
“A good debut for the Blackstone-Embassy issue could quicken potential offerings by the likes of Xander group, Brookfield, CPPIB and IIFL Holdings who are holding high-quality realty assets,"" said Amit Goenka, Mumbai-based managing director of Nisus Finance Services Ltd. “Even if only one-fourth of the high-grade, yield-generating commercial properties are moved into trusts, we will have a $50 billion REITs market in India in a few years.""

New Delhi: Kotak Mahindra Bank will raise up to  ₹ 500 crore by issuing preference shares on a private placement basis. 
The non-convertible preference shares (NCPS) issuance committee of the board of directors of the bank on Wednesday resolved to approved the issue of perpetual non-cumulative preference shares on a private placement basis aggregating to an issue size of up to  ₹ 500 crore, Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a regulatory filing. 
The NCPS will offer the allottees a fixed dividend of 8.10%. 
The funds are to be utilised to boost the capital under Basel-III norms which are to be adopted fully by Indian banks by March 2019. 
As per the norms, banks are required to shore up their capital adequacy ratios and maintain equity capital at 7% of risk-weighted assets. Being implemented in phases since 1 April, 2013, India is expected to fully implement Basel-III standards by March 2019, three months later than the globally accepted deadline. 
Although banks in India have higher capital adequacy ratio than the minimum total capital requirement under Basel-III, their Tier-I or equity capital needs to be shored up to meet the norm.

Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd on Tuesday said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has rejected its proposal to issue non-convertible preference shares to reduce promoter holding. In a notice to the exchanges, the bank, however, said it had met the central bank guidelines and will continue to engage with RBI. 
Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd on Tuesday said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has rejected its proposal to issue non-convertible preference shares to reduce promoter holding. In a notice to the exchanges, the bank, however, said it had met the central bank guidelines and will continue to engage with RBI.
“RBI has communicated to us that our PNCPS (perpetual non-cumulative preference shares) issuance doesn’t meet its promoter holding dilution requirement. We continue to believe that we have met the requirement and will engage with the RBI,"" said the notice. 
Kotak had earlier said it was looking to raise as much as  ₹ 500 crore by issuing non-convertible PNCPS to dilute promoter shareholding. RBI had mandated the bank to reduce promoter shareholding to 20% of paid up capital by 31 December 2018, and 15% by 31 March 2020. 
“I do not think RBI will yield, no matter how much the bank tries to convince the regulator. RBi has taken a stance since Kotak’s move to issue PNCPS sets a bad precedent for others to follow, something that RBI will not want to allow,"" said Suresh Ganapathy, head of financial services research, Macquarie Capital Securities India Pvt. Ltd.
“It is along expected lines and I was not expecting the RBI to allow this. You cannot circumvent RBI regulations. What we have to look at is the intent of the central bank’s guidelines and it holds true for others like Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank as well. I believe (Uday) Kotak would not do something wrong on corporate governance, having himself been on the committee as it is incumbent on him to follow the highest standards,"" said Anil Singhvi, chairman, Ican Investment Advisors. The issuance of these shares, the bank’s paid-up capital would have increased to  ₹ 1,453 crore from  ₹ 953 crore, thereby bringing down promoter’s interest in paid-up capital to 19.7% from 30.3%.
Preference shares are considered part of paid-up capital, and RBI’s norms refer to ownership caps as a percentage of paid-up capital. Brokerages and investor advisory firms had questioned whether Kotak’s decision meets RBI’s guidelines. The management said the Banking Regulation Act, however, curtails voting rights of promoters to 15%. Typically, stake dilution happens through sale or issue of fresh equity shares. According to a Mint analysis, Kotak Bank would have needed to issue  ₹ 1.25 trillion equity to meet norms of promoter stake dilution. If promoters had to sell shares outright, it would have required a block deal of about  ₹ 25,000 crore.

If the bank issues about  ₹ 1.2 trillion ($17 billion) of new stock to back an acquisition, that would effectively dilute the billionaire’s holding below the 20 percent target.
“Uday Kotak may favor a big acquisition that will take care of his dilution woes in one go,"" said Rakesh Kumar, an analyst with Elara Securities India Pvt., who remains negative about Kotak Mahindra stock until the issue is resolved. Acquisition targets could include Axis Bank Ltd., India’s third-largest private lender, or a financial firm such as PNB Housing Finance Ltd., according to Devansh Lakhani, an analyst at Lakhani Financial Services Ltd.
Last year, the RBI ordered Kotak to cut his ownership of the bank in phases, to below 20 percent by 2018 and to 15 percent by March 31, 2020, as part of a plan to reduce the influence of founding shareholders. Kotak currently owns about 567 million of the bank’s 1.9 billion shares, or just under 30 percent.
Preference Shares
The bank has said it still hopes to persuade the RBI to approve its original plan to reduce Kotak’s stake. That involves a proposed sale of  ₹ 500 crore of so-called non-convertible perpetual non-cumulative preference shares to domestic institutional investors.
But if the bank fails to sway the regulator and opts solely for an acquisition to reduce its founder’s stake, it would require the issuance of about 970 million new Kotak Mahindra ordinary shares to get the holding below 20 percent, worth about  ₹ 1.2 trillion at current market prices. Kotak Mahindra rose 0.5% to  ₹ 1,281 in early Mumbai trade on Tuesday. 
Another option is for Uday Kotak to reduce his stake either wholly or in part via a share sale to institutional investors. The billionaire founder took this route when he sold 1.5 percent of his shares to Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in March 2017. To get down to the 20 percent solely via a share sale would require Kotak to dispose of about $3.4 billion of the bank’s ordinary shares.
An acquisition is also part of the Kotak playbook. In 2014, the bank purchased ING Vysya Bank Ltd. in a deal valued at $2.4 billion via a share swap.
Rumors that Kotak Mahindra is about to buy another financial firm have boosted the shares of Axis Bank, PNB Housing Finance, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd. and Shriram Transport Finance Co., among others, in recent months.
‘Best Target’
Axis Bank, with a market capitalization of $23 billion, looks like the “best target"" in that it would help Kotak Mahindra increase its presence in corporate banking, according to Purvesh Shelatkar, senior vice president at Centrum Broking Ltd.
Another option, which also has a precedent, is that Uday Kotak dilutes his stake with a new $17 billion share offering unrelated to an acquisition. But this is considered unlikely because Kotak Mahindra’s capital adequacy ratio is a more than comfortable 17.7 percent, so any further buffering via a share issue would lead to an unnecessary dilution of earnings, according to Lakhani.
The bank last issued fresh shares in May 2017 when it raised $901 million to boost lending and raise money for acquisitions."

Mumbai: Dena Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, two dissenting financial creditors of debt-ridden textile maker Alok Industries Ltd, have withdrawn their applications against the resolution professional (RP) from the bankruptcy court, after being assured of recovery at par with lenders who had approved the resolution plan, court documents showed.
“It is further requested that Dena Bank shall be treated at par with the assenting financial creditor for payment of the money under the resolution plan dated 12 April, 2018, in view of the order passed by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) dated 12 September,"" said an order by the Ahmedabad NCLT on 22 October.
Dissenting financial creditors are those lenders who have either abstained from voting or voted against the resolution plan approved by the committee of creditors (CoC). 
The appellate tribunal—NCLAT—had clarified in its order in a different case on 12 September, 2018 that “no discrimination can be made between the financial creditors in the resolution plan on the ground that one has dissented and voted against the resolution plan or the other has supported and voted in favour of the resolution plan"".
Both banks had earlier objected to Reliance Industries (RIL)-JM Financial ARC resolution plan for Alok Industries which envisaged buying the company, which owes lenders  ₹ 29,600 crore, for just  ₹ 5,050 crore. The liquidation value of Alok Industries is  ₹ 4,200 crore, while the resolution plan from Reliance offered  ₹ 5,050 crore upfront.
A lawyer aware of the development said, both the lenders have been assured by the committee of creditors (CoC) that they will be at par with other creditors in terms of loan recovery. “Kotak Mahindra Bank was the first one to approach the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and Dena Bank followed,"" he said.
Emails send to Dena Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, resolution professional Ajay Joshi and Reliance Industries did not elicit any response.
The textile company is among the 12 large stressed assets identified in June 2017 by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), where lenders were directed to initiate proceedings under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
The company’s resolution plan was initially rejected by lenders in April 2018 after only 70% voted in its favour. However, lenders re-voted on the proposal in June 2018 after the government lowered the CoC approval threshold from 75% to 66%. This time, 72% lenders approved RIL’s resolution plan.
The Financial Express reported on 26 April that steps taken by the resolution professional (RP) for Alok Industries to recover trade outstanding to the tune of  ₹ 11,622 crore from 5,293 debtors of the textile company remained unsuccessful as 2,467 of them could not be traced.
“Debtors were not locatable at the addresses that were provided by Alok Industries,"" the Financial Express said, citing documents, understood to have been made available to the CoC ahead of a meeting scheduled for 13 April under the IBC process. It said Damania & Varaiya, a chartered accountancy firm, appointed after the fourth CoC meeting to conduct an independent verification of the transactions (trading transactions) and a forensic audit conducted by Grant Thornton — for the period 1 April 2012, to 31 March 2015 — found “no malfeasance on the part of promoters of the Alok Industries or any transfer involving siphoning of funds was observed"".

144,2018-11-28,Kotak,"While Kotak Mahindra Bank has its conversations with the regulator, investors are left wondering which way the outcome will swing

The Reserve Bank of India’s insistence on promoter stake dilution continues to be an albatross around the neck of Kotak Mahindra Bank. This is reflected in the 9.7% fall in the share price ever since RBI refused to bless an innovative way of bringing down the stake of promoter Uday Kotak in August. 
The Reserve Bank of India’s insistence on promoter stake dilution continues to be an albatross around the neck of Kotak Mahindra Bank. This is reflected in the 9.7% fall in the share price ever since RBI refused to bless an innovative way of bringing down the stake of promoter Uday Kotak in August.
The bank had issued perpetual non-cumulative preference shares to eligible shareholders that increased its capital base by  ₹ 500 crore. The private sector lender had argued that following this issue, the stake of the promoter group stood diluted to below 20%. This, it said, fulfilled the central bank’s norms on the same ahead of the deadline of December. However a week after the share issue, RBI refused to give its blessings and this makes the December deadline very real for the bank.
There are no easy options available to Kotak Mahindra Bank’s promoters, who need to bring down ownership from 30.02% to just under 20% by December. It can acquire another lender or finance company, and try and bring the promoter stake down through a share swap. Needless to say, this is easier said than done—the merger with ING Vysya Bank, for instance, has taken more than a year.
Another option is to have a fresh issue of shares. Considering this would mean selling shares worth over  ₹ 1.1 trillion at current prices, it is a tall task. Yet another option is for Uday Kotak to sell his excess 10% stake in the secondary market through a block deal. Such a sale would be roughly worth  ₹ 22,400 crore ($3.16 billion). This looks tough but is not impossible as investors in other companies have done this before. For instance, in February 2012, Citibank sold a near 10% stake in Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) in a block deal worth $1.9 billion.
But from the looks of it, Kotak Mahindra Bank seems to be betting that RBI will relent. When it informed investors that the central bank hadn’t approved of its preference shares route for dilution, it added, “We continue to believe that we have met the requirement and will engage with the RBI in this behalf.""
In the past, Kotak Mahindra Bank has received extensions, although this time seems different, especially since RBI recently pulled up Bandhan Bank Ltd for failing to meet its deadline on the stake dilution norms. Bandhan Bank’s shares are still about 18% down since the central bank’s decree, which says that it cannot open new branches without its approval.
Analysts say that missing the deadline on promoter shareholding norms would be disastrous for the Kotak Mahindra Bank share prices as well.
Operationally, taking approvals for new branches may be cumbersome, but may not have much of an impact. Kotak Mahindra Bank has anyway been slow in adding branches, especially after ING Vysya’s acquisition, and is instead pushing its digital channels more. Nevertheless, investor sentiment will be hit and its valuations may begin to reflect the cost of running afoul of the regulator.
While Kotak Mahindra Bank has its conversations with the regulator, investors are left wondering which way the outcome will swing. Until this is sorted out, the stock is unlikely to break free of the current downward trend. Its valuations offer no help too, as at a multiple of five times estimated book value for FY21, they are viewed as rich. Firms like Elara Capital Plc have a sell rating on the stock due to high valuations and the unresolved promoter holding issue."
141,2018-12-11,Kotak,"Kotak Mahindra Bank's move to take RBI to court over the promoter shareholding issue is likely to buy the bank time, if it's successful in getting a stay

Is Uday Kotak’s move to take RBI to the courts a case of righteous defiance or foolish bravado? Investors are still making up their mind and the uncertainty is affecting the Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd stock. The scrip fell 6% after the bank said in an exchange filing that it has filed a writ petition against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the Bombay high court to protect its interests. Kotak and the central bank haven’t been seeing eye to eye on the methods available for a private sector bank to reduce promoter shareholding. 
Is Uday Kotak’s move to take RBI to the courts a case of righteous defiance or foolish bravado? Investors are still making up their mind and the uncertainty is affecting the Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd stock. The scrip fell 6% after the bank said in an exchange filing that it has filed a writ petition against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the Bombay high court to protect its interests. Kotak and the central bank haven’t been seeing eye to eye on the methods available for a private sector bank to reduce promoter shareholding.
Even though the deadline for meeting RBI’s norms was around the corner, investors didn’t seem too perturbed. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s shares have outperformed the markets this fiscal year. Investors seem to have assumed that Kotak would manage a workaround or a compromise. After all, there have been multiple similar deadlines in the past, and they were successfully navigated. But this time is evidently different.
For backdrop, RBI rules state that promoter shareholding in Kotak Mahindra Bank has to be brought down to 20% by the end of December this year and 15% by March 2020. It currently stands at a little over 30%.
In August, Kotak Mahindra Bank hit upon the route of issuing perpetual non-convertible preference shares to increase the paid-up capital, thereby diluting Kotak’s stake in the bank. RBI shot down this idea and refused to consider this route as a valid one. This implied that only traditional methods such as a direct sale of shares by the promoters or a fresh equity issue to outside investors would be considered kosher by the central bank.
But Kotak has persisted, and has been trying to convince the regulator to give in. The filing of the writ petition shows that neither side is blinking.
RBI’s stance is not surprising. Just a few months ago, it pulled up Bandhan Bank Ltd for violating the deadline of diluting promoter ownership. Other banks have behaved like obedient children and strictly followed timelines. Considering the law is equal to all and regulation cannot be partisan, RBI seems to have stuck to its guns.
The contents of Kotak Mahindra Bank’s petition are not known publicly yet, but analysts reckon it is mainly to challenge the exclusion of the preference share route for stake dilution. After all, Kotak’s argument is that this route is allowed under The Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
The window for suing the regulator is thanks to some poor drafting by RBI’s legal department. Under the rules, the promoter has to bring down stake with respect to paid-up capital, and not specifically equity capital. Kotak is just following the law to the letter, and has received a fair share of criticism for disregarding the spirit of the law.
Evidently, this isn’t something Kotak seems to be too worried about, having taken the letter of the law argument all the way to the courts. Having said that, the move is likely to buy the bank time, if it’s successful in getting a stay granted by the courts. In a best-case scenario, the courts may agree with Kotak Mahindra Bank’s argument.
For now, though, investors are left ruing the fact that uncertainty on the issue will linger, besides worrying about any likely fallout of taking on the regulator."

Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd has moved the Bombay high court against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) after its promoter Uday Kotak was barred from reducing his stake in the bank through a preference share issue, in the first instance of a bank dragging the regulator to court.
Documents on the Bombay high court website show the writ petition was filed by Kotak Mahindra Bank and its director Chengalath Jayaram against RBI and the finance ministry. Law firm Manilal Kher Ambalal & Co. (MKA & Co.) is representing Kotak Mahindra. The first hearing on the case will take place on 17 December.
Vikram Trivedi, managing partner of MKA & Co. declined to comment, citing client confidentiality.
The RBI had mandated the private sector lender to trim promoter shareholding to 20% of its paid-up capital by 31 December 2018, and to 15% before 31 March 2020. On 2 August, Kotak Mahindra completed an issue of perpetual non-convertible preference shares (PNCPS), increasing the bank’s paid-up capital from  ₹ 953 crore to  ₹ 1,453 crore, thereby bringing down the promoter’s holding from 30.3% to 19.7%. However, the bank informed the stock exchanges on 14 August that the method did not meet the RBI’s requirements.
In a regulatory filing on Monday, Kotak Mahindra said ever since, it has clarified and conveyed its position to the central bank “in relation to PNCPS being a part of paid-up capital, and the legal basis on the matter of dilution of shareholding under the Banking Regulation Act"".
“We have also shared with the RBI the opinions of eminent jurists and senior-most legal counsels of the country, which confirm our understanding."" It added that it has not heard from the RBI and given the deadline of 31 December, the “bank has been left with no option, but to protect its interests"".
Also Read | Lessons from Kotak Bank’s preference shares issue
A banking analyst, who did not wish to be identified, said in challenging RBI’s decision, Kotak Mahindra has essentially challenged RBI’s powers to regulate private sector banks. 
There are two possible outcomes from this, the analyst said. The first is, if Kotak wins the case and is allowed to use PNCPS to reduce promoter shareholding, the central bank will definitely challenge it in the Supreme Court. The second scenarios is, if Kotak loses the case, then he will not only have to use another way to pare his stake, but will also face far more stringent regulatory supervision following the debacle. In either scenario, the 31 December deadline is unlikely to be met. 
“The bank has filed a case against the regulator. The case will surely set a precedent for any such future disputes. The matter pertains to the interpretation of the law and should be dealt with by the court only,"" said Ashish K. Singh, founder and managing partner of law firm Capstone Legal. 
“The deadline for the diluting the shareholding is 31 December 2018; so if the writ petition is admitted, the time period is required to be extended by the direction of the court."" 
In August, when RBI rejected the bank’s proposal, experts said it was along expected lines as one cannot circumvent RBI regulations. 
Typically, stake dilution happens through sale or issue of fresh equity shares. Mint reported on 14 August that Kotak Mahindra would have needed to issue  ₹ 1.25 trillion equity to meet the norms of promoter stake dilution. If promoters had to sell shares outright, it would have required a block deal of about  ₹ 25,000 crore.

Mumbai: The Bombay high court has declined to stay a directive of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the promoters of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, including its billionaire owner Uday Kotak, to lower their stake in the bank by 31 December.  
Mumbai: The Bombay high court has declined to stay a directive of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the promoters of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, including its billionaire owner Uday Kotak, to lower their stake in the bank by 31 December. 
The private sector lender had moved the high court after RBI rejected the bank’s proposal to issue perpetual non-convertible preference shares in August to comply with promoter stake rules. Uday Kotak, who owns about 30% in the bank, has been asked by the central bank to cut his holding to 20% by the end of this year, and to 15% by March 2020.
While the next hearing on the case has been scheduled for 17 January, Monday’s decision by the Bombay high court is likely to force Kotak’s hand on the promoter’s stake issue. Kotak has two weeks to comply with the RBI directive or face penal action.
In a similar case, the banking regulator had earlier frozen the salary of Bandhan Bank chief executive and founder Chandra Shekhar Ghosh and also denied the private lender permission to open new branches. 
“The promoter of Kotak Bank would prefer to face some penal action similar to what RBI had done with Bandhan Bank. However, we expect the promoter to comply with the RBI guidelines on shareholder norms over a period of time,"" said Ashutosh Mishra, head of institutional research at Ashika Stock Broking.
Senior counsel Venkatesh Dhond, who appeared for RBI, said promoter stake dilution is aimed at ensuring that voting power is not concentrated in the hands of a single group and that all banks have complied with the rule. 
“We have issued a letter to the bank in August, but now when the deadline is approaching, the bank has come to the high court seeking a stay,"" he argued.
Darius Khambata, the lawyer representing Kotak Mahindra, said: “In the past, the RBI asked the bank to only dilute promoter shareholding of its paid-up capital. However, the impugned letter sought dilution of paid-up voting equity capital. 
“After receiving the letter, the bank wrote two letters—one to then RBI governor and the other to the RBI board seeking clarification. But, we haven’t got any response.""
Khambata pleaded before the court that “RBI must not take any coercive step post December 31, the deadline by when the promoters have to reduce their stake to 20%"". 
“We are the only private sector bank owned by an Indian,"" Khambata said on behalf of Kotak Mahindra. “If we go by the RBI mandate, then it will be difficult to find any domestic investor and hence the only option would be to bring in foreign investors.""
After hearing arguments from both sides, the division bench of the Bombay high court comprising Justice B.P. Dharmadhikari and Justice S.V. Kotwal said the central bank is a responsible regulator and the court would not direct it to do anything at this stage.
The bank, in its petition, has argued that “the impugned reduction communications and the 2018 RBI letter have been issued by the RBI without authority of law, contrary to the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, Article 14 and Article 19 (1)(G) of the Constitution of India."""

Mumbai: The outcome of the controversial demonetisation drive would have been “significantly better"" if “simple things"" like introducing Rs2,000 currency notes were avoided, banker Uday Kotak has said.
The executive vice chairman and managing director of the fourth largest private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank has also said small businesses are in a difficult situation at present and has welcomed the government focus to revive the sector.
On demonetisation, he said the outcomes would have been different if it was planned well.
“I think we would have had significantly better outcomes, if we had just thought about simple things. If you are taking out Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes, why would you introduce Rs2,000 notes? “ Kotak asked while speaking at former chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian’s book launch here over the weekend.
Kotak said as part of the “execution"" strategy, it was essential to ensure larger quantum of notes of the right denomination were made available.
If such things were undertaken, “we would have been talking very differently today than now,"" he said.
But Kotak claimed that for the financial sector, demonetisation has been a “huge boon"".
He said the growth in financial savings have been “unbelievable"", which has also led to a challenge of risk management.
On 8 November, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi surprised all by announcing a withdrawal of the  ₹ 500 and  ₹ ,000 notes, claiming to curb black money and fake notes. But the final numbers have disproved all the calculations wrong as 99.3% of the cancelled notes worth close to  ₹ 5.8 trillion has come back to the system.
This was immediately followed with the introduction of Rs2,000 note by RBI the same evening. Later, the Central bank has also introduced a Rs200 denomination notes.
On the small businesses sector, he pitched for more focus saying the sector is impacted.
“I believe that the SME sector has taken a significant amount of pain. Getting credit for them is tough even now"", he said.
He also welcomed latest government moves for the sector.

In a similar development, RBI had in September placed restrictions on Bandhan Bank for its failure to lower promoter holding by freezing branch expansion and remuneration to managing director and chief executive Chandra Shekhar Ghosh."

135,2019-01-11,Kotak,"While Bandhan Bank's Chandra Shekhar Ghosh is surrendering to RBI on promoter shareholding norms, Kotak Mahindra Bank's Uday Kotak is  suing the central bank

Chandra Shekhar Ghosh is a new arrival on India’s banking scene. Billionaire Uday Kotak is a seasoned campaigner and Asia’s richest banker. No wonder then that Ghosh is falling in line with a central bank command, while Kotak is suing. 
Chandra Shekhar Ghosh is a new arrival on India’s banking scene. Billionaire Uday Kotak is a seasoned campaigner and Asia’s richest banker. No wonder then that Ghosh is falling in line with a central bank command, while Kotak is suing.
The disputes concern the founders’ maximum permissible ownership. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is pushing the largest shareholders of Ghosh’s Bandhan Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd to dilute their stakes because it doesn’t want a single powerful entity to control any deposit-taking institution.
Ghosh tried to avoid dilution, but is now surrendering.
Kotak has been stalling for a long time, but has now turned mutinous.
Take Bandhan Bank first. Ghosh founded it as a non-bank finance company, focusing on small-ticket advances to tiny businesses and other borrowers typically ignored by the formal banking system.
RBI selected the shadow lender as one of two successful applicants (out of 25) to be a deposit-taking commercial lender. The condition was that in three years, the holding company—Bandhan Financial Holdings Ltd—had to pare its stake in the bank to 40%.
After Bandhan Bank’s initial public offering (IPO) last March, the holding company was still left with 82.28%, locked in for a year under Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) rules. When RBI’s August deadline came, the holding company owned 42% more than the central bank would allow, but the stock-market regulator wouldn’t let it sell before March 2019.
As a punishment, RBI suspended Bandhan Bank’s ability to open new branches without approval, and froze Ghosh’s pay. The bank’s shares, on a tear until early August, lost two-fifths of their value in less than three months. Left with no choice, Bandhan Bank this week announced a merger with Gruh Finance Ltd, a home loan company. Bandhan’s holding company will get diluted to 61% (still 21% above the stipulated maximum), and 15% of the combined entity will be owned by Gruh’s parent Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC), which will seek RBI’s permission to retain its stake. If the request is denied, it will have to drop below 10%.
Bandhan Bank shareholders are naturally disappointed by both the dilution, and the threat of more selling pressure. Even then, Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Gaurav Jangale are calling it a “blessing in disguise"". The addition of Gruh’s secured mortgages will make the microfinance lender’s book of unsecured loans less risky.
Kotak’s case is more complicated. He got a licence in 2003, under a policy that mandated a controlling shareholder—known as “promoter"" in India—can never go below 40%. New guidelines in 2005 capped promoter ownership at 10%, though. In 2008, Kotak Mahindra Bank was given six months to come up with an action plan.
Then began long years of futile letter-writing, punctuated by another regulatory change in 2013 requiring promoter shareholding to drop to 15% within 12 years of operations. Other lenders, such as IndusInd Bank Ltd complied, though Uday Kotak kept resisting, kept winning new deadlines, and kept getting wealthier.
The last straw was in August when Kotak Mahindra sold  ₹ 500 crore ($72 million) of perpetual non-cumulative preference shares so that Uday Kotak could retain his 30% equity. When RBI said preference shares won’t count toward dilution, the lender dragged the regulator to court.
A victory for either party would be pyrrhic. If RBI wins, one of India’s few well-run banks will see a period of avoidable uncertainty, especially if desperation pushes Kotak Mahindra Bank into a merger with other lenders. A loss for RBI would dim its prestige as the banking regulator just as it faces pressure to toe the government’s line.
Shaktikanta Das, the new RBI governor, should take a practical view. The Indian banking industry is a mess with more than $200 billion in non-performing loans.
But the stress, or how it’s handled, isn’t correlated with ownership. State-run banks are in trouble partly because of “phone banking""—a pejorative reference to politicians calling bank chairmen to request loans for cronies. Private-sector banks have fewer bad debts, even if two of their chief executive officers (CEOs) have been shown the door by RBI for trying to hide them.
A third left after being accused of a conflict of interest. Two of these were professional managers; the third is a co-founder.
Internationally, research shows that concentrated ownership “significantly reduces"" banks’ non-performing loan ratios.
Still, it’s hard to conclude that managers with skin in the game will always play responsibly. Take Bandhan Bank again. What business did Ghosh, a microfinance specialist, have lending money to the failed infrastructure lender IL&FS Group?
Rather than impose one-size-fits-all numbers on ownership concentration, RBI should invest in more alert supervision of banks’ risk management, culture and conduct."
134,2019-01-16,Kotak,"There is also a growing clamour, among those associated with the ruling dispensation, for ensuring that the certain amount of indigenous control is maintained in the banking sector

New Delhi: Kotak Mahindra Bank’s case against an RBI decision on promoter stake dilution is likely to come up for hearing before the Bombay High Court on Thursday amid a growing clamour for a review of the central bank’s ownership guidelines for home-grown private sector lenders. 
New Delhi: Kotak Mahindra Bank’s case against an RBI decision on promoter stake dilution is likely to come up for hearing before the Bombay High Court on Thursday amid a growing clamour for a review of the central bank’s ownership guidelines for home-grown private sector lenders.
There is also a growing clamour, among those associated with the ruling dispensation, for ensuring that the certain amount of indigenous control is maintained in the banking sector even while welcoming the foreign capital and any stake dilution should be left to market evolution rather than forcing it.
As the debate continues on the RBI rules, which require private lenders to reduce their promoter holding eventually to 15% over a period of time, one of the newest banks in the country, Bandhan Bank, recently announced a merger with HDFC Group’s Gruh Finance Ltd in a share-swap deal.
Some experts have said that one of the key reasons for Bandhan Bank opting for this deal was to meet the RBI rules, especially after it had to face some curbs by the central bank last year for failing to reduce the promoter stake to 40 per cent within three years of operation.
The rules require a bank to cut the promoter stake to 40 per cent within 3 years, 20 per cent within 10 years and then to 15 per cent within 15 years.
In case of Kotak Mahindra Bank, it was asked to cut the promoter stake to 20 per cent by December 31, 2018, from 30 per cent earlier, and eventually to 15 per cent by March 2020.
In August, the bank announced an issue of PNCP (Perpetual Non Convertible Preference) shares to bring down the promoters’ holding to 19.7 per cent.
However, the regulator did not approve of this method of stake dilution, after which the bank filed an appeal with the Bombay High Court challenging the RBI decision. Earlier in December, the court had refused to grant any interim relief to the bank. Experts supporting the RBI stand opine that the promoter stake dilution is aimed at ensuring that voting power is not concentrated in the hands of a single group and that all banks have complied with the rule.
They also assert that the RBI communicated its stand to Kotak Mahindra Bank through a letter in August itself, but the lender went to court when the deadline was approaching.
During an earlier hearing in the case, the counsel for the bank had argued that the RBI in the past asked it to only dilute promoter shareholding of its paid-up capital, but the impugned letter sought dilution of paid-up voting equity capital.
As the case continues in the court, some experts have been seeking a review of the central bank’s ownership guidelines for the country’s private sector lenders.
The Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), a right-leaning think tank, said in a recent report that it is high time for a review of regulations and legislations and for re-working the model of governance and ownership norms for Indian private sector banks.
The Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM) also said recently there was an urgent need for a rethink on the regulatory framework for private bank ownership so that it remains in Indian hands.
“None of us want Indian homegrown banks to go into hands of foreign players,"" the SJM said.
The CEPR said the objective should be to form regulations that leads to creation of global giants like JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Santander within India.
It said these global giants were set up by families or individuals who diluted promoter stakes as a natural corollary to their success, growth and eventual scale over a period.
Only such an enabling environment will help well-run banks such as HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank reach a global scale that serves India’s interests as the world’s fastest growing large economy, the think-tank added.
Leading corporate legal firm Corporate Professionals’ founder Pavan Kumar Vijay said there is a need to increase competition in the banking space and that calls for a review of the ownership guidelines, which have been a cause for non-participation to obtain license.
He said the review is required more specifically around the maximum permissible stake promoters can have and it needs to be raised from 15 per cent to at least 26 per cent, which would be at par with the voting right cap.
The CEPR said it is time for India to commit to building robust Indian banking and financial institutions by training the spotlight significantly and perhaps solely on applying the ‘fit and proper’ criteria of bank ownership, which is typically the case in mature banking markets.

The Bombay high court will hear on 12 March Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd’s petition challenging the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) rejection of its proposal to reduce promoter shareholding. The central bank had asked all banks to reduce promoter stake to 20% of paid-up capital by 31 December 2018, and 15% by 31 March 2020.

According to BSE data, promoters held 30.02% in Kotak Mahindra Bank as on 30 September. 
After the central bank rejected Kotak’s proposal to reduce stake through an issue of perpetual non-convertible preference shares (PNCPS), the bank challenged the move in Bombay high court on 10 December.
Earlier on 17 December, the high court had refused to pass any order, but granted Kotak interim relief by extending the RBI deadline of 31 December, 2018. It had also directed the RBI to file an affidavit in response to the petition by 17 January. 
When the case came up for hearing on Thursday before a division bench of Justices B.P. Dharmadhikari and Revati Mohite Dere, the central bank lawyer requested more time to reply to the Kotak petition, which was granted.
Mumbai-based Law firm Manilal Kher Ambalal & Co. along with senior counsel Harish Salve appeared for Kotak Mahindra Bank, while the central bank is advised by Udeshi & Co. along with senior counsel Venkatesh Dhond. 
The bank in its petition has argued that “The impugned reduction communications and the 2018 RBI letter have been issued by the RBI without authority of law, contrary to the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, Article 14 and Article 19 (1) (G) of the Constitution of India."" 
However, at the last hearing, the central bank lawyer had argued that every bank has complied with the promoter shareholding dilution requirement.
Kotak Bank had earlier said it was looking to raise as much as  ₹ 500 crore by issuing PNCPS to dilute the promoter shareholding. The RBI had mandated the bank to reduce its promoter shareholding to 20% of paid-up capital by 31 December 2018, and 15% by 31 March 2020. According to the BSE website, the promoter group’s stake in the bank stood at 30.02% as on 30 September."

131,2019-01-22,Kotak,"Kotak Mahindra Bank reported an year-on-year increase of 23% in net profit growth because it wrote back provisions worth  ₹287 croreThe private sector lender ’s gross bad loan ratio fell to 2.07% and its net bad loan ratio slipped to 0.71%.

The sharp fall in bond yields during the December quarter has reaped profits for Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd literally. The private sector lender reported an year-on-year increase of 23% in net profit growth because it wrote back provisions worth  ₹287 crore it had made previously towards mark-to-market losses.
Had this write-back opportunity not been available, Kotak Mahindra Bank’s profit would have shown a 1.4% year-on-year decline instead of the impressive 23% rise. Its operating profit grew by a modest 6.5%, and has sequentially dropped.
But the lender is not alone in write-backs. HDFC Bank Ltd too did write-backs and other lenders would also do because bond yields had eased 60 basis points during the third quarter. Fall in yields generates mark-to-market gains for banks. Investors rewarded Kotak Mahindra Bank for its net profit growth by driving up the shares 2.7% on Monday.
That said, its profit growth is not hollow because the bank’s core income grew 23% and its net interest margin improved to 4.33%. The lender’s loan book grew 23% and it was not driven mainly by retail as is the case with most banks. While the corporate loan book grew by a strong 26%, commercial vehicle loans grew 36% and even retail personal loans and credit cards grew at that same pace
A strong loan growth contributes in a big way to low bad loan ratios. This has been true for private sector lenders such as HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and even IndusInd Bank Ltd. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s gross bad loan ratio fell to 2.07% and its net bad loan ratio slipped to 0.71%. These are enviable ratios that show pristine asset quality, although there are some scratches visible.
One, provisions towards loan assets have risen by 50% from a year ago and the lender has beefed up the coverage ratio by a massive 12.7 percentage points to 66.2%. This shows that the bank is anticipating stress and has prudently provided for it.
Another concern for investors is that SMA-2 (special mention accounts) outstanding has more than doubled from the previous quarter to  ₹344 crore for the lender. These are accounts where borrowers have not paid back for two months in a row. They are the most susceptible to turn bad and attract provisioning.
Having said that, investors seem to think the low bad loan ratios and a strong growth trajectory along with a comfortable liability profile are reason enough to back the premium that the Kotak Mahindra Bank stock commands. The stock trades at a multiple of nearly five times its estimated book value for FY20. That makes it the most expensive banking stock. Valuations may well have been higher but for the drag on earnings from subsidiaries such as Kotak Mahindra Prime, Kotak Capital and Kotak Securities. The group’s insurance arm has more than made up for this by generating  ₹125 crore net profit in the quarter.
As far as the lender goes, an overhang on the stock is the ongoing shareholding issue wherein promoter Uday Kotak has missed the deadline to bring his stake down. The bank has dragged the regulator to court and investors are awaiting more clarity. This explains the 10% correction in the stock from its highs in July last year."

New Delhi: The government will soon approach the RBI seeking a special dispensation for deferment of provisioning requirements for bank loans extended to some IL&FS group firms amid ongoing efforts to monetise assets of the crisis-hit group, official sources said Tuesday.
Some companies of the diversified IL&FS group, which has debt burden of over  ₹91,000 crore, have failed to repay loans. Following the crisis at IL&FS late last year that raised concerns over liquidity in the system, the corporate affairs ministry had superseded its board.
The sources said efforts to monetise certain assets of IL&FS are progressing and the group is expected to come out of the woods in the next four to five months.
Against this backdrop, the sources said the ministry would soon approach the RBI seeking dispensation for deferment of provisioning of loans with respect to some IL&FS group firms.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has strict norms in place regarding non-performing assets for banks and a relaxation is expected to help the government in getting more time to resolve problems at IL&FS.
The sources said the government has identified a few IL&FS subsidiaries having ample funds in their escrow accounts but are unable to service their debt obligations.
The government is likely to cite the current situation, including availability of funds in escrow accounts of certain IL&FS companies, for seeking the special dispensation, they added.
On Tuesday, the ministry reviewed the progress made in dealing with the problems at the group.
Following the series of defaults by some group companies, the government superseded the board and appointed seasoned banker and Kotak Mahindra Bank MD Uday Kotak as chairman in October 2018.
The IL&FS group companies are estimated to have outstanding loans of about  ₹60,000 crore to banks and financial institutions, while the total debt is over  ₹91,000 crore.
State-owned LIC is the single largest shareholder in IL&FS group with 25.34% while Japan's Orix Corporation owns 23.50% shareholding.

126,2019-02-10,Kotak,"PVR appoints Kotak Mahindra Capital and CLSA to manage the fundraising processPVR claims to have 32% market share of Hollywood box office and 22% of Bollywood box office 

MUMBAI :
PVR Ltd has held conversations with various investors in recent weeks as India’s largest multiplex operator looks to raise around $100 million through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) offering, said two people aware of the development.
“PVR has appointed investment banks Kotak Mahindra Capital and CLSA to manage the fundraising process. They have held domestic road shows to meet investors and they are likely to launch the offering soon, if market conditions are supportive for a trade. The company plans to use the funds for various purposes, including pursuit of inorganic growth,"" said the first person cited above, requesting anonymity.
On 21 December, PVR’s board had approved raising up to  ₹750 crore through an issuance of equity shares via multiple routes, including a QIP.
QIP is a capital-raising tool through which listed companies can sell shares, fully and partly convertible debentures, or any securities other than warrants that are convertible into stocks, to a qualified institutional buyer.
The resolution has received approval from its shareholders, the company informed stock exchanges on 30 January. Stock exchange filings by PVR show that it held meeting with various institutional investors on 5 and 6 February, while towards the end of January, it met investors in Singapore and Hong Kong.
PVR and CLSA declined to comment on the development. An email sent to Kotak Mahindra Capital did not elicit any response till press time.
PVR operates 748 screens across 161 locations in 64 cities as on 23 January, according to its latest investor presentation. It claims to have a 32% market share of Hollywood box office and 22% share of Bollywood box office in the year ended 31 March.
For the nine months ended 31 December, PVR reported revenue of  ₹2,272.5 crore, a jump of 28% over the revenue recorded in the same period last year. Between April and December 2018, it reported profit of  ₹141.62 crore, up 44% from the corresponding period of the last financial year.
PVR has focused on inorganic growth and has grown to its current leadership position on the back of several strategic acquisitions.
Last year, it had acquired a majority stake in South India-based multiplex chain SPI Cinemas, which operated 76 screens across 17 properties in 10 cities under brands such as Sathyam, Escape, The Cinema and S2 Cinema, for  ₹633 crore in an all-cash deal.
Last August, The Economic Times reported that the company is also in talks to acquire North India’s Wave Cinemas, which could fetch a price tag of  ₹450 crore.
In 2016, it acquired 32 screens from real estate developer DLF, which operated under the DT Cinemas, for around  ₹433 crore. In 2012, it acquired Mumbai-based Cinemax Ltd for  ₹395 crore."
125,2019-02-15,Kotak,"Infrastructure logjam needs to be removedGovernment needs to create bigger local private equity pool

Mumbai: India should kick-start private investment via policy measures or tax breaks if it does not want to stay stuck at a 7% growth rate, Uday Kotak, managing director and chief executive of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, told CNBCTV18 in an interview.
""India has the fundamental capacity and we need to create a situation where the ground capacity will be growing at somewhere between 8 and 9%,"" he said on the sidelines of an event organised by Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.
The Reserve Bank of India earlier in the month moderated its growth forecast to 7.2-7.4% for the April-September period, after economic growth in the country fell to a worse-than-expected 7.1% in the July-September quarter.
""We have got to really fix that piece because the key is private investment,"" Kotak said, late on Thursday in the interview.
The government's decision in November 2016 to suddenly ban large banknotes, so-called demonetisation, and the abrupt implementation of goods and services tax (GST) six months later, hit businesses hard.
The infrastructure logjam that has occurred due to a lack of liquidity in the system, also needs to be removed, said Kotak, whom the government hand-picked to lead major infrastructure financing and construction firm IL&FS after a string of defaults from the firm triggered fears of a liquidity crisis in the non-banking financial company (NBFC) sector.
The IL&FS imbroglio dried up lending from NBFCs at a time when private companies were already dealing with reluctant banks wary of lending due to their massive bad debt woes.
Kotak said that due to the IL&FS debacle, the current situation was fragile, but he added that it was more due to investor fears than a systemic problem.
Still, analysts at brokerage firm Ambit said in a report on Friday that India was headed for a consumption-led slowdown as seen from multiple sector indicators.

MUMBAI :
Banker Uday Kotak opined that technology majors like Google and Facebook should not be allowed to become banks as they don't like to be regulated.
He said banking is a business with a high degree of leverage involving public trust and continues to be synonymous with safety.
""If a Google or a Facebook ever decided to be a bank, we have a problem...They don't want to be as regulated as we are,"" Kotak, who heads Kotak Mahindra Bank said while speaking at the annual Nasscom leadership summit here Wednesday.
The comments come amid an aggressive play and keen interest by the global tech giants like Google with its payment platform Google Pay in the domestic financial sector, especially through payment services offerings.
Kotak said banks work at a leverage of 10:1 wherein they lend out  ₹10 for every rupee of capital which they have. It is a high risk business, but perceived to be safe, Kotak said, stressing banks have ""no choice"" but to manage the risks well.
He also hinted that young people are a bit adventurous with their investments and often put money into risky bets. But fortunately, a large pot of money is with the old people who allocate the resources very judiciously.
Kotak advised young fintech players and startups to enter the fray assuming that they will fail, as 99% of new entities fail.
Stating that banks and other entrenched financial services players should not be complacent in facing competition by young companies out to disrupt the game, he said within a week of demonetisation, a ""relatively unknown"" company became a common place across the masses, hinting at Paytm.
""It shook us out of our slumber,"" he said, adding this had the his bank soon launching the 8/11 account opening drive which gave it good business as it helped address the opportunities in the mass segment from the earlier mass premium segment.
Kotak also sounded peeved at the high cost of accessing IT services, exhorting software players to offer services at lower cost and said they need to offer services at 1-2% of the cost they are charging now.
He also rued that while the country has made a name for itself rendering software services to the world, there have not been enough product companies, resulting in multinationals to make a lot money.

122,2019-02-22,Kotak,"IDBI Bank sees wilful defaults more than double—from  ₹3,600 to  ₹7,381 crore—between Decembers of 2017 and 2018Govt has asked all banks to set up a separate fraud prevention wing to detect potential wilful defaults at an early stage

Mumbai: Despite lenders using the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and other means to recover loans and check defaults, most of them have seen a substantial jump in wilful defaults in 2018, shows data from Cibil.
Lenders were told by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2017 to refer more than three dozen defaulting companies to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). According to data from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), 1,484 cases have been admitted to the bankruptcy court between January 2017 and December 2018. These include referrals by financial creditors and operational creditors, besides the defaulting companies themselves.
The sharpest increase in wilful defaults among public sector banks was at loss-making IDBI Bank, which saw wilful defaults more than double—from  ₹3,660 crore to  ₹7,381 crore—between December 2017 and December 2018. This is more than 13% of the bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs).
Other public sector banks, such as Bank of India (BOI) and Bank of Maharashtra (BOM), are not too far behind. While BOI has seen 60% year-on-year (y-o-y) jump in wilful defaults to  ₹9,785 crore, BOM witnessed a 41% increase to  ₹1,385 crore. While data for State Bank of India (SBI) and its associates was not available as on 31 December 2018, they had the largest chunk of wilful defaults till September at  ₹37,250 crore.
A senior banker at one of India’s largest public sector banks, requesting anonymity, said lenders have been recognizing several large defaults over the last year and the process could have led to figuring out which ones have wilfully defaulted. “Moreover, after the finance ministry asked us to probe all bad loans above  ₹50 crore for fraud, we did forensic audits for all. The ones showing traces of fraudulent activity have been classified as wilful defaulters.""
Among private sector banks whose December 2018 data is available, Kotak Mahindra Bank stands out with wilful defaults of  ₹8,757 crore, 22% higher on a y-o-y basis. HDFC Bank has seen little change in the past one year with wilful defaults at  ₹465 crore in December 2018.
Another banker who did not want to be named said the government has asked all banks to set up a separate fraud prevention wing to detect these cases at an early stage. “We are in discussions with the Indian Banks’ Association to form common guidelines with regard to fraud and wilful defaults so that banks do not follow different procedures.""
A borrower is tagged a wilful defaulter if he/she fails to meet repayment obligations despite having the capacity to repay. Other instances include not utilizing the loan for the specific purpose for which it was taken, and instead, diverting it for other purposes.
The RBI has also mandated banks to submit a list of suit-filed accounts and non-suit filed accounts of wilful defaulters of  ₹25 lakh or more at least every month to credit information firms like Cibil.
The evidence of wilful default is examined by a committee of high ranking bank executives. If the committee concludes that wilful default has happened, it issues a show cause notice to the borrower, and after considering their submissions, issues an order, which is reviewed by another committee comprising the managing director or the chief executive officer, and two independent directors. The order becomes final only after it is confirmed by this review committee."

NEW DELHI :
After a nudge from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to lower their marginal cost of funds-based lending rates (MCLR) following a cut in the repo rate, at least five banks have already reduced interest rates by 5-10 basis points while other banks are likely to follow suit soon.
India’s largest bank, the State Bank of India (SBI), which has shied away from revising its MCLR, reduced interest rates for home loans of up to  ₹30 lakh by 5 basis points (bps) last month.
During the day, state-owned Bank of Baroda (BoB) announced that it will cut its benchmark lending rate by 0.1 percentage points with effect from March 7. BoB's MCLR for overnight and one-month tenors would be 8.25% and 8.30%, respectively.
During the last few days, Punjab National Bank (PNB), Allahabad Bank, Kotak Mahindra and Union Bank of India have also cut their MCLR.
With effect from March 1, state-owned PNB has reduced the MCLR by 0.10 percentage point for loans of various tenors. The interest rate on one-year tenor loans, against which most of the bank's consumer loans are benchmarked, has been cut to 8.45% from 8.55%, while the three-year MCLR has been cut to 8.65%.
Union Bank of India (UBI) has similarly reduced its lending rate by 10 bps. The state-run bank’s one-year MCLR or the minimum lending rate, against which most consumer loans are benchmarked, has been decreased to 8.60% from 8.70%.
Unlike PNB, UBI has also lowered its base rate by 10 bps to 9%.
Allahabad Bank has also cut its MCLR by 10 basis points for all loan tenures up to three years.
Among private sector banks, Kotak Mahindra Bank has lowered its lending rate by 5 basis points, taking its new one-year MCLR to 9%.
IANS reported today that four other PSU banks and a private bank are in the process of announcing rate cuts.
In its bi-monthly policy review last month, the RBI had cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25%. Citing higher credit cost due to massive NPA piles and the resultant churning of margins, banks have, however, been reluctant in passing the benefit of RBI rate cuts to borrowers. Mint had reported last month that the heads of public and private sector banks have sought time from RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das to pass benefits of the RBI repo rate cut to borrowers."

117,2019-03-12,Kotak,"Private banks have over the past five years eaten into market share of public sector banks in savings depositsSBI, on account of its sheer size, may be able to protect its base, but its peers will suffer, should they choose to follow

India’s largest bank has bitten the bullet on making interest rates more pliable to changes in policy rates. State Bank of India (SBI) has linked the rate on the stickiest of its products, savings bank deposits, to the benchmark repo rate. The change applies to deposits exceeding  ₹1 lakh in value.
It is natural that when SBI’s cost of deposits comes down, so would lending rates. Ergo, the regulator’s complaints on poor transmission seem to have been addressed.
SBI’s move to link its savings rate to the policy rate, at a time when the probability of an RBI rate cut is high, makes smart business sense. Margins may improve immediately and the fact that savings deposits are sticky will ensure SBI doesn’t lose its customers.
Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities note that the difference between the current savings rate and the estimated repo rate-linked one has narrowed in recent times. “A variable interest rate does not necessarily mean a negative outcome for the customer as well,"" the firm said in a note.
In any case, the understanding is that savings accounts are a function of convenience and habit more than interest rates. But it may not be so simple and linear an argument.
The chart above shows that over the last five years, private banks have eaten into the market share of public sector peers in savings deposits. Incremental deposits are going to the likes of Kotak Mahindra Bank and Yes Bank, which offer higher interest rates than the 3.5% given by the remaining lenders.
Last week, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said in a television interview that 95% of its customers will not be impacted. However, by value, roughly one-third of the lender’s deposit base is estimated to get linked to the repo rate. That is because 80% of its savings deposits, which form 40% of its total deposits, will fall in the category of above  ₹1 lakh, an SBI official told BloombergQuint.
Large savings deposits can be traced to high net worth individuals and corporations. They are not as sticky as the rest of the crowd. SBI’s market share in savings deposits has largely remained unchanged over the last decade.
The same cannot be said about its peers. Public sector banks have lost a massive 2.58 percentage points market share over the last five years and private banks have gained 5.54 percentage points. SBI, by the sheer size of its franchise, may be able to protect its base, but its peers will suffer, should they choose to follow.
The move towards market benchmarking of deposit rates has begun. It would be interesting to see if the historic trend of stickiness persists, or if public sector lenders become big losers."
116,2019-03-12,Kotak,"Uday Kotak's wealth now stands at $11.4 billion mainly due to share price gains that have increased the value of his holding in KMB, currently 30%Kotak Mahindra Bank boasts one of the lowest NPA ratios and one the highest net interest margins among Indian banks

Mumbai: Going toe to toe with a powerful regulator isn’t normally good for your financial health. But it has proven to be profitable, on paper at least, for India’s billionaire banker Uday Kotak.
The founder of Mumbai-based Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. has seen his wealth nearly triple since March 2014, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said he failed to meet the first of its successive milestones to reduce his stake in the bank. His wealth now stands at $11.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, mainly due to share price gains that have increased the value of his holding in KMB, currently 30%.
The latest RBI deadline was for Kotak to reduce his holding below 20% by the end of last year, part of the regulator’s industrywide efforts to reduce the influence of founding shareholders in Indian banks. Kotak Mahindra is taking legal action to contest that, arguing that a sale last year of  ₹500 crore ($72 million) in preference shares complies with central bank rules. A new hearing is due to take place on the bank’s motion later Tuesday in the Bombay High Court.
Kotak Mahindra shares have outperformed those of most of its peers, thanks to the bank’s success in avoiding some of the asset quality concerns that have weighed on many of the country’s lenders. KMB boasts one of the lowest bad-loan ratios and one the highest net interest margins among Indian banks, making its shares the best performer in the NSE Nifty Bank Index over the past five years.
“Uday Kotak seems to delay implementation of the shareholding rules as much as he can, adding billions to his wealth in the process,"" said independent analyst Hemindra Hazari, who writes for the Smartkarma platform. “Had he followed the timelines, he would have had to sell his shares for far less a price than today.""
Last year, the High Court refused to shield Kotak Mahindra from any penalties that might be imposed by the RBI over the failure to cut Uday Kotak’s equity stake below 20%. In September, the central bank ordered Bandhan Bank Ltd. not to raise Chief Executive Officer Chandra Shekhar Ghosh’s salary and restricted the lender from opening new branches without its approval after the bank failed to meet shareholding requirements.
“The actions of the bank have been in accordance with RBI’s communications, the needs of the company, and the law. It is incorrect to impute any motives to that,"" said Rohit Rao, KMB’s chief communication officer. He noted that the bank’s share price gains have accrued to all shareholders, not just its founder. “We are unable to comment further"" since the matter is subjudice before the Bombay High Court, he added.
Kotak Mahindra missed the original deadlines set by the bank for progressively reducing its founder’s stake in 2014 and 2016, though it did meet a dilution requirement set by the RBI in 2017, according to court documents.
Shareholders would lose out if Uday Kotak is forced to reduce his stake, according to J.N. Gupta, managing director of Stakeholder Empowerment Services, an investor advisory firm.
“Given the size of the bank, issuing equity to reduce the stake is impractical,"" Gupta said. “Selling the stake in the secondary market will also hurt investors as it will divert his attention from the bank. Either way, it will hurt.""
Uday Kotak will find a long queue of willing buyers for his shares if the court’s decision goes in favor of the regulator, said Ajay Bodke, head of investment strategy at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd. “His bank is a jewel in the crown of the Indian banking sector."""
115,2019-03-12,Kotak,"Kotak Mahindra Bank is asking the court to approve its issuance of preference shares as a way to dilute its founder’s stake and is arguing that RBI’s demands are against the public interestRBI says the lender and not the founder of the bank chose to file a complaint against it shows ‘the need to make private banks more independent and not reflect the interests of one individual’

India’s central bank is warning that its authority could be undermined if courts rule against it in a case involving a major private-sector lender.
Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.’s legal petition against the Reserve Bank of India’s objection to the method used by the founder to pare his stake in the lender, if granted, would weaken its regulatory authority, according to the RBI. Billionaire founder Uday Kotak, who currently holds 30% of the bank, has missed multiple milestones to reduce his stake in the lender, as mandated by the central bank. The RBI required his holding to be cut below 20% by December.
The private lender is asking the court to approve its issuance of preference shares as a way to dilute its founder’s stake and is arguing that the central bank’s demands are against the public interest. The preference share sale has already been rejected by the RBI.
“The reliefs sought in the petition, if granted, shall result in making inroads into the RBI’s autonomy, and to permit the petitioners and others to become regulators of their own selves,"" the RBI said in a petition to the Bombay High Court, a copy of which has been seen by Bloomberg News.
The central bank has been in tussle with Kotak since 2014 when it said he failed to meet the first milestone to reduce his stake in the bank. The RBI has been trying to separate the management and ownership functions at the nation’s lenders to improve corporate governance, and the case before the courts could force a reinterpretation of ownership restrictions governing local banks.
An RBI spokesman didn’t respond to a telephone call and email seeking comment, while a Kotak spokesman asked for more time to respond.
That the lender and not the founder of the bank chose to file a complaint against the RBI shows “the need to make private banks more independent and not reflect the interests of one individual,"" the central bank also wrote in its submission to the court.
Stake dilution
Kotak Mahindra missed the original deadlines set by the bank for progressively reducing its founder’s stake in 2014 and 2016, though it did meet a dilution requirement set by the RBI in 2017, according to court documents.
The bank will pledge that its founder’s voting rights will be in line with RBI’s ownership rules until May 2020, Harish Salve, a lawyer representing Kotak Mahindra said in a Bombay High Court hearing on Tuesday. The central bank had ordered Kotak to cut his stake in the bank to 20% by December and further reduce it to 15% after May 2020.
The lender also sought an interim protection in the matter. The court will hear further arguments in the case on April 1
The banking regulator’s policy on founder’s shareholding is “inconsistent, unreasonable, arbitrary"" and as applied to Kotak Mahindra is “contrary to public interest,"" the lender’s lawyers said in its petition last year.
The RBI said in its petition that the lender has given various reasons for not meeting the central bank’s order, including its market capitalization, volatility and the global slowdown. “Overall, these tactics were nothing but a way to run down the clock,"" it said.

114,2019-03-13,Kotak,"Kotak Mahindra Bank says ready to cap promoter voting rights at 20% despite holding 30% stakeBombay HC declines stay on RBI deadline for Uday Kotak to reduce stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank

Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd on Tuesday told the Bombay high court that its promoters are ready to give an undertaking to cap their voting rights at 20% despite holding a 30% stake in the private lender to allay concerns of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on concentration of power.
Kotak Mahindra Bank moved the Bombay high court after RBI rejected its proposal to issue perpetual non-convertible preference shares in August to comply with rules concerning promoter shareholding. Billionaire founder Uday Kotak, who holds about 30% of the bank, has been asked by RBI to lower his stake to 20% by the end of December 2018 and to 15% by March 2020.
While the next hearing on the case has been scheduled for 1 April, RBI’s senior counsel Venkatesh Dhond sought a week’s time to file an affidavit in response to the bank’s writ petition.
The case, being heard by a two-judge bench of Justices B.P. Dharmadhikari and Sarang V. Kotwal, is being closely watched as it is the first time that a bank has moved court on a RBI directive.
The court observed that the matter is not so simple that interim relief can be provided and declined to grant a stay on the deadline set by RBI.
In December, Dhond said the dilution of promoter stake is aimed at ensuring that voting power is not concentrated in the hands of a single group and all banks have complied with the rule.
In a similar case, RBI earlier froze salaries of Bandhan Bank chief executive and founder Chandra Shekhar Ghosh and also denied the private lender permission to open branches.
A 10 March 2019 PTI report said RBI is reviewing ownership norms for private banks. RBI is looking at either setting up a panel to review these norms or granting more time to meet these rules, it said."

111,2019-03-22,Kotak,"DSP MF has made it mandatory for its staff to make new investments in own schemes onlyThe firm believes that its staffs must walk the talk on the advice given to the investors to avoid investing directly in the asset classes, and instead use the scheme of DSP MF as an investment vehicle

In a move that the fund house has described as ‘eating the same food that we serve to our customers and build complete skin in the game’, DSP Investment Managers Pvt. Ltd (DSPIM) has prohibited employees from making any direct investments in shares, bonds, debentures and derivatives of a company and made it mandatory for its employees to make any incremental investments only in the schemes of DSP Mutual Fund.
“It demonstrates conviction in our own funds and takes away the distractions that come with owning a direct portfolio that has a different volatility profile,"" said Kalpen Parekh, president, DSP Investment Managers Pvt. Ltd. “We are in a fiduciary business and we espouse mutual funds as the most efficient way to invest. When we dissuade investors from investing directly in an asset class, then as people who are in the responsible position of dealing with people’s hard earned money, we need to walk the talk—not just in letter but also in spirit,"" he added.
Existing investments of the employees, whether in mutual funds or other securities, may continue. Any systematic investment plans already registered may also continue. However, switch-out of such investments or any change in such systematic registrations are not permitted. Employees can make investments in third-party mutual funds schemes in categories where DSP Mutual Fund currently does not offer a product. While employees are not allowed to make any additional investment in securities, they can invest in initial public offerings and follow-on public offerings. Investments in fixed deposits, insurance policies, public provident fund and postal saving schemes are exempt from this directive.
Parekh says that it is important to demonstrate reasonable skin in the game. “If our design and execution of product and the fund management is right, then as investors, we will also benefit,"" he said.
DSPIM is not the first to come out with such restrictions. In 2015, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. Ltd initiated this policy for its own investors. When we asked Nilesh Shah, managing director of the company, on how that policy had fared, he said, “We structured it as a voluntary pledge. When we started this initiative, we were a small company looking to grow big. That brought people together. Now, we have grown significantly over the last four years and growth has been faster than the industry. Despite this, people who have come in later have also been willing to take the pledge. So they must be seeing some value in it.""
But how will employees feel about staying tied to a scheme that is doing poorly? “Our funds’ performance has been in line with others in the industry. If performance was bad, it may have been difficult to retain the employees on the pledge,"" said Shah.
“There may be points in time when the funds don’t do well and our money faces the same pain that the investors face. We made it mandatory for employees to make incremental investments only in our own schemes so that there is no easy route out, and to force ourselves to constantly strengthen our platform and create value for all the investors,"" said Parekh.
PPFAS Asset Management Co. Ltd, another early convert to this philosophy, has a different take on this. “We encourage our employees to invest in the fund so that they are better equipped to handle the queries and give advice. At no stage is anyone forced to do it,"" said Neil Parag Parikh, chairman and CEO, PPFAS AMC Ltd. They have taken it a step further and made the information on employee holdings available on their website and it is updated every month. “This transparency builds the confidence of the unitholders where they can track the investment activities of key employees,"" said Parikh. Currently, 7.5% of the flagship scheme, Parag Parikh Long Term Equity fund, is held by its employees. But he does not believe that making this exercise mandatory is the right way to go. “We have only two offerings—a liquid fund and an equity fund—and it may not fit into the employee’s needs. The decision to invest has to be made keeping in mind the asset allocation and risk-taking ability of the individual,"" said Parikh.
Others have also raised concerns on the legality of such a move that restricts the employee’s choice. “Such policies could be questioned as being coercive and more importantly could be seen as reflective of trust deficit that the organization has on its own products. However, the situation would differ if the employees are incentivised (by way of beneficial conditions) while investing in the products offered by their employer,"" said Nitin Sharma, legal head in a large multinational company.
“Policies containing restrictive covenants like these could run afoul of the law of the land, including the rights granted under the Constitution. Further, restricting employees to investing only in investment products of their employing entity may also have to be assessed from the standpoint of insider trading regulations and any sector-specific legal requirements (by the Securities and Exchange Board of India), if any,"" he added.
But Kalpen Parekh believes that it will lead to self-selection for the company. “The right talent that believes in this ideology will find us as a great place to work at and see that the intent is to make sure that the best ideas come into the funds’ portfolios for the advantage of all investors instead of personal portfolios. If we are advocating the DSP funds to our investors, then it must hold good for us too,"" he said. He believes that this will help maintain the best fiduciary standards in the industry that will reflect well on all who are part of this.
The move by fund houses to demonstrate conviction by putting their money where their mouth is will no doubt bolster investors’ confidence in the schemes. But investors should stay with an evaluation process that would identify the scheme that is best aligned to their needs and risk preference, and use any information on employees’ holdings in the scheme as one more data point to consider while making an investment or exit decision in a scheme."
110,2019-03-26,Kotak,"Fortis, which owns 57% stake in SRL Diagnostics, is in the process of hiring Kotak Mahindra Bank to manage the stake salesOne of the key parts of the IHH-Fortis deal was to provide exits to private equity investors in SRL Diagnostics

New Delhi: Fortis Healthcare Ltd is facilitating the sale of stakes owned by private equity investors in its SRL Diagnostics unit, two people aware of the matter said. Fortis, which owns 57% in SRL Diagnostics, is in the process of hiring Kotak Mahindra Bank as an investment banker to manage the transaction, one of the two people said on condition of anonymity.
While IHH Healthcare Bhd, the new owner of Fortis, had earlier planned to buy out the private equity firms, the Malaysian company has decided against it because of the legal wrangle between Japanese drug maker Daiichi Sankyo Co. Ltd and the Singh brothers, the founders of Fortis, said the people cited earlier.
Private equity investors Resurgence Fund (7.5%), IFC (7.5%), New York Jacob Ballas Fund (16%) and other shareholders (12%) own around 43% in SRL Diagnostics. “As is normally the process, activities pertaining to the IM (information memorandum) approaching potential interested parties, etc. will play out over the next few months,"" the first person said.
SRL Diagnostics’ revenue growth trailed that of its rivals in the year ended 31 March 2018. While Thyrocare Technologies Ltd and Dr Lal PathLabs Ltd grew revenues by 17.1% and 16%, respectively, SRL’s revenue rose by just 7.4%.
When IHH took over Fortis, one of the key parts of the deal was to provide exits to the private equity investors.
In the face of legal complications that delayed the open offer for Fortis, IHH’s vision to overhaul it seems to have run into rough weather. According to the agreement to acquire control of Fortis, IHH’s fund infusion was also to be used to buy out the stake of private equity players in SRL Diagnostics.
“The dialogue on SRL didn’t materalize. However, the window is still open. IHH can jump in at any time,"" said the second person, requesting anonymity. Fortis has an obligation to provide an exit to the private equity investors, according to the terms of the investment contract.
An IHH spokesperson declined to comment on what he termed as market speculation. Emails sent to SRL Diagnostics and Fortis remained unswered till publishing of this story.
In July 2018, IHH Healthcare won a bidding war to acquire Fortis and completed the deal in November, buying a 31.1% stake through preferential allotment of shares. To stabilize the business, IHH infused  ₹4,000 crore into Fortis, but an additional  ₹3,400 crore put into an escrow account to initiate an open offer is stuck due to a Supreme Court-ordered status quo on the IHH-Fortis deal in December.
The Supreme Court had put on hold the IHH-Fortis deal, ordering a status quo with regard to sale following a contempt plea moved by Daiichi Sankyo against the Singh brothers, the former promoters of Fortis and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd."

Mumbai/New Delhi: Locked in a legal battle with RBI over promoter stake dilution issue, Kotak Mahindra Bank has alleged the regulator is ""unfairly"" creating an impression that the lender was trying to further promoter Uday Kotak's interest.
Countering an affidavit filed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the Bombay High Court, where it has challenged a regulatory directive, Kotak Mahindra Bank said, “The reply unfairly seeks to create an impression that the promoters’ interest is being furthered through the petition and seeks to question the locus standi of the petitioners (the bank) in challenging the Reduction Communications.""
RBI had asked the bank to cut promoter shareholding to 20 per cent of paid up capital by December 31, 2018, and 15 per cent by March 31, 2020.
As on December 31, 2018, Uday Kotak, the bank’s vice chairman and managing director, held 29.72 per cent stake in the bank.
The lender in August 2018 had proposed perpetual non-cumulative preference shares (PNCPS) to cut promoter holding to 19.70 per cent, which the RBI rejected.
The bank has challenged RBI’s contention in the Bombay High Court, which is hearing the matter.
The RBI’s bank licensing rules mandate that a private bank’s promoter will need to pare holding to 40 per cent within three years, 20 per cent within 10 years and to 15 per cent within 15 years.
The RBI has told the Bombay High Court that the bank has petitioned the court, and not the promoters whose shareholding the central bank has asked to be lowered.
The RBI’s decisions seek to regulate the shareholding rights of bank’s promoters, the central bank said.
“They (the promoters) have no issue with holding being regulated in the manner provided for by the RBI,"" the banking regulator had told the Bombay High Court in response to Kotak Mahindra Bank’s petition challenging RBI’s direction to trim promoter shareholding.
In response, Kotak Mahindra Bank has said in an affidavit filed with the court that if that were the case, “the RBI then cannot take any action against the petitioner (the bank) in relation to these matters (i.e. reduction of promoter shareholding)"".
The bank also said that in such a case, the regulator’s series of correspondence over several years with the bank, and not the promoter, becomes questionable.
“The RBI has wrongly addressed correspondence to the petitioner (the bank) over the years, wherein it has also threatened regulatory action,"" the bank said.
If the RBI’s stand that such matters related to or affect the bank’s promoters, then the RBI would have “no basis to initiate any action against the bank"" for not paring promoter shareholding.
Moreover, the bank told the court that RBI’s view “runs contrary to its own allegation that failure to reduce promoter shareholding would result in the bank being serious breach of law"".
The RBI has attempted to “unfairly allege"" that the bank needs to be more independent and not reflect the interest of just one individual or family is “mischievous, incorrect, ignores the high standards of governance of the bank,"" it added.
The bank denied the allegations and what it termed as “insinuations"" and said that “it also belittles the impact of the RBI’s unreasonable and arbitrary position"" on the bank, its shareholders, depositors and public at large.
The bank said reducing promoter shareholding would require to raise a “huge amount of capital not warranted for its business and growth which would be detrimental to all stake holders including the non-promoter shareholders and disruptive to the banking system"".
Any suggestion that the petition “is a device to benefit any vested interests is baseless, misconceived and devoid of any merit"".

107,2019-04-01,Kotak,"RBI had directed the bank to dilute the promoter's shareholding from around 30% to 20% by 2018 Earlier, the bank has requested the court to quash and set aside the RBI directions on equity dilution.  

Mumbai: The Bombay High Court Monday sought an affidavit from the promoters of Kotak Mahindra Bank stating that they have complied with the RBI's directive to dilute the promoter's shareholding.
A division bench of Justices A S Oka and M S Sanklecha was hearing a petition filed by the bank challenging an RBI directive of August 13, 2018.
The RBI had directed the bank to dilute the promoter's shareholding from around 30 per cent to a maximum of 20 per cent of its paid-up voting equity capital by December 31, 2018 and to 15 per cent by March 31, 2020.
The bench on Monday sought to know as to why the bank had approached the court and why the promoters have not challenged the RBI orders.
""The bank cannot be the aggrieved party here. The RBI is not going to take any action against the bank. The aggrieved party is the promoters. Why have they (promoters) not come to court in challenge against the RBI directive?"" Justice Oka said.
""In our view, if the promoters have not challenged the RBI directive, then the RBI is bound and free to take action,"" the court said.
The bank's counsel Darius Khambata on Monday told the court that the promoter share holding of the paid-up capital has been reduced to 19.7 per cent.
The bench, however, noted that such a statement should come from the promoters and not the bank.
""The promoters shall file an affidavit stating this,"" the court directed and posted the petition for hearing on April 22.
The high court had in the past on two hearings refused to grant any interim relief to the bank.
In the petition, the bank sought a widening of the definition of the paid-up equity capital to include the preference shares as well beyond the present equity voting capital.
It also questioned the laws related to capping of the shareholding at a more fundamental level, asking if there is a legal basis to have shareholding caps.
According to the bank's plea, the RBI had initially asked it to only dilute promoter shareholding of its paid-up capital. However, the impugned letter sought dilution of paid-up voting equity capital.
As per the plea, after receiving the letter from RBI, the bank wrote two letters -- one on September 4, 2018 to the RBI and the other on September 24, 2018 to the RBI governor -- seeking clarification, but did not get any reply.
On a previous hearing on December 17, 2018, RBI counsel Venkatesh Dhond had opposed the plea and had said the reason behind asking for promoter stake dilution was to ensure voting power is not in the hands of one single group.
The lender in its petition has termed the RBI's directive as ""arbitrary, without any authority of law and contrary to the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, and Article 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution"".
""Even assuming that the RBI has the power to issue directions requiring reduction of promoter shareholding in banking companies, the said power can only be exercised, and has always been exercised by the RBI, with reference to the petitioner's paid-up capital and not in relation to its paid- up voting equity capital,"" the petitioner has argued.
The bank has requested the court to quash and set aside the RBI directions on equity dilution.
It has also pleaded with the court to declare that the reduction of promoter shareholding should be considered complied with, if it is achieved as a percentage of the paid-up capital and not the paid-up voting equity capital of the bank.

BENGALURU :
Real estate developer Gaurs Group has raised  ₹500 crore from Kotak Mahindra Bank, through its subsidiary Kotak Mahindra Prime Ltd, to pace up construction work at Gaur City II, part of integrated township Gaur City and commercial project Gaur City Centre, in Greater Noida West.
This is the second debt transaction by the developer, after it raised  ₹640 crore from PNB Housing Finance Ltd for a housing project and a shopping mall development, earlier in the year.
While Gaur City II is part of the 237-acre integrated township project Gaur City, Gaur City Centre has a shopping mall, multi-level parking and a hospital.
The debt funding comes at a time when non-banking financial companies, or NBFCs, who have been a key source of funding for builders are undergoing a liquidity crisis. Property markets like Delhi-National Capital Region, India’s largest property market, have been impacted the most given the slow sales and because developers need debt to maintain the pace of construction, plan launches or repay loans.
“The investment would be used to pace up the construction at two of our projects in Greater Noida West. We have had a good run since two years and have sold good numbers which has helped us to complete projects within stipulated time. We also have excellent track record and relations with banks which has made us a preferred partner for such big fund deals,"" said Manoj Gaur, managing director, Gaurs Group in a statement.
NCR-based Gaurs Group also said that in March, it has clocked sales of over 600 units. “Kotak is a respected lender in the real estate space. The deal of the magnitude has been possible due to the consistent performance delivered by the Gaurs Group in last several quarters. This deal will cut down financing costs of the group significantly,"" said Vineet Singhal, group chief financial officer, Gaurs Group.
A spokesperson of Kotak Mahindra Group said, “We are extending the debt for development of quality residential and commercial projects. We value borrowers with good track record and who are progressively building organisational capabilities to deliver value to all stakeholders on a sustained basis.""
Gaurs Group is currently developing group housing and commercial projects in Greater Noida West, Siddharth Vihar (Ghaziabad) and Yamuna Expressway. The group has also announced its entry into affordable housing along with its expansion in education and hospitality segments."
103,2019-04-08,Kotak,"As earnings growth remains elusive, analysts said expectations of a full recovery in FY20 will not be pragmaticMeasures initiated by the US and Europe, as also by China, to overcome the economic slowdown are all factors that will be keenly watched

As India prepares for a new government in May, domestic equity markets are expected to be turbulent, but most analysts see growth opportunities in fiscal year (FY) 2020.
However, besides the elections, there are several challenges for India equities in FY20—liquidity condition, stability of the rupee, crude prices, the budget for the fiscal year tabled by the new government and the trade war between China and the US.
At this juncture, recovery in corporate earnings growth is also very crucial for Indian markets. Delay in expected corporate earnings, profitability growth and a fractured mandate by voters in the general elections are major concerns for equity markets in FY20, said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer, equity, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. He, however, expects the market breadth, as well as equity returns, to be better in the fiscal year, as compared to FY19.
Measures initiated by the US and Europe, as also by China, to overcome the economic slowdown are all factors that will be keenly watched by analysts, said Joseph Thomas, head of research, Emkay Wealth Management.
Thomas sees a couple of factors which could be hindrances to markets in FY20. First, liquidity condition in the interbank market is of prime importance, as the deficit is met by the Reserve Bank of India through repos, and open market operations (OMOs). “We need to see the systemic liquidity improving substantially through long-term money for the markets to retain the momentum,"" he added.
Second, any rise in Brent crude prices holds a threat to the economy with its impact on retail inflation and the current account deficit. A third factor is the likely intensity of the shadows of a global slowdown, with China slowing down to all-time lows, and German and French economies contracting, while Italy is still in a recession. Fourth, the government finances will also be one of the factors to be reckoned with. “Large government borrowings, persistent agrarian distress and low levels of employment are also factors which will impact growth and, therefore, earnings,"" Thomas added.
As earnings growth remains elusive, analysts said the expectations of a full recovery in FY20 will not be pragmatic. “As widely expected, 20% earnings growth in this year is a bit far-fetched,"" said Aditya Narain, head of research, institutional equities, Edelweiss Securities. “From consumption perspective, we are beginning to see some pressure, while from the investment cycle we are a bit cautious. As valuations are getting steeper, we see limited upside to the markets till December. Post-elections, we were expecting stimulus both from monetary and fiscal front, but it was done a little ahead of time. The big challenge for the markets will be liquidity.""
Another concern that could be hurting local equities is tapering fund flows. “Domestic money has been a strong support for the market. The return of foreign portfolio investors and persistently strong domestic institutional investor are big positives for the markets, especially on the liquidity front. A slowdown in retail flows, especially into mutual funds, may also be a likely damper,"" said Jinesh Gopani, head of equity, Axis Asset Management Co. Ltd.
Foreign institutional investor money was missing from India for most of FY19. They were net buyers of Indian equities worth $162.29 million in FY19, the lowest in three fiscal years. However, domestic institutional investors (DIIs), including mutual funds and insurance firms, were net buyers of  ₹72,109 crore Indian shares in FY19."
102,2019-04-11,Kotak,"Kotak Mahindra AMC, HDFC AMC among mutual funds forced to withhold or roll over FMPs with exposure to the Essel GroupMutual funds have  ₹7,000 crore exposure to Essel Group. The paper in question was backed by shares in Zee

Troubles in the debt market have finally reached the doorsteps of mutual fund investors, with Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. Ltd withholding part of the redemptions from one of its fixed maturity plans (FMP).
The development has attracted the attention of the stock market regulator, which has asked all mutual funds to provide details of debt schemes backed by promoter shares.
Two Essel Group companies in which the FMP had invested had not repaid in full. That forced the asset manager to hold back part of the payments when the plan matured on 8 April.
The redemption clock began ticking in January when the Essel Group companies, to which mutual funds had lent a combined  ₹7,000 crore against debt securities, neared a payment default. The funds agreed not to sell the pledged promoter shares until end-September. In the meantime, Kotak’s FMP—which too had lent to Essel—has come up for redemption, rendering the AMC unable to pay the entire redemption amount.
Lakshmi Iyer, head of fixed income at Kotak AMC, said except for one FMP, the fund had returned “100% of the principal amount"" to investors. “The impact is primarily on the returns. We have kept aside some units with their corresponding net asset value (NAV) and we expect to allow investors to realize these units once the Essel Group companies pay us back, latest by 30 September 2019. We refrained from selling the shares that were collateral for the papers concerned because this would have caused a market panic and wouldn’t have allowed us to realize their full value,"" Iyer said over the phone.
FMPs are close-ended funds with a fixed maturity period. They invest in debt instruments, with maturity matching the tenure of the scheme. In this case, the loan was given against pledged shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, the flagship company of Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group.
Nilesh Shah, managing director of Kotak Mahindra AMC, said that in return for forbearance on selling the collateral against the Essel Group companies’ debt, the AMC has secured additional concessions. “We have taken personal guarantee of Subhash Chandra, the promoter of Essel Group, over and above Zee Entertainment shares for better security. We have also secured upside sharing on a graded basis on stake sale in Zee over and above the coupon rate of the existing debentures,"" he said. The Essel Group has put 50% stake in Zee on the block to raise money and repay debt.
An Essel group statement said: “The lenders have unanimously extended support to the Group and the same has positively resulted in saving the loss of public money. The arrangement with the lenders has also given the Group, the required time to realise the right value from the stake sale of ZEE Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. and has indeed stabilized the stock performance of the mentioned public listed entity.""
Separately, HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd, India’s largest asset manager, on Wednesday extended the maturity of one of its FMPs maturing on 15 April 2019 to 29 April 2020.
“The purpose of rollover or extension is due to current interest rate scenario and portfolio positioning; the yields prevailing in the short-maturity bucket present an option for investors to lock in their investments at current prevailing yields,"" an HDFC AMC statement to investors said.
Typically, in a situation where assets are not realized, AMCs have three options—take a hit on their books, roll over the scheme or mark down the value of security to zero.
Altogether, nine AMCs have lent to Essel Group across 87 schemes, including FMPs and open-ended debt funds. As a percentage of scheme assets, exposure to Essel Group ranges from a negligible amount to as much as 21.01% in Kotak FMP Series 187. Kotak AMC has exposure to Essel Group debt across six FMPs.
Other funds that have exposure to Essel Group debt are SBI Asset Management Co. Ltd, HDFC AMC, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd, Franklin Templeton Asset Management (India) Pvt. Ltd, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Ltd, UTI AMC Ltd, Baroda Asset Management India Ltd and ICICI Prudential AMC.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) was watching the situation closely, said a person aware of the matter.
“Sebi will write to Kotak for an explanation on whether trustee approvals were taken. Sebi has so far not given any opinion on the agreement between the fund houses to not sell the Essel Group securities. But Sebi is concerned and has asked all fund houses to give details of debt schemes, which hold paper backed by promoter shares. The roles of trustees on giving approval to such debt schemes is being monitored very closely,"" said this person.
Kotak AMC’s action and the regulator’s response are likely to lay down a precedent for other mutual funds exposed to bad debt. In December 2018, Sebi had allowed so-called side pockets for mutual funds, to segregate bad debt without affecting the larger scheme.
“This is not a side pocket in the literal sense but more of holding back the securities that were not realized,"" said Kaustubh Belapurkar, manager- research at Morningstar.
Fair valuation norms require all schemes holding other bonds of the defaulting issuer taking a write-down on their holdings; this would impact NAV and returns of those funds, said Arvind Chari, head-fixed income and alternatives at Quantum Advisors Pvt. Ltd."
101,2019-04-12,Kotak,"The revision in interest rate comes into effect from April 15.Earlier, SBI had lowered interest rate on large savings accounts.

NEW DELHI :
Private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank has cut interest rate on savings account deposits up to  ₹1 lakh. The rate of interest has been lowered to 4.5% from 5% earlier, according to the bank’s website. The revision in interest rate comes into effect from April 15, 2019.
The interest rate on savings account deposits on balance above  ₹1 lakh and up to 1 crore remains unchanged at 6%. Similarly, the interest rate on savings account balance above  ₹1 crore remains steady at 5.5%.
The cut in interest rate on savings account deposits comes in the wake of Reserve Bank of India cutting repo rate by 25 basis points to 6% earlier this month.
SBI, the country’s largest lender, earlier this week revised interest rate of large savings accounts and also cut lending rates.
Starting 1 May, SBI will link savings bank deposits above  ₹1 lakh (275 bps below RBI’s repo rate) and short-term loans like overdraft with RBI’s repo rate in a move to improve interest rate transmission for consumers. So a cut in RBI’s repo rate will bring down the interest rate SBI will offer on savings account deposits above  ₹1 lakh.
From May 1, SBI savings account deposits above  ₹1 lakh will fetch 3.25%. SBI savings bank account customers with balances up to  ₹1 lakh will continue to get 3.5% interest rate."

MUMBAI :
Private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank has taken Ballarpur Industries arm BILT Graphic Paper Products to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for a default of  ₹218 crore.
An NCLT tribunal of V.P. Singh and Ravikumar Duraisamy adjourned the matter to May 8 when they will decide on the admissibility of the bankruptcy petition.
""The respondent (BILT Graphic) can file its response during that time,"" the court added.
BILT Graphics owes over  ₹6,000 crore to lenders.
The company was on the second list of 29 defaulting companies of RBI, recommending that these firms be referred for resolution through the bankruptcy code.
In February 2018, IDBI Bank took the company to NCLT after an RBI direction to do so as the regulator rejected its debt recast package as only 70% of the lenders had signed it.
However, in March 2018, the company challenged the RBI directive in Delhi High Court, which ordered the lender to maintain status quo at NCLT. Later, the company moved the Supreme Court, where the matter is still pending."
97,2019-04-21,Kotak,"FMPs are market-linked instruments and are, therefore, exposed to the return and risk characteristics of the underlying bonds in the portfolioInvestors must recognise the risky nature of these products, and fund managers must turn more cautious as FMPs are often sold as replacement for FDs. They aren’t.

In the past few days, two fixed maturity plans (FMPs), from Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. Ltd and HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd, have faced trouble due to their exposure to Essel Group’s debt papers. In one case, investors got most of the payment, but the AMC held back some units until the recovery of money from Essel Group. In the other, the AMC rolled over the FMP for clients who agreed to it. In the coming months, the trouble may spread to FMPs of other fund houses having exposure to Essel Group. Shaikh Zoaib Saleem asked experts which of the two ways is better for investors:
It’s better to book losses and invest elsewhere
Pattabiraman Murari, Founder, FreeFincal
The way AMCs and rating agencies have dealt with the crisis is far from inspiring trust. Should investors exit or opt for roll over if the AMC gives that option? Even if one opts for a rollover and the fund house is able to recover the money, the delay will reduce the yield as the net asset value (NAV) will take weeks or months to recover to its pre-crisis value. I think it would be better for investors to take the loss, get rid of the uncertainty associated with debt recovery and invest elsewhere.
What else can be done to safeguard investors? Risk in a debt mutual fund is inevitable, but it can be compartmentalized. One can have debt funds that invest only in short-term gilts, only in long-term gilts, only in corporate bonds or only PSUs and so on. Such style of purity, especially in FMPs, offers choice. Those seeking higher yields can choose corporate- or PSU-based FMPs. Those who cannot stomach any credit risk can stick to gilt FMPs.
Investors must recognize that FMPs can’t replace FDs
Sandeep Parekh, Partner, Finsec Law Advisors
The mutual fund imbroglio is not as bad as it sounds. Had investments completely soured, the specific scheme would have written off the amount and returned the balance to investors. The deferral is the lesser of two evils. What was likely to be a default situation has been deferred with a higher security cover. There is higher probability of investors getting their money back , but there is no guarantee.
Whether to hold back units, or roll over the payback period, or just take a haircut is a call fund managers and investors must take. None of the options is inherently superior to the other as immediate liquidity must be faced with an immediate haircut, while a deferment is likely to return more money but only in the future. Ultimately, investors must recognise the risky nature of these products, and fund managers must turn more cautious as FMPs are often sold as replacement for fixed deposits (FDs). They aren’t.
Getting back some of the money is the better option
Suresh Sadagopan, Founder, Ladder7 Financial Advisories
The way the two fund houses have handled the problem is slightly different. But, fundamentally, in both the cases, the risk is still very much with the investor. That being said, I would prefer the Kotak AMC way of handling this situation because that would mean that I would have got almost 100% of my money back. If I invested  ₹100 and it has gone up to  ₹127 over a period of time, some money, maybe  ₹20, is stuck, but I still got  ₹107.
The fund houses are expected to do the due diligence, but as a debt fund investor, the risk also belongs to me.
One of the things that’s been said, which I agree with, is that AMCs should not get into the lending business. There is a thin line between direct lending to a business and buying securities. Direct lending involves more due diligence. AMCs are not business consultants and should not get into the business of being part-owners, which has happened in some cases.
FMP investors should get to decide if they want to stay
Vishal Dhawan, Founder, Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors
FMPs are market-linked instruments and are, therefore, exposed to the return and risk characteristics of the underlying bonds in the portfolio.
As they have a maturity date, they are perceived to be similar to bank FDs; also, they offer the benefit of tax arbitrage to investors in higher tax brackets. Thus, a lot of investors tend to use them for specific goals. Any fixed maturity instrument that does not permit liquidity at the point that it was promised could, therefore, create challenges for investors. So it is critical that, irrespective of the underlying performance, investors are able to choose whether they wish to stay or not. Investors who do not need liquidity could decide on the basis of the risk in the underlying security.
Ideally, investors should use open-ended debt funds so that they have more flexibility to make these changes, as underlying security performance, tax laws and needs of liquidity can change over a period."

BENGALURU :
Mumbai-based EnKash, owned by Nehat Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd., has raised $3 million in a Series A round from venture capital fund Mayfield India and early-stage investor and accelerator Axilor Ventures.
EnKash is a business-to-business (B2B) payments management and automation platform. The latest investment will be used to enhance its existing technology base and for building a leadership team, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.
Vikram Godse, managing partner, Mayfield, will join Enkash’s board of directors, the company said. Over the last three years, Mayfield India has also invested in other fintech companies such as LendingKart, Upwards Fintech, and M1 Exchange.
Industry experts say the B2B market records annual transaction values of more than $1 trillion globally. EnKash, which enables businesses to process high volume transactions, plans to make a dent in this market by adding support for credit-based payments and payment reconciliation for buyers and suppliers.
Founded in 2017, by Yadvendra Tyagi, Hemant Vishnoi and Naveen Bindal, EnKash connects corporates, vendors and credit providers. The product helps automate the entire process of B2B payments and ease the working capital requirements of suppliers.
It also helps businesses manage their purchase orders and invoices, and enable and track payments to suppliers or from buyers. The company believes that by automating B2B payments, buyers and suppliers can improve their cash flow by receiving advance payments or quick financing options on their invoices.
EnKash is live with banks like Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank and is in advanced discussions with several other financial institutions, it added in its statement.
“Businesses in India have been struggling with manual payment processes for a long time. We are easing B2B payment problems for thousands of businesses today. Along with the partnerships of Mayfield and Axilor, we are bullish about the positive impact that we can have in the buyer/supplier ecosystem,"" said Yadvendra Tyagi, chief executive of EnKash, in a statement.
“Their (Enkash’s) core tech platform solves issues around the dearth of working capital through a payment mechanism, which we believe will create tremendous value for the supplier ecosystem. We are excited to partner with them,"" added Vikram Godse, Managing Partner, Mayfield."
95,2019-04-24,Kotak,"At least three banks are “under certification” at NPCI for the debit card-based e-mandate systemWhen you take a loan or start an SIP, you permit the lender or the mutual fund company to debit money from your account periodically

Registering a mandate for recurring payments like systematic investment plans (SIPs) and equated monthly instalments (EMIs) will now be easier for customers of Kotak Mahindra Bank. The bank has become the first bank to go live with debit card- as well as netbanking-based electronic mandate, using the National Payments Corp. of India’s (NPCI) new e-mandate platform.
Other banks too are expected to offer this facility soon. At least three banks are “under certification"" at NPCI for the debit card-based e-mandate system, while State Bank of India has completed the certification, but is not live yet. Many other banks are also under certification or have completed it (To see banks’ status click here).
What is an e-mandate?
When you take a loan or start an SIP, you permit the lender or the mutual fund company to debit money from your account periodically. Earlier, this was done through the electronic clearing system (ECS). For the past few years, this is being done through the National Automatic Clearing House (NACH). The mandate or permission is given by filling up and signing a physical form. The company that needs to debit money from your account takes the form to your bank as proof that you have allowed it to withdraw money from your account periodically.
The process became more efficient through e-NACH, where a digital submission and verification was made. Under e-NACH, the maximum time taken for registering the mandate came down to two days from 10-15 days earlier. The e-sign-based e-mandate used Aadhaar-based e-signature to take customers’ authorisation. However, the Supreme Court judgment in September 2018 on Aadhaar declared the portion of Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act that enabled private companies to use Aadhaar for establishing the identity of an individual as unconstitutional. This hit instant e-KYC (know your customer) through Aadhaar, and Aadhaar-based e-signature. Eventually, NPCI decided to suspend e-NACH in November 2018. While the e-sign-based e-mandate was suspended, the older NACH system continued.
Most fintech companies in the lending business were early adopters of the e-sign-based e-mandate as it cut the processing time and the costs. For consumers too, a digital process meant faster service and reduction or elimination of paperwork.
Some banks and mutual funds allowed consumers to use the bill-pay system to make periodic payments like SIPs, which is also a completely digital process. However, that didn’t work for lending companies as they need to pull money from bank accounts based on a contract.
What’s new?
Customers of Kotak Mahindra Bank will now be able to place an e-mandate using their debit cards or netbanking. This would not require Aadhaar-based e-sign to authenticate the identity of the user. Instead, unique debit card details or internet banking credentials will be used.
Once the system is available across major banks, registering an e-mandate for EMIs or SIPs would become a smoother experience for you."

A savings account is one of the basic financial products that everyone must have. All the major banks including State Bank of India (SBI), Bank Of Baroda (BoB), Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC and ICICI Bank offer their customers several variations of savings accounts. These are just basic savings accounts where you can leave your money and earn an interest in the range of 3.5-6%, depending on the amount and the bank. The interest amount then gets credited to the customer on a quarterly basis, according to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rules.
Here are the savings account interest rates for major Indian banks:
SBI: The State Bank of India, the largest one, offers its customers 3.50% interest rates on savings deposit balance of up to  ₹1 crore. Above  ₹1 crore, the interest rate levied on savings balance is 4% per annum. Following the 25bps reduction in repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 4 April, SBI’s cash credit and overdraft rate will be reduced by 25bps with effect from 1 May. The savings bank rate also stands revised to 3.5% for balances up to  ₹1 lakh and 3.25% for above  ₹1 lakh.
Kotak Mahindra Bank: Private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank has cut the interest rate on savings account deposits of up to  ₹1 lakh. The rate of interest has been lowered to 4.5% from 5% earlier, according to the bank’s website. The revision in interest rate came into effect from 15 April 2019. The interest rate on savings account deposits on balance above  ₹1 lakh and up to  ₹1 crore remains unchanged at 6%. Similarly, the interest rate on savings accounts balance of above  ₹1 crore remains steady at 5.5%.
Bank of Baroda: Bank of Baroda (BoB), which has become the second largest public sector bank after SBI following its amalgamation with Bengaluru-based Vijaya Bank and Mumbai-based Dena Bank, offers an interest rate of 3.50% to 4.00% on savings account.
HDFC Bank: HDFC Bank is offering an interest rate of 3.50% per annum (p.a.) on savings deposit balance below  ₹50 lakh. Above this amount, HDFC levies an interest rate of 4% p.a.
ICICI Bank: ICICI Bank, too like HDFC, gives its customers the same range of interest rates. For account balance below  ₹50 lakh, the interest rate is 3.5% per annum. The interest rate of 4% for savings balance amount over  ₹50 lakh."

Markets are expected to remain volatile this week. Crude oil price fluctuations, rupee movements, corporate earnings and the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rate will drive Indian markets. Share markets will have only three trading days this week with Monday and Wednesday being holidays due to general elections in Mumbai and Maharashtra Day, respectively.
According to Jimeet Modi, founder and CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote, markets are expected to move either 2-3% up or down from current levels.
""Open interest is consistently reducing in the futures market given the already elevated levels and uncertainty over the election outcome. Status quo is expected to be maintained going forward. At the sectoral level, FMCG, capital goods and healthcare are largely expected to move sideways with very little volatility. Realty, mid-caps, auto, metal, power and small-caps are in a corrective mode with further downward pressure going ahead,"" he said.
Major corporates scheduled to announce March quarter results this week are Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tata Power, Hindustan Unilever and Federal Bank among others.
Auto stocks will be in focus this week as automobile companies will declare their monthly sales for April. In March domestic automobile sales were hurt by weak consumer sentiment amid a rise in borrowing costs and increased fuel prices.
The markets will keenly observe fluctuations in crude oil prices. Brent crude has risen nearly 6% this month and could be a major headwind for Indian markets. Crude oil prices could have repercussions on the external sector (including currency), fiscal math, inflation and financial markets.
The Federal Reserve will meet this week to decide on raising rates. It is widely expected that the US central bank will not hike interest rates this time after it killed off rate-rise expectations at its March meeting. The latest Reuters poll all but puts to bed any risk of rates going up this economic cycle, given inflation remains below the Fed’s alarm threshold and unemployment is the lowest in generations.
Another important factor will be the rupee's movement against the dollar. The dollar has zipped to near two-year highs. The euro has tumbled to 22-month lows against the dollar and investors are preparing for worse, buying options to shield against a further downside. Emerging-market currencies are also in pain, with the Turkish lira and Argentine peso both sharply weaker."

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a 25% growth in net profit for the quarter ended March 31, boosted by a strong loan growth. Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a 25% jump in net profit to  ₹1,408 crore in the March quarter, as compared to  ₹1,124 crore in the same quarter of the previous year. Overall, its loans grew 21% as of end-March.
The bank's net interest income jumped to  ₹3,048 crore, from  ₹2,580 crore a year earlier. The net interest margin also inched higher to 4.48% during the quarter.
Other income also rose to  ₹1,270 crore in the fourth quarter ended March 31, as compared to  ₹1,151 crore a year earlier.
Asset quality remained stable, with gross bad loans as a percentage of the total at 2.14% by the end of March, compared with 2.07% in the previous quarter and 2.22% in the same period last year.

92,2019-04-30,Kotak,"Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a 25% growth in net profit in March quarter aided by lower provisionsThe bank has no exposure to troubled Essel Group and Jet, and has negligible exposure to IL&FS

Sometimes, saying no makes all the difference. This is true for Kotak Mahindra Bank, which is reaping the benefits of turning away borrowers who are now a matter of concern for most other lenders.
The richly valued private lender reported a 25% growth in net profit for the March quarter as it did not have to beef up provisions like some of its peers. The bank’s provisions, in fact, fell marginally compared with the previous quarter.
The bank’s gross bad loan ratios rose marginally. However, when future stress is expected to be low, investors are bound to ignore a paltry rise in the bad loan proportion of the loan book.
Kotak Mahindra Bank’s special mention accounts 2 (SMA-2) fell to  ₹138 crore in the fourth quarter from  ₹344 crore in the previous quarter.
SMA-2 accounts are those where the dues have not been cleared for up to 60 days. These are accounts that are most likely to turn bad, as borrowers have only a month to pay back.
What this means is that the lender managed to make some of these borrowers pay up. However, it should be noted that from a year-ago period, SMA-2 has almost doubled.
The private lender has negligible exposure to defaulter Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) as well.
The bank even escaped an exposure to Jet Airways, another pain point for many lenders.
Kotak Mahindra Bank has said no to even the Essel Group. Ironically, the Kotak group’s mutual fund was hit by giving out loans to the Essel Group.
In an interaction with the media after the announcement of results, the bank’s management sounded sanguine on future asset quality and said there is some worry on the bank’s exposure to auto industry given the slowdown there. Big automakers have seen sales drop sharply in fiscal year (FY) 2019 raising concerns over their earnings.
Why then were investors not very enthused about the lender’s performance, given that its stock hardly reacted to the numbers on Tuesday?
A key overhang on the stock is the ongoing legal battle between Kotak Mahindra Bank and the Reserve Bank of India regarding promoter shareholding rules. Both the private lender’s and Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) counsels have made scathing arguments against each other.
Given the next hearing date is a year ahead, the issue is likely to nag investors.
In the light of this tussle with the regulator, analysts believe the stock is richly valued. The share price has gained 12% in the last two months and it now trades at a multiple of nearly five times its estimated book value for FY21.
That makes it the most expensive banking stock to own in town. Perhaps, it’s time now for investors to start saying no."
91,2019-05-01,Kotak,"Uday Kotak said the fear this time is the financial sector impacting both itself as well as the real sectorKotak said banks coming out of NPA pains was also one of the issues which led us into the present situation

Mumbai: Banker Uday Kotak Tuesday warned of more liquidity crisis plaguing the financial sector, which is already passing through ""turbulent times"", for the newt two quarters and stressed on the need to have strong balance sheets to withstand difficult times.
The next six months are crucial for the financial sector, Kotak, the executive vice-chairman of Kotak Mahindra Bank said, adding the fear this time is the financial sector impacting both itself as well as the real sector.
Comments come days after smaller rival Yes Bank under a new chief executive warned that up to  ₹10,000 crore of assets existing on its book as standard assets can slip into NPAs and massively provided for the same, resulting in a maiden loss of over  ₹1,500 crore.
""We are in the midst of one of the significant challenges in the financial sector and I think the next few months are crucial in the sense how the financial sector shapes up across various segments,"" he told reporters after announcing the March quarter earnings of the bank wherein it reported a 14 percent growth in net income.
""This is the time when the quality of the balance sheet of financial players gets very crucial...the true test of a financial institution is the balance sheet,"" he added.
Rather than focusing on profits, market should look at the inherent strength of the balance sheet whether it can withstand difficulties, he said.
Kotak said the financial sector was the biggest beneficiary of the note-ban exercise as massive amount of liquidity flowed into banks, insurers and mutual funds. But soon, this money got invested in illiquid assets like land and realty, which was the biggest folly because once liquidity got tighter, exiting such assets has become tough.
He said the issues faced by infra lender IL&FS, which he chairs after its bankruptcy, was the ""first signal"" of the looming crisis. It can be noted that the same has been followed by the troubles faced by promoters who borrowed against pledged shares, especially from mutual funds.
Kotak said banks coming out of NPA pains was also one of the issues which led us into the present situation. ""We need a very strong approach both from the practitioners as well as policymakers to take the financial sector into safer waters from the more turbulent waters.""As a way-out, he said the best solution is more equity infusion into struggling players or consolidation and in the worst case there can be some mortalities as well."

India’s total market capitalization, or the value of all shares traded, has eroded this month after equities went into a tailspin in May because of a slew of factors. Aggregate market cap in dollar terms fell 4.8%, losing $104.7 billion, since the beginning of May, showed Bloomberg data. Among the world’s biggest stock markets, China’s market cap has slipped 5.59%—the most in May so far.
However, in this year so far, China’s market capitalization has jumped 24.28%—the most among the top 10 countries. China’s market capitalization is at $6.68 trillion, much lower than the $31.17 trillion of market topper US.
Last week, India fell two notches to rank ninth in the table with a market capitalization of $2.08 trillion. Canada and Germany were at the seventh and eighth positions, respectively. India is the only one among the top 10 countries by market cap that has not seen any growth in 2019.
In dollar terms, India’s benchmark Sensex index fell 4.6% in this month so far and gained 3.38% in 2019 till date.
Meanwhile, the share of both BSE MidCap and BSE SmallCap indices in overall market capitalization has decreased, while the Sensex has grown since January. At current levels, the BSE MidCap index contributes 13.07% to India’s total market cap, down from 13.68% in January. In contrast, the contribution of the Sensex to the country’s total market capitalization has grown from 44.87% in January to 46.84% at current levels. The BSE MidCap and SmallCap indices lost 8.51% and 6.15%, respectively, in 2019.
Fear of an escalating trade war between the US and China, uncertainty over the general elections, muted quarterly earnings and slowdown in the economy have rattled investor sentiment, which has dragged stocks in the last few weeks, say analysts. Volatility in Indian markets has also spiked, as the Lok Sabha elections, crude oil prices and global geopolitical developments weighed on equities.
“Another reason for the markets falling now could be due to profit booking, as Indian equities had jumped considerably in the beginning of this year,"" said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer (equity) at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. Ltd.
Upadhyaya thinks once the poll uncertainty is over on 23 May, markets will shift focus on other fundamental issues, such as crude oil prices, state of the economy and earnings. In 2019, crude oil prices have risen 34% but have cooled off this month.
“Election uncertainty has driven markets in the last year with cyclical segments witnessing a significant de-rating despite posting good results and order books. Elections impact returns in the short term, whereas earnings drive returns over the long term. With the election results getting out of the way in May, focus should shift to earnings growth visibility,"" said Anoop Bhaskar, head (equity), IDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd.
Foreign institutional investor (FII) flows continued to be positive in India, whereas domestic institutional investors (DIIs) are still cautious pending the election results.

88,2019-05-16,Kotak,"Muted government spending and high election-linked expenditure have created a cash deficit in India’s banking system in the past few monthsLakshmi Iyer of Kotak Mahindra AMC thinks there will be consolidation in the sector in the next two to three quarters

India needs to pump more cash into its financial system to prevent a worsening of the funding crisis among shadow banks and the corporate sector, according to one of the nation’s biggest money managers.
Non-banking financial companies had served as a “surrogate womb"" for banks, who face regulatory limits on how much they can lend, but that “surrogacy has stopped,’’ Lakshmi Iyer, chief investment officer for debt at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co., said in an interview at her office in Mumbai. “If the liquidity the system requires is not provided sooner or later, this could morph itself into something beyond NBFCs.’’
The non-bank lenders, which have been hit by high borrowing costs and largely shut out from the bond market after the crisis at shadow lender IL&FS Group broke out last year, are facing the risk that more borrowers will be unable to repay their debt as the cash crunch drags on. Oil industry firms, steel producers and mineral companies, all of which rely on NBFCs for funding, are finding it difficult to raise money, Iyer said.
Muted government spending and high election-linked expenditure have created a cash deficit in India’s banking system in the past few months. Authorities are already using open-market debt purchase operations and currency swaps as a “potent liquidity tool,"" but more is needed to get enough cash into the system, Iyer said.
India’s cash deficit, measured by how much lenders need to borrow from the central bank to carry out their operations, is the worst since 2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The banking system has experienced a liquidity deficit for all but 10 days so far in 2019, the data show.
Policy makers appear to be aware of the potential risks. The nation’s top bureaucrat for corporate affairs, Injeti Srinivas, warned of an imminent crisis in NBFCs due to over-leveraging and a credit squeeze among other reasons, and those are “a perfect recipe for disaster,"" the Press Trust of India reported.
The troubles have hit borrowers reliant on non-bank lenders for financing, such as property developers. In an industry group letter to India’s finance minister, real estate companies complained that some lenders are delaying loan disbursals and raising interest rates arbitrarily.
There were 10,190 NBFCs operating as of September 2018, and their outstanding loans came to about 20 trillion rupees ($285 billion), according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). That’s around a fifth of the balance sheet of all the nation’s banks.
Iyer thinks there will be consolidation in the sector in the next two to three quarters.
In the meantime, investors should try not to act too much on rumors in a volatile market, as “when that small matchstick will become a forest fire, we don’t know,’’ she said. “The last thing that we want right now is a forest fire.’’"

85,2019-05-26,Kotak,"While retail loans like credit cards, personal loans are growing, consumers are concerned about banks not being able to pass on interest rate changes to themShanti Ekambaram, president, consumer banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank, talks about how banks are dealing with consumer issues

While retail loans like credit cards and personal loans are growing, consumers are concerned about banks not being able to pass on interest rate changes to them, especially in a falling interest rate regime. Even the Reserve Bank of India has raised the issue from time to time. Shanti Ekambaram, president, consumer banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank, talks about how banks are dealing with such consumer issues
What are the new trends in the banking space that could be of interest to consumers?
If you look at credit growth, which I think is a key barometer of the economy, in the last few quarters, credit growth from the retail segment has been growing reasonably well. We have seen growth in credit cards and personal loans. Some of these products have grown because of the increase in discretionary spending and aspirational lifestyle values of the younger generation. In the last three-four months, we’ve seen a little bit of slowdown in traditional products like cars, homes and a little in (consumer) durables, which has been different from the trend of the last three to five years. Maybe this is just reflecting on the overall economy.
So I would say credit growth continues to be reasonably good. Some segments are continuing to show a strong trend, while others are showing a slowdown. Digital adoption among customers also continues at a healthy pace.
There has been a sharp growth in unsecured loans. This could be risky if there are defaults. Is that a cause of worry at the bank’s level?
Any lending is subject to economic cycles. Credit cards are no different. Any wholesale lending is dependent on economy, investment and volume growth, among others. Retail will depend on jobs. While job growth may not have been that rapid, there is no loss of employment and that is what is critical. Second, I think for each bank, the percentage of unsecured loans to the total portfolio also matters. For example, at Kotak, it is a small portion of the total portfolio. Our secured lending is much higher than unsecured lending. So I’d say that if there are rapid massive job losses like what you saw in the post Lehman phase, which had an impact on retail and had a contagion effect, if that were to repeat, there could be (impact on retail asset quality). It’s not exactly a worry, but you have to watch the trends. You haven’t seen job losses in the economy, if the economy continues to grow and there are no job losses, we should be okay.
Interest rates are coming down, but there is concern that the cuts are not getting passed on to consumers. This is particularly true for home loans.
Post February, when the first rate cut happened, a lot of banks have been reducing rates which is basically MCLR (marginal cost of lending rate) and transmitting the same to customers. The challenge for banks is that liquidity is always very tight in March. RBI did provide liquidity through the swap windows or through OMOs (open market operations), etc., but if you look at the markets today after two rate cuts and forex swaps, liquidity continues to be tight. One of the reasons is that the government stopped spending because of elections; hopefully it will restart.
Growth in deposits has been slow, because of which banks have not been able to bring down deposit rates significantly. As banks are focused on growing the deposit base because there is credit demand, their ability to lower deposit rates has been marginal. And banks are driven by the cost of funds. So transmission has been happening.
How can this be improved?
Banks are trying to see how they can be more cost-effective in their deposits and this transmission will continue based on how you can lower the cost of your deposits. For example, there has been an increase in the small savings rate. Now banks are competing for deposits with small savings rate. They have not been able to reduce their deposit rate because they need the deposit flow. So that’s really the challenge that banks are facing. If your cost of funds doesn’t go down, your ability to transmit will be more gradual and I think it would continue to be transmitted. I think the factors of liquidity and the ability to reduce deposit rates for cost of funds are important.
SBI has linked its savings account deposits rates with the repo rate. How is the industry perceiving this move? Will people move their money from savings accounts to fixed deposits?
It is interesting but it is still early days. If one third of their savings base is linked with an external rate, over a period of time, it can make a difference to their cost of funds either way, taking it up or down. It remains to be seen whether customers are indifferent. But it will certainly help the bank. If a one-year term deposit is getting 7.3% and your savings account rate is 3.25%, what will you do? Customers look at different products but there is also inertia when it comes to money.
RBI came out with a draft framework for external benchmarking of retail loans and it could not be implemented. What are your thoughts on that?
Conceptually, that is interesting, but practically, banks’ deposits are mostly on a fixed rate and lending mostly on a floating rate. So you have this classic interest rate mismatch. Your deposits are fixed and there is no correlation between them and the money markets. The external benchmark is really linked to the money market. So until this changes structurally, it could pose risks for banks. So the structural deposit side of a bank’s balance sheet has to get closer and closer to market rates. But deposit rates are fixed and they come from very small individuals, while money market rates are determined by more institutional groups. How do you bridge that gap? And when your deposit rates become a little more floating, then you think of external benchmarks. So the difference really is the cost of deposits versus the rates in the money market, which is a wide gap. So to get the whole small consumer base used to a floating rate will take some time. It is a question of adoption.
There has been some stress in debt mutual funds recently. How do you look at it?
As bankers, we have always been lending money. Banks have large credit departments. Before you lend money, your level of due diligence is really deep and wide. Mutual funds, when they take credit exposure, largely go by ratings. They have very thin teams who do not do the kind of due diligence that a bank does. So in an environment that has changed in India, the level of due diligence required has to go up. Then the real question is what are the norms for credit exposure. Banks have very stringent norms for credit exposure. Perhaps some more norms could be needed.
Even individual depositors in some instruments often go by ratings?
It only teaches us that don’t just go by ratings. Read up a few things and understand a bit before you put your money. Every investor, retail or otherwise, perhaps has to increase the level of diligence before putting their money in an instrument. And there is no return without risk. So if you see you are getting a higher return, look closely. Don’t invest in something just because someone told you to. Read and try to understand. If you can’t, ask someone who does. If you don’t get an explanation, be safe in your investments."
84,2019-05-28,Kotak,"The lender’s QIP, expected to be the largest in India, could be launched as early as in the next fortnightBank of America Merrill Lynch, CLSA, Kotak Mahindra Capital, and SBI Cap have been advising SBI on this fundraise

MUMBAI :
The State Bank of India (SBI) is preparing to raise  ₹15,000 crore to  ₹18,000 crore through what is expected to be India’s largest qualified institutional placement (QIP) in the next few weeks, said three people aware of the development.
In January, SBI’s board of directors approved a plan to raise up to  ₹20,000 crore through various equity and equity-linked instruments, including a QIP.
The state-owned lender, the country’s largest, could launch the deal as early as the next fortnight, according to one of the persons mentioned above.
“SBI was waiting for the elections to get over as political uncertainty is an issue with many investors. The stock has done well since the mandate of the election was announced. They have been talking with investors and they want to launch the transaction soon,"" said this person.
SBI’s stock has seen its value increase by 20.4% since the start of the year. After the results of the general elections were announced on 23 May, it has moved up by more than 5%, data from stock exchanges show.
On Tuesday, the lender’s shares closed the day at  ₹360.40 apiece, down by 0.29% on the BSE, while the benchmark Sensex closed at 39,749.73 points, up 0.17%.
An email sent to SBI enquiring about its QIP plans went unanswered.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, CLSA, Kotak Mahindra Capital, and SBI Capital Markets have been advising the bank on this fundraise, Bloomberg reported in January. HSBC declined to comment, while emails sent to the other advisors did not elicit a response.
The latest QIP from the lender is expected to be slightly larger than its previous fundraise in 2017 from the public markets when it raised  ₹15,000 crore through the largest QIP witnessed in the country.
A large chunk of that QIP was snapped up by the Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC), which accounted for more than 35% of the shares offered in the QIP, while another investor, EuroPacific Growth Fund, subscribed to a little over 10% of the shares on offer, data from stock exchange filings show.
Earlier this month, the bank reported a profit of  ₹838.40 crore for the fourth quarter, missing analysts’ estimates after making hefty provisions to pare bad debt. In the corresponding quarter of the previous year, it posted a loss of  ₹7,718.17 crore.
However, the bank’s asset quality improved during the quarter with new bad loans falling sharply.
The bank classified its exposure of  ₹1,125 crore out of  ₹3,487 crore toward Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) as a non-performing asset (NPA) in this quarter. As a percentage of total loans, gross NPAs stood at 7.53%, compared with 8.71% in the previous three months, and 10.91% in the year-ago quarter.
Net NPAs were at 3.01% in the March quarter against 3.95% in the previous quarter, and 5.73% in the corresponding quarter of last year.
So far this year, three companies have raised a total of  ₹4,382.4 crore through QIPs, while in 2018, 25 companies raised  ₹16,587 crore through the route, data from primary market tracker Prime Database shows.
A QIP is a capital-raising tool through which publicly traded firms can sell securities such as shares and convertible debentures to institutional buyers."
82,2019-06-02,Kotak,"The MPC headed by RBI Governor will meet for 3 days beginning 3 June to firm up the second bi-monthly monetary policy of the fiscalThe RBI needs to continue lowering interest rates in order to provide a stimulus to the economy, says CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee

New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India may go for another round of rate cut, third in a row, on Thursday to prop up the economic growth which dropped to a five-year low in the final quarter of 2018-19, opined experts.
The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is slated to announce its bi-monthly policy on Thursday amidst Narendra Modi-led government starting its second term. The central bank had cut the short-term lending rate (repo rate) by 25 basis points each in its last two policy reviews. The MPC headed by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das will meet for three days beginning 3 June to firm up the second bi-monthly monetary policy of the fiscal.
 India's largest bank SBI in a recent research report had said that the RBI needs to go in for a larger rate cut, more than 25 basis points, in the next monetary policy review in June to reverse the current slowdown in the economy.
On expectations from the MPC, CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said the RBI needs to continue lowering interest rates in order to provide a stimulus to the economy. ""This is needed to address the slowdown in production and sales across consumer goods categories including segments such as passenger cars, two-wheelers as well as non-durables,"" he said, adding that with inflation still far below the RBI’s target of 4%, there is an ample room for a reduction in the policy rate. 
Shanti Ekambaram, President, Consumer Banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank opined that macro environment was conducive for the RBI to cut rates.""One can expect both liquidity measures and a rate cut. Rate cut expectation ranges from 25 bps to 50 bps,"" she said. 
Without making any judgement on rate cut by the RBI, Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said there has been reduction in policy rate in the last two policies announced since February. It is for the Monetary Policy Committee to take a view on policy rate taking into consideration low inflation and moderation in the economic growth. Inflation continues to be much lower than the target, he said, adding core inflation also now on a decline. 
On the other hand, Karthik Srinivasan, Head, Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA expects the MPC to maintain a status quo in the upcoming meeting.""We expect MPC to adopt a wait and watch approach and look for the fiscal policy announcements during the union budget in July 2019,"" Srinivasan said. India's GDP growth slowed to a five-year low of 5.8% in the fourth quarter of 2018-19 mainly due to poor performance of agriculture and manufacturing sectors."

Life insurance is not about investing your money to earn a return on it, it’s about financial protection for your loved ones. The most efficient way to do that is through a term insurance policy. You pay only for insurance and after the policy term ends, you don’t get any money back. But on death during the policy term, it pays a huge corpus to the nominees.

After hitting a record high in March, payment transactions via Unified Payments Interface (UPI) declined second time in a row in May. Last month, as many as 733.54 million transactions were clocked across its various platforms, down 6% from April, according to data from National Payments Corp. of India.
Despite a slowdown in volume, value of such transactions continued to expand. Data showed that transactions worth  ₹1.53 lakh crore were made, up 7.3% from April.
During March, transactions hit a record high of 799.54 million worth  ₹1.33 lakh crore, up from 93,000 transactions when it was launched close to three years ago. UPI’s growth has more or less been consistent since then, both in terms of value and volume.
“In case of smaller banks across the country and regional rural banks, the UPI adoption is still happening in a big way and hence we have been witnessing growth in both volumes and value,"" Mandar Agashe, Founder and Vice Chairman of payments solution provider Sarvatra Technologies said. “The existing user base of customers is now opting for higher value and more frequent transactions, instead of smaller value transactions.""
Currently, 143 banks are live on UPI, down from 144 in April.
UPI allows users to transfer money across multiple bank accounts on a real-time basis, without putting out details of the beneficiary’s bank account. Funds can be immediately transferred through one’s mobile phone 24x7 and 365 days, regardless of the bank’s working hours. The payments system was developed by the NPCI, which is an umbrella organisation for all retail payments in the country.
While the pilot was launched in April, 2016, banks started uploading their UPI-enabled apps four months later. UPI gained momentum after Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the UPI-based, Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app, in December 2016, soon after he announced the massive exercise to scrap  ₹500 and  ₹1,000 notes in November 2016.
The growing popularity of UPI can be attributed to its simple, safe, cost-effective and mobile-based payment system. Transactions via UPI have surpassed mobile wallet payments in terms of volume of transactions as well as value.
According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), payment systems such as UPI and Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) are likely to register average annualised growth of over 100% by 2021.
With an aim of a less-cash society, the banking regulator in May announced the vision for payments in India during the three-year time period of 2019-2021, which will enable safe, secure, accessible and affordable payment system. The idea is also to provide more payment options to the population that has been untouched by payment systems. It expects digital transactions to quadruple to 8,707 crore in December 2021 from 2,069 crore in December 2018."

Industry executives on Monday sought tax cuts, lower interest rates and bold reforms in land acquisition and labour laws in a blueprint prepared to aid the Modi administration in adding momentum to economic growth.
Vikram Kirloskar, chairman and managing director of Kirloskar Systems Ltd. and president of industry chamber Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said at a briefing that sharpening the competitiveness of businesses is key to overcoming the risks to economic growth such as protectionist trends in global trade, tighter liquidity conditions at home and abroad and volatile oil prices.
The industry chamber expects the Indian economy to expand at 7-7.4% in 2019-20. Economic growth had slowed down to 5.8% in the March quarter of 2018-19, its lowest pace in five years, Mint reported on 1 June. The Modi government will present its first budget of the second term on 5 July, which will indicate the direction of economic policies India will adopt in the near future.
Industry executives cited the tight liquidity condition as one of the speed breakers to growth. Kirloskar urged the government to explore reducing taxes on the returns that equity investments fetch, whether it is capital gains or dividends distributed by companies, to make such investments more attractive.
“With a landslide electoral victory and new council of ministers in place, we expect the government to engage strongly with industry to ideate and implement impactful policy solutions for double-digit growth, said Kirloskar. A statement from the industry chamber said it has in a pre-budget wish list sought reduction in the corporate tax rate to 25% for all companies and progressively lowering it further to 18% without exemptions. At present, new manufacturing companies and companies with annual sales up to  ₹250 crore are taxed at a concessional rate of 25%.
Uday Kotak, founder and managing director and chief executive officer of Kotak Mahindra Bank and president-designate of CII, who was present on the occasion, explained that equity is getting taxed at multiple levels, which makes savers more comfortable putting their money in debt. “Then you don’t have enough risk capital available in the country for building new businesses or for expanding existing ones,"" said Kotak. He said taxes on equity returns have to be such that these encourage investors to take equity risks."

India’s wealth managers saw a rise in assets under management in 2018, bucking a slowing trend in most of Asia, according to a survey by Asian Private Banker.
The top 20 wealth firms in India expanded their AUM by 18% over the previous year to $193 billion, the report published Monday showed. In contrast, assets at the 20 largest private banks across the whole of Asia fell 3.6% as market turbulence deterred rich clients from deploying their wealth, according to an APB survey in April.
Domestic asset managers continued to expand their hold on the market, accounting for about 78% of the top 20’s AUM last year, versus 64% in 2015, according to the survey.
The wealth management arm of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. retained the top slot in India, boosting assets under management to $33.6 billion, Monday’s report showed. BNP Paribas SA kept its leading position among foreign wealth managers in India with total assets of $13.8 billion last year.
There were a total of 3,564 wealth managers at India’s top 20 firms last year, Asian Private Banker said, yielding an average $54 million of AUM per individual.

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank Friday imposed a penalty of  ₹2 crore on Kotak Mahindra Bank for not complying with its directions regarding dilution of promoters' shareholding in the company.
The private sector lender was directed by RBI to furnish information about details of the shareholding held by its promoters and to submit details of the proposed course of action for complying with the permitted timeline for dilution of promoter shareholding.
""Subsequently, the bank was directed to convey its commitment to achieve the dilution as per the timelines stipulated,"" the RBI said.
However, Kotak Mahindra Bank failed to comply with the directions and a show cause notice was issued to the bank as to why penalty should not be imposed for non-compliance, it added.
""After considering the reply received from the bank, submissions made by the bank during the personal hearing and the documents submitted by it, RBI came to the conclusion that the bank had failed to comply with the directions issued by RBI and decided to impose monetary penalty on the bank,"" the central bank said while imposing a ""monetary penalty of  ₹20 million"".
The action, RBI said, is based on the deficiencies in regulatory compliance and ""is not intended"" to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank.
In a BSE filing Friday, Kotak Mahindra Bank said it is examining the order.
As per RBI's banking licensing norms, a private bank's promoter holding has to be brought down to 40 per cent within three years of operations, 20 per cent within 10 years and 15 per cent within 15 years.
In consonance with RBI norms, Kotak Mahindra Bank last August proposed to issue non-convertible perpetual non-cumulative preference shares to reduce promoter stake to 19.7 per cent, worth  ₹500 crore at  ₹5 apiece, which the RBI shot down arguing that preference shares do not comprise core equity and help promoters retain voting rights.
As a result, the tussle went to Bombay High Court and the matter is still pending with the court.

74,2019-06-23,Kotak,"Every time you make a transaction at an ATM machine that does not belong to your card-issuing bank, it pays an interchange fee to the operator of the ATM you have usedThe card issuing bank pays a fee of  ₹15 for each cash transaction and  ₹5 for each non-cash one

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently set up a committee to review the ATM interchange fee. Every time you make a transaction at an ATM machine that does not belong to your card-issuing bank, it pays an interchange fee to the operator of the ATM you have used. At present, the card issuing bank pays a fee of  ₹15 for each cash transaction and  ₹5 for each non-cash one. While operators have been pushing for a fee hike for some time, citing increased costs, some banks have been resisting the move. The extra cost burden will eventually get passed on to customers. Disha Sanghvi asks experts if a fee hike is inevitable and why.
V Balasubramanian, President - Merchant & Terminal Business, FSS
Rate hike will add more ATMs, promote inclusion
We have been pushing for a hike in interchange rate as new regulatory requirements, coupled with low interchange rates, were making it unfeasible for service providers to deploy or operate ATMs.
We are happy about the recent announcement by RBI about the review of the interchange rate mechanism in the interest of offering better services.
The hike in interchange rate is inevitable for several reasons. First, the significant increase in the cost of operations of ATMs due to the need to comply with various regulations. Second, the acquiring banks will deploy more ATMs if the interchange is increased, as this will make them viable. This will help the industry grow and promote financial inclusion, especially in the digitally-backward, cash-rich rural economy. Third, the Nandan Nilekani report clearly highlights the role of cash and ATMs in promoting digital transactions. In India, there is an immense need for ATMs, especially in tier II-IV cities and rural areas. With interchange rate hike, both banks and white-label ATM operators will deploy more ATMs.
Surinder Chawla, Head, Retail Liabilities and Wealth Management, RBL Bank
Let banks decide how much they want to charge
Financial inclusion and expansion of bank accounts across various strata of society and regions has given an impetus to ATMs and their nationwide distribution through government and private sector initiatives. ATMs will be vital to financial institutions.
There is growing incidence of cyber crimes, and a number of advisories and risk-mitigation inputs from the regulator have been mandated. Banks have invested in securing their ATM networks and customer touchpoints. This has led to reasonably high costs for all stakeholders, including service providers and cash transit agencies, which need to be paid by banks. Also, the pricing of ATM transactions has been static for the last few years.
While the ATM industry is clamouring for an increase in the pricing of ATM transactions to recover costs, it may be time to liberalize this service, like interest rates were freed to let market forces determine pricing. Banks can compete and decide the number of free transactions they want to offer, as well as the pricing, with a maximum cap to be determined by the regulator.
Himanshu Pujara, Regional managing director, Asia Pacific, Euronet Worldwide
More cards are issued than the ATM network can support
RBI’s payment system benchmarking report underlined what industry participants have been saying for years now: that while India is a cash-dependent economy, the per capita ATM coverage is among the lowest in the world. This is a result of low incentives offered to ATM deployers and the disproportionate costs of running the channel.
The recent RBI regulations on various security measures for ATMs and the guidelines of the ministry of home affairs on revised cash loading processes are good for consumers and the industry overall. However, these have led to the penalising of the ATM deploying entity, which is picking up the cost, while certain banks that issue more cards than can be supported by their ATM network continue to enjoy the lower interchange fee established years ago.
For reference, the number of ATMs in the country has grown by 2% over the last 20 months, while banks have issued 120 million new cards in the period. The only way for the ATM industry to continue to survive is by increasing the ATM interchange fee.
Puneet Kapoor, Senior executive vice president, Kotak Mahindra Bank
New mandates will further increase costs for operators
With the ongoing implementation of guidelines issued last year by the ministry of home affairs and RBI’s circular on the mechanism of cash loading in ATMs, the cost of running ATMs is going to increase for both banks and operators.
At present, only the cash that is required for the day is supplemented in the machines, but the new directive says operators must swap out the cassette, or the box that holds the cash, itself. The impact of this change in terms of the cost incurred is being absorbed by banks.
Another mandate announced in the last monetary policy says that all ATM machines need to be grouted to a wall, pillar or floor, in order to enhance the security. This is an expensive exercise. Each of these proposed changes will increase costs.
As these changes get implemented, the viability of running an ATM network will be more compromised. A hike in the ATM interchange fee is desirable because for someone who is running a large network of ATMs, there is a significant cost to be absorbed, even in the current protocol itself."

Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company has a total exposure of around  ₹140 crore in crisis-hit home loan and property finance firm Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL), a source said.
The total exposure of the mutual fund industry in the company is estimated at  ₹5,000 crore from 10 asset management companies (AMCs), he said.

Its current assets under management (AUM) stood at  ₹1,70,000 lakh crore.

Do nice boys finish last? Bandhan Bank Ltd’s promoters probably know the answer since they are in a race to meet regulatory rules on shareholding.
It is a tough road and the stock is already paying a price, having fallen since the beginning of the year. One of the lender’s much larger competitors, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, chose rather to take the regulator to court on the shareholding issue, and its shares are doing much better.
Investors didn’t show Bandhan Bank any love after a strong performance in the June quarter (Q1) either. The lender continues to report robust growth and low toxic level in loans.
Indeed, small is not only beautiful, but it is highly profitable, too. Bandhan Bank beat Street estimates for the second time by reporting a sharp 45% jump in net profit for the June quarter against an expected modest increase of around 30% by the Street.
That this profit growth came on the back of strong core income growth of 36% was another reason to rejoice.
The lender managed to maintain its asset quality metrics and even ramped up provisioning to be safe. Gross bad loans were 2.02% of its loan book that expanded to a healthy 39% for the June quarter.
Provisions were raised by 56% from a year ago, which meant that its coverage ratio also improved. Having realized its folly of lending to large companies, when its strong point was basically microloans, Bandhan Bank is now back to focusing on such small loans again.
The growth in non-microloans has decelerated and the bank’s overall loan book, too, is growing slower than before because of this. Microloans continue to grow near long-term average for the bank.
To be sure, loan growth has decelerated over the last one year. Another worry is the sharp fall in the share of low-cost current account savings account (CASA) deposits on a sequential basis. The CASA ratio dropped from 40% in the March quarter to 36.06% as of June end. That said, it is still higher than a year ago.
The stock trades at a multiple of almost four times its estimated book value for FY21. That is lower than Kotak Mahindra Bank’s multiple of five times, even though Bandhan Bank’s lower base means its growth is likely to be higher.
As pointed out earlier, investors still worry that the bank has given no clear road map as to how the promoter stake would come down to the permissible level of 40%. While announcing the Q1 results, too, the management had not thrown any light on this.
The last attempt of the bank to shed promoter weight, through the acquisition of Gruh Finance Ltd, was a costly one, and the effect of it is yet to play out on the books of Bandhan Bank."
63,2019-07-22,Kotak,"Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a deceleration in loan growth to 18% for Q1 from 22% a year agoThe management cited a slowdown in demand and flagged concerns over auto, real estate, small biz

When the valuable HDFC Bank’s shares dropped about 3% reacting to slowing loan growth, can the most expensive private bank stock be unaffected?
Kotak Mahindra Bank shares, too, dropped 3.6% on Monday, ahead of the release of its first-quarter results. Sure enough, the bank reported a deceleration in loan growth for the June quarter to 18%, lower than the 22% growth for the corresponding period in FY19. Sequentially, loans hardly grew at all.
Loans to companies grew just 7.4%, a far cry from double-digit growth the lender reported in previous quarters. While for any first quarter, a slowdown would be taken in stride, times are not good in terms of economic growth.
What should worry investors is the commentary from the management. The message that the management sent out to investors was that of caution. Dipak Gupta, joint managing director said that sectors such as automobiles, non-bank finance companies and even small businesses demanded greater caution, given the bumpy times ahead. “Corporate has been sluggish and will be sluggish,"" he said in a media conference.
Indeed, carmakers aren’t selling as much as they used to, real estate is in a prolonged slowdown and non-bank lenders who nudged customers to borrow and buy cars and houses are under increased stress. For a bank lending to all these sectors, times are not looking good.
So, Kotak Mahindra Bank has fortified itself with provisions and its coverage ratio is a healthy 67%. Gupta said that the lender would focus on seeking “good pockets"" and avoid huge risks. It should avoid risk, given that for the June quarter, there was a 76% surge in borrowers who haven’t repaid for more than 60 days. A delay of a month more would turn them bad.
For the June quarter, however, the lender reported an enviable gross bad-loan ratio of 2.19%. The bank has reduced its exposure to non-bank finance companies after troubles began intensifying for many of them in the aftermath of defaults triggered by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) last year.
The intent to avoid troubled sectors is visible and the management said that loan growth will continue to come from retail. Even though it is cautious on automakers, non-bank lenders and developers, the lender is willing to chase retail borrowers seeking loans to buy homes and cars. Gupta said that despite the slowdown, repayments won’t be affected here.
Incipient signs of a slowdown aside, the bank’s valuations could borrow strength from its robust core income growth and margins. Both net-interest income and net-interest margins were above Street expectations for the June quarter. Even after the 3% fall on Monday, the stock quotes at a multiple of over 5 times its estimated book value for FY21.
If it guns for good pockets as indicated, perhaps investors would continue to favour the stock."

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.1%. South Korea's KOSPI shed 0.3%, Australian stocks lost 0.2% and Japan's Nikkei fell 0.5%.
Global equity markets had risen briefly towards the end of last week after dovish comments by New York Fed President John Williams boosted the prospect of the central bank lowering rates by 50 basis points at its 30-31 July meeting.
But the stock markets gave back those gains on Friday, with Wall Street shares ending in negative territory, after the New York Fed walked back Williams’ comments by saying his speech was not about potential policy action at the upcoming Fed meeting.
Expectations for a 50 basis points cut were scaled back further after the Wall Street Journal reported the Fed was likely to cut rates by 25 bps when it meets later this month, and may make further cuts in the future given global growth and trade uncertainties.
Back home, key companies which will announce their June quarter results on Monday are Kotak Mahindra Bank, United Spirits, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL), Oriental Bank of Commerce, TVS Motor Company, ICICI Securities, Just Dial, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals and Mastek.
Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL)and HDFC Bank are likely to be in focus on Monday after they announced their June quarter earnings after markets closed for trading last week. Reliance Industries Ltd on Friday reported a 6.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) increase in net profit for the June quarter, beating Street estimates on the back of strong performances by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Reliance Retail. RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM), or the amount a refiner earns by refining one barrel of crude oil, narrowed to $8.1 a barrel—an 18-quarter-low for the company.
HDFC Bank Ltd on Saturday said its first quarter net profit rose 21% on account of higher provisions and other income. Asset quality deteriorated marginally as gross non-performing assets (NPAs), as a percentage of total advances, rose to 1.4% in the June quarter compared to 1.33% in the year-ago period.
Meanwhile, the dollar and US Treasury yields rose on the greater likelihood of a shallower 25 bps rate cut.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 97.152 after rising 0.4% on Friday. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield stretched Friday’s rise and climbed to 2.058%.
The greenback was nearly flat at 107.830 yen after adding 0.4% on Friday thanks to the rise in US yields. The euro was little changed at $1.1218 after shedding 0.5% on Friday.
In commodities, Brent crude futures were up 1.26% at $63.26 per barrel following a gain of about 0.9% on Friday. Crude was buoyant after Iran’s Revolutionary Guards on Friday captured a British-flagged oil tanker in the Gulf after Britain seized an Iranian vessel earlier this month, further raising tensions along a vital international oil shipping route.
Gold slipped from a six-year high as the dollar firmed and as expectations for a deep rate cut by the Fed were dialed back.

The budget earmarks 100 billion rupees for drinking water projects in rural areas.
Kanawala also favors lenders that have good access to borrowing resources, as they’re likely to gain share amid the problems in the non-bank financial industry.
Kotak Mahindra Life has about  ₹9,500 crore in equity holdings. Kotak Classic Opportunities - its top fund with  ₹4,370 crore of stocks - has returned 11% annually over the past five years, beating 73% of rivals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The US-China trade dispute “becomes more and more painful after each round of talks between the two nations and no resolution.""
“Central banks are getting accommodative across the globe and we expect another round of monetary easing in the next six to 12 months. We aren’t sure about how it impacts the global economy, but the impact on markets will definitely be positive.""
“Among financial stocks, apart from banks, we prefer shares of insurance firms and asset management companies."""
61,2019-07-23,Kotak,"Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd reported a 32.7% jump in its first-quarter profit'The corporate loan book grew slowly in the June quarter,' said Jaimin Bhatt, chief financial officer of Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd reported a 32.7% jump in its first-quarter profit on Monday, but its results fell marginally shy of estimates and it became the third private-sector Indian bank in a row to sound a cautionary note about the slowing pace of domestic growth.
The lender, helmed by billionaire Uday Kotak who is one of Asia's richest bankers, said its advances in the June quarter rose 18%, compared with a rise of 24% a year ago.
""The corporate loan book grew slowly in the June quarter,"" said Jaimin Bhatt, chief financial officer of Kotak Mahindra Bank, at a press briefing following the bank's results. ""And on the retail front, we've seen negative growth in auto loans both on a year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter basis.""
A series of factors from distress in the rural economy due to a run of droughts in key agricultural belts, to a liquidity crunch in the shadow banking sector following the collapse of infrastructure lender IL&FS, has led to a rapid cooling in the domestic economy, presenting a challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government as it begins its second term.
Dipak Gupta, joint managing director at Kotak Mahindra Bank, warned the small and medium enterprises segment continued to be a pain point.
""We've been cautious about the slowdown for some six to nine months and will continue to remain cautious,"" said Gupta, adding that the bank was seeing some stress in its unsecured loan book, but this was ""not at alarming levels"".
HDFC Bank, the largest private bank in the country, also warned of slower retail loan growth, in an analyst call on Saturday after announcing its results. The bank stated that the slowdown in the auto sector and stress in the agricultural space were hurting growth.
Following the warning, HDFC Bank's stock on Monday closed at an over two-month low. Its warning came close of the heels of one from smaller rival RBL Bank, which also saw its stock plunge after it flagged risks to its asset quality and warned of a rise in bad loans.
Meanwhile, Kotak's gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans came in slightly higher at 2.19% by the end of June, versus 2.14% at the end of the March quarter and 2.17% in the same period a year ago. The bank said it expected its credit cost to remain in the range of 50-60 basis points, as guided earlier.
The banks in Asia's third largest economy have been dealing with a huge pile of stressed loans worth over $150 billion, with the state-run banks holding the vast majority of the bad debt.
The warnings from the private sector lenders like HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, which have been investor darlings, have amplified concerns around slowing growth and spooked investors.
India's benchmark Nifty Index has fallen 6.25% after touching a lifetime high in early June, and the Nifty Bank Index ended down 1.63% on Monday.

Mumbai: Indian markets may be marginally higher on Tuesday after severe sell-off in equities on Monday. 
Asian stock markets were higher tracking gains in the US. The US stocks gained ground on Monday at the onset of a heavy earnings week, while European shares inched higher as investors took heart from potential progress in US-China trade talks and increasing geopolitical tensions sent oil prices climbing.

Kotak Mahindra Bank on Monday reported a 33% increase in its June quarter net profit due to higher net interest income and lower provisions. Net profit for the quarter stood at  ₹1,360.20 crore, up 32.71%, from  ₹1,024.94 crore a year ago.
Major companies which are going to announce June quarter results on Tuesday are Larsen & Toubro, Hindustan Unilever, Zee Entertainment Enterprises, SBI Life Insurance Company, HDFC Life Insurance Company, Jyothy Labs, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, M&M Financial Services and Indian Overseas Bank.
Oil prices inched lower on Tuesday as the International Energy Agency (IEA) said it would act quickly if needed to keep the market supplied amid tensions in the Middle East and traders eyed a weaker demand outlook.
Brent crude futures slipped 2 cents to $63.24 a barrel by 0121 GMT. The international benchmark rose more than 1% in the previous session, following Iran’s seizure of a British tanker last week that stoked fears of supply disruptions from the energy-rich Gulf.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday that the government plans to take policy measures “fairly quickly"" to address the challenges plaguing the industry. She said also that the government is open to hearing out the grievances of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs).
The minister was speaking to reporters after meeting chief executives of private and state-run banks as she kicked off a series of meetings planned with various industry heads. She met the heads of State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Punjab National Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank among others. The meeting also discussed the credit requirements of non-bank lenders, automobile industry and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and the transmission of interest rate cuts to the economy.
“Behind the series of meetings is to hear them out and fairly quickly after that come out with something that will help those sectors...We are getting inputs from various sectors and trying to respond so that the confidence of those sectors is being restored,"" Sitharaman said.
Over the next few days, the minister will meet representatives from several sectors —FPIs, automakers, industry associations, financial markets, MSMEs, industry associations and real estate to listen to their challenges. This is the first time the finance minister is meeting top executives in the second term of the National Democratic Alliance government, in a way acknowledging the ongoing economic slowdown and the government’s willingness to take inputs from businesses.
Sitharaman said the economic affairs secretary will soon hold talks with FPIs on their problems. There has been a massive outflow of overseas funds following the Union budget announcement to impose higher surcharge on some of these investors.
Bankers who attended the meeting sought the government’s intervention on tax notices asking lenders to pay service tax and Goods and Services Tax (GST) on minimum balance accounts. Banks will soon respond to the notices, Sitharaman said, adding Jan Dhan accounts and basic deposit and savings accounts do not attract any charges.
On the decision to borrow overseas in foreign currency, Sitharaman said she will not speculate on the number of tranches and the finance ministry has done nothing in this regard, besides the announcement in the budget, owing to commitments in the ongoing Parliament session.
During the March quarter, India’s economy grew at 5.8%, the slowest in five years. Growth in 2018-19 was 6.8%, down from 7.2% a year ago. Besides the slowdown in fresh private investments, subdued demand and stress at non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are affecting growth.
In signs of a persistent slowdown, India’s automobile makers are finding it hard to sell vehicles, and NBFCs and MSMEs are struggling to access credit.
Overall credit growth continues to be at 12%, which is marginally lower than 13.3% at the end of March, the finance ministry said in a statement after the meeting.
“At the same time, with turnaround in the NPA cycle, high provision cover of over 75%, and record recovery, banks’ balance sheet are healthier than before. Banks are now, therefore, in position to step up lending,"" said a finance ministry statement.
MoS for finance Anurag Thakur, finance secretary Rajiv Kumar, economic affairs secretary Atanu Chakraborty, expenditure secretary G.C. Murmu, revenue secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey, RBI deputy governor NS Vishawanathan, were among those who attended the meeting."

55,2019-08-13,Kotak,"The fund, managed by Kotak Investment Advisors, is anchored by a $500 million commitment from ADIAKotak Special Situations Fund looks to invest in stressed assets opportunities

Kotak Special Situations Fund, which aims to invest in distressed assets, has reached its final close with total commitments of $1 billion ( ₹7,000 crore) from investors, a top executive said.
The fund, launched in February 2019, is anchored by a $500 million commitment from sovereign wealth fund Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). The fund will be managed by Kotak Investment Advisors Ltd.
Other investors are sovereign wealth funds and one very large family foundation based out of India, Srini Sriniwasan, managing director and chief executive officer of Kotak Investment Advisors Ltd said in a phone interview. The capital, he said, could be deployed at any point over the next four years while the fund life will be about ten years.
“This is a sector-agnostic fund that addresses the stressed assets problem in the country. Right now, the stressed asset opportunity can be divided into two parts—one is for those assets that are going through the NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) process and the others are those companies, which under the new RBI’s (Reserve Bank of India) dispensation, allow for a potential one-time settlement with their lenders to avoid the NCLT process. We are happy to finance both these opportunities,"" said Sriniwasan.
“The average ticket size could be anywhere between  ₹350-700 crore for a single investment as we don’t want to have a very high concentration of a single stressed asset. But in terms of our actual ability to do a transaction, we can do much larger deals of more than  ₹1,200-1,500 crore each, because our investors have given us capital with the expectation that we will be able to show them additional co-investment opportunities so they can put more capital to work. In that sense, we would be interested in any transaction that is between  ₹350-1,500 crore?,"" he added.
With the final close of its special situations fund, Kotak joins other investors that have been tapping the distressed debt opportunity in India, which has the world’s worst non-performing loan ratio.
The country’s banking system saw its bad loans peak at 11.5% in March 2018 and then decline to 9.3% in March this year.
The Reserve Bank of India expects gross non-performing assets to decline further to 9% by March next year, as capital infusions from the government help public sector banks, while private sector banks tap markets to raise capital.
“The Kotak Special Situations Fund has been closed at an opportune time for us. We have a flexible investment mandate enabling us to provide much needed capital to address the short-term financial dislocation in the market as well as long-term capital to address the NPL (non-performing loan) issue,"" said Sriniwasan.
In January, Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd closed its distressed assets focused fund EISAF II, with a corpus of $1.3 billion. AION Capital, a joint venture between US-headquartered global private equity fund Apollo Global and domestic alternative assets manager ICICI Venture, is on the road to raise its second fund, targeting a corpus of over $1 billion.
Aditya Birla Capital Ltd, the financial services arm of Aditya Birla Group, has tied up with alternative assets manager Varde Partners to invest in distressed assets in India.
Other investors active in the space include Piramal Enterprises Ltd which has set up a distressed asset investment platform with Bain Capital Credit, in order to invest $1 billion in stressed assets, Hong Kong-based SSG Capital Management and new entrants such as Cerberus Capital Management Lp.
“In addition to the opportunities that arise out of the IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) process, the fund also has the flexibility to provide structured credit solutions in the current environment where capital availability is scarce,"" said Sriniwasan.
“That may be a short-term investment opportunity for companies that are facing liquidity issues, and we have the flexibility to participate in such opportunities as well,"" he added.
Kotak Investment Advisors is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and was set up in 2005 with its first private equity fund.
So far, the alternate assets business has raised $3.8 billion across different asset classes including private equity funds, real estate funds, infrastructure funds, the special situations credit fund and listed equities."

49,2019-09-05,Kotak,"Bajaj Finance Ltd. has picked banks including Nomura Holdings Inc. and Kotak Mahindra BankBajaj Finance plans to sell the shares by December, the people said

Indian shadow lender Bajaj Finance Ltd. has picked banks including Nomura Holdings Inc. and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. to arrange a share sale of about $1 billion, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The financier has also selected JM Financial Ltd. for the proposed offering and may add more arrangers later, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. The company plans to sell the shares by December, the people said. Bajaj Finance may raise equity capital, subject to board and shareholder approval, Managing Director Rajeev Jain had told investors in July, without providing further details.
Selling shares will help Bajaj Finance to raise funds to expand lending as many of its peers grapple with a liquidity crunch. The credit profile of the financier has remained unscathed even as many of its rivals got shunned from India’s credit market after a string of defaults from IL&FS Group to Dewan Housing Finance Corp Ltd. over the past year.
Deliberations are ongoing and details including fundraising size could still change, the people said. Representatives for Bajaj Finance and Nomura declined to comment, while those for Kotak and JM didn’t immediately respond to emails and phone calls seeking comments.
The lender’s shares rose 23% this year, making it one of the top gainers on 116 member BSE Finance Index. Bajaj Finance rose 0.2% to 3,258 rupees at 11:45 a.m. in Mumbai on Thursday.

48,2019-09-05,Kotak,"Bajaj Finance has appointed i-banks Kotak Mahindra Capital, JM Financial and Nomura to manage the share saleThe proposed share sale is expected to be closed within the current fiscal year

Mumbai: Consumer focussed lender Bajaj Finance Ltd has hired investment banks to help it raise up to $1 billion through a share sale, said two people aware of the development.
“They are looking to raise funds through a qualified institutional placement (QIP). The lender has appointed i-banks Kotak Mahindra Capital, JM Financial and Nomura to manage the share sale,"" said one of the persons cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to the media.
The proposed share sale is expected to be closed within the current fiscal year, he added.
Emails sent to Bajaj Finance, Kotak Mahindra Capital and JM Financial did not elicit a response. A spokesperson for Nomura declined to comment.
On Thursday, Bajaj Finance told stock exchanges that its board of directors will meet on 17 September to consider, “a proposal for raising of funds by way of qualified institutions placement, subject to such regulatory/statutory approvals as may be required, including approval of the shareholders of the company"".
QIP is a capital-raising tool through which listed companies can sell shares, fully and partly convertible debentures, or any securities other than warrants that are convertible into stocks, to a qualified institutional buyer.
The proposed share sale will help the non-bank lender shore up its balance sheet when consumer demand is showing signs of weakness and liquidity has been scarce for lenders.
For the quarter ended 30 June, Bajaj Finance’s assets under management grew by 41% to  ₹1.29 trillion.
“Gross NPA and Net NPA stood at 1.60% and 0.64%, respectively, on 30 June 2019. Adjusted for IL&FS exposure, GNPA and NNPA stood at 1.42% and 0.50%, respectively,"" the lender said in its recent exchange filings.
Bajaj Finance has also been exploring other routes to diversify its funding sources. “During the quarter, we established a secured Euro Medium Term Note (MTN) Programme for programme value of $1.50 billion on Singapore stock exchange. We intend to raise $750 million through ECB (external commercial borrowing), as allowed under automatic route, to diversify and strengthen our liability profile by March 2020,"" the lender said.
Till August, only five firms had tapped the markets to raise funds via QIP this year, raising a total of  ₹8,412.87 crore, while in 2018, 25 firms raised  ₹16,587 crore through this route, data from primary market tracker Primer Database shows."

Singapore: The real estate and financial services sectors in India are set to witness a significant consolidation in the next two years, said Uday Kotak, CEO and MD of Kotak Mahindra Bank.
Speaking at the HT-MintAsia Leadership Summit in Singapore on Friday, Kotak said banks need to be very alert because no one knows “who’s going to eat your lunch the next day"".
“One of the things we’ve got to consider ourselves lucky is that, globally, Google and Amazon have decided not to go into banking,"" he said.
Drawing an analogy between the banking sector and Bollywood films, Kotak said private banking in India is currently “seeing a love story developing, but there’s a villain in the middle"". “I think the villain is slowing growth and Indians are scared to invest (in the economy) because they are worried that things might not get better. It’s a classic thing I’ve seen so many times over—and we go through it every few years. Look at the 1998 Asian financial crisis, then 2008 and now 2018,"" he said.
And, what have these cycles taught him? “My view is it’s never as good as it looks and it is never ever as bad as it looks."" Kotak said interest rates should be cut further and the rupee allowed to depreciate a little more. There is also work to be done on the governance front, he said.
“I think on the governance framework side, there is an issue with six layers of checks and balances that are not working —the management, board of directors, institutional investors, auditors, regulators and rating agencies. Quality of governance is also an extremely important part.""
He said the financial sector is going through an “evolution"", citing IBC as an example. “When it was ushered in, we believed we were going to have a fantastic cleaning up of the system quickly. But it has taken longer...Once you’re doing a clean-up, a speedy clean-up is as important. Second, I don’t think India is fully ready for challenges in financial sector resolution. An example is DHFL. So, how do we resolve the financial sector when the insolvency and bankruptcy court don’t apply to the sector? We need a fourth financial sector resolution mechanism,"" he said.

46,2019-09-06,Kotak,"Uday Kotak has pointed to a behavioural shift as a factor. People are increasingly seeking alternatives to private transport, in his observation

Uday Kotak, chief executive officer of Kotak Mahindra Bank, has stirred a debate over sliding car sales. The usual assumption is that the current economic slump is to blame. Kotak, however, has pointed to a behavioural shift as a factor. People are increasingly seeking alternatives to private transport, in his observation. He has cited the example of his son, who, he says, now prefers to use Uber and Ola.
Uber, of course, has made it a mission to convince people that the availability of its service means it’s pointless owning a car. Cabs are easy to hail, and not much more expensive, if maintenance costs and a driver’s salary are considered. The finer point of a change in behaviour, though, concerns the declining influence of a four-wheeler as a status symbol. A culture that places a premium on convenience may be upon us, and car marketers may have to rethink their strategies. Does this mean their sales pitches need to turn utility-oriented? Perhaps not. The market could get polarized. Those who simply need to get from point A to point B will opt for cabs. Passionate motorists, however, would still want to get behind the wheel."

Fogg maker Vini in talks to raise fresh capital to fund growth plan
Vini Cosmetics, maker of Fogg deodorants, is in talks with several investment firms, including its existing private equity investor WestBridge Capital, to raise money and fund its next growth plan, Mint reported citing founder and promoter Darshan Patel. The fundraising plan, which may involve dilution of promoter stakes, is in line with its strategy to expand its product portfolio and double its revenue to  ₹2,000 crore in the next three years. “We are in talks with several investors. We want to bring in strategic investors who can help take this company to another level...from a small to a midsize company,"" Patel told Mint over the phone. As part of the growth plan, the Ahmedabad-based firm would look at both the organic and inorganic route to expand its product portfolio. At present, the company earns more than 80% of its revenue from the Fogg deodorant brand, while the rest comes from other products, such facial powder White Tone and facial cream Glam-Up. Patel launched Vini Cosmetics in 2010 after spending two decades at Paras Pharmaceuticals, which he co-owned with his brothers. Patel had a 24% stake in the company. In 2006, he sold his stake to private equity firm Actis Capital for $43 million following differences with his brothers. He later exited the company, which was acquired by Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc in 2010 for  ₹3,260 crore.

New Silk Route looks to exit Rolex Rings
Rajat Gupta and Parag Saxena-promoted private equity fund New Silk Route is making a last-ditch attempt to recover money from its troubled portfolio, The Economic Times reported citing persons with direct knowledge of the deal. After several failed attempts to exit the firms, including an IPO which did not go through due to valuation mismatch, the fund has initiated the sale of its 45% stake in Rolex Rolled Rings and has invited investment bankers to manage the sale process. While the deal is still at a very nascent stage, the company is currently being valued at  ₹2,000 crore. New Silk Route (NSR) bought around 26% stake in the Rajkot, Gujarat-based company for $40 million in 2007. The fund subsequently increased its shareholding in the company to 45%. The promoters Manesh Madeka and family that own around 55% stake in the company are also keen on selling their stake."

40,2019-09-20,Kotak,"Move to tax new manufacturing firms set up after 1 Oct at 15% is expected to strengthen the MSME sectorThe move is likely to help the Centre achieve the target of growing India’s exports to $1 trillion in the next five years, as lower taxes will help homegrown firms compete with global peers

The cut in corporate tax rates on Friday will play a major role in reviving economic growth, which slumped to 5% in the June quarter, besides improving the investment climate and pushing private sector capex, said industry leaders.
A slowing economy and consumer demand slump, amid banking sector woes over non-performing assets and the liquidity crunch facing non-bank lenders, had fuelled uncertainties and volatility in the Indian market.
The government announcement to cut basic corporate tax rate for domestic firms from 30% to 22%, and for new manufacturing firms from 25% to 15%, is a “bold move"" that will make Indian firms more competitive on the global stage, said senior leaders and company executives. It will also help attract significant investments from foreign and long-term investors.
“The government’s decisive steps to pump-prime the economy will lead to a big reset and revive animal spirits in corporate India. The reduction in corporate tax rates will not only lead to economic buoyancy, but will also make Indian industry more competitive globally,"" said Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman, Aditya Birla Group. The steps will also lead to a paradigm shift in the mindset, Birla added.
The move is likely to help the Centre achieve the target of growing India’s exports to $1 trillion in the next five years, as lower taxes will help homegrown firms compete with global peers. In 2018-19 India’s exports crossed the half-a-trillion-dollar mark to clock $537 billion. While goods exports were at an all-time high of $331 billion, services exports were at $205 billion. 
Uday Kotak, executive vice-chairman and managing director, Kotak Mahindra Bank, said the government’s decision will level the playing field and allow Indian companies to compete with those in lower-tax jurisdictions.
Industry leaders also expect the move to boost industry sentiment and lead to a revival in capital expenditure. 
Mint reported on 2 July that investments in new projects had plunged to a 15-year low in the June quarter, citing data of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Indian firms, across private and public sectors, announced projects worth  ₹43,400 crore in the June quarter, 81% lower than in the March quarter, and 87% lower than a year ago.
“We are certain that this Big Bang reform will kick-start the economy. Surplus funds available to firms will be invested in capex and talent,"" said Ajay Piramal, chairman, Piramal Group, adding non-banking financial firms will be able to save  ₹250-300 crore, which can potentially be redeployed as loans. The move to tax new manufacturing firms set up after 1 October at 15% will prove to be a significant boost to entrepreneurship and is expected to strengthen the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector, which are key cogs in the industrial supply chains. The move “will unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of new India"", said Vedanta chairman Anil Agarwal. “The revised rate of minimum alternative tax will pave way for new investments from startups and MSMEs; to create a robust ancillary ecosystem,"" he added.

39,2019-09-23,Kotak,"Currently, this as a good opportunity to enter midcap and smallcap segments of the market: Kotak Mutual FundKotak Standard Multicap Fund, the company’s biggest fund, has returned an average of about 11% over the past five years

Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. has loaded up on shares of Indian mid- and small-sized businesses based on its primary investment rule to pick stocks rather than try to time the market. It’s been a volatile year for Indian stocks, however, with the Sensex’s 12% climb through early June nearly wiped out as of Thursday’s close. The benchmark gauge surged 5.3% Friday after the country cut its corporate tax rate, putting it back in the green for the year.
“For investors it’s very difficult to time market phases,"" Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer-equity at India’s sixth-largest fund manager, said in an interview at his office in Mumbai last week. “If you can take a little bit of more risk, you should tilt toward mid- and small-cap as this basket can give higher returns when the market stabilizes.""
India’s smaller stocks have been hit by a slowing economy and a severe dent in consumption. The Nifty Midcap 100 Index has slumped 25% from its peak in January 2018 and now trades 14.3 times its estimated 12-month earnings, lower than the Nifty 50 Index’s 17.5 times.
Kotak sees this as a good opportunity to enter this segment of the market, as it expects Indian lenders to pass interest-rate reductions by the central bank to their customers. “If it happens, it will improve consumer and corporate demand, and that will be one of the bigger triggers,"" Upadhyaya said.
The money manager prefers non-consumer companies and will continue to add shares of businesses such as industrial-equipment suppliers, chemicals, cement and gas utilities. Consumer stocks constitute nearly 12% of its holdings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of Aug. 31.
About 40% of the firm’s holdings are financial stocks. Around 55% of its stock holdings are larger companies, while mid- and small-sized names constitute a total 39%.
Kotak Standard Multicap Fund, the company’s biggest fund with about $3.6 billion of assets, has returned an average of about 11% over the past five years, topping 82% of its rivals, according to Bloomberg data. That compares with a 7.4% annual return generated by the Nifty 200 over the same period.
Here are some more comments from Upadhyaya:
Although interest rates have fallen and are expected to drop further, the initial leg of revival will likely be among companies with strong balance sheets
India has been a beneficiary of abundant global liquidity and low interest rates, and if anything changes with that it will impact local investors
If oil prices rise, that would add to the problems that local investors are already facing

If that’s not met, creditors can sell shares in the group’s flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. kept as collateral against loans

Indian media giant Essel Group, run by industry mogul Subhash Chandra, is seeking an extension to repay debt in order to avoid creditors liquidating its shares.
The company faces a month-end debt repayment deadline. If that’s not met, creditors can sell shares in the group’s flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. kept as collateral against loans. The case highlights broader risks that borrowings backed by stock pose to the equity market. There’s a lot at stake with share-backed loans currently at about 1.9 trillion rupees ($26.5 billion).
Essel Group’s Chandra is seeking to sell assets ranging from a stake in the nation’s most valuable publicly traded TV network to roads. Shares of his Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. have plummeted to the lowest level in five years.
“We have certainly discussed the point pertaining to the extension as well, purely in the interest of deriving the right value for the precious assets,"" said Punit Goenka, managing director and chief executive officer at Zee Enterprises in an emailed response, “The lenders have noted our view and have been extremely supportive.""
The media tycoon’s challenge is the first of what could be a string of tests this year for beleaguered business titans. They have raised funds to expand their empires by pledging equity stakes in their firms and the clock is ticking as repayment dates loom.
Risks Mount
“Not everybody is going to come out of this alive,"" said Jayanth R Varma, a professor at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad, referring to the founder’s funding predicament. “I can’t imagine that all the groups that are in trouble today will be able to sort out their mess.""
Chandra has already sold $614 million of its Zee Entertainment Stake to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund and has agreed to sell his solar power projects for $182 million to Adani Green Energy Ltd. The Essel Group has begun paying back creditors, including about half of the 3.95 billion rupees ($55.7 million) it owes Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co., Harsha Upadhyay, chief investment officer for the asset management firm said in an interview.
Still, some lenders didn’t agree to extend Essel Group’s repayment deadline beyond September end and has sold the shares of Zee Entertainment kept as loan collateral, a representative for the company said in an email statement on Tuesday. Others have “in-principally agreed to grant more time to"" repay debt, the representative said.
Broader Concerns
Shares of publicly traded firms with a large portion of equity pledged as collateral risk abrupt declines should lenders move to recover their dues. For instance, Chandra’s Zee Entertainment lost $1.6 billion in market capitalization in a single day on fears that creditors would offload shares.
A spokesman for Emami Ltd. declined to comment.
Should Essel group clear its debt hurdles, equity investors will still need to keep a close eye on the progress other conglomerates make in slashing debt, as companies’ credit quality endures the longest streak of deterioration since 2014.
“Stocks are getting decimated on their market capitalization, some company founders have realized their error and are liquidating assets,"" said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice-president at IIFL Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “Prudent risk management is the order of the day.""

37,2019-09-25,Kotak,"State Bank of India declined following a rating downgrade by brokerage firm Morgan StanleyOther banking stocks such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Axis Bank were down 1-2% each

Banking and financial stocks were under severe selling pressure on Wednesday. The BSE Bankex has declined 1.7% so far today after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) put curbs on Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank. The central bank’s restrictions include limits on cash withdrawals amid a probe into accounting lapses, sparking speculation that the regulator may force a management change at the cooperative bank through a merger, according to a Mint report.
Shares of Housing Development & Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) fell 4% on news report that the RBI’s action on the PMC Bank was the result of a loan of  ₹2,500 crore to the now bankrupt real estate firm.
Among banking stocks, shares of State Bank of India fell the most--down over 4%--following a rating downgrade by brokerage firm Morgan Stanley. Other banking stocks such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Axis Bank were down 1-2% each.
India Ratings and Research has placed ratings of most of the public sector banks (PSBs) on ‘rating watch evolving (RWE)’, maintain a stable outlook for private banks. The rating agency believes banks have been facing the double whammy of absorbing aging provisions on corporate stressed assets and growing their balance sheets, while on-boarding minimum incremental stress.
“Post announcements of amalgamations, the anchor banks may deliver credit growth, although management bandwidth could be diverted towards the amalgamation process. Credit growth and asset recovery may not receive adequate attention in the short term as focus is also diverted towards asset quality harmonisation, human resource integration and other challenges,"" India Ratings and Research said in a report on 24 September.
It added that some of the banks excluded from the amalgamation process are likely to continue to shrink their balance sheets and may also require additional capital in FY20-FY21. It estimates that among its rated banks, the return on assets (RoA) of PSBs and private banks is expected to increase by up to 10 basis points (bps) and 30 bps (10%-15% higher than base case), respectively, as a result of the lowering of the corporate tax rate by government.
It said public sector banks may not see a material impact in FY20, especially given that many of them would be making net losses.
Others concur.
Kotak Institutional Equities expects the revised lower tax rate to have negligible impact on banks with high DTA (deferred tax asset). “We expect a positive impact on loan growth and provisions but offset by lower treasury. We maintain estimates but the long-term impact of return on equity (RoE) improvement is debatable. The impact on non-banks is mixed with lower tax rates (for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), negligible impact on housing finance companies (HFCs) that already enjoy 26-27% tax rates,"" it said in a report on 22 September."

Issues like liquidity, rate cut, credit disbursal were to be on the agenda between the Finance Minister and the lenders and financiers, sources said.

MUMBAI :
The Government on Tuesday allowed Kotak Mahindra Bank managing director Uday Kotak to continue as the head of bankrupt infra lender IL&FS for one more year.
Kotak was appointed by the Government as the head of the lender's board which will help the troubled company come out of difficulties, after the state took over the board.
Under the Banking Regulation Act, a bank cannot be managed by any person who is a director of any other company. She can be given a temporary exception for three months or nine months with the concurrence of the RBI.
Accordingly, Kotak was given a go-ahead for three months initially, which was followed up with a nine-month relaxation that ends on Wednesday.
The statutes will ""not apply to Kotak Mahindra Bank in so far as it relates to its Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Uday Kotak being on Board of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited as its Non-executive Director for a period up to the 2nd October, 2020"", a gazette notification from the Government said.
The notification was issued by the Department of Financial Services in the Ministry of Finance on Tuesday and signed by Joint Secretary Amit Agrawal.
It added that the exemption has been granted on the ""recommendation"" of the Reserve Bank of India.
Terming it as a ""historic development"", a source claimed this is the first time RBI is giving approval to Government to give an extension to a bank CEO to continue as chairman of another financial institution.
It can be noted that Kotak Mahindra Bank has dragged RBI to court over the issue of promoter group led by Uday Kotak's holding in the bank. The Bombay High Court has adjourned the matter by over a year to early 2020.
The Uday Kotak-led board has discovered that there was a complex web of over 250 companies which were a part of the overall IL&FS group, which has an outstanding of over  ₹94,000 crore to lenders. Over 90 per cent of the flagship company's assets are classified as dud.
The board is trying to keep the company as a going concern by focusing on asset sales and has appointed a resolution professional to steer the way.

32,2019-10-04,Kotak,"Bank stocks came under pressure in the past 10 days owing to renewed concerns over asset qualityMarket cap of HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra now tops that of other 10 banks in Nifty Bank by 10%

Indian banks have faced rough weather in the past two weeks and investors are rediscovering stocks that act as lifeboats in choppy waters.
HDFC Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd have emerged as these lifeboats over the last 10 days. Ergo, while the Nifty Bank index lost over 6% since 23 September, these stocks have weathered the selling pressure.
As the adjoining chart shows, the market capitalization of the two private sector lenders now exceeds that of the other 10 banks in the Nifty banking sector index by about 10%. Just three months ago, the combined value of the two banks was about 10% lower than the other 10 lenders, which include State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank Ltd, Axis Bank Ltd and seven of the remaining largest lenders in the country.
So what transpired in the last 10 days to drive investors away from other banks and towards HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank?
The collapse of Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank Ltd, which had an absurdly high exposure to real estate developers, brought to the fore the vulnerabilities of Indian banks in general.
Investors realized that Indian banks have an uncomfortable exposure to non-banking financial companies (NBFC) that finance real estate developers (HFCs). “Negative news flow around HFCs/NBFCs and banks has overshadowed the recent tax cut tailwind, bringing focus back on sector issues: liquidity issues and contagion risks,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd wrote in a note.
The result was a massive fall in stock prices, and banks such as Yes Bank Ltd and RBL Bank Ltd saw their valuation erode sharply. According to Jefferies India, Yes Bank has an exposure of more than  ₹10,000 crore to troubled companies it terms as “high risk"".
Even the more stronger and larger balance sheets such as SBI and ICICI Bank weren’t spared by investors.
In addition to the resurgence of stress, concerns that the current slowdown would affect the loan growth of banks also weighed in. Analysts at Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said banks are not likely to grow their loans as most companies would use savings from tax cuts to boost profits.
Analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd wrote in note, “We expect overall system credit to see 10-12% growth, but near-term growth trajectory depends on pick-up in consumer sentiment in this festive season.""
Investors flocked to HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank as they showed a track record of pristine asset quality. Moreover, both lenders have negligible exposure to troubled NBFCs. Lower stressed assets would mean lower provisioning for the two lenders and, therefore, the banks would have more free capital to lend. Ergo, their loan growth is likely to be superior to others.
Even so, the consumption slowdown is likely to affect all lenders. Investors know this. While HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank may have been spared in the recent rout in bank shares, investors await the quarterly performance for clarity."
31,2019-10-06,Kotak,"Harsha Upadhyaya of Kotak Mahindra AMC said this is a good time for patient investors to build long-term equity portfolios since market valuations seem to have discounted most of the pain in the economy

Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO, equity, at Kotak Mahindra AMC, told Mint that maintaining investment discipline across market phases and focusing on long-term bets selected after rigorous fundamental analysis helped their equity funds book top spots in their categories. He said this is a good time for patient investors to build long-term equity portfolios since market valuations seem to have discounted most of the pain in the economy.
Many of the Kotak equity funds have been in the top and next quartile in their respective categories over longer tenors. If you did an attribution analysis what would be the biggest contributor to the returns?
Our investment approach is a blend of top-down and bottom-up investing. Both sector allocation and stock selection have contributed equally well for consistent long-term performance. Another key contributor to our performance over the years has been the fact that we hold on to winners for a longer time as compared to the ones which drag our performance. More importantly, we have stuck to investment discipline across market phases and have focussed on long-term bets based on rigorous fundamental analysis.
The Kotak Standard Multicap fund has traditionally had a large-cap focus. But in the recent past, you spoke about the emerging opportunities in the mid- and small-cap space. Will this fund see a shift in focus? Does the large size of the fund impact portfolio construction decisions?
Kotak Standard Multicap has always had a large-cap tilt. Historically, the large-cap allocation has remained 65-75% of its portfolio. Currently, it is towards the upper range. We find valuations in the mid- and small-cap space potentially more rewarding for long-term investors. In line with this, we have been looking to increase allocation to this basket gradually over time. The large-cap tilt and long-term investment style have helped in creating consistent outperformance over the benchmark, with relatively lower volatility. Portfolio churn has always been low. We do not bet on event or tactical plays. Portfolio construction discipline in terms of selection of stocks, sizing of bets, diversification etc. have remained intact despite the increase in portfolio size and change in market conditions. We believe that this disciplined approach will aid performance even going forward.
Which themes and sub-themes look interesting in the Indian markets at this point in time?
We continue to focus on investment-driven domestic economy recovery plays in our portfolios. Recent policy initiatives from the government also focus on investment-driven recovery rather than a consumption-oriented one. We like domestic cyclicals with high operating leverage. We remain overweight on capital goods and cement sectors. In the cement sector, we expect pricing scenario to turn favourable going forward, given continuing strong volume growth. The fortunes of the capital goods sector are also brightening up gradually. In addition, there is not much debt on the books of most capital goods and cement companies. The profitability improvement is going to be much stronger once demand picks up on a sustainable basis. We also expect government spending to continue in infrastructure creation and private capex to pick up gradually, given lower tax rates in future, which augurs well for these sectors.
What has the fund house’s experience been with SIPs? While the industry has seen steady SIP inflows through the difficult market, is the level of discontinued SIPs a matter of concern?
Our SIP book has also been growing in line with industry trends. The MF industry collected over  ₹8,200 crore in SIPs during August 2019. The net monthly SIP flows at the industry level have remained fairly steady despite some discontinuations. Data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India data shows that the MF industry added, on an average, close to 10 lakh SIP accounts each month in FY20.
Managing downside risk is seen as an important activity in an actively managed fund. How do you manage this in equity funds?
We like businesses that have proven business models, which are scalable in nature, where capital efficiency is high and that have reasonable competitive edge in their respective areas of business. We also keenly look at the management track record and its quality. The final filter is valuation in every case. Typically, we look for compounding characteristics of earnings growth at reasonable valuations, and build a portfolio around that strategy. We do not like sectors and stocks that require capital on a regular basis and those with a high degree of leverage. We also tend to avoid companies that have a high level of policy or regulatory risk. We avoid betting on event-based tactical plays. Our focus has always been long-term bets based on analysis. Following these principles over market cycles has enabled us tide over some challenging times.
Will measures such as rate cuts and corporate tax cuts translate into resumption of consumption and spending in the near future or is there some more pain left for the economy?
The decision to lower corporate taxes meaningfully is a key structural measure to support India’s growth outlook. One of the key objectives of the sharp cut in corporate tax rates is to make India globally competitive. This step significantly boosts medium-term investment potential in the economy. The focus of fiscal stimulus is capex-driven rather than consumption-driven and thus poses limited risks to macro stability. Similarly, the current monetary policy is also supportive. However, we believe consumption recovery is going to be more gradual in nature.
Do you see a contagion effect in equity markets of the debt issues troubling companies and causing distress in debt markets?
There has already been a contagion effect over the past year or so. Over the next few months, we expect things to gradually normalize as the focus has shifted to monetary transmission and making liquidity available to deserving and creditworthy businesses. While volatility in equities may continue for some more time, it is also a great time to build a portfolio from the long-term perspective. Broader market valuations seem to have discounted most of the pain already. For patient investors, it is a great time for stock picking.
Given the low inflation and low growth phase in Indian economy, is it time to reset return expectations for equity investors?
The cost of capital for businesses is coming down significantly. Apart from that, domestic inflation band has also got reset downwards. Given these conditions, even low double-digit equity returns over the long term should be viewed as great returns. However, equity returns can never be linear and, hence, during good times the returns could be larger and vice-versa."
30,2019-10-09,Kotak,"After a bumper rally triggered by corp tax cuts on 20 September, markets had turned volatile ahead of Q2 earningsThe Bankex rose 3.67%, with State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank rising 3-5%

Mumbai: Investors on Wednesday cheered the government’s decision to raise dearness allowance (DA) in the middle of the festival season, driving Indian markets up nearly 2% in a rally led by financial sector stocks.
The benchmark 30-share BSE Sensex closed 1.72% or 645.97 points higher at 38,177.95, while the 50-share Nifty closed at 11,313.30, up 186.90 points or 1.68%.
The five percentage point increase in DA to 17% will put more money in the hands of at least 5 million government employees and 6.5 million pensioners. The hike, which will cost the exchequer  ₹16,000 crore, will be effective from July.
Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities Ltd, attributed Wednesday’s rebound to bargain hunting as well, coming after six straight days of losses. “Sentiments also turned positive after the government hiked dearness allowance. Most emerging market stocks were headed lower for a third day on Wednesday as the US and China showed little signs of backing off from their trade dispute ahead of a crucial round of negotiations. However, later, European shares moved sharply higher and the Chinese currency in the offshore market jumped on Wednesday after a Bloomberg report said China was still open to agreeing a partial trade deal with the United States,"" he said.
The Bankex rose 3.67%, with State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank rising 3-5%.
According to Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services, banking stocks rallied on hopes of greater liquidity and consumption, as the plunge in bond yields indicates further room for rate cuts. “Further, the hike in DA will add impetus to festival demand. Going forward, the results season will dictate the market direction and investors are expecting some green shoots on account of festival demand and good monsoon,"" he said. The 10-year bond yield jumped 22 basis points to 6.45% on Wednesday.
After a bumper rally triggered by corporate tax cuts on 20 September, the markets had turned volatile ahead of second quarter earnings. Analysts said the tax cuts are a pro-investment stimulus, but will take time to show results, given the nature of the ongoing economic slowdown.
Rahul Singh, chief investment officer-equities at Tata Mutual Fund, said the 8-9% lift in Nifty earnings per share after the corporate tax cuts will provide support to stock valuations, in addition to the fact that India’s valuation premium to other emerging markets is at a more acceptable level now. “The recent privatization initiative indicates the government’s seriousness in tackling the economic slowdown and we believe that there is more to come in the coming weeks and months,"" he said.
Indian companies are set to report a drop in revenue and profit for the second straight quarter amid a slump in consumer demand that sent the government scrambling to boost investment and consumption through a raft of measures, including tax cuts for companies.
“It has been a year since the IL&FS crisis erupted and the repercussions of the same are still being felt, especially in financials. Besides NBFCs, banks too have started facing asset quality concerns now,"" Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a note.
The brokerage firm said the earnings season will be more of the same—tepid and uneventful. The underlying demand slowdown in the domestic economy and weak global commodities prices are expected to take a toll on earnings with very few bright spots, if any, it said."

Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank said on Tuesday its profit after tax totalled  ₹1,724 crore during the second quarter of the current financial year, up 51 per cent from  ₹1,142 crore in Q2 FY19.
Net interest income for Q2FY20 increased to  ₹3,350 crore from  ₹2,676 crore in Q2 FY19, up by 25 per cent. Net interest margin, a key indicator of a bank's profitability, rose to 4.61% from 4.19% last year.
However, asset quality weakened in September quarter with gross non-performing assets (as a percentage of gross advances) rising 13 basis points sequentially to 2.32 per cent and net NPA climbing 12 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 0.85 per cent in Q2.
CASA (current account savings account) ratio as on September 30 stood at 53.6 per cent compared to 50.2 per cent as on September 30 last year.
Average savings deposits grew by 20 per cent to  ₹80,425 crore compared to  ₹66,892 crore for Q2 as average current account deposits grew by 22 per cent to  ₹33,216 crore for Q2 FY20 compared to  ₹27,231 crore for Q2 FY19.
Advances as on September 30 were up 15 per cent to  ₹2.13 lakh crore ( ₹1.84 lakh crore as on September 30, 2018). Capital adequacy ratio of the bank as per Basel III norms is 18.2 per cent and tier I ratio is 17.6 per cent.
Kotak's loan growth during the quarter slowed to 15%, versus a growth of 18% last quarter and 21% in the same period last year.

23,2019-10-23,Kotak,"In times of rising risk, beefing provisions is what Kotak Mahindra Bank has been doing in the past quartersWhat should worry investors is that special mention accounts, which are the first signs of stress, have risen for the third straight quarter

Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd’s blockbuster net profit growth of 51% not only beat Street estimates, but seems to have vindicated the near 6% rise in the company’s stock in the past month.
The fact that it came on the back of a 25% increase in core interest income and an expansion in net interest margin should also boost sentiments.
But beyond that, the private sector lender’s performance had little to offer. Its loan growth decelerated year-on-year to 15.3% for the September quarter, a steady fall for the third straight quarter. The strongest growth came from mortgages, while commercial vehicle loans disappointed. Even disbursal to small businesses didn’t perk up much.
What’s more is that Kotak Mahindra Bank saw its delinquencies increase. Optically, its bad loan ratios passed muster, even though they rose from the year-ago period. What should worry investors is that special mention accounts, which are the first signs of stress, have risen for the third straight quarter. These accounts stood at  ₹431 crore as of September end.
Of course, as a percentage of the total loan book, they are still a meagre 0.2%, a level most peer banks cannot boast about. Also, Kotak Mahindra Bank’s bad loan ratios are far superior to its peers.
The commentary from the management on asset quality didn’t offer much clarity. Dipak Gupta, joint managing director of the bank, said that in times of stress, the key is to get the pricing of the risk right. Further, the lender is willing to lend to good credit even in commercial real estate—a sector considered risky by banks and the banking regulator as well. In the September quarter, the exposure to commercial real estate comprised 2% of the bank’s loan book.
In times of rising risk, beefing provisions is what Kotak Mahindra Bank has been doing in the past quarters. The lender continued with the practice in the September quarter as well. But the provision coverage ratio fell from 67% in the June quarter to 64% in Q2 FY20. Clearly, provisioning was not enough in the wake of increase in bad loans.
Analysts say that deposit growth, too, had slowed in the September quarter. But the management has clarified that the bank wants to improve the granularity of deposits, and the increase in current account and savings account deposits should give some comfort.
The Kotak Mahindra Bank stock didn’t move much on Tuesday and trades at a multiple of five times its estimated book value for FY21, making it one of the most expensive private sector bank stocks."

MUMBAI :
Financier Shriram Capital Ltd plans to merge two of its listed units with itself to help investors Piramal Enterprises Ltd and TPG Capital to easily sell their stakes in Shriram Group companies.
The plan entails merging Shriram Transport Finance Co. Ltd and Shriram City Union Finance Ltd with parent Shriram Capital to create a simpler shareholding structure, three people familiar with the plan said.
“We are looking at a few options like merging both the entities to the parent company and thereby listing it. Also we are still looking at an individual investor who can pick up the entire stake of Piramal and TPG. However, this is going to take a few weeks,"" said R. Thyagarajan, founder of Shriram Group.
Kotak Mahindra Capital Co. Ltd has been hired to advise on the planned merger and shortlist buyers for Piramal and TPG’s stakes.
Emails sent to Shriram Capital and Kotak Mahindra Capital went unanswered.
On Friday, Ajay Piramal, chairman of Piramal Group, told Mint in an interview that the group’s planned exit from Shriram Capital was on track. “We are going through many different combinations, we have not yet decided. One thing is clear that we will exit. Which is the best way forward for Shriram, that we are discussing,"" Piramal said.
Piramal bought a 20% stake in Shriram Capital for  ₹2,014 crore in 2014. Piramal also holds 10% in Shriram City Union. Over the past few months, Piramal has been looking for a buyer for these stakes.
TPG Capital holds a 9.4% stake in Shriram Capital, while South Africa-based Sanlam Group owns 26% and Shriram Ownership Trust and Shriwell Trust hold 30.7% and 13.4%, respectively, according to a Crisil ratings report.
“The value of the stake in Shriram being planned to be sold by Piramal is quoted at  ₹4,500-5,000 crore for the prospective buyers, which in turn will value Shriram Capital at around  ₹25,000 crore,"" one of the people familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity.
If the deal goes through, the proceeds from the stake sale will be used by Piramal to infuse capital into its lending businesses, repay debts of Piramal Enterprises’ promoter entities and provide capital for organic growth.
Piramal had a 9.97% stake in Shriram Transport Finance, but in June sold this stake for  ₹2,300 crore to several institutional investors.
The proposed three-way merger will result in the automatic listing of Shriram Capital, as Shriram City Union and Shriram Transport are both listed entities.
“Private equity firms and foreign sovereign funds have shown a lot of interest to buy stakes in Shriram Group from Piramal and TPG,"" said the second person, declining to be named.
Shriram Capital’s businesses include commercial vehicle finance (Shriram Trasport Finance), consumer and enterprise finance (Shriram City Union Finance), retail stock broking (Shriram Insight Share Brokers Ltd), life insurance (Shriram Life Co. Ltd), general insurance (Shriram General Insurance), financial product distribution (Shriram Fortune Solutions Ltd) and wealth advisory (Shriram Wealth Advisors).
On 30 August, a Piramal Group spokesperson said that since January, Piramal has raised over  ₹23,000 crore in long-term funding through banks, financial institutions and external commercial borrowings. “Also, as previously stated, we intend to bring in further equity of  ₹8,000-10,000 crore into the financial services business, of which  ₹2,500 crore has already been allocated. All of this will be more than sufficient to not only address all repayments, but also to augment business growth in this financial year.""
On 8 August, The Economic Times reported that private equity funds Advent International, Blackstone Group, CVC Capital, Carlyle Group and Brookfield placed initial bids to buy around 30% in Shriram Capital as Piramal Enterprises and TPG Capital sought to exit.
Piramal Enterprises and TPG have been looking to exit Shriram Group for two years. Piramal had invested in Shriram Capital with the intent to merge Shriram Capital, the holding company of Shriram Group, with itself. But the merger failed due to the sheer difference in size. Although Piramal had begun taking control of Shriram Group soon after making the investments by replacing key managers across group firms, a merger would have resulted in a large stake dilution in the merged entity for Piramal Group, which was not acceptable.
Shriram Group also tried a merger between Shriram Capital and IDFC Bank Ltd in 2017. But the plan fell through as the two entities failed to agree on an acceptable swap ratio."

MUMBAI :
Consumer lending firm Bajaj Finance Ltd on Monday said that it will raise funds through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) at a floor price of  ₹4,019.78 per share.
Bajaj Finance did not disclose the size of the fundraise, but one person aware of the lender’s plans said it was looking to raise up to  ₹8,500 crore (about $1.2 billion).
“Our company intends to use the net proceeds of the issue to augment the long-term resources for meeting funding requirements for our company’s business activities and general corporate purposes and other purpose as per our company’s growth strategy and to meet the capital adequacy norms laid down by the Reserve Bank of India,"" Bajaj Finance said in a stock exchange filing.
On Monday, shares of Bajaj Finance closed at  ₹4,115.95, up 1.14% on the BSE.
Investment banks JM Financial, Axis Capital, Kotak Mahindra Capital, Morgan Stanley and Nomura are advising the company on the share sale.
QIP is a capital-raising tool, through which listed companies can sell shares, fully and partly convertible debentures, or any securities, other than warrants that are convertible into stocks, to a qualified institutional buyer.
Bajaj Finance had raised  ₹4,500 crore in 2017 through a QIP. So far this year, eight companies have raised  ₹22,312 crore through the QIP route, data from primary market tracker Prime Database shows.
Between July and September, Bajaj Finance’s net profit rose 63.11% to  ₹1,506.29 crore, compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. Its consolidated assets under management, as of September, grew 38% to  ₹1.35 trillion.
That was despite sluggish consumer demand in India, as rural household consumption slumped to a seven-year low in the September quarter, plagued by falling crop prices and declining income.
Besides, the country’s non-bank lenders have also faced a severe credit crisis owing to rising borrowing costs and weak investor confidence, following the collapse of infrastructure lending behemoth Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) in 2018.
Bajaj Finance’s gross non-performing loans (GNPL), including the IL&FS exposure, stood at 1.61% in July-September, reducing marginally from 1.49% in the corresponding quarter of 2018. Its net interest income rose 48% to  ₹3,999 crore during the period, while it booked 6.47 million new loans, compared to 5.6 million in July-September last year. The retail financier’s total customer franchise stood at 38.7 million as on 30 September, showing a year-on-year growth of 29%."

MUMBAI :
Banker Uday Kotak on Friday pitched for rules to enable exits and consolidation in the financial sector.
Kotak, the head of the private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank, said non-disruptive creative destruction is essential for the financial sector to help in winding up of businesses.
The comments come at a time when the companies in the sector like DHFL are grappling with resolutions and the future of thousands of crore of debt is in doubt. It also comes at a time when cooperative lender PMC Bank is in troubles allegedly because of mismanagement, putting depositors in a difficulty.
According to reports, the government is mulling a re- introduction of the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, which may address such issues.
We are at this point of time at a critical juncture to put down the rules of the game on how we will manage exit in a non-disruptive way in the financial sector. This is crucial for our future, Kotak said, addressing a CII event.
The policy framework needs to have clarity on how we will handle mortality, how we will handle consolidation. We need good rules of the game for entry, but we need good rules for the exit as well, he added.
Kotak said there is a greater need for non-disruptive exits in the financial sector, underlining that the leverage is much higher in such companies as compared to the ones in the real sector.
He urged policy makers to take a holistic approach for the development of the financial sector and embrace the free- market model.
Adopting the free market model may lead to some friction because it may be at loggerheads with the objectives of the nation-state, he conceded.
He, however, advocated to persist with the same free- market model, pointing that it may look as if there are mad animals in the jungle, but those are essential.

According to a Bloomberg survey, CPI will be at 4.34% from 3.99% a month ago, and WPI is expected to be at (-) 0.22% from 0.33% last month.
""Uncertainties over the formation of government in Maharashtra have also spoiled the sentiment in the second half of the trading session. Except for Nifty Reality Index, other sectors failed to hold at higher levels and came under hefty profit-taking pressure from the market participants. The excitement from Q2 performances of Nifty 50 companies is fading away and this would trigger further selling in the near term,"" said Shrikant Chouhan, senior vice-president, equity technical research, Kotak Securities.
Among the gainers, state-owned NTPC Ltd rose 2.3% after the company on Saturday posted a 38% rise in its consolidated net profit to  ₹3,408.92 crore in the quarter to September, driven by higher revenues. Yes Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd also rose 2.5% and 1%, respectively.
Among laggards, Vedanta Ltd fell 1.6% followed by Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, which were down 1.5% each.
Bank of Baroda rose 3% after the company reported a five-fold jump in its net profit to  ₹736.68 crore in the second quarter-ended September.
""We usually see stock reacting sharply lower during the corrective phase of the benchmark index. Thus, we advise booking some profit off the table and focusing more on stock selection. Also, we suggest keeping a close eye on the global developments and earnings announcements for further cues. Since the broader indices are still underperforming, we advise preferring index majors over the others"", said Ajit Mishra, vice president, research, Religare Broking Ltd.
The sentiment in markets was also dented after Moody's Investors Service early on Friday lowered India’s outlook to negative from stable, while retaining the issuer rating at Baa2.
""In our view, this will take time to work on the ground and reflect in numbers. One of the major concerns is on the fiscal front - with lower tax incomes and higher spending - leading to a ballooning deficit. However, it appears that the government would be using the non-traditional routes including disinvestment/privatisation to fill the income gap. The long-term fundamentals of Indian economy continue to remain strong with healthy growth and a domestic consumption driven economy,"" said Motilal Oswal, managing director & CEO, Motilal Oswal Financial Services."

11,2019-11-19,Kotak,"Difference between profit before tax and profit after tax is exaggerated on deferred tax paymentsLacklustre revenue growth reveals lower demand both at biz and consumer levels

Earnings for the latest quarter have ushered mixed news for the corporate sector. While the recent cut in corporate tax rates led to better-than-expected profit and restrained the pace of earnings downgrades, businesses continued to reel under pressure in the three months ended September.
Lower commodity prices and cost cutting initiatives by companies aided in aggregate net profit growth, but lower revenue in the second quarter underscored continued sluggish demand.
A Mint analysis of 1,462 firms showed net sales in the September quarter was the lowest in at least 27 quarters. Net sales decelerated 2.23% year-on-year, much lower than the 5.15% growth in the preceding three months, according to data provider Capitaline. This compares to net sales growth of 21.61% in Q2 FY19. In Q2, profit before tax (PBT) was also lowest in three quarters, with companies surveyed reporting a fall of 7.92% y-o-y compared with a 1.58% drop in Q1 FY20.
In the second quarter of FY19, profit before tax had grown by 16.92%. As reduction in corporate tax rate cuts resulted in several adjustments in last quarter’s tax numbers, we have assumed PBT for our assessment.
Including telecom firms Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, PBT of these companies fell 62% (y-o-y) in Q2FY20, while it had reported growth of 10.79% in Q2FY19. The two telcos incurred a record  ₹50,922 crore loss and  ₹23,045 crore loss, respectively, in the September quarter.
The difference between PBT and profit after tax (PAT) is exaggerated due to the deferred tax adjustments for the quarter. Tax reversals pertaining to higher taxes paid in Q1FY20 has also inflated Q2FY20 net profit. Adjusted net profit of these companies rose 8.76% y-o-y in Q2 compared with growth of 0.87% in Q1 FY20. The review excludes banks, financial services and oil and gas companies, which follow a different revenue model.
“The quarterly results show resilient double-digit growth in aggregate net profit aided by the recent corporate tax cut, lower commodity prices and cost-cutting initiatives. However, lacklustre revenue growth reveals lower demand both at the business and consumer levels. Destocking across the board also contributed to sluggish topline growth. Lower commodity prices resulted in lower topline growth for a whole host of firms , including metals,"" said Deepak Jasani, head, retail research, HDFC Securities Ltd.
Prices of commodities, such as crude oil and metals, underwent a steep correction in the September quarter. Crude prices were down 8.67%, aluminium 4.40% and copper 4.79% lower on the London Metal Exchange in Q2.
Jasani said while some companies gained from providing lower amounts towards tax, some others had to write off the accumulated deferred tax asset to opt for the lower tax regime resulting in higher effective tax provision. He expected the effective tax rate to have fallen on an overall basis and which could decline further in the next fiscal.
Data showed that taxes paid by these companies fell 57% in Q2 to the lowest in at least 27 quarters. In the same quarter last fiscal, tax outgo was 32.84% higher.
Shibani Kurian, head, equity research, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management, said there was no major disappointment in Q2 earnings overall.
“Earnings were mostly in line with expectations. Management commentaries indicate that they are not confident of the continuation of the minor revival growth seen due to festival demand,"" she said. “Number of companies saw good net profit growth due to cut in corporate taxes leading to no further earnings downgrade, which was earlier expected. Companies were able to maintain margins due to low commodity prices, but we will watch how it pans out going forward."""

Bank of America Corp. and Kotak Mahindra Capital Co. are among banks Indian billionaire Radhakishan Damani picked for another planned stake sale in Avenue Supermarts Ltd., owner of the DMart brand, said people with knowledge of the matter.
Damani selected the banks as he prepares to pare his stake in India’s largest listed retail chain by selling about 5.2% next year, the people said, asking not to be identified as the discussions are private. Damani, who sold about 1% earlier this year, has to sell more shares before the end of March to meet a minimum requirement for public float, one of the people said.
A 5.2% stake in Avenue Supermarts would be valued at around  ₹5,870 crore, based on the closing price in Mumbai on Friday. The founders hold about 80.2% of Avenue Supermarts, including about 37.4% by Damani, according to exchange data. The public shareholding is below the minimum 25% threshold.
The share sale could come at a time when companies in India are battling weaker consumer demand as Asia’s third-largest economy slows. Avenue Supermarts, which operates food and grocery retail stores under the DMart brand, is among the few players that could sail against the wind. Its shares have gained about 12% this year.
A final decision hasn’t yet been taken on the size of the sale and more banks could be added, the people said. Representatives for Bank of America and Avenue Supermarts declined to comment, while Kotak couldn’t immediately comment."

3,2019-12-17,Kotak,"'I think Uday (Kotak) is the best candidate to acquire Yes bank. You need deep pockets, Uday has that,' SBI chairman saidIn the past, both Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank have been discussed as potential suitors for Yes Bank

Mumbai: Two of India's top bankers on Tuesday opined that Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) is best suited to acquire smaller and capital-starved rival Yes Bank.
Yes Bank's capital buffers have dipped on accelerated non-performing assets recognition under new chief executive Ravneet Gill earlier this year.
The private sector lender's capital raising plan is also passing through uncertainties and there are speculations on whether Yes Bank is an acquisition target, which has been denied by its management.
""I think Uday (Kotak) is the best candidate to acquire Yes Bank. You need deep pockets, Uday has that,"" SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said at Times Network's India Economic Conclave here.
When the same question was posed to third-largest lender Axis Bank's Managing Director and CEO Amitabh Chaudhry, it was answered with the same suggestion.
""We (Axis Bank) are a smaller bank. We are trying to ensure that we grow big so that at some stage we can acquire others. So, yes Mr Kotak, they are best suited rather than us,"" he said.
When contacted, Kotak Mahindra Group Chief Communication Officer Rohit Rao said, ""these are comments made by other bankers and reflect their views, and not ours"".
In the past, both Axis Bank and KMB have been discussed as potential suitors for Yes Bank.
According to some watchers, acquiring a bank can help Uday Kotak reduce the promoter stake in KMB, and help him get closer to the levels mandated by the RBI.
The regulator has been dragged to the court by KMB for not accepting an earlier attempt at stake dilution and the same petition is slated to be heard early next year.
Meanwhile, speaking at the same event, Kotak said there is a need to resist a ""colonialisation"" of Indian finance, hinting at share sales to foreign investors.
""I'm looking forward to best in class quality but strong Indian-owned and controlled financial sector and while we must attract foreign capital, we must ensure that there is no colonialisation of Indian finance,"" Kotak said.
Yes Bank had to cut its book size by 7 per cent in the September quarter because of the capital constraints and has been looking to finish the capital raising exercise at the earliest.
The lender had first announced it has interest from investors of USD 3 billion, and a few days later disclosed offers of USD 2 billion. It wanted to finalise the same at the last board meet on December 10 but was not able to take a decision.
Yes Bank's share price plummeted to  ₹32 apiece in October as against a high of  ₹400 just a year ago and has been one of the most volatile scrips on the bourses

Mumbai: Noted banker Uday Kotak on Tuesday said the country's financial system is currently in a Darwinian mode as only the fittest lenders are able to survive.
The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Kotak Mahindra Bank also that historically, whenever there has been a problem with a private sector lender, it has been merged with a state-run bank. ""India is in massive Darwinian mode of what I call as the survival of the fittest.
""Sector after sector has seen that it is going to be more consolidated than ever before. Consolidation in the Indian economy is happening more out of mortality and less out of combinations,"" Kotak said.
He also noted that historically, whenever there has been a problem with a private sector lender, it has been merged with a state-run bank. According to him, the government has to ""rework"" the Financial Resolution Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill since an exit route is essential for troubled lenders.
FRDI Bill, which had raised concerns over protection for depositors, has lapsed and the government is yet to introduce a new bill.
""As you are allowing entry in banking, we should be thinking more about exit policy. And one of the earlier bill that was planned earlier was the FRDI Bill. We need to rework on that,"" Kotak said, speaking at the Times Network organised India Economic Conclave here.
The comments come at a time when multiple lenders, especially non-banks and also cooperatives like PMC Bank are sailing through choppy waters, which has highlighted the need for a legislation to take care of exits by financial sector participants.
Kotak also welcomed rules introduced under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) wherein troubled DHFL has been referred for resolution.
Regarding infra-lender IL&FS, whose over RS 94,600-crore debt resolution process he heads, Kotak reiterated the company is confident of recovering over 50 per cent of its dues.
He said the biggest challenge in the IL&FS resolution was the distribution mechanism, which has been overcome after the Supreme Court judgement in the Essar Steel case.
Kotak said there has been a complex web of over 340 companies in the IL&FS group created over two decades which resulted in a lot of time taken by its new board.
He said the time has come to ""dramatically increase"" the flow of domestic savings going into risk averse assets like fixed deposits and gold, into risk capital which can help the economy better.
Further, Kotak said the government should choose a set of six core state-run lenders, and mark out three others where its stake would go down below 50 per cent through sales in the market and have the remaining three run as ""public private partnerships"".

0,2019-12-27,Kotak,"Move aimed at shielding lenders from non-bank risks, steering focus to boost credit growthBanks have asked the regulator for five years to implement the rule but they may get just three years

MUMBAI :
The Reserve Bank of India has asked lenders to cut their stakes in insurers to 30%, as the banking regulator attempts to shield banks from risks arising out of their non-banking businesses and steer focus to boosting credit growth in a slowing economy, four people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
RBI informed the bankers in a meeting last week that it will soon introduce rules to cap their holdings in an insurance company to 30%, the people said, requesting anonymity as the matter is confidential. The holding limit will be 50% for non-banking financial companies such as Housing Development Finance Corp. that have insurance units, they said. Banks have been told to await RBI’s official communication on the new rules.
The move is likely to have far-reaching impact not only on banks, which derive significant income from their insurance units, but also on the insurers themselves as their parent banks are major capital providers and distributors of insurance products. State Bank of India, ICICI Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank will be among the lenders to be affected by the decision.
“The 30% capping rule is meant to safeguard banks from capital risks arising from non-core businesses. But the new RBI rule, which is likely to come into effect some time in fiscal 2021, will create a huge supply of equities in the market when the banks slash their stakes. It is to be seen if the market has an appetite to absorb such large amount of liquidity,"" said the first of the four people. The rule is likely to be implemented in a phased manner, the person added.
“RBI is asking us to rather use the money for credit growth. RBI is suggesting banks to increase Tier 1 networth,"" said the second person. “There should not be much of a problem as some of the insurance firms are listed. We (as a bank) have to give a roadmap to RBI as in when we will bring down stake to 30%. We have asked for five years but they (RBI) will not give five years. They may say three.""
Current regulatory norms mandate that a bank can hold a maximum of 50% in an insurance venture but the regulator may allow them to hold more on a case-to-case basis.
In the life insurance space, ICICI Bank owns 52.87% in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd; Kotak Mahindra Bank holds a 77% stake in Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance Co. Ltd; and State Bank of India owns 57.6% in SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd. Home financier HDFC holds 51.47% in HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd.
Among general insurers, HDFC holds 50.49% in HDFC Ergo General Insurance Co.; ICICI Bank holds a 55.86% stake in ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd; Kotak Mahindra Bank holds 100% in Kotak Mahindra General Insurance; and State Bank of India holds 57.13% in SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd.
“Banks are the major distributors of financial products especially life insurance. Any reduction of stake by sponsor banks in these institutions may have negative impact on the distribution capabilities as well as general public perception about these institutions they enjoy because of parentage. This issue may impact the prospective investor sentiment also,"" said Ashutosh Mishra, head of research, Ashika Stock Broking.
In any insurance business, whenever capital infusion takes place, all promoters need to put in money as per the proportion of their shareholding. If even one of the promoters is unable to put in money as per their shareholding, the capital infusion process fails. This can stifle the growth of the insurer.
“RBI is concerned that such capital contributions commitments may hurt the bank and exposes it to higher risks. This is why RBI wants to cap bank’s holding in insurance firms,"" said the first person.
The second person said RBI doesn’t want banks to own insurance, asset management and NBFC businesses.
“Over a period of time, RBI wants to reduce the holding cap to 30% or below 10%,"" said the second person.
Insurance is a capital-guzzling business, which needs regular capital infusions as it grows. Mutual fund businesses also have been growing steadily but new norms related to penetration of AMCs into locations beyond top-15 cities, require additional growth capital.
The NBFC business has been shrinking after the IL&FS debacle last September and a subsequent liquidity crisis. Any turnaround in the NBFC business or even to keep the NBFC afloat, albeit with losses until the credit situation improves, will require a lot of capital.
In all these businesses, wherever banks are parent companies, capital outflow will be from the bank’s books, which will weaken the bank’s own core business.
While RBI plans to limit the holding of banks in insurance at 30%, in order to ensure that insurance companies do not face growth constraint due to the ceiling on bank’s holding, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, or Irdai, last week proposed an increase in FDI in insurance from 49% to 74%. If this proposal is enacted in the Parliament, foreign joint venture partners in insurance will be able to infuse more capital in the company whenever growth plans are drafted.
To be sure, RBI has been attempting to recalibrate banks’ holding norms to safeguard them from external risks for some time. In May 2011, an RBI working group recommended a holding company structure for banks. It said all new banks and insurance companies will mandatorily need to operate under the financial holding company (FHC) framework and intermediate holding companies within the FHC should not be permitted.
Under the holdco norms, a bank had to unwind its shareholding in subsidiaries, and the existing shareholding of the bank in its units were to be transferred to the holdco.
According to the working group, the holdco was supposed to be regulated either by RBI itself or by a new regulator. The group had said it was necessary to put in place some limit on the expansion of non-banking businesses after the existing financial groups, dominated by banks, migrate to the holding company structure. However, the holdco proposal has now been scrapped due to its complexities, according to the three people cited above."
