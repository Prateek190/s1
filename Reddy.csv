New Delhi: Pharmaceuticals major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories has recalled a single lot of Docetaxel injection vials, used for treatment of breast cancer, USFDA has said. 
As per the US health regulator’s enforcement report for the week of 17 January, a single lot of 1,051 vials of Docetaxel injection USP, 20 mg/mL was distributed in the US, Uzbekistan and Myanmar. 
The company has recalled the drug on account of defective container, the report said. 
“Product complaints received of defect in the seal of the Docetaxel injection vials that the aluminium seal and/or stopper is removed when the cap is flipped off,"" it said. 
The vials were manufactured by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories at its Visakhapatnam facility, the United States Food and Drug Administration has said. 
The voluntary ongoing recall is a class II recall, the regulator said. As per the USFDA, a class II recall is initiated in a situation, “in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote"". Shares of the company were trading 1.23% higher at  ₹ 2,492.05."

Bengaluru: Indian generic drugmaker Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd said its quarterly net profit slumped nearly 40%, its third consecutive quarter of declines as pricing pressures in the US hit sales.
Indian drugmakers have faced challenges in negotiating prices as a result of consolidation among drug distributors in the US, the world’s biggest pharmaceuticals market. Like many of its domestic rivals, Dr. Reddy’s has also been hit by US bans on Indian plants over quality control issues.
Net profit fell 38.5% to Rs303 crore in the third quarter ended 31 December 2017, below an average analyst estimate of Rs340 crore.
Revenue from the company’s generics business in North America fell 3% to Rs1607 crore. Revenue from its Europe generics business dropped 7% to Rs201 core due to pricing pressures and temporary disruptions in supply.
Dr. Reddy’s shares fell as much as 3.5% to Rs2,469 on BSE."
77,2018-01-26,Reddy,"While the business environment is still evolving, the December quarter results for now show that recovery is still a work in progress for Dr Reddy's Laboratories

Given the pricing pressure in the core US market and with few opportunities for drugs with limited competition that provide revenue upside, nobody was pencilling in a revival in pharma company earnings in the December quarter. 
Given the pricing pressure in the core US market and with few opportunities for drugs with limited competition that provide revenue upside, nobody was pencilling in a revival in pharma company earnings in the December quarter.
Expectations are muted and are centred on company-specific themes such as continuation of the recovery in emerging markets and cost rationalization measures in Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd’s case. But as it turns out, the company tripped on both these counts in the December quarter.
The drop in generic product revenues from North America, emerging markets and Europe was in the range of 1-7%. On a sequential basis North America did well, clocking a 12% growth in generic revenues. But that brought no cheer as Europe and India underperformed. Also, the company which had promised cost rationalization against the backdrop of pressure on revenues saw its selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rise 6% from the year-ago quarter. Contrary to the commentary and earlier quarterly trends, SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenues rose—both sequentially and from a year ago.
Still, even then the company managed to report an improvement in gross margin, which widened three percentage points compared to the previous quarter. But as can be seen by the 2% fall in Dr Reddy Laboratories’ share price on Thursday, that didn’t inspire much confidence among investors. Two analysts with different broking firms pointed out that margins were propped up by non-recurring revenue of Rs130 crore, received as part of milestone compensation. Excluding these revenues, the sequential margin improvement doesn’t look that large, say the analysts.
Overall, even as the company reported a respectable 3% growth in revenue and lower-than-expected drop in operating profit, one-off revenues and underperformance in emerging markets made investors wary of the December-quarter results.
The key for Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, as with most pharmaceutical companies, is to obtain approvals for limited competition drugs."

Hyderabad: Dr Reddy’s Laboratories has initiated voluntary recall of over 80,000 bottles of its drug Atorvastatin Calcium Tablets 10mg, 20mg and 40mg from the US market due to quality concerns.
Atorvastatin is a drug that blocks the production of cholesterol and reduces its level in the blood.
According to a notification issued by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), multiple lots of Atorvastatin 10 mg, 90 count and 500 count bottles; 20 mg, 90 count and 500 count bottles and 40 mg, 90 count bottles, are being withdrawn from the market. 
Dr Reddy’s officials were not immediately available for comment.
 The product is being recalled through three separate letters to the drug regulator.
According to the USFDA, the reason for the recall was, “Failed Impurities/Degradations specifications; out-of-specification results observed for Total Degradation Impurities during stability.""
The product was manufactured at the drug maker’s Srikakulam plant in Andhra Pradesh. The drug is being recalled under “not yet classified"" category which, according to the FDA, means that a firm’s action meets the definition of a recall, however, the FDA has not completed its assessment of the hazard posed by the recalled product(s) yet, and is considered a pending classification.
“Once FDA completes the hazard assessment, the Enforcement Report entry will be updated with the recall classification (Class I, II or III) indicating the hazard posed by the recalled product(s),"" said FDA.
Meanwhile, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals in a separate letter also initiated voluntary recall of 5,136 tunes of its Mometasone Furoate Cream, USP, 0.1% 45gm from the US market due to violations of the CGMP (current good manufacturing practice) regulations set up by the USFDA.
Mometasone Furoate Cream is used to treat skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, allergies, and rash."

New Delhi: Dr Reddy’s Laboratories on Monday said its chairman Satish Reddy, chief operating officer (COO) Abhijit Mukherjee and US subsidiary have been included as defendants in the class action lawsuit filed against it by investors.  
New Delhi: Dr Reddy’s Laboratories on Monday said its chairman Satish Reddy, chief operating officer (COO) Abhijit Mukherjee and US subsidiary have been included as defendants in the class action lawsuit filed against it by investors. 
Last year in August, the company had said “a law firm representing a purported investor in the company filed a purported class action lawsuit against the company, its CEO and CFO in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging violation of the US federal securities laws."" Later on in November, the company said it was served a securities class action lawsuit in the US by the lead plaintiff. 
“We would like to inform you that an amended complaint has been filed by the lead plaintiff, wherein our Chairman, COO and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Inc, a wholly-owned subsidiary in the US have been added as defendants,"" Dr Reddy’s Labs said in a BSE filing. 
As intimated earlier, the company believes that the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations, it added. The lawsuit filed at the District Court for New Jersey seeks damages to compensate the class of investors for a ‘purported decline’ in the company’s share price allegedly caused by the misstatements or omissions. 
The company had stated that the lawsuit represented a class of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired the company’s publicly traded shares on the New York Stock Exchange between 17 June 2015 through 10 August 2017. The lawsuit alleged that the company made materially false and/or misleading statements or omissions in connection with its corporate quality system, it had added. 
The allegation is specifically in connection with a warning letter from the USFDA dated 6 November, 2015 and a letter from Regierung von Oberbayern in Germany, dated 10 August, 2017, Dr Reddy’s had said. Shares of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories were trading at Rs2,199.50 a piece in the afternoon trade, down 0.60% from the previous close on BSE."

New Delhi: Pharma firm Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd on Tuesday reported a 3.29% fall in its consolidated net profit to Rs302.2 crore for the March quarter, or Q4, mainly on account of continuing headwinds in the US.

The company had posted a net profit of Rs312.5 crore for the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.
Consolidated revenue of the company stood at Rs3,534.9 crore in Q4 as compared to Rs3,554.2 crore for the same period a year ago. For FY18, the company posted a net profit of Rs980.6 crore as against Rs1,203.9 crore for the year-ago period. Consolidated revenue of the company stood at Rs14,202.8 crore for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2018. It was Rs14,080.9 crore in 2016-17.
On Tuesday, Dr. Reddy’s Labs shares closed 6.30% higher at Rs2013.75 on BSE.
“We concluded a challenging year for Dr Reddy’s with a relatively muted fourth quarter performance,"" said Dr Reddy’s MD G.V. Prasad. This was mainly on account of continuing headwinds in the US market and a temporary drop in the sales in Russia, attributable to a shift in the channel purchasing pattern, he added.
In a separate filing, Dr Reddy’s said its board has recommended a final dividend of Rs20 per equity share of Rs5 face value for 2017-18. Shares of the company were trading at Rs1,927.90 per scrip on BSE, up 1.77% from its previous close."
71,2018-05-23,Reddy,"The US market continues to hold the key to an upward shift in Dr Reddy's performance in FY19, which can lead to an upgrade in the pharma firm's valuations

What explains the 6.3% spike in Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd’s shares on Tuesday? The BSE Healthcare index rose 1.1% as many of its constituents gained. Some gained by as much as 2%. Even then, Dr Reddy’s shares outperformed. The reasons are not clear. 
What explains the 6.3% spike in Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd’s shares on Tuesday? The BSE Healthcare index rose 1.1% as many of its constituents gained. Some gained by as much as 2%. Even then, Dr Reddy’s shares outperformed. The reasons are not clear.
Dr Reddy’s Q4 FY18 results did not contain anything that can explain the spike and the management commentary on issues such as big product launches or even updates on the regulatory compliance front did not bring any pleasant surprises. Maybe the markets were expecting worse numbers. Dr Reddy’s shares had fallen by 6% till Monday, over a week ago.
The US market continues to be a problem, with North America sales down by 10% sequentially, due to price erosion, competition in key products and lower sales of a key drug. The firm launched three products during the quarter.
Some key generic products in the pipeline could get launched later than expected, depending on regulatory clearances. In FY19, however, Dr Reddy’s did say it expects to launch about 15 products, of which some should be limited competition products (which earn better margins). That does raise the prospect of a boost to revenue in FY19.
On its plants that are under the regulatory scanner, the company said it will be able to request an inspection for its Duvvada plant in June, and in Srikakulam, it will report to the US Food and Drug Administration in the near future on activities completed, and await further communication.
In India, revenues rose by 16% over a year ago after adjusting for the goods and services tax-related accounting impact. In Europe, it suffered due to supply disruptions and price erosion, while its emerging market revenues also fell due to a temporary disruption in sales in Russia.
The net effect was that total revenue fell by 1.6% over a year ago, Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) fell by 4.6% and profit before tax fell by 6.7%. Profit after tax fell by 19% but mainly due to a charge related to changes in the US tax laws.
In FY19, its India business can be expected to do well, barring any new policy-related hiccups. After a 6% decline in revenues, could the US market bounce back is a question nobody has an answer to. If price erosion in the US market stabilizes at lower levels, then it could. That’s also assuming Dr Reddy’s pipeline delivers the promised launches in FY19, especially those with limited competition.
The US market continues to hold the key to an upward shift in Dr Reddy’s performance in FY19, which can lead to an upgrade in the company’s valuations. Positive developments on the US regulatory compliance front could also make a difference, but it’s unwise to speculate on that."

Dr Reddy’s said it would launch its therapeutic equivalent of Suboxone, which is a composition of buprenorphine and naloxone, at risk, with an approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program.
One analyst said the at-risk sudden launch was a surprise and could threaten Indivior’s 2018 guidance.
A spokesman for Indivior said the company was preparing to release a statement.
Indivior could seek an injunction to try to halt a launch of the generics or launch its own authorised generic, analysts at Jefferies said in a note.
“If Indivior was to prevail in any of its on-going legal challenges then Dr Reddy’s would be liable for damages,"" Jefferies said, estimating that Indivior’s 2018 earnings per share could be hit by as much as 50% if Dr. Reddy’s has sufficient inventory and launches by 1 July."

Net profit came in at  ₹ 476 crore ($69.31 million) in the quarter ended June 30, compared with  ₹ 66.6 crore a year earlier, the company said. Analysts on average had expected a net profit of  ₹ 298 crore, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Revenue from the company’s generics business in North America, its biggest market, jumped 6% to  ₹ 1,590 crore, driven by the US launch of gSuboxone.
Dr.Reddy’s got approval to sell versions of Indivior Plc’s best-selling opioid addiction treatment last month, materially hurting the British drugmaker’s revenue and forcing it to scrap its full-year forecast amid market share loss.
The company also said revenues in US were partly offset by competitive pressure on key molecules as it continues to experience price erosion in the US generics market.

Mumbai: Teva Pharmaceuticals has agreed to hold off launching its knock-off version of Indivior Plc’s blockbuster opioid addiction drug until the resolution of a US court case on another generic rival, Indivior said on Wednesday. 
Mumbai: Teva Pharmaceuticals has agreed to hold off launching its knock-off version of Indivior Plc’s blockbuster opioid addiction drug until the resolution of a US court case on another generic rival, Indivior said on Wednesday.
The pair’s Indian rival Dr Reddy’s Laboratories is currently locked in a legal battle in the US to re-launch a cheaper version of the UK drugmaker’s Suboxone Film. 
Indivior Plc‘s US subsidiary Indivior Inc recently filed patent lawsuits against Dr Reddy’s, Actavis, Par, Alvogen and Teva for infringement of the US patent related to proposed generic versions of Suboxone Film. Suboxone Film is used for treating opioid addiction and has a brand size of around $1.7 billion in the US, according to estimates.
Indivior also reiterated its full-year net revenues guidance of $25 million to $50 million from its new opioid addiction drug Sublocade, on which the company has pinned its hopes after the legal battles.
Sublocade injections are delivered direct to doctors for administration, rather than distributed through pharmacies to be sold based on prescription.
“Experience and satisfaction with Sublocade continues to be positive based on anecdotal reports from both patients and physicians,"" CEO Shaun Thaxter said on Wednesday.
Indivior said Sublocade sales would be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter, and that it was confident in achieving its annual peak net revenue goal $1 billion or above."

New Delhi: Drug major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL) Monday said it will sell its active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) business unit in Hyderabad to generics pharmaceutical company Therapiva Private Ltd.
In a regulatory filing, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories said it has entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of its API manufacturing business unit in Jeedimetla, Hyderabad, to Therapiva.
Therapiva is a joint venture between Omnicare Drugs India, a wholly owned subsidiary of Neopharma LLC, Abu Dhabi and Laxai Life Sciences.
The sale includes all related fixed assets (land and building), current assets, current liabilities, and its employees, the company said.

How times have changed. Investors in pharmaceutical firms selling to the US generic market traditionally focused more on revenue growth and less on costs.

News that Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd is selling one of its API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) units sent its shares up by 4.5% on Monday.

The company said this is part of its measures to streamline production and reduce costs. A fortnight ago, it closed another deal to sell its investment in a US antibiotics facility to UAE’s Neopharma Inc.
Monday’s announcement will see an API facility in Hyderabad sold to Therapiva Pvt. Ltd, a joint venture between a subsidiary of Neopharma Llc (parent of Neopharma Inc.) and Laxai Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd. Although Dr Reddy’s has not disclosed details such as consideration or revenues of the units sold in both transactions, investors applauded the company’s actions.
In its last conference call, the company had said it will shut down some of its urban sites, partly due to rationalization and as a reaction to urbanization. It also said it intends to move some production from older to newer sites. But the management also clarified that no major impact on sales or profit was expected as a result. That should be a note of caution for investors.
Dr Reddy’s has seven API plants, according to its website. Four of them are in Hyderabad, including the one being sold. The API business forms part of its pharmaceutical services and active ingredients division (PSAI). “Pharmaceutical services"" is doing custom manufacturing for other companies.
Indian companies chiefly run the API business for their captive needs and use surplus capacity to sell to others. While certain APIs can be very profitable, where there is limited competition, the business earns lower margins than formulations.
In Dr Reddy’s case, its PSAI division earned a segment profit margin of 17% in the June quarter, compared to 61.2% for the global generics business. While PSAI earned revenue of  ₹ 702 crore,  ₹ 148 crore of that is for APIs transferred to the generics business at cost, what is called inter-segment revenue. So APIs will always be part of the production mix.
But a formulation-maker could sell parts of the API chain that are no longer important. Or, it could consolidate API production at fewer locations. Also, the acquirer may have a lower profitability threshold than Dr Reddy’s has. In a win-win arrangement, the acquirer gets a viable API business, while Dr Reddy’s could ink a long-term sourcing arrangement to ensure raw material availability.
In the June quarter, Dr Reddy’s had said that the improvement in profitability was partly due to costs being kept in check. Investors may have assumed the sale of the unit could see profitability improve further.
While their assumptions may be correct, they face the risk of having overvalued the benefits. More clarity on the impact on profitability should be forthcoming at Dr Reddy’s post-results conference call later this month."

Hyderabad: A move by two senior political leaders to join the Congress party has suddenly put the grand old party in the driver’s seat in the forthcoming assembly elections in Telangana. 
Lok Sabha MP (member of Parliament) Konda Vishweshwar Reddy quit the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) on Tuesday and joined Congress a day later, while prominent backward classes leader R. Krishnaiah entered the party a few days earlier, his name figuring in the Congress’s fourth list of candidates released on 19 November.
Reddy, who joined the TRS in 2013 and supported the Telangana statehood movement, resigned his Chevella parliamentary seat. 
An entrepreneur from an illustrious family, the former MP met Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday. His grandfather is Konda Venkata Pratap Reddy, who was deputy chief minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh.
His departure is likely to impact the TRS’s performance in the assembly segments falling under the Chevella parliamentary seat. 
Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) treasurer Gudur Narayana Reddy was confident that his party will win a handful of assembly seats with Vishweshwar Reddy’s help.
“We will win seats which are not ours (won by TRS in 2014 state polls) like Tandur, Chevella and Vikarabad,"" Narayana Reddy told Mint, adding that the Congress-led grand alliance in Telangana will win more than 72 of the 119 seats in the 7 December polls. 
The alliance also includes the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), Telangana Jana Samithi and the Communist Party of India. Prominent backward classes leader R. Krishnaiah’s presence in the Congress is also expected to boost the alliance given that backward classes make up 53% of the population in Telangana. Krishnaiah, will contest from Miryalaguda. He had won the L.B. Nagar seat on a TDP ticket in the 2014 assembly polls. 
“The grand alliance will now get an additional 10% of the vote share and we are definitely going to get close to 80 seats,"" he said.
In a letter to TRS chief K. Chandrashekar Rao, Vishweshwar Reddy said the ruling party is becoming “more and more distant from the people"" and that the government was “becoming inaccessible to the people"". The TRS MP from Karimnagar B. Vinod, however, said Konda Vishweshwar Reddy’s departure will have no impact on the elections, as it was simply because of local issues that he left."

Good news is somewhat of a rarity when it comes to Indian pharmaceutical companies and the US generics market. Investors were pleasantly surprised when Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd won a case, allowing it to continue selling a generic version of Suboxone, a drug used to treat opioid addiction.  
Good news is somewhat of a rarity when it comes to Indian pharmaceutical companies and the US generics market. Investors were pleasantly surprised when Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd won a case, allowing it to continue selling a generic version of Suboxone, a drug used to treat opioid addiction. 
For Indivior Plc, which holds patent over the drug, the bulk of its $768 million revenue in the nine months of 2018 came from sales of Suboxone, said Bloomberg.
Dr Reddy’s launch will see it gain share at the expense of Indivior, and this drug was expected to be a key contributor to revenues. Unless there are any further legal obstacles, the Indian company should be in a position to bring the product back on the market. 
It is still an at-risk launch, meaning there is ongoing patent litigation, but the drug maker has chosen to go ahead and launch based on its confidence of winning the case.
The legal victory means Dr Reddy’s will start generating revenues from generic Suboxone earlier than expected. Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd estimates that the launch can add 12% to Dr Reddy’s FY19 earnings but the FY20 earnings estimates have been left unchanged as the product was expected to be launched in that year anyway. Along with Dr Reddy’s, there will be other generic competitors in the fray, though their entry will be staggered and still in limited numbers.
This development should give a much-needed boost to Dr Reddy’s US business. Sales during the September quarter declined by 0.4% over a year ago and its base business declined by 5%, according to Jefferies India. The company had launched four new products during the quarter. It said that the sequential decline in sales was chiefly due to lack of sales from generic Suboxone and price erosion in some key products that were partially offset by a favourable forex situation.
Dr Reddy’s shares rose by 5.9% on this news on Wednesday and then settled down on Thursday. That in some way reflects accurately the mood among investors. While this event will give a one-time boost, the rest of it was anyway factored in its valuations. 
This done, the bigger picture is Dr Reddy’s ability to get US business growth going, by launching a few more key products from its pipeline.
Then, there’s the regulatory overhang that is worrying the market. Recent news that the company got eight observations for its Duvvada plant (near Visakhapatnam), five of which were repeat observations, is certainly not the kind investors want to hear. It reflects an inability to take adequate remedial action on an observation, which reflects rather poorly on the company.
Dr Reddy’s shares still reflect optimism on the part of investors, trading at 20 times the FY20 mean of analyst estimates compiled by Reuters. Hopefully, it can still get through the hurdles in its path to deliver on those expectations"

52,2019-01-23,Reddy,"Neither of them was even born when the last wave of going-global swept Indian boardrooms

The Indian multinational corporation (MNC) Version 3.0 is here and it presents a promising picture. Last week as online tutoring startup Byju’s acquired Osmo, a maker of educational games, for $120 million and extended its footprint to the US, it joined a new breed of emerging Indian multinationals that are foraying into global markets. Among them are Oyo Hotels and Homes and Ola Cabs, both of which have now set up operations in multiple locations outside the country.
That neither of them was even born when the last wave of going-global swept Indian boardrooms tells the story of corporate India’s progression from an insular economy to one whose entrepreneurs are now confident of taking on the best in the world.
Unlike in the past, the current surge is being fuelled by developments in technology that have given India’s latest unicorns global advantages based on domestic consumer characteristics that are replicable abroad without major outflows of capital. It also comes only after they have built a strong base at home, learnt the ropes and, vitally, developed robust back-end systems. With infrastructure in most other markets much better than at home, these companies are ready to take their proven operational models abroad. Oyo will compete with formidable adversaries such as Airbnb and Tujia in China, while in Australia, Ola is up against three existing players.
An incorrect reading of the commodity cycles and over-reliance on debt in large-sized acquisitions have meant that the first two rounds of efforts at going global by Indian businesses met only limited success. Yet that doesn’t deflect from the pioneering spirit of those companies.
At the start of this century, as Tata Tea acquired the ailing British tea company Tetley Tea, then the second largest producer of tea bags in the world, for $431 million, it ushered in the first wave of companies prepared to leave the comfort of a secure domestic market. In 2001, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories became the first pharmaceutical company from the Asia Pacific (barring Japan) to list on the New York Stock Exchange. Five years later, the company went on to buy 100% of Betapharm Arzneimittel, the fourth largest generic pharmaceutical company in Germany, in a $570 million all-cash deal.
Soon after, Vedanta Resources Ltd, the holding company of the Sterlite group, raised a record $1 billion on the London Stock Exchange through its maiden initial public offering (IPO). It was the largest such fund-raise by an Indian company in overseas markets and the second largest IPO in Europe in 2003. Around the same time, Bharat Forge acquired German forging company Carl Dan Peddinghaus, in the process becoming the second largest forging company in the world after Thyssen Krupp. For the Pune-based company, the acquisition was a smooth passage into the European market, paving the way for it to become a supplier to German automakers such as Daimler AG and BMW AG.
However, these were just the appetizers. The main course was yet to come.
And it was kicked off by the man from St Xavier’s College, Kolkata. On 25 June 2006, Mittal Steel, owned by Lakshmi Mittal, whose global ambitions had started in 1976, and Luxembourg-based Arcelor sewed up a $33.6 billion merger to create the world’s largest steel company. That one deal signalled that Indian business was now welcome on the global high table (this after the Arcelor management had dismissed Mittal Steel as a “company of Indians"") and that protectionist barriers across the world were being blown away by economic rationale.
This was reinforced by two successive deals. In 2007, Tata Steel acquired Corus, UK, in a $12.1 billion transaction and, just a few days later, Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Hindalco Industries Ltd bought US-based Novelis Inc. for $6 billion. A year later, Tata Motors Ltd bought the Jaguar Land Rover business from Ford Motor Co. for a net consideration of $2.3 billion. The cycle ended with Bharti Airtel’s 2010 acquisition of Zain Africa for an enterprise value of $10.7 billion.
In between there were the IT services majors, most of whose business came from outside but whose operations were largely centred at home. Despite this, it would be fair to say that companies such as Infosys Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Wipro Ltd, spurred by competition from multinationals such as Accenture, Cognizant and IBM, were among the earliest Indian companies to adopt MNC practices in terms of management processes, technology, human resources, their approach to sales and marketing, best-in-class standards in accounting, regulatory affairs, and intellectual property rights.
The likes of Oyo and Ola thus have a rich legacy and the learning that comes from it. They can also aspire to carry forward the charge of Indian multinationals much like Japanese and South Korean companies did in the 20th century.
The difference is that when Japanese companies started their global march in the late 1960s and those from South Korea and other East Asian countries in the 1980s, they caught the rising wave of globalization. Over the next several decades, global trade in goods and services soared as countries opened their markets quite willingly. India’s new MNCs by contrast face a rising tide of de-globalization, with more and more countries looking to shut out foreigners and foreign firms.

Shares of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd gained 3.3% on Friday after the company’s earnings for the December quarter exceeded analysts’ estimates. Growth momentum in emerging markets coupled with cost- rationalization measures are expected to help Dr Reddy’s maintain the earnings tempo.
Revenue in the December quarter increased just 1%. However, as the company kept a check on operating expenses, including spending on research and development, operating profit increased 7.4%.
Gross margin softened during the quarter, reflecting continuous price erosion in its key US market. But the loss in the US market is being more than made up for by growth in emerging markets and in India. Further, Dr Reddy’s custom pharmaceutical services business had a good quarter, shoring up earnings.
The net result at the company level is positive revenue growth for the third straight quarter. Importantly, Dr Reddy’s sees stabilization at the portfolio level, largely aided by continuing growth momentum in emerging markets and limited-competition opportunities in the US. Limited-competition opportunities are with reference to certain complex drugs that offer better realizations due to less competition.
As the company maintains its focus on cost-rationalization and efficiency- improvement measures, analysts see a stable earnings trajectory. “We raise our FY19/20/21 earnings per share estimates by 6%/4%/3% to factor in better growth in emerging markets, cost-rationalization measures and lower tax,"" Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd said in a note.
Growth in emerging markets is being driven by market expansion. The company is not only expanding its reach but also building new service lines such as hospitals and other business verticals that largely work on a business-to-business (B2B) model. 
That said, as with most global generic drug firms, Dr Reddy’s fortunes are intertwined with that of the US, the largest drug market. The US market continues to face pricing pressures. Last quarter, higher volumes helped the company alleviate the revenue impact; its revenues grew 4% sequentially. 
Dr Reddy’s focus is on new product launches and limited-competition opportunities. In the current quarter, the company expects to step up product filings. 
If approved in time, the limited-competition drugs could lift US revenue next fiscal (year). But much of the benefit will also be linked to resolution of the regulatory issues at its manufacturing plants, key to cost-effective production. 
“Dr Reddy’s has taken significant remediation measures and awaits a response and/or re-inspection from the US Food and Drug Administration for sites under the warning letter,"" added analysts at Motilal Oswal. “Given the uncertain nature of time-lines taken by companies to resolve regulatory issues, we wait for successful compliance at (these) sites."""

45,2019-02-21,Reddy,"Indian pharma companies are seeing reduced pricing pressure in the US generic drugs businessHelped by new product launches, US revenues of large pharma companies are expected to recover in FY20

The December quarter (Q3) results of Indian pharmaceutical companies, while unexciting, gave important cues about the US market.
One, companies are seeing reduced pricing pressure in the US generic drugs business, even though the degree varies across companies and product categories. Two, the long-awaited complex generics and specialty products businesses are finally shaping up. These segments have higher entry barriers and better price realizations. As these gain traction, and pricing pressure in the core generic drugs business subsides, chances of a rebound in US revenues in FY20 are quite high, say analysts.
“We expect US generic revenues to recover sharply over FY20-21 on the back of new launches, although the timing of the launches is still somewhat uncertain, which may push back the recovery in revenues and profits,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a recent note referring to the domestic pharma companies.
US is a key market for large Indian pharma companies, such as Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd and Lupin Ltd. Compared to a 1.6% fall in FY19, Kotak estimates the combined sales of these three companies to increase by 16% next fiscal year.
As competition in the US generic drugs business intensified, financial performance of all the three companies had come under pressure. Signs of stabilization emerged in Q3, with all three registering sequential growth in US revenues. The growth was driven by volume increase, new product launches and reduced pricing pressure.
Drug makers such as Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd, however, continued to see pricing pressure, but compared to earlier years, the price drop has moderated, after the squeeze in profitability made the industry wary of irrational pricing.
Concurrently, as companies began introducing complex generics and specialty drugs, the fall in revenues at the portfolio level is being arrested.
Lupin, which had launched one specialty drug (Solosec) last year, expects its sales to grow this year. It plans to introduce more limited competition drugs in the current quarter. Similarly, Sun Pharma introduced a couple of specialty drugs and plans to launch a few more this year.
In this backdrop, the expectation of a revival in US growth isn’t surprising.
Even so, Anshuman Gupta, analyst at Investec Capital Services (India) Pvt. Ltd, warned that the recovery assumptions are tied to the success of the new products. “The recovery will be dependent on success of these large products, where we believe the chances of surprising on the downside are higher,"" he said.
Indeed, the caution is warranted. Delays in product launches are commonplace, and the recent specialty drug launches did not see the kind of growth as initially envisaged. This should be reason enough for investors to exercise some caution.
Complex and specialty drugs require significant upfront investments. Slow growth can not only prolong the payback period, but can also increase risks to earnings projections. How well the companies ramp-up this business will be crucial.
“These investments are significant, and also bring in more risks as the probability of success is lower, along with higher gestation periods,"" pointed out Gupta."
44,2019-02-21,Reddy,"The re-launch comes on the heels of a favourable decision delivered by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Suboxone had sales of around $1.86 billion in the US for the 12 months ended April 2018, according to market reports

HYDERABAD :
Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd. has said it re-launched its Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film, generic version of Suboxone in the US market.
According to a press release issued by the city-based drug maker Wednesday night, the re-launch comes on the heels of a favourable decision delivered by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit concluding that UK-based Indivior had not shown that it is likely to succeed on its claim that Dr Reddy's product infringes a patent pertaining to Suboxone.
Indivior is in a legal battle against the launch of the copycat version of its opioid addiction treatment by competitors including Dr Reddy's Laboratories in the US market.
Suboxone had sales of around $1.86 billion in the US for the 12 months ended April 2018, according to market reports.
""We are pleased with the decision of the appellate court in Dr Reddy's favour, vacating the preliminary injunction that had prevented Dr Reddy's from continuing to market this important drug to the public,"" Marc Kikuchi, Chief Executive Officer, North America Generics of DRL said.
In June 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approved Dr Reddy's Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film, in four strengths including 2 mg/0.5 mg, 4 mg/1 mg, 8 mg/2 mg, and 12 mg/3 mg, for sale in the US market.
The product was launched immediately after approval, with sales and commercialisation activities halted as a result of a court-imposed temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction against Dr Reddy's.
The TRO and preliminary injunction did not prohibit commercial manufacture of the product.

Mumbai: Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd is seeking more than $70 million from Indivior Plc as compensation for lost US sales of its generic version of a leading opioid addiction treatment that was delayed in a patent dispute with the UK-based drugmaker.
Indivior had managed to block Dr Reddy’s generic version of Suboxone Film through a court injunction in July, despite the Indian company receiving regulatory approval earlier to sell the market-leading product for opioid dependence. Last month, the US Supreme Court refused to uphold that injunction, allowing Dr Reddy’s to resume sales of the drug.
“If we were not injuncted by the court, we would have made a lot of money,"" G.V. Prasad, Dr Reddy’s managing director and chief executive said in an interview at the company’s headquarters in Hyderabad. 'If we get the lost profits, it’ll certainly outperform.""
Suboxone is the leading prescription drug used to treat opioid abuse in the US, which is battling an addiction crisis that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates kills 130 Americans every day. Suboxone Film — absorbed by being placed under the tongue or inside the cheek to treat addiction to opioids including heroin and prescription painkillers — accounted for almost all of Indivior’s $1 billion in sales last year.
Indivior posted a bond of $72 million to cover Dr Reddy’s potential claim of lost profit while the injunction was contested, according to Prasad. The Indian drugmaker is claiming that it’s owed more than that since the injunction lasted longer than the bond was meant to cover. He declined to say how much the company is asking for.
Notwithstanding legal costs and the three other generic versions of Suboxone Film which have entered the US since Dr Reddy’s legal victory, Prasad estimated his company could still get about a quarter of the market share, making it a profitable product.

NEW DELHI :
 India's anti-satellite missile test is a reflection of the country's growing capability to develop critical technology and it will act as a good deterrence, DRDO Chairman G Satheesh Reddy said Wednesday. Reddy said clearance for the project was given over two years back.
""It is a great achievement for India,"" he told PTI after India shot down a satellite in space with a missile, catapulting the country into an elite club of space powers. Reddy said the technology used for the test has been completely developed indigenously.
The shooting down of the satellite with a missile reflected that ""we have matured to develop technology which could achieve accuracy in terms of centimeters"".
""The anti-satellite missile test has reflected our capability and will act as a good deterrance,"" the chief of Defence Research and Development Organisation said.
The project was implemented in the fastest way possible and it showed the DRDO's capability in doing such programmes, he added."
41,2019-03-28,Reddy,"For business to scale, Dr Reddy’s needs to streamline distribution and find a local partner in China, which would require investmentswith China focusing on developing its pharma industry, imports from India will not be a preferred option

Continuing tribulations in the US drug market is impelling pharmaceutical firms to look for growth elsewhere. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, with a sizeable presence in emerging markets (EMs), is further sharpening its focus on China. It aims to grow ahead of the market in India, while scaling up its operations in China.
The move is well-timed. China’s $160-billion drug market, the world’s second-largest after the US, is reforming. Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd says the country offers fast-track approvals and incentives for generic drugs.
Of the Indian firms, Dr Reddy’s is ahead in building a business in China. It notched $95 million in revenue for the first nine months of FY19. Further, it has a sizeable product range, with approvals in developed markets that can be introduced in China.
Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd says Dr Reddy’s has 70-80 products with $8 billion in sales that could be filed in China. “(China) is a competitive market. However, with early moves, certain products have revenue potential in excess of $30 million,"" it said in a note.
Dr Reddy’s stock reflects the optimism. Compared to a 9% rise in the Nifty Pharma index, it has gained 33% in the past year. It did well as business in EMs gained traction, aiding overall revenue. Total revenue rose 6.6% in the first nine months of FY19. In the year-ago period, it was up just 1%.
Part of the optimism can also be attributed to the forthcoming large product launches in the key US market, which can give a fillip to revenues from the region. But, for the growth-focused long-term investor, China is the key variable.
The country is intensely competitive. Jefferies India says that a national tender has seen price cuts of around 50%. Further, for business to scale, Dr Reddy’s needs to streamline distribution and find a local partner, which would require investments.
How well the company manages this will determine future earnings. “While the reforms make China an attractive market, ramp-up and profitability will have significant challenges,"" Jefferies India said in a note. “Unlike the US, distribution is important in China and will need a local partner and higher spend. Additionally, with the Chinese government focus on developing local industry, imports from India will not be a preferred option requiring a local manufacturing setup."""
40,2019-04-06,Reddy,"The anti satellite (ASAT) missile test was “intentionally done at a lower orbit of 280 km to ensure that the debris decay very fast"" Decisions on the weaponisation of space to be taken by the government

New Delhi: India on Saturday said its anti satellite (ASAT) missile test was done in a low orbit of less than 300 kilometres and at a particular angle to ensure that minimal debris were disbursed above into space to avoid damage to other satellites or the International Space Station (ISS).
India’s interceptor missile used in the ASAT test on 27 March has the capability to neutralise satellites up to 1,000 km in space, Defence Research and Development Organisation chief G. Satheesh Reddy said. But the ASAT test was “intentionally done at a lower orbit of 280 km to ensure that the debris decay very fast,"" Reddy said.
With the test done last month, India has mastered the capability to kill satellites at 300 km above the earth, Reddy said. ""We don’t need any more tests at this orbit now,"" though he did not rule out the option of conducting more tests in the future. 
Decisions on the weaponisation of space would be taken by the government, Reddy said. 
He also clarified that a test done on 12 February was not an ASAT test, but a ballistic missile that was used to take out an electronic target — in response to media reports that the 12 February test was also an ASAT test that failed.
Reddy’s comments come against the backdrop of criticism from the US space agency — the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) — whose administrator Jim Bridenstine said that India’s ASAT test had created about 400 pieces of debris of which 24 were in an orbit near the International Space Station.
""That is a terrible, terrible thing to create an event that sends debris and an apogee that goes above the International Space Station. That kind of activity is not compatible with the future of human spaceflight,"" Bridenstine said at a NASA townhall with employees on Monday.
According to Reddy, before the physical ASAT test on 27 March, scientists had simulated the test to gauge the trajectory of debris and it was concluded that a direct head-on collision between the interceptor missile and the satellite would result in the least amount of debris going into space above — endangering the International Space Station which was in an orbit 120 km above the collision spot. Moreover, the International Space Station was not directly above the collision spot but in an orbit above the North Atlantic Ocean, over French Guyana, when India’s ASAT test took place over the Bay of Bengal, Reddy said.
“There is a risk (of debris from the Indian ASAT test) but the risk is for about 10 days which has been crossed,"" Reddy said. All the debris created by India’s test would take about 45 days to decompose, he added.
Reddy also responded to criticism by former home minister P Chidambaram, who had faulted the government for making India’s ASAT capability public. The DRDO chief said that a “mission of such nature"" could not have been kept a secret technically, given the numerous satellites launched by different countries orbiting in space.
Explaining the strategic importance of the test, Reddy said India had demonstrated that it possessed the capability to intercept and kill a satellite — which acted as a deterrent vis a vis other countries. “This is a ground-based direct hit capability ... it works for defence also.""
Almost all the technologies used for the ASAT test were indigenously developed with some 50 industries contributing components for the 13 metre missiles weighing 19 tonnes. Clearance to conduct the test was received in 2016 when the programme to develop the interceptor missile began in earnest, Reddy said. Of a team of 150 scientists involved in the project, 30-40 were women who were involved in radar software development, telemetry and ground computer systems, he added.
India’s ASAT test catapulted the country into an exclusive club of nations to acquire such a capability — the other countries being the US, Russia and China. New Delhi had successfully tested ballistic missile defence systems and it was one of these missiles that was upgraded for the ASAT test.

New Delhi: Drug major Dr Reddy's Laboratories is recalling 33,958 bottles of Divalproex Sodium Extended-Release tablets, used to treat seizure disorders, from the American market, as per a report by the US health regulator.
Besides, InvaGen Pharmaceuticals Inc, a subsidiary of Mumbai-based drug maker Cipla, is recalling over 7.8 lakh vials of Testosterone Cypionate injection, used to treat low testosterone levels in men.
Dr Reddy's Laboratories Inc, a subsidiary of the Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy's Laboratories, is voluntarily recalling the affected lot of bottles on account of certain deviations from the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations.
As per the latest enforcement report by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), the firm is recalling the product as it has been exposed to above 50 per cent relative humidity levels during packaging operations.
The product was supplied to major distributors and retailers who may have further distributed the product throughout the US, the report added.
Meanwhile, InvaGen Pharmaceuticals Inc is recalling its product in various strengths due to the ""presence of particulate matter"", the report said.
The vials were manufactured by Cipla at its Verna facility in Goa for Cipla USA Inc.
The USFDA has classified both the recalls as a Class-II recall, which is initiated in a ""situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote"".

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. is scouting for a partner in China to help it win a larger piece of the world’s second-largest drug market, where the government is on a mission to drive down the cost of healthcare.
With a recovery underway in its US business, Sun Pharma’s billionaire founder Dilip Shanghvi is homing in on China and believes market watchers are underestimating the potential there for India’s largest drugmaker.
“There is a big opportunity for us,"" Shanghvi said in an interview with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait in Mumbai on Thursday. “That would create a significant new revenue stream, which is not factored in our valuation when analysts look at it.""
China has rolled out an ambitious multi-city bulk drug procurement program that’s driving down prices and providing an opening for Indian manufacturers like Mumbai-based Sun Pharma to compete. The country is importing more drugs, reimbursing for more and speeding up approvals of new medicines to ensure they reach patients faster.
The policy push comes as many generic drugmakers continue to reel from a brutal price war in the US, the world’s biggest drug market. While Sun Pharma’s Indian rivals, like Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. and Cipla Ltd., are already expanding in China, Shanghvi has mostly kept quiet about his plans there.
Scaling Up
India’s top drugmaker will start scaling up its China business in six to nine months, according to Shanghvi. The unit is expected to contribute “some percentage"" to Sun Pharma’s $4 billion of overall sales within three years, from almost nothing right now, he said.
The $160 billion Chinese drug market “is now a focus for Indian generics"" as U.S.-approved drugs are cleared faster, Jefferies analyst Piyush Nahar wrote in a Feb. 27 note.
“While the reforms make China an attractive market, ramp-up and profitability will have significant challenges,"" Nahar wrote. “Unlike US, distribution is important in China and will need a local partner and higher spend.""
Analysts are split on the prospects for Sun Pharma’s shares, which have lagged the rise in the S&P BSE Sensex this year. In the last four years, Sun Pharma has fallen nearly 52 percent compared to the Sensex’s 42 percent climb.
Sun Pharma’s large portfolio of US-approved products should help the drugmaker ramp up its China business with little investment, Shanghvi said.
“We see enormous interest in China for products that we have global rights for,"" Shanghvi said, adding that the company “would be comfortable making significant financial commitments,"" there longer term.

37,2019-05-14,Reddy,"Sun, Dr Reddy’s among firms named in antitrust suit filed by 40 US statesThe lawsuit accuses 20 pharma firms of conspiring to inflate prices of more than 100 different drugs

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON :
Seven Indian drug makers, including Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, and five of their executives have been named in a US lawsuit that accuses Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd of orchestrating a conspiracy to raise medicine prices.
The antitrust lawsuit was filed by 40 US states on 10 May and is based on a five-year investigation of the firms. Other Indian generic drug makers named in the lawsuit are Aurobindo Pharma Ltd, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Lupin Ltd, Wockhardt Ltd and Zydus Pharma.
The lawsuit accuses 20 drug makers of conspiring to inflate prices of more than 100 different drugs, significantly broadening a 2016 complaint. In addition to the states, the justice department’s antitrust division is conducting a criminal probe. The complaint is an expanded document of suit, which is still under litigation and was filed by US states in December 2016.
ALSO WATCH:
The states claim that the drug makers conspired with one another to fix prices and carve up markets for medicines among themselves, rather than compete on price. Executives used industry dinners, cocktail parties and golf outings to perpetuate the scheme, in addition to communicating through text messages and telephone calls, the complaint said.
Indian pharma stocks declined in Mumbai on Monday. BSE’s healthcare index fell 3.53% to 13,310.47 points. Shares of Sun Pharmaceuticals plunged 21% in intraday trading, but ended the day down 9.39% to  ₹396.85 on the BSE. Dr Reddy’s fell 2.5% to  ₹2,804.95.
A Sun Pharmaceutical spokesperson said, “We believe the allegations made in these lawsuits are without merit and we will continue to vigorously defend against them.""
The US complaint puts Teva at the centre of the conspiracy, saying it colluded with a core group of competitors to follow each other’s price increases. During a 19-month period from 2013 to 2015, Teva significantly raised prices on about 112 generic drugs and colluded with its competitors on at least 86 medicines, the states said. While the size of the increases varied, some were more than 1,000%.
“Teva is a consistent participant in the conspiracies identified in this complaint, but the conduct is pervasive and industry-wide,"" according to the complaint that was filed in federal court in Connecticut. “Through its senior-most executives and account managers, Teva participated in a wide-ranging series of restraints with more than a dozen generic drug manufacturers, all of whom knowingly and willingly participated.""
In a statement, Kelley Dougherty, a Teva vice-president, said, “The allegations in this new complaint and in the litigation more generally, are just that—allegations.""
The US states are seeking unspecified damages and penalties from the firms. Potential fines could exceed $2 billion, given that generic drug firms were making higher profits during the time in question, said Steven Tepper, an analyst at Israel Brokerage and Investments. That strikes a blow to Teva, struggling to pay back $29 billion of debt—a sum almost twice its market value.
“We have hard evidence that shows the generic-drug industry perpetrated a multi-billion dollar fraud on the American people,"" Connecticut attorney general William Tong said in a statement on Friday. “We all wonder why our healthcare, and specifically the prices for generic prescription drugs, are so expensive in this country—this is a big reason why.""
The firms have argued that price increases were due to factors such as industry consolidation and regulator-mandated plant closures."
35,2019-05-15,Reddy,"Since the plaintiff states have demanded a trial by jury, there will be an emotive angle to whatever judgement is finally delivered. American citizens are literally sick of what they perceive as the excesses of the pharma companies

There are very few industries as notorious as Big Pharma. Fewer still have done more to deserve that notoriety. Tweaking existing drugs to generate new patents, price gouging by creating artificial scarcities and simply buying off competitors, there’s hardly a dirty trick that pharma companies haven’t tried.
So last week’s news about the charges filed by 44 US states alleging collusion between 20 drug makers to raise prices and allocate markets among themselves, comes as no surprise. While Israeli firm Teva is at the epicentre of the ring, which includes reputed multinational firms like Pfizer and Sandoz, also named are seven of India’s top pharma companies, including Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (a subsidiary of Sun Pharma), Glenmark, Dr Reddy’s and Aurobindo Pharma.
The charge against these companies is that they conspired to fix prices at artificially high levels. An excerpt from the department of justice (DoJ) filing gives a sense of how outrageous some of the hikes were: “Clomipramine HCL, also known by the brand name Anafranil, is used for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, and chronic pain. In addition to Defendants Sandoz and Mylan, Defendant Taro also manufactured Clomipramine HCL. Indeed, it was Taro that led a price increase on this product on May l, 2013. The price increase was striking—more than a 3,440% increase to Taro’s WAC pricing on certain formulations.""
Significantly, the DoJ document also says that besides conspiring with Teva, the other “competitors also colluded with each other on drugs that Teva did not market."" Presumably this included the seven Indian companies as well.
Predictably, all the accused companies have denied the charges. But that isn’t surprising.
Companies rarely accept wrongdoing until they are presented with incontrovertible evidence and the threat of even worse punishment if they continue with their denials. In 2011, the DoJ began investigations against automotive parts manufacturers in the US on charges of large-scale price-fixing. The case dragged on for seven years before finally last year all but two of the charged companies pleaded guilty, and a total of nearly $3 billion in criminal fines was imposed on them.
In fact, the present case, being dubbed the biggest single act of cartelization in the US, picked up steam when in 2017, two executives of Heritage Pharmaceuticals, an American company that is part of the current lawsuit, pleaded guilty to fixing prices for two generic drugs, doxycycline and glyburide, and agreed to cooperate with the larger investigation.
It is true that generics makers have provided badly-needed low priced alternatives to expensive drugs. Indeed, it was Cipla Inc., not named in the current investigations, that in 2001 provided the real impetus to Indian generics when it slashed prices for AIDS patients in Africa from $10,000 to $100 per year by launching its version of the HIV triple drug combination.
In recognition of the growing role of generics in the healthcare business, US Congress in 1984 passed the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to streamline the process for generic pharmaceutical approvals while simultaneously retaining the incentives needed for research and development. The Act came about following protracted and prolonged drug testing and approval procedures of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Its purpose was to allow a faster approval route to generic drugs. The act has served its purpose rather well. Nearly 90% of all prescriptions in the US are for generic drugs.
The US generic drug market, dominated by hospital pharmacies, was valued at $103.8 billion in 2018, having grown at 12.1% between 2011 and 2018, according to IMARC Group. It is expected to reach $190.4 billion by 2024, at a projected CAGR of 10.6% in the years from 2019 to 2024.
That represents a huge opportunity for Indian pharma firms which already have a major share of that market. However, recent events, including strictures from the US FDA on quality-related issues as well as the current charges about anti-competitive behavior, could act as a dampener.
The success of India’s software services companies rests on maintaining quality and ethical standards on par with the best in the world. Five years ago as the whole Ranbaxy story fell apart in the US, it queered the pitch for other Indian pharma companies who found themselves subjected to additional scrutiny by the FDA on abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs). The knock-on effect of the current investigations could lead to similar reprisals. That is of course over and above the fines running into several millions of dollars that the accused firms will have to pay if the DOJ and the state attorneys are able to prove their charges.
Since the plaintiff states have demanded a trial by jury, there will be an emotive angle to whatever judgement is finally delivered. American citizens are literally sick of what they perceive as the excesses of the pharma companies. Witness the glee over news of solitary confinement for Turing Pharma’s infamous CEO Martin Shkreli, now serving a seven-year sentence for securities fraud. This is the man whose company hiked the price of antiparasitic drug Daraprim from $13.50 to $750 a pill. As evident from pronouncements by politicians, the knives are out for pharma companies. Will they pay heed?

Dr Reddy's Laboratories Limiteds consolidated profit after tax for the quarter-ended March 31, 2019 was up by 44% at  ₹434.4 crore against  ₹302.2 crore in the third quarter of FY 18, a senior official of the city-based drug maker said Friday.
President, CFO and global head (HR) of Dr Reddys Saumen Chakraborty in a press conference said the revenue for the quarter under discussion was up by 14% at  ₹4,017 crore against  ₹3,535 crore in the same quarter last fiscal.
During the last quarter, the company entered into an agreement with Encore Dermatology, Inc. for sale and assignment of US rights relating to three of its dermatology brands.
He said the company launched about 20 products during the last fiscal and expects to launch equal or more during the current fiscal.
""Some of the new launches will be the key driver of growth this year in the USA,"" he further said.
Revenues from global generics segment in the Q4 was reported at  ₹3,038 crore a year-on-year growth of nine per cent over the same quarter last year, primarily driven by contributions from emerging markets and Europe, he said. Those from North America grew by three per cent to  ₹1,496 crore against  ₹1,449 crore in Q4 of FY18.
The revenues from India during the Q4 was at  ₹650 crore. Those from pharmaceutical services and active pharma ingredients was at  ₹676.50 crore in the fourth quarter with eight per cent growth over the Q4 of FY 18, the official said.
For FY 19, PAT stood at  ₹1,880 crore while revenue was 15,385 crore. Chakraborty said research and development (R&D) expenses were at  ₹1,560 crore in FY 19. The CEO and co-chairman of the company GV Prasad said FY19 has been a good year with a significant turnaround in the financial performance and steady progress on the quality front. 
Replying to a query, he said the Indivior Plc which tried to block Dr Reddys launch of generic suboxone in the USA through legal battle posted a bond of $72 million to cover Dr Reddys potential claim of lost profit while the injunction was contested in the US courts. 
Dr Reddy's relaunched its buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film, the generic version of suboxone in the USA market in February 2019 at risk. Indivior unsuccessfully contested in courts on the launch of Dr Reddys drug. The matter is still pending in court.

31,2019-05-19,Reddy,"Exclude  ₹180.7 cr firm got by selling the US rights for 3 derma brands, and the revenue growth drops to an unexciting 8.5%US revenue grew a mere 1% sequentially, despite some big product launches

Top pharmaceutical firms have bad news for investors who are looking for a recovery in business. After Lupin Ltd, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd has reported subdued performance for the March quarter.
Reported revenues of Dr Reddy’s increased 14% from a year ago. But exclude the  ₹180.7 crore the company received for the sale of its US rights for three dermatology brands, and revenue growth drops to an unexciting 8.5%. On a sequential basis, revenues are flat.
Even otherwise, the sectoral performance is telling. US revenue grew a mere 1% sequentially, despite some big product launches. The disappointment does not end there. Revenue in India dropped 4% sequentially. On a year-on-year basis, India revenue is up just 6%, trailing industry growth and Street estimates by a sizeable margin. Together, both these geographies generate more than half of Dr Reddy’s revenue, and have dragged down overall growth numbers.
The lacklustre performance in the US implies limited boost from the new drugs, which the Street was banking upon. This also made the company susceptible to pricing and cost pressures. Gross margin narrowed 100 basis points from a year ago to 52.4%. In Q1 FY19, margins were as high as 55.7%. If one were to exclude the proceeds from the sale of dermatology brands, the drop in margin will be significantly higher.
Not surprisingly, the performance disappointed the Street, which sent the stock down 2.5% on Friday. To recap, investors drove Dr Reddy’s shares up 38% in the past year, as the company moved to reduce costs, realign business priorities and brought it back to the growth path. But the progress in the March quarter suggests the recovery is a bit patchy.
The management expects gross margins to improve in FY20, helped by cost-rationalization measures and higher growth in key markets. It is confident of sustaining growth momentum in India and other emerging markets. India revenue grew 12% in FY19, despite the setback in the March quarter. Revenue from emerging markets, which includes Russia, jumped 28%. The company is benefiting from expansion into new geographies and from the expansion of its product portfolio in these countries.
While Dr Reddy’s post-results commentary sounds encouraging, what’s crucial for investors is an improvement in the US market. Its big-ticket products, such as Suboxone, are facing increasing competition in the US. This can limit the incremental revenue addition in FY20, warn analysts.
Likewise, two crucial products, Nuvaring and Copaxone, which the company is working on, offers significant growth opportunities in FY20. But much depends on the eventual volumes of these products. Indian drug firms’ progress on new product sales has been patchy of late. This, coupled with the subdued performance in March, may cause some caution among Dr Reddy’s investors."

Also, valuation provides limited upside at current levels,"" the report added.
It has shifted its estimates to a neutral stance with a target price for the stock at  ₹2,700.

27,2019-06-17,Reddy,"Karthik Reddy, managing partner at early-stage investor Blume Ventures, talks about India’s fundraising environment, competition in seed-stage investing‘We are beginning to realize that the only way to predictably drive exits is to build IPO-worthy companies’

Karthik Reddy, managing partner at early-stage investor Blume Ventures, talks about India’s fundraising environment, competition in seed-stage investing, and a worrying lack of exits. Edited excerpts of an interview:
As you approach your third fund’s final close, how have limited partners (LPs or investors in VC fund) conversations changed over the last 7-8 years?
Institutional LPs form the base of a long-term fund house and their ask has not changed over the last eight years—“Show us that the country’s growth curve or markets you are chasing are capable of building large outcomes"", “show us how exits will happen"" and “show us that you are building a team and culture that attracts best founders and builds the next layer of great venture spotters"". As the fund sizes grow, this ask only grows to be commensurate with the size of exit outcomes—in our case, this means needing to be 4x larger exit values from what we achieved in Fund I, at the least.
With more than a dozen dedicated funds and new entrants like Sequoia’s Surge, does the seed stage have the capacity to absorb so much capital?
Seed stage has been competitive for 2-3 years now, even before Sequoia’s Surge. I don’t think that alone changes anything. There are far more than just a dozen seed funds. Maybe 3-4 dozen if you add all the sectoral funds, family offices, spin-offs from larger funds etc. And they will all make 6 out of 10 bets that don’t scale to full potential (these are misconstrued as failures most times, which is not the case) - this hasn’t changed across six decades of venture capital. The key is to make investments with great founders and great market opportunities and both those sets are growing every year. We think the entrepreneur pipeline has never been stronger and there are enough great investments to make, but later stage capital and/or strategic buyers need to have similar alignment of scale in the ecosystem.
Will we see Blume exit a few companies this year? Is the lack of exits also worrying for the VC industry?
We consistently have a few exits every year. We don’t force them as much as the market does. We are beginning to realize that the only way to predictably drive exits is to build IPO-worthy companies, back such founders and build on that trajectory - the best exits will follow. Lack of exits? Yes! A resounding yes! The industry should be alarmed at not planning better for how to build “exitable"" companies or paths to exits. We are woefully inadequate (so far) on building IPO-worthy companies but I think there is a massive wave coming - I’m hoping to see 50 IPOs in tech of all sizes and shapes by 2025. Acquisitions continue, but not at the prices one expects since it’s a buyers’ market and it is in Indian markets’ DNA to squeeze the seller. To my surprise, it’s not one bit different across most of the startup industry since the large startups have yet to hit their own IPOs or massive positive cash flows, resulting in very conservative acquisition prices.
We haven’t seen any unicorns from Blume’s portfolio yet. Is that something you worry about? Do LPs ask about this?
There’s only one measure of Fund returns - IRR or Cash on Cash returns! Yes - As fund sizes grow, it’s imperative for a top decile fund to have “Unicorn"" outcomes in the portfolio. So, LPs understand and want this but they’re also aware that we could deliver a great Fund I without arguably needing Unicorns. Fund II is all of 3.5 years old - so, it feels premature to demand Unicorns, but we think some of our companies including Grey Orange, Unacademy, Servify, Turtlemint, can get to the $500 million to $1 billion level if not surpass the Unicorn mark comfortably. We are much happier building sustainable, path to profitability businesses, even if a year or two slower, than chasing Unicorn speed and valuation artificially.
Blume has made fairly broad based bets across consumer, saas, B2B, internet, etc. What would be some specific focus areas going forward?
The broad areas still hold. The India opportunity is still consumer or SMB-led growth. SMB's include micro-entrepreneurs. The post Jio India is hungry for growth enabled by what a smartphone can deliver - the next 500 million folks on the Indian net will shape the country in many ways for the next decade - financial services, education to jobs, smarter cheaper healthcare, media, travel/commute, and revolutionizing agri (even ahead of manufacturing) will be the areas we will try and find bold founders challenging India's status quo. Our early Fund III investments - Jai Kisan, an undisclosed EV play, TartanSense and LeverageEdu - are indicative of what's to come in this 2/3rds of our portfolio. Software and deep tech plays that are leveraging Indian tech talent to build solutions for global markets are the other 1/3rd of our portfolio. Going to overseas markets means that very large market sizes open up for these entrepreneurs - we think we are going to see Indian founders deliver more and more large wins. Agara Labs and Ethereal Machines are our first Fund III investments in this thesis area.
We also hear you are raising a follow-on fund along with the third main fund. Will this trend continue?
The follow-on fund is designed only for large winners out of Funds I and II. We didn't have adequate reserves with our small fund sizes and it would've been a shame to let go companies at $50-100 million valuations when we think they're growing to grow 10-20x to exit from here. We hope to get better at rightsizing funds in the future than keep raising opportunity funds. The $80-100 million attempt at Fund III is a step in that direction with a much more concentrated portfolio - we can now play as deep as $5 million per company across rounds, as and when we see the potential. Other seed funds may mimic the opportunity when they feel they're missing a big winner but this is a tactical phase that smoothens into larger fund sizes over the long-term.
Do you see the market to be overvalued? How much of a concern is valuation, from B2B to B2C? Has it increased in the last year or so?
In B2C, we see overvaluations when market winners have been decided. Too much of the future prospect seems built into the justification of valuation, especially if there's a parallel large winner in the Chinese market. Lofty B2C valuations at seed seem to justify another type of confidence - a scaled founder or leadership member from a large startup / unicorn has disproportionately better odds at succeeding to build even larger - this is somewhat true too. Its tough to compete in those kind of spaces/companies for small funds. In B2B, we see some inflation when the company starts crossing /trending into $10 million+ ARR but that's justified since all the hard work is behind - the investor is betting that a much more profitable $100 million ARR outcome is possible. Quality founders / quality performance / traction are beginning to understandably attract premiums on valuation.
Do you see the seed stage getting more competitive as bigger funds including Sequoia double down on the space?
Seed stage has been competitive for 2-3 years now, even before Sequoia's Surge. I don't think that alone changes anything. I'm a believer that all the best founders will work with funds that significantly increase their odds of building a great company. So, as a pre-A fund, the key is to demonstrate this repeatedly, with stellar performance - no different from what the LP asks for. If one can do that, it doesn't matter what the ""competition"" is - everyone can collaborate anyhow as co-investors - the key is in the hands of the best founders, on who they choose to pick as partners."
26,2019-06-21,Reddy,"Cumulative proceeds from the recent drug sales should be sufficient for the proprietary business’s R&D costs for the next two years, driving it towards self-sustainability, says EdelweissAs price erosion in the generic drug business began undermining profitability, pharmaceutical firms are pressed to control costs, particularly product development

Last week, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd sold two neurology drug brands for $110 million and certain royalty payments that will be received in future. In April, too, the company had entered into a similar agreement to sell a dermatology brand.
These divestments mark a crucial change in its strategy. Along with generics and active pharmaceutical ingredients, drug discovery used to be a focus area for the company. In the fiscal year 2016 annual report, chairman K. Satish Reddy had lauded the progress made by the firm in proprietary drugs, saying it would be one of its growth drivers.
Three years hence, the company is shrinking the drug discovery unit. As price erosion in the generic drug business began undermining profitability, pharmaceutical companies are pressed to control costs, particularly product development. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd is another case in point.
Apart from selling proprietary drugs, Dr. Reddy’s has also sold a couple of manufacturing units. Cumulative proceeds from the recent drug sales should be sufficient for the proprietary business’s research and development (R&D) costs for the next two years, driving it towards self-sustainability, says Edelweiss Securities Ltd. “In proprietary products, Dr. Reddy’s incurred ~ ₹400 crore losses in FY19, adjusted for the sale of three dermatology brands to Encore, which generated ~$30 million. The upfront cash flow of $110 million+$30 million from the sale of total five proprietary products should eventually finance R&D for two dermatology products and one neurology product, which Dr. Reddy’s expects to file in CY19,"" Edelweiss analysts said in a note.
This will help the company contain costs, furthering its profitability objective. But for investors tracking the Indian pharma industry trajectory, the whole episode is a cautionary tale.
Apart from cost pressures, the retraction from drug discovery also underscores the patchy progress of Indian firms in product development and commercialization. The experience with specialty drugs, in particular, demonstrates this. These drugs, which are priced higher and have limited competition, are expected to make up for revenue loss from the pressures in the generic drugs business (thereby yielding growth at the company level). But, as seen at Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Lupin Ltd in recent quarters, the ramp-up has been rather gradual, even as upfront costs continue to mount. Importantly, as one analyst points out, Indian companies lack the ideal specialty drug portfolio in a given category, because of which they don’t enjoy scale benefits. In this backdrop, Dr. Reddy’s decision to sell its branded products is seen as a strategically right move. “Given our long-standing concerns over the scalability of Dr. Reddy’s proprietary products strategy, and questionable product selection track record, we believe the divestitures are a correct step,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note."

HYDERABAD :
Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has announced a natural calamity fund of  ₹2,000 crore to mitigate drought conditions and tackle drinking water scarcity in the state. The announcement was made on the first day of the 14-day budget session of the Legislative Assembly, which began on Thursday.
Reddy and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) supremo and former AP chief minister Chandrababu Naidu also traded barbs, after the former accused Naidu of letting Telangana divert three thousand million cubic feet of water from the Godavari river through the Kaleswaram irrigation project.
The chief minister said  ₹1 crore each will be given to the 175 MLAs to identify and take measures to solve the drinking water scarcity.
“We also had to pay Rs.7 lakh compensation to the families of the farmers who committed suicides due to crop failure and debt. The YSR Rythu Bharosa scheme (through which each farmer will be given  ₹12,500 a year) will be implemented from 15 October and  ₹3,000 crore as Market Stabilization Fund will be created to check the price fluctuations of agriculture produce,"" Reddy said.
“We will face the situation and work for farmers’ welfare,"" Reddy said. The first day of the budget session also witnessed a lot of din when Naidu spoke, leading to heated discussions. Naidu’s TDP had won 23 out of the 175 seats in the Assembly election.
Later in the day, Naidu, while addressing a press conference, said accused Reddy and YSRCP of “political terrorism"".
The TDP supremo claimed that YSRCP members “wanted us to keep quiet and listen to what they said. He is creating political terrorism. Everyday TDP workers are being attacked in the state.""
The YSRCP-led government on Wednesday released a white paper on the state’s financial situation, in which it accused the previous TDP government of “mis-governance, financial mismanagement, complete neglect of investment in human and physical capital."" It claimed that the Naidu’s term as chief minister had “pushed the state into the dark ages that were never experienced in its history""."

Amid stifling competition in its biggest market, the US, Indian drug makers are scouting for partners in China, the world’s second largest drug market. A report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, released on Monday, estimates more Indian companies will enter the pharma industry in China through joint ventures.
Major pharmaceutical companies in India like Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Aurobindo Pharma Ltd, Cipla Ltd and Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd are looking at China as a big opportunity, making the market one of the focus areas for future growth.
“Indian companies are seeking partners that can make tangible business contributions, safeguard IP, ensure operational control and manage talent,"" said the report. Five joint ventures are already in place in China.
Dr Reddy’s has identified 70 products from its US portfolio that meet requirements and can obtain approval from Chinese authorities in coming years. The company is building a new plant, upgrading teams and building a pipeline for China.
Aurobindo Pharma is next in line to construct a facility in China. The company expects commercialisation of its products in the next 2-2.5 years. There is also a joint venture for inhaler products which will start operating soon.
Early in July, Cipla said it was setting up a joint venture with a Chinese pharmaceutical company to manufacture and sell drugs. They are in the process of setting up a facility in China. “The company is looking at both routes--manufacturing in India and exporting to China as well as looking at potential facilities in China--for oncology,"" the report further says.
In May, Sun Pharmaceutical said it had entered into licensing agreements with China Medical System Holdings to develop and commercialise drugs to treat psoriasis and dry eye in Greater China. According to the company, there is a strong interest in China for products which it has global rights. Alembic Pharmaceutical has also announced its interest in China.
According to the report by analyst Girish Bakhru, the recent renewed interest in China has stemmed from healthcare reforms in the country that aim to reduce drug prices and increase competition and the quality of generics.
“Given high fragmentation, complex distribution, high hospital channel share, language and cultural barriers, most Indian firms are opting for joint ventures in China. Efforts are visible across the board as companies put China as one of the focus areas for future growth,"" added the report by Bakhru.
In an announcement on Monday Strides Pharma Science Limited (Strides) said that its step down subsidiary Strides Pharma Global Pte, Singapore (SPG) has entered into a joint venture (JV) with Sun Moral International (HK) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group Ltd (Sihuan), one of China’s leading pharmaceutical companies.
According to the statement, the JV will fast track Strides’ entry into China. “The recent regulatory developments in China has enabled fast track approvals of differentiated high-quality generics approved in key regulated markets. Strides’ specialized basket of 140+ products qualifies for the program, and this JV will be able to leverage it in China,"" said the company.

21,2019-07-30,Reddy,"Excluding the  ₹346 crore non-recurring revenue, Dr Reddy’s earnings and net will be lowerVolume traction, revenue accretion from new products countered by price cuts in key molecules

Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd’s June quarter results, released after the market hours, lagged the Street’s estimates.
Revenue grew 3% year-on-year in the June quarter. Operating earnings and net profit jumped 41-45% from a year ago. But, excluding the  ₹346 crore non-recurring revenue the company’s received from a settlement, operating earnings and net profit will be lower from the year-ago levels. This is a significant variation to the double-digit earnings growth the Street was projecting.
On the positive side, Dr Reddy’s India business did well along expected lines. Domestic revenue grew 15% from a year ago. New product launches and growth in existing business helped the company. Europe also did well, clocking 19% revenue growth.
Comparatively, the 3% revenue expansion in North America was muted. But, as analysts say, the 9% sequential growth in revenue was decent, especially considering the rupee appreciation in the previous quarter.
Even so, revenue growth in the US counted for less. The market continues to see pricing pressure. The US is the biggest market for Dr Reddy’s, generating 42% of revenue.
According to the company’s, volume traction and revenue accretion from new products was partly countered by price erosion in some key molecules.
Add to this, the 16-21% fall in pharmaceuticals services and active ingredients and proprietary products revenues. Gross margins also fell markedly from a year ago. Divestment of certain proprietary products a year ago, and supply disruptions and the resultant fall in volumes, led to lower revenues at these divisions.
The company lowered the impact by moderating R&D (research and development) expenditure. R&D expenses at  ₹361 crore were not only lower than the average quarterly expenditure Dr Reddy’s had incurred in the recent past, but is less than the amount guided to by the management in the past, said an analyst.
Compared to the four percentage-point fall in the gross margin, operating profitability adjusted for non-recurring income dropped just 1.5 percentage points, show calculations by Edelweiss Securities Ltd.
As Edelweiss Securities points out, much of the softness in revenues and profitability can be explained by the fall in revenue in pharmaceuticals services and active ingredients division, which is faced with supply-chain issues. However, growth in its generic drugs business was decent, with global generics clocking 8% revenue growth from a year ago.
Even so, the weak performance on the operating earnings front is a drawback for the Dr Reddy’s stock, which trades at about 20 times FY20’s earnings estimate. Recovery in core earnings and resolution of the regulatory issues at the company’s manufacturing plants are the crucial points to watch out for."
19,2019-08-14,Reddy,"The Sun Pharma stock was the biggest loser among Nifty stocks on WednesdayWhile the firm’s June quarter results seemed good at first, sustainability is under question

MUMBAI :
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s shares gained 4% on Tuesday, after the company reported better-than-expected June quarter results. But the gains did not last long. On Wednesday, Sun Pharma was the biggest loser among Nifty stocks, falling 5.2%.
The 16% rise in revenues and 31% growth in profit exceeded Street estimates. But the expectations were soon tempered, as investors realized that the earnings momentum is not likely to sustain in the near term.
Growth in the US, a key market, was driven by a non-recurring short-term order. Besides, profits were aided by lower research and development (R&D) expenses, and higher other income. In fact, gross margins fell from the year-ago quarter, owing to an unfavourable product mix.
Sun Pharma expects R&D and tax expenditure to rise from hereon. To add to this, there is the promotional expenditure pertaining to specialty drugs. In this backdrop, analysts doubt if the 22.8% June quarter operating margin will be sustained in the near term. “Significant part of the beat was led by lower R&D and tax rate, which will normalize going forward,"" Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
Importantly, the earnings call indicated a delay in the launch of a specialty drug CEQUA (cyclosporine ophthalmic solution). The company now expects to launch the drug only in the next quarter against the earlier expectation of a launch in Q2.
The news came to light amid reports that another large pharmaceutical firm, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, may also see a delay in launch of one of its key drugs (NuvaRing) in the US market. The reports sent the shares of Dr Reddy’s lower as well, pulling down the Nifty Pharma index.
Even so, the sharp fall in these companies’ share prices is surprising. Dr Reddy’s had already alluded to the possible delay in the NuvaRing launch in its recent earnings call. Further complexities of the specialty drug business mean delays will not be uncommon.
Perhaps the challenges are unnerving investors. With the base generic drug business continuing to face price pressures, hopes are pinned on the limited competition drugs to drive growth. With the scale-up and launches not progressing as per plan, investors are getting wary. “Sun Pharma is increasingly reliant on specialty portfolio to deliver growth in US as base business commentary remains lackluster at best. In the specialty basket, key products such as Ilumya are tasked with expanding market share in what is a difficult and crowded market. Management expects to launch Cequa in Q3 FY20 though associated costs are fully reflected in Q1 expenses; moreover, it believes Cequa to be an attractive opportunity even if Restatis (a similar drug in the market) is genericized,"" Yes Securities Institutional Equities said in a note"

Note that in end-August, the shares had fallen about 15% from their highs in May. The recent improvement in sentiment, therefore, is welcome.
The main reason is the swelling pipeline of drug launches in the US. In FY19, Dr Reddy’s launched 24 new drug applications in the US, up from 14 in FY18. The management has lined up around 30 new launches for FY20. Besides, relaunching some of its older drugs in the US is on the cards. This would provide the requisite fillip to its North American business.
“DRL has various drugs (Kuvan, Ciprodex, Remodulin), a US$15 mn-35 mn opportunity, which should help its base US sales continue growing,"" said analysts at Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in a note to clients.
This follows the disappointing delay in the launch of two of its high-value products, Copaxone and NuvaRing. In fact, it received a Complete Response Letter from the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for NuvaRing, which means that the product is not yet ready for approval. Further, clarifications regarding the product could take over a year.
Despite the setback, though, analysts said some of the company’s other launches may counter the delay as they, too, seem to have substantial revenue potential. “The overall US pipeline for DRL is still very strong (104 pending ANDAs). Even without Copaxone and NuvaRing, DRL could hit sales of $1 billion by FY22 in the US, vs. US$865 mn in FY19,"" said the Credit Suisse report.
Besides, this will reduce its dependence on a few drugs in the US market, said analysts. “In addition, from the perspective of future launches, we believe that the consensus view of Dr Reddy’s growth depending on just a few products is unjustified,"" said analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in a note to clients.
Note, though, that there has been a price erosion in the US generics market in most segments in FY19. Hence, even as some of the new launches have limited competition, revenue potential could be at risk if price erosion is significant.
Note further that any delay in launches or inspection by US FDA must be tracked."

Hyderabad: After launching an input subsidy scheme for farmers, the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP)-run Andhra Pradesh government on Friday announced that it will give a cash incentive of  ₹10,000 to car and auto drivers every year in the state. The ‘YSR Vahana Mitra’ scheme will be launched on 4 October and self-employed auto and taxi drivers will be eligible under it.
The decision to start the scheme was based on chief minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s election promise during his 3,600 kilometre ‘Pada Yatra’ (walkathon) he undertook before coming to power, as part of election campaign for the 2019 state (and Lok Sabha) polls. “The motto of ‘YSR Vahana Mitra’ is that the amount could be useful for the drivers to repair, vehicle fitness, insurance expenses,"" said a press release from Reddy’s office.
It added that the AP Transport department has sent ‘YSR Vaahana Mitra’ applications to all the district collectors and that the verification process for the same will be completed by 30 September. So far, the state government has received over 1.75 lakh applications, out of which a little over 93,000 have been verified. The applications have been received online and offline to make the process easy for the applicants, stated the release.
Prior to this, the YSRCP government, after coming to power this year, launched the ‘Rythu Bharosa’ input subsidy scheme for farmers under which the beneficiaries will get  ₹12,500 a year. The scheme was launched after scrapping the previously launched (under the previous Telugu Desam Party) ‘Annadata Sukhibhava’ input subsidy programme.
On the same day, a study report by an expert committee also submitted a report to Reddy, which said that using electrical vehicles (EVs) will be beneficial to the State Road Transport Corporation (APRTC) and it will be environmental friendly apart from saving fuel costs. The committee recommended that the state government introduce a large number of EVs in the corporation as well.
“By taking loans at lower rates of interest from national and international organizations, electric vehicles can be brought in APRTC as soon as possible so that fuel can be saved,"" a press from the state government quoted the committee on Thursday. The report by the committee also suggested to use solar power instead of wind power."

Amaravati: The Andhra Pradesh government on Monday appointed over 1.26 lakh employees, claimed to be the first of its kind in the country in terms of numbers in a single recruitment drive, under a new governance initiative of Village and Ward Secretariats, being launched on October 2.
""This should be written in golden letters in the country's history. Never before were these many permanent government jobs created in one go anywhere in the country and employees recruited in a record time of just two months,"" Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy said. While over 21 lakh candidates applied for various posts in these Secretariats, that would deliver about 500 public services, a total of 19.50 lakh appeared for the written examinations from September 1 to 8.
Of the 1,98,164 candidates qualified in these examinations, 1,26,728 have been given jobs, including 31,640 in urban areas. The Chief Minister initiated the process of handing over appointment letters to the qualified candidates at a function in Vijayawada on Monday. The Village and Ward Secretariats would become fully functional across the state from December first week, he announced on the occasion.
Each Secretariat would have 10-12 employees related to departments like panchayat raj and rural development, revenue, medical and health, animal husbandry, power, agriculture and social welfare in rural areas and municipal services in urban areas. Besides, there would be a woman police and women and child welfare assistant in each Secretariat to take care of women protection and counselling. About 500 public services will be delivered through these Secretariats with the help of village and ward volunteers.
We have already appointed over 2.8 lakh village and ward volunteers for this purpose, Jagan said. He stressed on ensuring corruption-free delivery of government services and exhorted the newly-recruited staffers to treat this not merely as a job but a service. He said a social audit would be conducted periodically to ensure transparency and accountability and bring in credibility to the system.
The Chief Minister announced on the occasion that henceforth, recruitment examinations would be conducted every year from January 1 to 31 to fill up vacant government posts in different departments. In all, 11,158 Village Secretariats and 3,786 Ward Secretariats (in urban areas) are proposed to be opened across the state.

13,2019-10-05,Reddy,"The regulator has also classified the adverse observations made in a Form 483 as Voluntary Action InitiatedThis indicates that the observations do not require immediate redressal

New Delhi: The US Food and Drug Administration has issued an establishment inspection report to Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd’s bulk drug manufacturing plant 2 at Bollaram near Hyderabad, indicating closure of the audit done in July, the company said in an exchange filing today.
The regulator has also classified the adverse observations made in a Form 483 as Voluntary Action Initiated, which indicates that the observations do not require immediate redressal.
However, the company does have to address the issues as the US FDA could classify similar observations that come up in future inspections as “official action indicated"", which makes it mandatory for companies to undertake remedial measures immediately.
The US FDA had inspected the active pharmaceutical manufacturing (API) manufacturing plant in July, after which it had issued five observations. One of the observations was that the company did not actively investigate complaints by customers on test results which were out of specifications from what was in place for the product. A copy of the Form 483 was reviewed by Mint.
Active pharmaceutical ingredients, or bulk drugs, are key raw materials for drug formulations.
The regulator in its Form 483 also pointed out that the company did not have preventive controls for its electronic inventory and warehousing management systems were not effectively established.
The active ingredients and custom pharmaceutical services segment contributed around 15% to the Hyderabad-based drug maker’s consolidated net revenue of Rs. 38.4 billion in the June quarter. Most pharmaceutical companies do not disclose the revenue break-up from their various plants."
12,2019-10-06,Reddy,"Analysts are factoring in a y-o-y revenue growth of about 11.5% in the Sep quarter, the slowest in the past four quartersIn the first quarter (Q1), almost all domestic pharma companies registered negative growth rates in their US businesses

All is not well with pharma companies in the overseas markets, particularly the US. This is expected to reflect in lower sequential growth rates in the second quarter (Q2) of FY20.
In the first quarter (Q1), almost all domestic pharma companies registered negative growth rates in their US businesses. Competition in some of the base drugs launched earlier has been intensifying. As a result, sales volume growth has been slow.
Additionally, lack of new launches in the US market could further drag down revenue growth. “US business should be weak for almost all companies with a sharp dip in approvals in Q2, compliance issues, lack of meaningful launches and competition in base portfolios,"" said analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd in a recent report to clients.
Domestic markets, however, could lend a helping hand to overall growth rates. In Q1 FY20, most companies had reported domestic growth rates of more than 10%, barring Cipla Ltd and Cadila Healthcare Ltd, which posted single-digit growth.
Hence, domestic growth rate is expected to remain strong for most pharma companies, particularly those in the respiratory ailments segment that have an edge over others.
“With respect to domestic markets, the growth is likely to favour companies with a larger presence in acute therapy as a heavy monsoon together with flooding situation has led to a surge in occurrence of infectious diseases. Emerging markets (EM) growth has been affected by adverse pricing regulations and the impact should be seen in subsequent quarters, too,"" said a recent report by Nirmal Bang Securities Pvt. Ltd.
Operating margin growth may also remain weak. A key contribution to margin growth was to come from speciality products. However, in Q2 FY20, the ramp-up in speciality product sales has been less than desired for most pharma companies. Besides, the research and development (R&D) expense is likely to increase this quarter, after companies cut back spending on R&D in Q1.
Hence, analysts expect Ebitda margin growth in Q2 to weaken. In fact, analysts are factoring in revenue growth of just about 11.5% year-on-year in the September quarter, which is the slowest in the last four quarters, while Ebitda growth is expected to be just 7.8% year-on-year. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.
Select domestic pharma companies, such as Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, could buck the trend due to their strong domestic portfolios and an increase in new launches this season. But for most other pharma firms, investors may not have much to look forward to."
11,2019-10-23,Reddy,"The Hyderabad-based drug maker does not sell ranitidine in IndiaDr Reddy’s had initiated a voluntary recall of the medicine at the retail level

New Delhi: Dr Reddy’s Laboratories on Wednesday confirmed it has recalled all ranitidine tablets from retail counters in the US due to the presence of the carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) above levels established by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The Hyderabad-based drug maker does not sell ranitidine in India.
Dr Reddy’s had initiated a voluntary recall of the medicine at the retail level for over-the-counter products and at the consumer level for prescription products on 1 October after the US FDA had issued a caution note alerting patients and health care professionals about the impurity in certain samples of ranitidine, the company said in an exchange filing.
While NDMA is a known environmental contaminant found in water and foods, it is also classified as a probable cancer-causing substance for humans based on results from laboratory tests.
On 13 September, the US Food and Drug Administration had issued a safety alert citing traces of NDMA in ranitidine.
Following the US regulator’s safety alert, the Drug Controller General of India also issued a directive to all state regulators asking them to get manufacturers to test anti-acidity drug ranitidine for the impurity.
On 25 September, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd (GSK) suspended the distribution and supply of ranitidine hydrochloride products to all markets, including India, as a precautionary measure after regulatory authorities detected the carcinogen in its products.
The move by GSK followed suspension of the certificate of suitability of its bulk drug supplier Saraca Laboratories Ltd by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM).
In India, GSK Pharma manufactures the drug under Zinetac. Other brands are JB Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Ltd’s Rantac, Sun Pharmaceuticals Ltd's Histac, Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd's Ranitin, Ajanta Pharma Ltd's Pepitran."

6,2019-11-02,Reddy,"FDA said levels of the probable carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine found in ranitidine 'are similar to the levels you would expect to be exposed to if you ate common foods like grilled or smoked meats' Dr Reddy’s Laboratories had also initiated a voluntary recall of the medicine at the retail level in US on 1 Oct

New Delhi: The US Food and Drug Administration late Friday downplayed the risk associated with popular antacid medicine ranitidine, saying that the carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is not formed after ingestion of the drug and that levels of the contaminant in most samples were similar to those found in common foods.
“The agency has tested numerous ranitidine products on the market over the past few months, and today we’re releasing a summary of the results we have to date. Through our testing so far, we have found levels of NDMA in ranitidine that are similar to the levels you would expect to be exposed to if you ate common foods like grilled or smoked meats,"" Janet Woodcock, director at the regulator’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.
However, Woodcock also pointed out that while most samples had NDMA at levels “much lower"" than what third-party scientists first claimed, its presence in some samples did exceed acceptable amount.
The US FDA considers 96 nanograms per day, or 0.32 parts per million, as the acceptable limit for ranitidine, and has asked pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily recall ranitidine products if the contaminant breaches the limit in their products.
The US regulator has also asked manufacturers of another antacid nizatidine, popularly sold under the brand Axid, to test their products for presence of NDMA and initiate a voluntarily recall if they find the carcinogen above acceptable daily intake level. Nizatadine is is chemically similar to ranitidine.
The regulator is still working with manufacturers to investigate the true source of NDMA and to understand the root cause of the low levels of NDMA present in the drugs, it said.
Meanwhile, it has advised doctors and patients to consider using other products instead of rantidine, like Pepcid, Tagamet, Nexium, Prevacid and Prilosec, and their generics. Tests of these products have shown show no NDMA impurities.
The US FDA had last month issued a safety alert citing traces of NDMA, a known carcinogen, in ranitidine.
Following the US regulator’s safety alert, the Drug Controller General of India also issued a directive to all state regulators asking them to get manufacturers to test anti-acidity drug ranitidine for the impurity. Many other drug regulators world over have also issued similar advisories and are conducting tests.
Dr Reddy’s Laboratories had also initiated a voluntary recall of the medicine at the retail level in the US on 1 October after the US FDA’s caution note.
On 25 September, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd suspended the distribution and supply of ranitidine hydrochloride products to all markets, including India, as a precautionary measure after regulatory authorities detected the carcinogen in its products.
The move by GSK came after the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM) suspended the certificate of suitability of its bulk drug supplier Saraca Laboratories Ltd.
In India, GSK Pharma manufactures the drug under Zinetac. Other brands are JB Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Ltd’s Rantac, Sun Pharmaceuticals Ltd's Histac, Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd's Ranitin, Ajanta Pharma Ltd's Pepitran. Dr Reddy’s does not sell rantidine products in India."
5,2019-11-04,Reddy,"Revenues include receipts towards licence fee for selling territory rights for two brandsGenerics revenue growth in the US market has been flat y-o-y due to supply disruption

Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd’s better-than-estimated second-quarter earnings have not generated much buzz. That’s because profit got a boost from a one-off income from the sale of rights to two of its products. Besides, generic pricing pressures continue in the US in certain pockets, even though that could be more acute for newer products. Shares of Dr Reddy’s fell 1.02% on Friday post the earnings announcement.
Revenue growth in its biggest market, the US, was flat, hurt by the recall of ranitidine, used to treat heartburn, and some disruption in the supply chain. Besides, price erosion affected some of its products, which, combined with lower volume, led to about a 13% decline in revenue growth quarter-on-quarter. This shows that the North American market is still price-sensitive and further pricing pressures cannot be ruled out. However, the management in a post-earnings conference call has said that the supply disruption has been addressed.
Additionally, Dr Reddy’s launched eight drugs in the American market, which could raise its revenue growth in coming quarters.
Also, it has a pipeline of about 99 generics filings with the US Food and Drug Administration that are awaiting approval from the regulator. The company reckons it could launch first versions in about 31 drug filings, providing it exclusive access to the market for a limited period.
However, important regions of India and the rest of the world are delivering better growth rates, which is a good sign. Generic sales were higher in India and the rest of the world by about 9-10% year on year. This is considered a decent growth rate as margins are higher in these markets.
Proprietary product revenues, of course, got a major boost due to receipts of about  ₹723 crore as licence fee for selling the rights to two of its brands. Dr Reddy’s has incurred about  ₹32.8 crore towards these products.
Dr Reddy’s has embarked on paring costs given the pricing pressures in the US. This quarter research and development expense was trimmed to about 7.6% of revenue, compared to about 10.8% for the year-ago period. This could have a bearing on its specialty-products pipeline as well as its proprietary products.
Ebitda margin in Q2 widened to 29.9% from 22.8% in the year-ago quarter. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. In the post-earnings conference call, the management clarified that various cost control measures are bringing the margins closer to the benchmark.
Profit raced by about 117%, y-o-y, though this may not sustain given the one-offs. Even so, analysts raised earnings per share estimates to about  ₹130, up about 15% in FY20 due to lower tax and R&D spends. This appears fair valuation, although, pricing recovery in the US market remains a key variable. Besides, progress on expansion in other markets also must be watched."

New Delhi: Strides Pharma Science Ltd on Friday announced the relaunch of popular antacid ranitidine for the US market with immediate effect after the presence of the carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was found within acceptable limits.
“Strides’ ranitidine tablets 300 mg were within the acceptable limits for NDMA of 96 nanograms per day or 0.32 ppm (parts per million). Strides has now completed comprehensive testing of several of its batches available in market and in stock meeting the limits prescribed by the USFDA,"" the company said in a release.
Strides Pharma has US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for ranitidine tablets of strength 150 mg and 300 mg, which according to market research firm IQVIA’s data, has a market of about $ 76 million, the company said.
At 2pm, shares of Strides Pharma traded 1.3% higher at Rs403.55 on the BSE.
The company had halted sales of the antacid in the US in September following a safety alert by the US regulator, which cited traces of NDMA, a known carcinogen, in the product.
Following the US regulator’s safety alert, the Drug Controller General of India also issued a directive to all state regulators asking them to get manufacturers to test anti-acidity drug ranitidine for the impurity. Many other drug regulators world over have also issued similar advisories and are conducting tests.
Dr Reddy’s Laboratories had also initiated a voluntary recall of the medicine at the retail level in the US on 1 October after the US FDA’s caution note.
On 25 September, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd suspended the distribution and supply of ranitidine hydrochloride products to all markets, including India, as a precautionary measure after regulatory authorities detected the carcinogen in its products.
However, last week, the US regulator downplayed the risk associated with popular antacid medicine ranitidine, saying that levels of NDMA in most samples, after numerous tests, were found to be similar to those in common foods.
“The agency has tested numerous ranitidine products on the market over the past few months, and today we’re releasing a summary of the results we have to date. Through our testing so far, we have found levels of NDMA in ranitidine that are similar to the levels you would expect to be exposed to if you ate common foods like grilled or smoked meats,"" Janet Woodcock, director at the regulator’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, had said in a statement."

NEW DELHI :
Dr Reddy’s Laboratories entered the nutrition segment in India with the launch of ‘Celevida’ drink, targeted at diabetics to help them manage blood sugar levels.
“We are pleased to mark our foray into the nutrition segment with Celevida, which will address unmet nutrition needs of the patients in India. Through this nutrition drink, we continue to work towards making a positive impact on people’s health and quality of life,"" M.V. Ramana, Dr. Reddy’s chief executive officer for branded markets (India and Emerging Markets), was quoted as saying in a release on Thursday.
Made from soy, ragi and gram flours, Celevida is formulated to have high protein and fibre, and slow-digesting carbohydrates, which will support in management of postprandial blood glucose response and satiety of patients, the company said in an exchange filing.
The product is also fortified with 20 vitamins and minerals, and ingredients such as folate, iron, magnesium, pantothenic acid, riboflavin, vitamin B12, vitamin B6 and vitamin C that would help manage fatigue in patients, the company said.
Celevida will be available in two flavors -- Kesar Elachi and Chocolate -- and has been taste tested with over 300 diabetics and pre-diabetics.
India has around 73 million diabetics, and another 80 million in pre-diabetes population, and the country is estimated to have the world’s largest diabetes population by 2035, the company said quoting data from International Diabetes Federation, an umbrella organization of over 230 national diabetes associations."
2,2019-11-21,Reddy,"Earlier this month, the US FDA downplayed the risk associated with ranitidineThe safety alert triggered considerable chaos in the pharmaceutical sector worldwide﻿

New Delhi: India will continue testing for known carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in popular antacid ranitidine, two senior officials of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) said, even as the US regulator, which had flagged the issue first, has downplayed the risk.
“The venom that the information (of US FDA) was carrying of a public danger, that is removed now. But still it will be tested,"" one of the two people cited above said on condition of anonymity.
Earlier this month, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) downplayed the risk associated with ranitidine, saying that levels of the carcinogen in most ranitidine samples were similar to those found in common food items. The regulator, though, asked pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily recall ranitidine products if the contaminant breaches the limit in their products. The US FDA considers 96 nanograms per day, or 0.32 parts per million, as the acceptable limit for ranitidine.
The statement followed a safety warning by the US regulator in September, citing traces of NDMA, a known carcinogen, in ranitidine.
Following the US regulator’s safety alert, the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) V.G. Somani, head of CDSCO, had also issued a directive to all state regulators asking them to get manufacturers to test anti-acidity drug ranitidine for the impurity. Many other drug regulators the world over also issued similar advisories and are conducting tests.
“It is unlikely that drug manufacturers will reintroduce ranitidine products as of now. They would look at how regulators globally would react on the product. While the ranitidine market has been hit, there are substitute for antacids,"" Surajit Pal, an analyst with Prabhudas Lilladher, said.
The safety alert triggered considerable chaos in the pharmaceutical sector worldwide, with many companies withdrawing sale of the medicine.
On 25 September, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd suspended the distribution and supply of ranitidine hydrochloride products to all markets, including India, as a precautionary measure. The move by GSK came after the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM) suspended the certificate of suitability of its bulk drug supplier Saraca Laboratories Ltd.
Somani had in his letter sought reports from manufacturers, including GSK, on their internal tests in September, but two months later, the CDSCO continues to await the results, the second official said. “The test is very, very expensive. But we will still test the samples to make sure the drug is safe.""
Dr Reddy’s Laboratories had also initiated a voluntary recall of the medicine in the US on 1 October after the US FDA’s caution note. Dr Reddy’s does not sell ranitidine products in India.
In India, GSK Pharma manufactures the drug under the Zinetac brand, the second-largest brand for the product. The most popular brand of ranitidine in India is Cadila Pharmaceuticals’ Aciloc.
GSK’s suspension of ranitidine sales aided sales of Cadila Pharmaceuticals’ Aciloc in October, data from market research firm AIOCD-AWACS shows. In October, the first full month of suspension of supply, ranitidine sales of GSK dropped to just  ₹6 crore from  ₹18 crore in August, the data showed. For September, the sales had slipped to  ₹15 crore.
On the other hand, Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd clocked a 16% rise during the same period to  ₹24.8 crore in October, the data showed."
1,2019-12-15,Reddy,"A competitor has started sales of a limited competition drug that Dr Reddy’s is developingAs a result, Amneal gets a lead in the US market, reducing the opportunity for Dr Reddy’s

MUMBAI :
Shares of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd saw the biggest fall in four months on Friday after it became known that a competitor had started selling a limited competition drug it has been developing. Amneal Pharmaceuticals Inc. received the approval to launch the first generic version of NuvaRing in the US.
NuvaRing has a market size of $800 million and is a hormonal birth control drug for women.
Amneal’s earlier-than-expected launch led to a 3% drop in Dr Reddy’s shares, making it the biggest loser among Nifty stocks.
Unlike pure generics, limited competition drugs have fewer sellers, thereby providing better realizations.
The launch of NuvaRing by Dr Reddy’s was delayed after the US regulator asked for data pertaining to the drug. Even then, the prospects from this drug remained high for Dr Reddy’s as potential competitors also received similar queries from the US drug regulator, thereby delaying the product for most, according to a recent note by SBICAP Securities Ltd.
But the latest approval and the drug launch by Amneal alters the scenario. It diminishes the market opportunity for Dr Reddy’s. “It gives Amneal a 12 months-plus head start to gain market share. With Teva expecting its launch in 2020, Dr Reddy’s could be the third entrant (vs expectation of similar launch as peers), which could limit the opportunity and market share for Dr Reddy’s,"" Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
Of course, the narrative at Dr Reddy’s after the top management change has been one of de-risking the company from the US and product development specific to that market. It realigned itself, stepping up focus on India, China and other emerging markets. In the process, it sold certain non-core assets and rationalized expenses, including research and development spend. This change of priority has enthused investors—the stock is still up 8% from a year ago—and profitability and return metrics have started showing benefits.
According to Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd, as a base case (without product-specific upsides), Dr Reddy’s is aiming for operating profit margin and return on capital employed (RoCE) of 25%. In FY19, RoCE stood at 14.7%.
Much of the transformational benefits were presumed on the company’s gains in India, China and other emerging markets. But Dr Reddy’s is yet to gain critical scale in these markets. For instance, it is yet to break into the Top 10 club in the domestic formulation market. China, which is seen to be the next big opportunity, is still at the investment phase.
As a consequence, the US remains central to the company’s fortunes, at least in the near term. With potential new drugs facing competition, investors are worried. “Product concentration for Dr Reddy’s is high, with 20% of FY22E EPS contributed by three products for which the risks of competition and approval delays are high as the Amneal NuvaRing approval highlights,"" added analysts at Jefferies India. EPS is earnings per share."
0,2019-12-30,Reddy,"Dr Reddy’s sodium nitroprusside injection is the therapeutic generic equivalent of nitropress injectionThe nitropress brand and generics sold approximately $8 million MAT in the US in the year ending October 2019

New Delhi: Pharmaceutical major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories on Monday announced the launch of sodium nitroprusside injection, primarily used for immediate control of high blood pressure, after it received US Food and Drug Administration’s approval, the company said in a regulatory filing.
Dr Reddy’s sodium nitroprusside injection, 50 mg/2 ml (25 mg/ml) single-dose vial, is the therapeutic generic equivalent of nitropress (sodium nitroprusside) injection, 50 mg/2ml vial. The injection is available in single-dose 50 mg/2 ml (25 mg/ml) vials, the company said.
The nitropress brand and generics sold approximately $8 million MAT in the US in the year ending October 2019, according to a report by IQVIA Health. Dr. Reddy's sodium nitroprusside injection is available in single-dose 50 mg/2 ml (25 mg/ml) vials.
Sodium nitroprusside injection cannot be directly used and the solution needs to be further diluted in sterile 5% dextrose injection before infusion into a patient’s body. The drug can cause precipitous decreases in blood pressure, which can lead to irreversible ischemic injuries or death, if patients are not properly monitored, the drug maker said in its filing.
“Except when used briefly or at low (< 2 mcg/kg/min) infusion rates, sodium nitroprusside gives rise to important quantities of cyanide ion, which can reach toxic, potentially lethal levels. The usual dose rate is 0.5 to1.0 mcg/kg/min, but infusion at the maximum dose rate should never last more than 10 minutes,"" the pharmaceutical company said.
Even after 10 minutes of infusion at the maximum rate, if blood pressure is not under control, then administration of sodium nitroprusside should be terminated immediately, the company said.
“Although acid-base balance and venous oxygen concentration should be monitored and may indicate cyanide toxicity, these laboratory tests provide imperfect guidance,"" it said.
Shares of Dr Reddy’ closed negative at  ₹2,883 on the BSE today."
