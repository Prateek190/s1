79,2018-01-22,IOC,"Indian Oil Corp. has laid out an eight-fold leadership competency framework, specifying the kind of competencies that it values and seeks in its leaders

State-owned refiner Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC), which operates 11 of India’s 23 refineries, is among the largest employers in the country with over 33,000 employees and serves consumers across the country with an elaborate ecosystem of dealers, distributors and transporters, making people at the core of its assets. 
State-owned refiner Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC), which operates 11 of India’s 23 refineries, is among the largest employers in the country with over 33,000 employees and serves consumers across the country with an elaborate ecosystem of dealers, distributors and transporters, making people at the core of its assets.
That makes ensuring their safety at refineries, upgrade of skill, motivation and rewarding a core function for the country’s largest refiner. The complexity of operations, including supply of fuel at remote areas and during natural calamities, operation of a complex network of road and pipeline transportation infrastructure, massive capacity expansion projects and diversification into new businesses in allied sectors which have a public policy dimension such as revamping sick fertilizer companies make management of workforce a key task for the oil giant. 
Deployment of workforce at optimum efficiency becomes a key guiding principle in the refinery business which thrives on very low margins and massive volumes.
Chairman Sanjiv Singh, who took over the leadership of the company on 1 June 2017, highlighted the importance of having a positive work environment in his first message to shareholders, saying it was key to make IOC future-ready at a time energy sector’s future is facing disruptive trends.
“With a workforce encompassing varied age groups and expertise, IOC represents a perfect blend of youth and experience. This creates an environment highly conducive to innovative ideas, technologies, high-quality products and services, and safe and efficient operations while enhancing stakeholder value on a sustained basis,"" said Singh. 
The company has laid out an eight-fold leadership competency framework, specifying the kind of competencies that the organisation values and which it seeks in its leaders and budding leaders. To groom leaders, IOC introduced the project “Saksham"" in 2015 with the help of leading business schools in the country. The programme is constantly being revised to expand its scope. According to a company official, who asked not to be named, IOC believes in developing leaders from within. The idea is to offer a rewarding career to those joining the company, not merely employment.
IOC is taking the lead in India’s shift to a more environment friendly mix of fuels while ensuring energy security through affordable conventional fuels. In a recent interview, Singh said that IOC was making a strategic shift to a less carbon-intensive future by getting into clean energy and related infrastructure, while keeping refinery expansion plans flexible for course correction.
Most of the townships located at its refinery locations are self-sufficient with all amenities including medical facilities, schools and recreation centres as per information given by the company in its annual report for 2016-17. IOC seeks to ensure that takes meticulous care in taking affirmative action in empowering those with disabilities."

Guwahati: Indian Oil Corporation will invest Rs3,400 crore in Assam over the next five years to expand its operations by setting up new units as well as upgrading the existing ones, a senior IOC official said on Saturday. 
Guwahati: Indian Oil Corporation will invest Rs3,400 crore in Assam over the next five years to expand its operations by setting up new units as well as upgrading the existing ones, a senior IOC official said on Saturday.
The company will sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Assam Government to this effect at the two-day ‘Advantage Assam - Global Investors Summit 2018’, beginning here today, the official said.
“We are signing an MoU with the state government that will empower us to invest Rs3,400 crore in Assam over the next five years. This will be for various projects across the state,"" Indian Oil Corporation, executive director (IndianOil-AOD), Dipankar Ray told PTI at the Summit.
The company’s Board has already approved the funding and it may increase in future depending upon the progress of the work, he said.
“The major chunk of this will go for expansion of our refinery capacities. We are going to add new units and also upgrade the existing ones to improve the fuel quality and BS-VI compliant fuel will be required as per norms,"" Ray said.
The company will also enhance the capacities of its LPG bottling plants at North Guwahati, Silchar and Mirza, he added.
“The petroleum storage capacities are also being enhanced at various places like Barak valley and Digboi. In Barak valley, we are setting up a new depot, which will be well-connected by rail network and will have provision for pipeline connectivity as well,"" Ray informed.
Besides, IOC’s existing depots at Betkuchi in Guwahati, Lumding and Missamari will see capacity expansion under this project, he added.
“Some projects under this MoU have already started, while some will begin soon. These projects will also help create jobs, mostly in contract through indirect route,"" Ray said."
77,2018-03-31,IOC,"Indian Oil Corp (IOC) says it plans to invest about Rs1.43 trillion to nearly double its oil refining capacity to 150 million tonnes and boost petrochemical production by 2030

New Delhi: India’s biggest oil firm IOC on Saturday said it plans to invest about Rs1.43 trillion to nearly double its oil refining capacity to 150 million tonnes and boost petrochemical production by 2030. 
New Delhi: India’s biggest oil firm IOC on Saturday said it plans to invest about Rs1.43 trillion to nearly double its oil refining capacity to 150 million tonnes and boost petrochemical production by 2030.
While Indian Oil Corp (IOC) is expanding refining capacity to meet fuel demand, which is expected to nearly double by 2040, it does not want to remain “a refining company alone and is thus venturing into petrochemicals and alternative fuels as well,"" company’s director (Refineries) B.V. Rama Gopal told reporters in New Delhi.
The company currently owns and operates 11 out of the country’s 23 refineries. Its refineries have a total capacity of 80.7 million tonnes per annum.
IOC is investing Rs16,628 crore in upgrading its refineries to produce Euro-VI emission norm compliant petrol and diesel as against Euro-IV fuel being produced now. This investment cycle would be completed by 2020, he said.
Besides, the company is investing Rs15,600 crore in expansion of petrochemical projects and another Rs74,600 crore in raising the capacity of its existing refineries.
He said another Rs36,500 crore worth of projects are in pipeline but haven’t been approved by the company board as yet. These include expansion of its recently-commissioned 15-MTPA Paradip refinery in Odisha to 18 MTPA as also the expansion of Bongaigaon unit.
India’s current refining capacity of 247.6 MTPA exceeds consumption but with demand growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 3.5-4%, it will need to add more capacity to meet the rising fuel needs.
While the Energy Information Agency of US projects India’s demand to reach 434 MT by 2040 from 194 MT currently, IEA puts the number between 450 and 492 MT. IOC plans to raise the capacity of its Panipat refinery in Haryana to 25 MTPA from current 15 MTPA, while Koyali refinery in Gujarat would be expanded to 18 MTPA from 13.7 MTPA.
While 3 MT will be added in IOC’s Barauni refinery in Bihar, a 1.2-MTPA capacity addition is planned for Uttar Pradesh’s Mathura refinery to take its capacity to 9.2 MTPA.
The official said IOC is also looking at adding a 9 MTPA capacity to its subsidiary Chennai Petroleum (CPCL). He said IOC, BPCL, and HPCL are together setting up a new 60 MPTA refinery on the west coast in Maharashtra.
Talking of growth drivers, he said IOC is setting up a new unit at its Panipat refinery to manufacture ethanol from refinery off-gases. Ethanol so produced will be used for blending in petrol. India is targeting blending of up to 10% ethanol in petrol to cut reliance on imports to meet oil needs. Also, a plant to convert agri-stubble into ethanol is being set up.
On alternate energy plans, he said the company plans to take solar power generation capacity to 260 MW by 2020 from current 188 MW."
76,2018-04-27,IOC,"Indian Oil Corp said its board has approved to set up a Rs4,221 crore Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit at Paradip in Odisha

New Delhi: State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) on Friday said its board has approved a Rs4,221 crore project to set up a petrochem project at Paradip in Odisha. 
New Delhi: State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) on Friday said its board has approved a Rs4,221 crore project to set up a petrochem project at Paradip in Odisha.
The board, at its meeting yesterday, “accorded approval for implementation of 357 kilo tons per annum Ethylene Glycol Project alongwith associated facilities at Paradip based on off-gas of the Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit at an estimated cost of  ₹ 4,221 crore,"" the company said in a regulatory filing.
IOC would use by-products generated from refining crude oil at its 15 million tonnes a year refinery at Paradip to manufacture Ethylene Glycol.
In the plastics industry, ethylene glycol is important precursor to polyester fibres and resins. Polyethylene terephthalate, used to make plastic bottles for soft drinks, is prepared from ethylene glycol.
IOC said the major application of Ethylene Glycol is in manufacture of polyester fibre, bottle grade chips and polyester grade chips.
“The project would help in meeting the growing domestic demand of Ethylene Glycol in the country,"" it said."
75,2018-05-11,IOC,"State-refiner Indian Oil Corp. (IOC) has bought 3 million barrels of US crude for loading in June as the arbitrage for American oil to Asia has opened

New Delhi/Singapore: State-refiner Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC) has bought 3 million barrels of US crude for loading in June as the arbitrage for American oil to Asia has opened, a senior source privy to the deal said. 
New Delhi/Singapore: State-refiner Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC) has bought 3 million barrels of US crude for loading in June as the arbitrage for American oil to Asia has opened, a senior source privy to the deal said.
IOC, the country’s top refiner, has bought 2 million barrels of Louisiana Light Sweet crude and a million barrels of WTI Midland through tender for arrival in July, said the source. The source did not wish to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The source said US crude competed with other middle eastern and African grades in an open tender. The source declined to reveal the prices and identity of the seller.
However, trade sources said Chinaoil sold the WTI Midland cargo while Trafigura sold the LLS crude.
Rising production and supplies from US have stretched the discount between US crude futures to Brent to $6 a barrel, making arbitrage economics feasible for India to import US crude, they said.
Separately, IOC has also bought 1 million barrels of Banoco Arab Medium crude in another tender from Shell, the sources said."
74,2018-05-30,IOC,"Oilex says it will take over Gujarat State Petroleum Corp's share in the Cambay basin block if the Indian explorer fails to pay its dues to meet exploration commitments

Mumbai: Australia-based Oilex Ltd has warned Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Ltd (GSPC) that it will take over its share in the Cambay basin block in Gujarat if the Indian explorer fails to pay its dues to meet exploration commitments in the block.  
Mumbai: Australia-based Oilex Ltd has warned Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Ltd (GSPC) that it will take over its share in the Cambay basin block in Gujarat if the Indian explorer fails to pay its dues to meet exploration commitments in the block. 
In a statement issued on its website, Oilex said that if GSPC does not settle the outstanding amount within 60 days, the company may issue a notice whereby GSPC shall be immediately deemed to have transferred all its participating interest in the production sharing contract (PSC) to Oilex. GSPC owes US $3,054,832 or around Rs20 crore to Oilex. 
GSPC, the exploration and production arm of the GSPC group, holds 55% stake in the field while Oilex holds 45%.
“An increase in Oilex’s participating interest in Cambay from 45% to 100% would greatly assist the company in strategic farm-in discussions with third parties,"" said Oilex. 
The joint venture partners have been sparring over investments in the Cambay field with GSPC failing to meet its investment target for the field for over two years. GSPC did not reply to an email at press time. 
“Oilex remains committed to unlocking the significant resource potential at Cambay by achieving commercial gas flow rates in the EP-IV formation. The development of new oil and gas fields such as Cambay is essential to meeting the Government of India’s policy to reduce reliance on imports,"" said Oilex. 
Oilex has received several informal expressions of interest from parties to participate in the ongoing work programme, it said. 
“To ensure that the JV has met and continues to meet the obligations and expectations of the national government and its industry regulator, Oilex has borne the full cost of many activities including the recent work to prepare a field development plan and securing government approval of the proposal for a 10-year extension to the PSC,"" said Oilex. 
Oilex managing director, Joe Salomon said in a statement: “Securing government approval for the application for the extension of Cambay PSC has been a significant event for the company. The company has sought and will continue to seek constructive resolution of all matters that obstruct the development of Cambay.""
GSPC has been struggling to reduce its debt for over two years now. This March, the company decided to sell a 28.4% stake in Gujarat Gas Ltd, its city gas distribution business, to its subsidiary Gujarat State Petronet Ltd (GSPL).
With this transaction, GSPC reduced its Rs16,500 crore debt by over Rs3,250 crore. Both Gujarat Gas and GSPL are subsidiaries of GSPC.
GSPC has invested $3.5 billion (approximately Rs20,000 crore) in the Deen Dayal block in offshore Krishna Godavari (KG) basin, which saddled the company with debt.
Last year, state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd agreed to pay $1.2 billion to GSPC for the purchase of its 80% stake in Deen Dayal block."

71,2018-09-14,IOC,"Top refiner Indian Oil Corp wants to lift 6 million barrels each in September and October, while Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals would load 3 million barrels each for those two months

New Delhi: Indian refiners will cut their monthly crude loadings from Iran for September and October by nearly half from earlier this year as New Delhi works to win waivers on the oil export sanctions Washington plans to reimpose on Tehran in November. India’s loadings from Iran for this month and next will drop to less than 12 million barrels each, after purchases over April-August had been boosted in anticipation of the reductions. 
New Delhi: Indian refiners will cut their monthly crude loadings from Iran for September and October by nearly half from earlier this year as New Delhi works to win waivers on the oil export sanctions Washington plans to reimpose on Tehran in November. India’s loadings from Iran for this month and next will drop to less than 12 million barrels each, after purchases over April-August had been boosted in anticipation of the reductions.
The United States is renewing sanctions on Iran after withdrawing from a nuclear deal forged in 2015 between Tehran and world powers. Washington reimposed some of the financial sanctions from Aug. 6, while those affecting Iran’s petroleum sector will come into force from Nov. 4.
India, Iran’s No.2 oil client behind top buyer China, does not recognise the reimposed US sanctions, but winning a waiver from the restrictions is a must for New Delhi to protect its wider exposure to the U.S. financial system.
India’s oil ministry in June told refiners to prepare for a “drastic reduction or zero"" imports from Iran from November.
“Some refiners have either already exhausted or front-loaded their term contract to a large extent, which allows them the flexibility to go to zero if required, or until clarity on the waivers emerge,"" Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy Aspect, told Reuters.
Washington will consider waivers for Iranian oil buyers such as India but they must eventually halt crude imports from Tehran, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week in New Delhi after a meeting of high level officials.
The Indian government, already facing a backlash over a falling rupee and record high fuel prices, does not want to halt the oil imports from Iran as the Islamic republic offers a discount on oil sales to India.
Government sources said India made this point clear in last week’s meetings with U.S. officials and remains engaged with Washington to work out waivers on its oil purchases from Iran.
“We have a special relationship with both the U.S. and with Iran, and we are seeing how to balance this all, and also to balance out the interest of the refiners and end-consumers,"" said one of the government officials.
But if Washington adopts a tough line, India would have no other choice than to end imports from Iran, they said.
Cutting imports nearly in half
India lifted about 658,000 barrel of oil per day (bpd) from Iran in April-August, according to data obtained from trade sources by Reuters, and the cuts projected for September and October would drop the daily average over those two months by about 45 percent to 360,000-370,000 bpd.
Indian oil refiners have already given the October loading plans to the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC), sources familiar with the loading schedule said.
Top refiner Indian Oil Corp wants to lift 6 million barrels each in September and October, while Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals would load 3 million barrels each for those two months, the sources said.
IOC would also lift 1 million barrel for its subsidiary Chennai Petroleum Corp in October, they said.
Bharat Petroleum Corp would lift 1 million barrels in September and skip purchases in October, a company source said on Tuesday.
Bharat Petroleum has already drawn more than its fixed volumes - the amount it is obligated to purchase - that were contracted for 2018/19, its chairman said on Tuesday.
Nayara Energy, part owned by Russian oil giant Rosneft, plans to lift 1 million barrels each in September and October, the sources said. But the refiner began reducing its oil imports from Iran in June and aims to completely halt purchases from November.
Hindustan Petroleum, Reliance Industries and HPCL Mittal Energy (HMEL) have no plans to buy from Iran in September and October, they said.
India refiners - excluding Reliance and HMEL, which do not have term contracts with Iran - will together lift about 73 percent of their fixed contract volumes from Iran by end-October, the loading data showed.
IOC, Nayara and MRPL did not respond to Reuters’ emails seeking comments."

The announcement came just before the market closed on Thursday, driving refiners’ stocks down. The S&P BSE Energy Index tumbled 6.7%, the most since August 2015, while each of the three state-run refiners closed more than 10% lower.
HPCL, BPCL and IOC shares came under heavy selling pressure today also, falling as much as 29%. HPCL slumped as much as 25% to  ₹ 165.45 per share on BSE, Indian Oil fell as much as 24.9% to  ₹ 105.65 and BPCL dived 28.9% to  ₹ 239.
The imposition of price controls is an “unequivocal negative"" that underscores “high political risk"" associated with state-owned enterprises, Citigroup’s analyst Saurabh Handa wrote in a note.
The move would reduce pretax profit of state-run oil marketing companies by a combined  ₹ 4,500 crore in the year ending March 31, according to people with knowledge of the matter. On an annualized basis profit before tax may drop by about  ₹ 9,000 crore based on current sales volumes, they said, asking not to be identified as they aren’t authorised to speak to the media.

New Delhi: India will buy 9 million barrels of Iranian oil in November, two industry sources said, indicating that the world’s third-biggest oil importer is to continue purchasing crude from the Islamic republic despite US sanctions coming into force on 4 November.
“Refiners have placed November nominations to lift 1.25 million tonnes (about 9 million barrels) of oil from Iran,"" one of the sources said.
Indian Oil Corp. will lift 6 million barrels of Iranian oil and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd 3 million barrels, the source told Reuters.
The United States plans to impose new sanctions targeting Iran’s oil sector on 4 November to try to stop the country’s involvement in conflicts in Syria and Iraq and bring Tehran to the negotiating table over its ballistic missile programme.
The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media. Indian Oil and Mangalore Refinery did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“India is continuing with its relationship with both its key energy partners Iran and the US,"" a second source said.
Indian refiners imported around 10 million barrels of Iranian oil in October, and its November shipments are expected to be lower. In the previous round of sanctions, India continued to buy Iranian oil although it had to cut purchases significantly to protect its wider exposure to the US financial system.
India’s foreign minister said in May it abides only by sanctions imposed by the United Nations and not those imposed by any other country. With the European Union considering the creation of a “special purpose vehicle"" before November to facilitate trade with Iran, India hopes to find a way to settle payments to Tehran.
“Previously there was no European channel. This time Europe is not working with the US, so we intend to evolve a mechanism,"" the second source said.
India, Iran’s top client after China, has close diplomatic ties with Iran, where it is building a strategic port called Chabahar that is expected to be operational by 2019. At the same time, India is closely working with the United States to further its strategic interests.
“It is still early to say how India will settle its trade with Iran,"" the first source said, adding that India could consider paying Iran for crude with the rupee currency."

Mumbai: Shares of upstream and downstream companies eroded nearly  ₹ 1.25 trillion of their market valuation in the last two sessions after government asked the state-run companies to absorb  ₹ 1 for every litre of petrol and diesel sold. Upstream companies are so far exempted from the subsidy burden despite expectations of windfall gains in earnings on higher crude and rupee deprecation. Analysts, however, belive that the government may consider a higher dividend from upstream companies to compensate the revenue loss due to a cut in excise duties.

Shares of downstream companies—Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Indian Oil Corp.

Citigroup downgraded BPCL, HPCL and IOC to sell, while Goldman Sachs lowered the first two companies to sell. Antique Stock Broking downgraded the stocks to hold from buy.
In the last two sessions, ONGC eroded nearly  ₹ 36,000 crore market valuations, HPCL lost  ₹ 7,200 crore, BPCL  ₹ 25,750 crore, IOC  ₹ 36,800 crore. Gail India Ltd, Oil India and MRPL lost  ₹ 12,700 crore,  ₹ 3,700 crore and  ₹ 1,800 crore, respectively.
At 9.50am, HPCL was down 21%, BPCL fell 21%, IOC 20%, ONGC 11%, Gail India 14%, MRPL 10%, and Chennai Petrolum Corp 8%.
“While the move is certainly benign for the consumer, the modality of the same has negative fallout for the OMCs. As if the covert price control (during elections) was not enough to dampen the investor sentiments, re-introduction of underrecovery, in our view, could further dent investment environment. We therefore re-caliberate our earnings estimates, trim our target prices & valuation multiples and downgrade OMCs to HOLD"", said Antique Broking firm
The government on Thursday cut prices of petrol and diesel by  ₹ 2.50 a litre each wherein it factored in an excise duty reduction of  ₹ 1.50 per litre and asked the OMCs to absorb   ₹  1 per litre on sales of petrol and diesel respectively.
“Earnings for India’s OMCs remain starkly uncertain, therefore, with little tailwind from refining either with margins trending lower y/y. We find little reason to recommend these stocks, therefore, even after their 28-48% fall YTD"", said Jefferies India in a note.
Analyst belives that the  ₹ 1/ltr burden on OMCs was a huge negative surprise as it is likely to be construed as reversal of the autofuel price deregulation policy by investors (and return of the erstwhile subsidy sharing mechanism), apart from the financial burden. Analyst estiamtes an annualised impact on OMC’s EBITDA of  ₹ 14000 crore while for fiscal year 2019 the impact would be  ₹ 7000 crore.
“In a scenario where we mechanically cut our petrol/ diesel marketing margin assumption for the OMCs (IOCL, BPCL, HPCL) by Rs1/L the impact on EPS is material, with scope for 25%-40% consensus earnings downgrades. Petrol and diesel combined account for slightly under two-thirds of OMC marketing volumes, and given existing thin EBITDA margins, this burden would leave segment EBITDA in the red"", said Macquarie Research in a 5 October note."
66,2018-10-09,IOC,"State refiners Indian Oil Corporation and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) have contracted 1.25 million tonnes of Iranian oil for import in November

New Delhi:  India will continue its energy imports from Iran even in the wake of the US government’s 4 November deadline, petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan hinted on Monday. 
New Delhi:  India will continue its energy imports from Iran even in the wake of the US government’s 4 November deadline, petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan hinted on Monday.
Two of India’s state-owned companies have contracted for Iranian crude for November, Pradhan said at The Energy Forum here and non-committally said one does not know whether or not the sanctions have been waived off.
State refiners Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL) and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) have contracted 1.25 million tonnes of Iranian oil for import in November.
Pradhan’s statement assumes importance given that India, the world’s third-largest oil importer is a major importer of Iranian oil. Of the 220.4 million metric tonnes (million MT) of crude oil imported by India in 2017-18, about 9.4%, was from Iran.
President Donald Trump pulled the US out of a historic 2015 accord with energy-rich Iran, which was inked to curb the Islamic Republic’s nuclear programme in return for ending sanctions. However, according to Alice G. Wells, principal deputy assistant secretary of state for south and central Asia, the US has not taken any decision on sanctioning India for importing oil from Iran and investing in the Chabahar port.
Wells, who was in New Delhi earlier this month as part of the delegation accompanying US secretary of state Mike Pompeo for the India-US “2+2"" dialogue, said there was no “blanket waiver or country-specific waiver"" from US sanctions on trading with or investing in Iran or buying arms from Russia. She said the sanctions that come into force on 4 November were designed to bring Tehran to book and not penalize India, which meets 83% of its crude oil requirements from outside.
Pradhan said a new world order is being established. “Isn’t this a recognition of India’s leadership?"" he asked.
Increasing tensions between the US and Venezuela, the US demanding an end to all imports of Iranian oil by early November and the rupee’s being Asia’s worst performing currency of the year have compounded the situation and put India in a difficult spot.
With US sanctions on Iran looming, Moody’s Investors Service had estimated a decline of around $500 million in earnings for IOCL and other Indian state-owned refiners such as Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) combined, on account of substituting crude oil imports from the Persian Gulf country.
India, which is reeling under the impact of high oil prices, has also reminded Saudi Arabia of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (Opec) promise of increasing production by an additional one million barrels per day, said Pradhan. 
Opec accounts for around 40% of global production. The grouping’s June decision to increase production by around one million barrels per day (bpd) or around 1% of global supply came against the backdrop of calls from the US, China and India to help moderate prices.
Pradhan said he had reminded Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid A. Al-Falih two days ago of Opec’s June decision.
This comes at a time when India has pitched the International Solar Alliance (ISA) as a counterweight to Opec, at the recently concluded first general assembly of the first treaty-based international government organization headquartered in India.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that ISA will play a role similar to that of Opec. With India being one of the major Opec consumers, India has called for a global consensus on “responsible pricing"" against the backdrop of rising global oil prices.
Pradhan later told reporters, “We will be guided by our national interest.""
“This is not going back on deregulation. Fuel prices continue to be decided on a daily basis based on factors like benchmark international rate and foreign exchange rate,"" he added.
While Brent prices had softened a bit on Monday from $86 per barrel mark and was trading at $83.53 per barrel, traders worldwide are betting on oil price to cross the $100 mark yet again. International crude oil prices had reached a record high of $147 per barrel in July 2009.
The cost of the Indian basket of crude, which represents the average of Oman, Dubai and Brent crude, rose to $84.14 a barrel on 5 October, according to the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell. To this, taxes at the central and state levels are added, besides dealers’ commission, to arrive at the retail price.
On Monday, petrol and diesel were selling at Rs82.03 per litre and Rs73.82 per litre, respectively in New Delhi. Subsidised domestic cooking gas prices have also been increased by Rs2.89 per 14.2 kg cylinder to Rs502.40, an all-time high. 
“We are going through challenging times,"" Pradhan said.
The National Democratic Alliance government had last week effected a Rs2.50 per litre cut in prices of petrol and diesel to ease inflationary pressure and boost consumer confidence. Many Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states have also cut value-added tax (VAT) on fuel by an equivalent amount at the Centre’s request.
Moody’s Investors Service in a report on Monday said that the government’s decision is credit negative for IOCL, BPCL and HPCL and will impact its earnings by Rs6,500 crore. The effective reversal of fuel price deregulation will also constrain future private sector investments in the sector.
“In effect, the government has asked OMCs to sell petrol and diesel at subsidized prices, for which they will not be reimbursed by the government,"" the report said.
In the run-up to 2019 general elections, Fitch Ratings recently raised the spectre of return of state control on fuel pricing in India.
“The step taken by the government reverses the price deregulation of diesel and petrol and increases the likelihood that the government may ask upstream companies Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (Baa1 stable) and Oil India Limited (Baa2 stable) to share the fuel subsidy burden,"" the report said."
65,2018-10-31,IOC,"A 14.2-kg subsidised LPG cylinder will cost Rs505.34 from Wednesday midnight as against Rs502.40 now, Indian Oil Corp said

New Delhi: Subsidised cooking gas (LPG) price on Wednesday was hiked by Rs2.94 per cylinder due to tax impact on the change in base price. 
New Delhi: Subsidised cooking gas (LPG) price on Wednesday was hiked by Rs2.94 per cylinder due to tax impact on the change in base price.
A 14.2-kg subsidised LPG cylinder will cost Rs505.34 from midnight tonight as against Rs502.40 now, Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the nation’s biggest fuel retailer, said in a statement here.
This is the sixth straight monthly increase in rates since June. In all rates have gone up by Rs14.13 per cylinder since then.
All LPG consumers have to buy the fuel at market price. The government, however, subsidises 12 cylinders of 14.2-kg each per households in a year by providing the subsidy amount directly in bank accounts of users.
This subsidy amount varies from month to month depending on the changes in the average international benchmark LPG rate and foreign exchange rate.
When international rates move up, the government provides a higher subsidy. But as per tax rules, GST on LPG has to be calculated at the market rate of the fuel. The government may choose to subsidise a part of the price but tax will have to be paid at market rates.
This has led to an increase in price.
The non-subsidised or market price LPG rates have gone up by Rs60 per cylinder to Rs880.
“While the price of non-subsidised LPG at Delhi will increase by Rs60 per cylinder in November 2018, mainly due to change in international price and foreign exchange fluctuations, the actual impact on subsidised domestic LPG customers is only Rs2.94 per cylinder, which is mainly due to GST,"" the statement said.
The subsidy transfer in customers’ bank account has been increased to Rs433.66 per cylinder in November 2018 as against Rs376.60 per cylinder in October 2018.
“Thus the domestic subsidised LPG customer is protected against the increase in prices of LPG,"" it said.
As a result of higher global rates, the price of non-subsidised LPG in Delhi will increase by Rs60 per cylinder. The balance Rs57.06 (Rs60 minus Rs2.94) is being compensated to the customer by the increase in subsidy transfer to their bank account. Accordingly, the subsidy transfer in the customer’s bank account has been increased to Rs433.66 in November from Rs376.60 per cylinder in October."
64,2018-11-02,IOC,"Indian Oil Corp says oil suppliers, including Saudi Arabia and Iraq, have been informally communicated about considering rupee payments, as it will bring down the demand for dollars

New Delhi: With reports about the US allowing eight countries—including India, Japan and South Korea—to buy Iranian oil after it re-imposes sanctions on the Persian Gulf nation, state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) on Friday remained circumspect about the possible fallout. 
New Delhi: With reports about the US allowing eight countries—including India, Japan and South Korea—to buy Iranian oil after it re-imposes sanctions on the Persian Gulf nation, state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) on Friday remained circumspect about the possible fallout.
India is a major importer of Iranian oil —of the 220.4 million metric tonnes of crude imported by India in 2017-18, more than 9% was from Iran.
Speaking to reporters, Sanjiv Singh, chairman at India’s largest oil refiner, said that he was hopeful to be able to import from Iran as loss of substantial volume of Iranian oil won’t be good for the international market as it will impact prices. He added that while IOC places order for crude oil a month in advance, the time for placing December contracts hasn’t come.Bloomberg reported that while the Trump administration’s goal remains to choke off revenue to Iran’s economy, waivers are being granted in exchange for continued import cuts so as not to drive up oil prices.
This comes in the backdrop of India adopting a “wait and watch"" policy ahead of US oil and banking sanctions on Iran from Sunday. India has been eyeing these concessions and were hinted at by petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan on 8 October about India continuing its energy imports from Iran even in the wake of the US’ 4 November deadline. State-run refiners Indian Oil Corp. Ltd and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd have contracted 1.25 million tonnes of Iranian oil for import in November.
“We need to see what channels are open,"" Singh said.
India, which meets 83% of its crude oil requirements through imports and has been reeling from high oil prices, is not new to doing business with a sanctions-hit Iran. Indian banks put in place a rupee payment mechanism during the earlier round of sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme, that included strictures against Iran’s energy and banking sectors. IOC has made payments for Iranian oil contracted till August.
Bloomberg added that the identity of the countries getting waivers is expected to be released officially on Monday, with these waivers being only temporary.
India has also been trying to diversify its supply portfolio, with firms starting to source liquefied natural gas and oil from the US. The options before it include increasing imports from sources such as the US, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Venezuela, and the UAE. However, their terms may not be as attractive as those offered by Iran as the energy major provides 60-days credit, insurance and shipping.
Singh added that while there are alternatives for sourcing adequate volumes, but prices may be affected in the wake of sanctions.
Moody’s Investors Service in a report on 27 September estimated an around $500 million decline in earnings for Indian state-owned refiners, IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd, if they were to buy crude from sources other than Iran.
Any rally in global crude oil prices will affect India’s oil import bill and trade deficit. Every dollar increase in oil prices has the potential to push up the import bill by around  ₹ 10,700 crore on an annual basis. While crude prices jumped 50% in dollar terms and 70% in rupee terms since last year, the prices have fallen from the four-year highs reached earlier this month.
Arun Kumar Sharma, director, finance, at IOC, said that oil suppliers, including Saudi Arabia and Iraq, have been informally communicated about considering rupee payments, as it will bring down the demand for dollars. However, no response has been received, Sharma added.
This comes in the backdrop of India seeking a review of payment terms with major oil producers with the pitch being made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself during his meeting with top executives of global oil companies and experts from the energy sector last month. Also, the slide in the rupee has made it Asia’s worst performing currency of the year.
India has also proposed a consumers’ collective comprising major energy buyers—China, India, Japan and South Korea. The move assumes importance given that China and India are the world’s second and third largest oil importers, respectively. Japan and South Korea are placed at the fourth and fifth positions, respectively.
In another development, IOC will bear a  ₹ 2,200 crore impact on account of the NDA government last month effecting a  ₹ 2.50 per litre cut in prices of petrol and diesel. Out of the  ₹ 2.50 cut, the Centre reduced excise duty by  ₹ 1.50 per litre, while state-run fuel retailers are to take a hit of  ₹ 1 for every litre sold.
Singh added that there is no indication from the government at what level the  ₹ 1 price cut can be withdrawn.
IOC posted a 12.2% fall in second-quarter profit on Friday due to forex expenses and raw material costs. It registered a net profit of  ₹ 3,247 crore in the quarter ended 30 September compared with  ₹ 3,696 crore in the corresponding period last year."

New Delhi: India’s biggest state-owned crude oil refiner Indian Oil Corp Ltd aims to lift full volumes under its 2018/19 annual contract with Iran, a company official said on Thursday.
The company has a deal to buy 180,000 barrels per day (bpd)Iranian oil this fiscal year.
He said India’s overall oil imports from Iran could surpass last year’s level. Indian state refiners cut imports from Iran in the last fiscal year due to a dispute over the development rights of a large gas field.
The official, who did not wish to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Indian refiners are prepared to pay for Iran oil imports entirely in rupees through state-owned UCO Bank.

New Delhi: Ahead of general elections, public sector oil companies plan to allot about 65,000 petrol pumps across the country to nearly double the existing retail network, officials said on Sunday.
Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) on Sunday issued advertisements for setting up 55,649 petrol pumps across the country.
“This does not include any sites in poll-bound states,"" HPCL’s state-level coordinator Vishal Bajpai told reporters here.
Assembly elections are on in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Mizoram and advertisement for these would be issued after polling is completed.
IOC, which already has 27,377 petrol pumps across the country, has advertised for setting up 26,982 more in states that are not going to polls. BPCL will add 15,802 outlets to its existing strength of 14,592 and HPCL would add 12,865 petrol pumps to its existing tally of 15,287.
Delhi has 390 petrol pumps and 170 more are to be set up, Bajpai said.
The poll-bound states may have some 9,000-10,000 sites, another official said.
The allotments will be done on relaxed guidelines which has lowered the educational qualification to 10th pass from 12th pass and graduate currently and the only essential requirement is ownership of the land where the pump is to be set up, Bajpai said.
This is the first time in almost four years that allotment of petrol pump sites is being advertised.
India currently has 63,674 petrol pumps, most of them with public sector firms. Nayara Energy Ltd, formerly Essar Oil Ltd, has the highest number of outlets in the private sector at 4,895 while Reliance Industries has 1,400 pumps. Royal Dutch/Shell has 116 outlets.
“For a fast-growing economy like ours, energy needs are growing manifold. PSU oil marketing companies are undertaking retail outlet (petrol pump) network expansion in tandem with the growth in demand for petrol and diesel. Retail sales of petrol and diesel are increasing at the rate of approximately 8% and 4% per annum,"" Bajpai said.
The expansion, he said, was being undertaken to meet the growing fuel needs and convenience of customers in emerging markets like upcoming highways, agricultural pockets and industrial hubs.
The retail outlet network in rural, remote and far-flung areas is also being expanded with the intention of increasing availability of products, predominantly diesel, ensuring quality and correct price to meet the rural agricultural demand and cater to people in remote areas, he said.
He said the process of dealer selection has been simplified by introducing online applications and doing away with the requirement of submitting voluminous documents in support of eligibility.
“Only the selected candidate would be required to produce the documents. Similarly, the eligibility norms have also been relaxed,"" he said. “Availability of suitable land at the advertised location/stretch is the most important requirement. Applicants without land can also apply, however, they are expected to offer land when called for,"" he added.
For the first time, the computerised draw of lots or bid opening would be held under the aegis of an independent agency to bring in more transparency."
61,2018-12-04,IOC,"The tender says Indian shippers will be given first right of refusal for the contract as the nation seeks to boost its shipping industry

New Delhi: India’s top refiner, Indian Oil Corp (IOC), has issued a global tender to charter scrubber-fitted oil tankers for at least five years to import Iraqi oil, a tender document seen by Reuters showed. 
New Delhi: India’s top refiner, Indian Oil Corp (IOC), has issued a global tender to charter scrubber-fitted oil tankers for at least five years to import Iraqi oil, a tender document seen by Reuters showed.
The tender says Indian shippers will be given first right of refusal for the contract as the nation seeks to boost its shipping industry. It is seeking bids from vessels that are less than 10-years old.
A scrubber is a product that strips out sulphur emissions and, in doing so, can allow shippers to use dirtier fuel oil but still meet new global requirements for lower emissions.
IOC and the country’s second biggest state-owned refiner, Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL), last year also issued similar tenders seeking vessels for five years.
The two refiners, however, could not award the tenders as there were very few bids by shippers because at the time they were seeking clarity on the new fuel emissions requirements.
The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is introducing the rules on marine fuels from the beginning of 2020, limiting the sulphur content to 0.5 percent, down substantially from the current 3.5 percent, to curb shipping pollution.
IOC’s tender document is seeking global bids for a very large crude carrier (VLCC) capable of carrying Iraqi Basra Light and Basra Heavy crude for five years and grants Indian shippers the right of first refusal.
BPCL will soon issue a domestic tender seeking to hire Suezmax tankers capable of carrying up to 1 million barrels of oil for a five-year period, two industry sources said.
The IMO says that when the new rules come into force it will ban ships that do not have scrubbers from carrying any fuel oil, making it easier to catch cheaters.
The duration of the IOC contract can be extended by another two years to a total of seven, the tender document showed. The tender will close on January 7 and bids will remain valid until March 11, the document showed.

New Delhi: State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) may raise about $3 billion more through US dollar bonds issue after the Reserve Bank permitted fuel retailers to raise an overseas loan to check fall in rupee value, its Chairman Sanjiv Singh said Wednesday. 
New Delhi: State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) may raise about $3 billion more through US dollar bonds issue after the Reserve Bank permitted fuel retailers to raise an overseas loan to check fall in rupee value, its Chairman Sanjiv Singh said Wednesday.
IOC is already in market to raise $900 million through a bonds issue and is raising an equivalent sum through a syndicated loan for meeting its working capital requirements.
“Yes, we will certainly look at raising more overseas loans within the limit set up by RBI "" he told reporters here.
RBI had in October last year relaxed external commercial borrowing (ECB) policy for IOC, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) to allow them to raise $10 billion in overseas loans for working capital needs. It had lifted the individual borrowing limit for the three firms which was set at $750 million.
“The three OMCs (oil marketing companies) were allowed to raise $10 billion and we reckon our share of that would be around $5 billion,"" he said. “We will certainly look at opportunities to raise overseas funds."" He, however, said no timelines have been set for raising of additional loans.
Singh said since India imports over 80 per cent of its crude oil and pays most of it in US dollars, an overseas loan in the American currency acts as a natural hedge during currency fluctuations.
Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg had in October stated that the RBI relaxation would help the oil companies raise as much as $10 billion for maturity periods of three to five years.
The RBI move had followed rupee losing 13 per cent to the dollar during the year and allowing oil companies - who are the biggest buyers of US dollars - to raise overseas loans that would ease pressure on the currency.
IOC in a regulatory filing on Tuesday said it has launched an international bonds issue of $900 million, carrying a coupon of 4.75 per cent.
The Notes are expected to be settled by January 16, 2019.
“The Notes carry a coupon of 4.75 per cent per annum payable semi-annually. The Notes will mature in 2024 and all the principal and interest payments will be made in US dollars,"" it had said.
IOC said the proceeds of the issue will be used to fund working capital requirements for the normal course of business.
The bonds will be listed on the Singapore Exchange.
Bookrunners for the issue are Citigroup, DBS Bank, SBICAP Securities, Standard Chartered Bank, and Westpac Banking.
Besides running a huge working capital requirement, IOC is buying back shares and is paying an interim dividend for 2018-19, aggregating to  ₹ 11,000 crore.
The board of IOC last month approved buyback of up to 29.76 crore shares, or 3.06 per cent of share capital, at  ₹ 149 per share aggregating to  ₹ 4,435 crore. It also approved payment of  ₹ 6,556 crore as interim dividend to shareholders. Fitch Ratings had last month stated that  ₹ 4,435 crore share buyback and  ₹ 6.75 per share interim dividend, together with funding requirements for IOC’s capex plans to upgrade refineries for new emission standards and expansion of refining and petrochemical capacity, will drive up the company’s leverage. Its expected capex of  ₹ 23,000 crore in 2018-19 and  ₹ 27,500 crore in 2019-20 will result in continued negative free cash flow. The government is pushing cash-rich PSUs to pay higher dividends and buy back shares using their reserves so as to help meet its budget deficit target.
The government, which holds 54.06 per cent stake in IOC, is expected to participate in the share buyback.

New Delhi/Mumbai: India will not share the limited supply of Iranian crude allowed under a US waiver from sanctions with private refiners, according to people with knowledge of the matter. That is a departure from the earlier practice of splitting exempted volumes.
The government has asked its four state refiners led by Indian Oil Corp. to share the entire 9 millions barrels of Iranian oil available every month under a 180-day waiver from US sanctions, the people said, asking not to be identified. Private refiner Essar Oil, now rechristened Nayara Energy after it was acquired by Rosneft PJSC and partners, was allowed to buy about half of the Iran volumes when a similar curbs were imposed in 2012.
Indian refiners — state-run or private — scramble for Iranian crude because it is less expensive and offers a longer credit cycle, apart from savings in freight cost. Iranian shipments to India jumped 2.5 times in about a year after the economic curbs on the Persian Gulf nation were lifted under a 2015 accord.
Reserving Iranian crude for state-run refiners will deprive the private processors of these benefits, forcing them to look for costlier alternatives. An Indian oil ministry spokesman couldn’t immediately comment.
Private refiners such as billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. have greater agility to source and process cheaper crude than the state-run refiners and should not be allowed to eat into the Iranian barrels, especially when there isn’t scarcity of supply in the global oil market, said an oil ministry official.
Reliance and Nayara Energy together imported close to a third of India’s total oil imports from Iran last year, according to shipping data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s despite both halting Iranian purchases months before U.S. restrictions against oil dealings with Iran went back into effect in early November.
India plans to continue with this strategy to protect Iran oil supplies only for its state-run refiners if waivers are extended beyond April, as it continues talking to the Trump administration for the rollover, according to people with knowledge of the matter."

During the shutdown IOC will mobilise naphtha from other plants for the 800,000 tonnes per annum cracker associated with the plant, a company source said.
From mid-March, IOC will shut one of eight heaters attached to its Panipat naphtha cracker for 45 days, the spokesman said.
The company source said the shutdown of one the heaters would curtail the refiner's naphtha production to 350 tonnes per hour from an average of about 400 tonnes per hour.

56,2019-01-25,IOC,"Gujarat may offer an additional 50% stake in GSPC LNG to AdaniThe LNG terminal project was originally conceived way back in 2008 by the Gujarat government

AHMEDABAD :
Gujarat may offer an additional 50% stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corp. (GSPC) LNG Ltd to Adani Group, which already holds a 25% stake in the company, after Indian Oil Corp. Ltd decided to opt out of the race, said three state government officials close to the development, requesting anonymity. 
The Gujarat government, which owns 50% in GSPC LNG, had been looking to induct a third partner for the remaining 25% stake. It may now allow the Adani Group to pick up the 25%, and offload up to 25% of its own stake in the company.
“We are looking at various options for commissioning the LNG terminal, which includes giving additional stake to the Adani Group,"" said one of the officials mentioned above. 
The Gujarat government had set up GSPC LNG as a special purpose vehicle for implementing the project with a proposed capacity to re-gasify 5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa). The cost of the project was estimated at  ₹4,500-5,000 crore. 
The terminal’s capacity can be expanded to 10 mtpa and is designed to have a berth for receiving LNG (liquified natural gas) tankers and storage tank facilities for re-gasification and gas evacuation. 
The terminal was inaugurated in September by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Four months on, however, it is yet to be commissioned as the land lease and sub-concession agreements are yet to be signed between the promoters and the Gujarat government. 
A commissioning cargo from the US had arrived at the Mundra LNG terminal in November last year but it had to be diverted to Hazira port as it was not allowed to discharge at Mundra, said an industry expert in the know of the development. 
“Certain agreements are yet to be signed and we are hopeful of resolving all pending issues. We will soon decide a date for commissioning the project,"" said the second official.
Last year, the Gujarat government had set up a three-member expert committee headed by retired bureaucrat and former chairman of Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board, L. Mansingh, to assess the investment claims by Adani Group in the project. 
An email query sent to Adani Group on 15 January remained unanswered. 
“Adani Group has said that it has invested about  ₹1,200 crore for dredging and other port-led development activities. The committee is examining their claims and is soon expected to file its report,"" the third official said.
Initially, GSPC had a majority stake in the project, but the organization has been under financial stress. Subsequently, the state’s energy and petrochemicals department funded the project and directly holds a 50% stake in GSPC LNG. 
“The matter of transfer of equity to GSPC is under consideration and will be decided shortly,"" a GSPC group official said. He, too, requested anonymity. 
The LNG terminal project was originally conceived way back in 2008 by the Gujarat government. Back then, it was planned to come up at Hazira and GSPC was to hold a 50% stake in the project with management control, while Adani and Essar Power Ltd were to hold 25% each. Essar later backed out of the project and the site of the terminal was shifted to Mundra. 
The project has been facing delays due to uncertainty over equity sharing and project execution. 
In 2013, Gujarat had also invited expression of interests for the project and various companies, including India Gas Solutions, a joint venture between Reliance Industries and UK’s BP Plc, besides Torrent Power and GAIL India and Petronet LNG, had participated. 
The plan did not materialize, and, later on, Indian Oil planned to pick up a 50% equity stake in the project for which it got an in-principle approval from its board in August 2017. 
IOCL, which has carried out due diligence of the project, informed Gujarat government recently that it might not go ahead with its investment plans. 
IOCL had offered about  ₹750 crore for the 50% stake in the project. This same offer is being put before the Adani group, said the two government officials cited above. According to the state government’s LNG Terminal Policy, it will, through its nominated agency, have the right of equity participation from 11% to 26%. It also has the right to reserve 15% of total re-gasification capacity and a maximum up to 2.5 mtpa on the first right of refusal basis."

NEW DELHI :
Indian Oil Corp, the country's top refiner, is looking for an annual deal to buy US crude as it seeks to broaden its oil purchasing options, its chairman said on Wednesday, amid uncertainties over imports from Iran.
Washington in November granted a six-month waiver to New Delhi from sanctions against Tehran and restricted India's monthly intake of Iranian oil to 1.25 million tonnes or 300,000 barrels per day.
Sanjiv Singh told reporters IOC has not yet finalised from which company it would buy US oil.
""When we go for term, it should have price advantage for us and strategic advantage for us apart from supply sureties. So considering these three we will work out volumes also,"" he said.
India Oil had previously purchased US oil from spot markets and signed a mini-term deal in August to buy 6 million barrels of U.S. oil between November to January.
IOC is the top Indian buyer of Iranian oil with an annual contract for 180,000 bpd in the fiscal year ending March 2019.
Singh said his firm buys Iranian oil because of competitive prices and attractive terms and conditions. Iran offers extended credit periods and almost free shipping on oil sales to India.
He said IOC was in talks to renew an annual oil contract with Iran but a new any deal would depend on conditions attached to a subsequent waiver from the U.S. sanctions.
""The earlier waiver was for the existing contract, (for a new contract) we will have to work it out,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the refiner has signed a deal with Iraq to buy 360,000 bpd of oil, including up to 500,000 bpd of Basra Heavy, in 2019 compared with 356,000 bpd last year."

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a plea by operational creditors of Essar Steel, including Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), which had sought a stay in insolvency proceedings against the debt-laden company.
Accordingly, the matter will continue to be heard by the Ahmedabad branch of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, appearing for IOC, told the court that it would need more time to argue before the NCLT.
Kamlaljeet Singh Ahluwalia, an operational creditor of Essar Steel, had moved the Supreme Court on 6 February challenging two orders of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) directing the Ahmedabad bench of the NCLT to pass an order in the insolvency case by 11 February.
The orders in question passed by the appellate tribunal are of 23 January and 4 February. The matter is likely to be mentioned before a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi on Thursday.
The plea had sought setting aside of the orders as it claims them to be contrary to the settled legal propositions and against the principles of natural justice. According to the petitioner, the NCLAT erred in passing the impugned orders and dictating the procedure to the NCLT in conducting a matter, which is contrary and beyond its scope of jurisdiction.
“The appellate authority, while exercising powers under Section 61 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, cannot assume supervisory jurisdiction over the adjudicating authorities and issue directions dictating the procedure to conduct the hearing of applications before the adjudicating authority,"" the petition said.
On 4 February, a two-member NCLAT bench headed by its chairperson Justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya said only after the matter had been heard at NCLT, Ahmedabad, would the appellate tribunal hear it on 12 February.
The NCLAT’s directive was issued while it was hearing a petition filed by the committee of creditors (CoC) of Essar Steel, through State Bank of India, against resolution professional Satish Kumar Gupta and others.
The appellate tribunal had also asked the operational creditors to choose one representative as the bench would not hear all of them individually.
The Ahmedabad bankruptcy court had turned down the bid by Essar Steel Asia Holdings Ltd (ESAHL) to regain control over the company, which came as a setback to the promoter Ruia family."

Mumbai: Oil India Ltd's (OIL) divestment could happen shortly, said the company’s chairman and managing director Utpal Bora.
""We are ready and all approvals for the divestment are in place, but I think the government is waiting for the right market condition and the divestment could happen anytime now,"" said Bora on the sidelines of Petrotech 2019. The government plans to offload a 10% stake in Oil India.
To meet its divestment target, the government is said to be considering a plan to sell shares worth $2 billion in state-run Oil India, Oil and Natural Gas Corp and Indian Oil Corp. This is in addition to the proceeds the government can generate from an estimated  ₹10,000-crore share buyback programme by these companies.
Post divestment, it is estimated that the government will earn approximately  ₹10,000 crore from these companies.
Last November, Oil India had approved buyback of shares at an aggregate of no more than 10% of the fully paid-up equity share capital and free reserves of the company.
The company, which is facing threats of shutdown by its labour union over the production enhancement contracts (PECs) farmed out for the Jorajan and Tengakhat fields in Assam, is trying to find middle ground with the union on the issue. He added that the PECs proposed for Jorajan and Tengakhat fall under a “technical services"" model where contractors will only be offered a fee for raising production.
""There have been some protests as there are a lot of misconceptions among the people that the fields are being privatized and that people will lose jobs. However, this is only a move towards induction of technology. The fields remain with India and the manpower will be intact. We hope they understand,"" added Bora.
A prior attempt to offer a stake in the fields was scrapped."

NEW DELHI :
The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is looking to expand its presence in India by investing in refining and petrochemicals and strategic petroleum reserves, said Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, Minister of State, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of ADNOC.
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of Petrotech 2019, he said, “India is very high on our strategic agenda and expanding our strategic reserve in India will be an item on the agenda to be discussed with our friends and counterparts in India.""
India, the world's third largest energy consumer, has drawn the UAE's attention. The UAE is looking at investing in refining and petrochemical projects as well as stocking more crude in India.
“We are looking at the expanding investment portfolio in downstream sectors, refining and petrochemicals. We are only looking at strategic partnerships given that we can also bring our own crude. India is not only an important market for us, India is a very strategic partner. We will continue to always look for ways to enhance our avenues of cooperation,"" Al Jaber said.
Last June ADNOC and Saudi ARAMCO had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for participating in the Ratnagiri Refinery and Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd, which is building the 60 million tonne refinery project in Maharashtra.
The mega refinery to be set up with an estimated investment of  ₹3 lakh crore will be able to process 1.2 million barrels of crude oil per day.
The refinery project, which was announced in December 2015, was to be commissioned by 2022 but land acquisition delays have pushed the deadline to 2025.
Commenting on the progress made on the project, Al Jaber said, “We are still at an early stage, we are still in the process of defining the scope and scale of the project. We are working very closely with our partners Saudi Aramco as well as our counterparts in India.""
RRPCL is a joint venture among the three state-run oil marketing companies--Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation. Aramco and ADNOC will together own 50 per cent of the planned project but a division between them has not yet been announced. The oil marketing companies will together own 50%.
He added that UAE is also looking at storing more crude oil in Indian storages. Currently, the UAE supplies a small quantity of oil to India. Last November, India signed an initial pact to lease out a part of its underground strategic oil storage at Padur in Karnataka to ADNOC for storing crude oil.
India has built 5.33 million tonnes of emergency storage -- sufficient to meet its oil needs for 9.5 days -- in underground rock caverns in Mangalore and Padur in Karnataka and Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. It has allowed foreign oil companies to store oil in the storages on the condition that the stockpile can be used by New Delhi in case of an emergency.
Aramco has also expressed its desire to venture into fuel retailing in India.

51,2019-02-14,IOC,"The RRPCL refinery project, which was announced in December 2015, was to be commissioned by 2022But land acquisition delays have pushed the deadline to 2025

Mumbai: When 40-year-old mango and cashew farmer Avinash Mahajan boarded a train to Panipat to visit Indian Oil Corp.’s Panipat refinery, he was protesting against a proposed refinery near his farm in Ratnagiri that is believed will hurt farming prospects in the region.
He had every reason to be resentful. Mango farming had suffered in the region due to changing environmental conditions. Produce of Alphonso mangoes, cashew from Mahajan’s 30-acre farm in Ratnagiri, where he also grows bamboo, has been impacted as the fruit-bearing season for mangoes in Ratnagiri has changed from February to May, when the season for mangoes is at its peak. Mahajan says this impacts the supply. Importantly, youth from the region were migrating to bigger cities in search of jobs that offer small income.
Worse, had the project by Ratnagiri Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (RRPCL) received a green signal for land acquisition, Mahajan would have to sell one-third of his ancestral land to the company that is seeking 15,000 acres in the Konkan region of Maharashtra to build a 60-million tonne per annum refinery-cum-petrochemical complex at an estimated cost of  ₹3 trillion. A significant part of the proposed land bank for the refinery will have to be bought from at least 850 families in the region which mostly depend upon farming and fishing for livelihood and are currently protesting against the proposed refinery. But Mahajan’s viewpoint, along with that of his his fellow villagers, seems to have changed now, especially after a trip like the one to Panipat. Some of them are now willing to sell their land to RRPCL, paving the way for the refinery to come up.
""I was amazed,"" Mahajan said after he reached the Panipat refinery along with 23 fellow villagers on a four-day familiarization trip organized by RRPCL in a bid to persuade villagers to understand benefits of such large industrial projects. The group included local village leaders, housewives and farmers.
""The Panipat refinery was nothing like what we had imagined. It is not coal-fired. It does not pollute water. The green belt was impressive, irrigated with treated water. We saw the rehabilitation of the locals and spoke to seven sarpanch (village heads) and learned how their living and economic conditions have improved. We want this kind of development for our Konkan region,"" Mahajan said. He is now convinced about giving up his land for the refinery, he told Mint.
The RRPCL refinery project, which was announced in December 2015, was to be commissioned by 2022, but land acquisition delays have pushed the deadline to 2025. RRPCL is a joint venture among the three state-run oil marketing companies -- Indian Oil Corp (IOCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL). Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) will jointly own 50% of RRPCL, with the remaining 50% owned by the oil marketing companies.
Like Mahajan, Nilesh Patankar, a 44-year-old chartered accountant from Ratnagiri, too, decided to give all of his 64 acres for the refinery after he visited Panipat.
""Our concerns are only with regard to environment protection, good rehabilitation and local job opportunities. At Panipat, most of the concerns were addressed and we have decided to support the project,"" Patankar said.
Moreover, their support for the project is also to ensure better job opportunities for locals, and improved living conditions and education for children. Like most of India, youth from the Ratnagiri region also migrate to bigger cities like Mumbai and Pune for jobs; a big project will help stem that migration.
""Our children are unable to complete their education. Many have to migrate to Pune and Mumbai for jobs for a meager Rs10,000 per month. We want them to be here with better job opportunities available locally,"" Mahajan said.
Like Mahajan and Patankar, at least 40% of the villagers in the region have handed over consent letters to the company for land acquisition. The company is hoping that the land acquisition process will end by 2019 and work on the project will begin from early 2020.
RRPCL now plans to take another batch of villagers to IOCL’s Paradip refinery in Odisha. They are all fisherman who were protesting in fear that the refinery will disturb the ecological balance, and hence fishing.
""We understand the project and associated challenges. So we decided to allay the fears of the locals by taking them to our refineries. We have addressed their apprehensions. People have understood our viewpoint and we believe we are on the right track,"" said B. Ashok, chief executive officer, RRPCL.
Another official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that the idea is to make the Ratnagiri fishermen meet their counterparts in Odisha to get their views on whether the Paradip refinery has threatened fishing or local jobs.
“So if anything, the Ratnagiri refinery will only bring big economic opportunities for the locals,"" the official quoted above said.
If not, then the Ratnagiri farmers such as Mahajan will harbor a grudge and rightly so because land is their biggest asset, like any other farmer in the world."
48,2019-02-18,IOC,"Stare-run oil companies and Saudi Aramco have teamed up to build what would be the country's biggest oil refineryThe announcement comes as Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is due to arrive in India on Tuesday

MUMBAI :
Opposition from farmers has prompted Maharashtra to move the location for what would be the country's biggest oil refinery, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said.
Stare-run oil companies and Saudi Aramco have teamed up to build the $44 billion refinery, which is aimed at giving India steady fuel supplies while meeting Saudi Arabia's need to secure regular buyers for its oil.
But thousands of farmers are refusing to surrender land, fearing it could damage a region famed for its Alphonso mangoes, vast cashew plantations and fishing hamlets that boast bountiful catches of seafood.
After their protests, land acquisition has been stopped for the refinery at the proposed site at Nanar, a village in Ratnagiri district, some 400 km (250 miles) south of Mumbai, Fadnavis said on Monday.
The refinery will be built at a place where local population won't oppose the project, he said in a press conference, without identifying a new location.
Fadnavis, a member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), made the announcement after forging an alliance with regional party Shiv Sena for the upcoming general election.
The location of refinery was one of the contentious issues between the parties, with Shiv Sena opposing the refinery.
The announcement comes as Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is due to arrive in India on Tuesday and is expected to announce investments in energy and infrastructure during the visit.
The Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd (RRPCL), which is running the project, says the 1.2 million barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery, and an integrated petrochemical site with a capacity of 18 million tonnes per year, will help create direct and indirect employment for up to 150,000 people, with jobs that pay better than agriculture or fishing.
RRPCL, a joint venture between Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum, has said suggestions the refinery would damage the environment were baseless.
""The company is hopeful that the state government will provide sufficient land for the project on the western coast,"" Anil Nagwekar, a spokesman for the RRPCL, told Reuters.
Land acquisition has always been a contentious issue in rural India, where a majority of the population depends on farming for its livelihood.
In 2008, for example, India's Tata Motors had to shelve plans for a car factory in an eastern state after facing widespread protests from farmers.

50,2019-02-18,IOC,"Top 5 most profitable companies made around 43.3% of the total profit made by the PSEs174 of the 184 profitable firms contributed around 38% of the profit in 2017-18

The Union government of India is by far the most diversified business owner in the country. But the bigger question is: is it making enough money through these businesses? The Public Enterprises Survey of 2017-18 provides us with the details.
How profitable are PSEs?
In 2017-18, the number of profitable public sector enterprises (PSEs) stood at 184. These companies made a total profit of about  ₹1.59 trillion. As can be seen from the accompanying table, the top 10 most profitable firms made a bulk of these profits. Their profit in 2017-18 amounted to  ₹98,707 crore, or 61.8% of the profit made by the profitable PSEs. In fact, the top 5 most profitable companies made around 43.3% of the total profit made by the state-owned profitable enterprises. The oil companies led by oil marketer Indian Oil Corp. made a bulk of the profit. The other big chunk came from the coal companies.
What is the trend with profitable PSEs?
Is this trend of top 10 profitable PSEs bringing in a bulk of the profit, limited to 2017-18? This is a trend which plays out every year. If we look at data between 2010-11 and 2017-18, the profit of the 10 most profitable firms varied anywhere between 58% and 64% of the profit of the profitable PSEs. What this tells us is that it’s not just the loss-making enterprises which are a problem. 174 of the 184 profitable firms contributed around 38% of the profit in 2017-18. This means that many PSEs are barely making money to justify the capital invested in them and are really being run just for the sake of being run.
What kind of PSEs actually make money?
One look at the above table tells us that state-owned companies operating in sectors where there is fairly limited competition are the ones actually raking in the moolah.
Does competition hurt PSEs?
Yes. It does. Let’s take the example of BSNL. In 2005-06, when the competition in the telecom sector wasn’t as cut throat as it is now, BSNL was the second most profitable PSE. It made a net profit of  ₹8,940 crore. Following Jio’s disruptive entry into the telecom space and the subsequent fall in data tariffs, BSNL was the largest loss-making PSE in 2017-18, with losses of  ₹7,993 crore. Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL), was the third largest loss-making firm during the year, with losses of  ₹2,973 crore.
What does all this tell us?
Take the case of the services sector. The PSEs operating in this space had net profit margin of 3.6% in 2017-18. This is extremely low. It tells us that any kind of competition isn’t good for India’s public sector utilities. In comparison, PSEs operating in the mining and exploration space, where competition is limited, had net profit margin of 18.2% in 2017-18. This comparison tells us the real story of the performance of PSEs.

NEW DELHI :
As tensions with Pakistan escalated, Indian oil companies have put in motion a ""very strong plan"" including moving a convoy of 500 trucks to ensure uninterrupted fuel supplies to all defence and strategic assets, top officials said Wednesday.
Tanks feeding defence establishment in forward areas along the border with Pakistan are all ""topped up"" and have enough fuel to meet any eventuality, they said.
Oil companies had topped up all storages in Jammu and Kashmir and other forward areas before the Tuesday's pounding of a terrorist camp inside Pakistan as retaliation to Jaish-e-Mohammed operative killing 40 paramilitary personnel in a suicide car bombing in Kashmir on February 14.
And now, as many as 500 oil tankers are being moved to the state and other forward locations to stock up jet fuel (ATF), diesel and other petroleum products for ensuring fuel supplies beyond the 10-day stock firms generally maintain, they said.
Indian and Pakistani fighter jets shot down war planes of each other on Wednesday in the most serious military confrontation between the two nations in decades.
State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) supply jet fuel for the fighter jets of Indian Air Force as well as diesel and other fuel for tanks, trucks and other automobiles used by defence and paramilitary forces.
""We have a very strong plan in place (to ensure uninterrupted supplies),"" an official said.
The requirement of defence services as a percentage of over 190 million tonne of fuel consumed in the country is ""very small"" but the task is ensuring its uninterrupted availability especially in forward posts in Jammu and Kashmir, another official said.
Oil companies, they said, carry out winter stocking in Jammu and Kashmir ahead of the onset of winter every year and they had moved enough quantities of fuel to the state to meet fuel requirement of the civilians as well as defence establishment.
A separate official said Indian oil companies had ensured fuel uninterrupted fuel supplies to defence forces even during the Kargil war in 1999.
""One is reminded of a picture in the newspapers during the height of Kargil war of a burning Indian Oil tanker alongside Bofors gun. We ensured fuel reached forces at all times,"" he said.
Officials refused to discuss specifics of the plan of ensuring uninterrupted fuel supplies because of ""strategic reasons.""
""Please leave that to us,"" one of them said.
Officials said the plan is in place not just for ensuring fuel supplies but also for protecting oil assets like tankages storing fuel and refineries.
Some oil refineries on the west coast are provided air cover by the Indian Air Force and other installations are also being provided security, they said.
Oil companies to advance winter stocking to meet requirements of the Leh and Ladakh region in Jammu and Kashmir and forward areas of Himachal Pradesh which are cut off from the rest of the country due to snowfall.
Total fuels supplied this year was about 102,850 tonne (121,000 kilo litre). Ambala, Jalandhar, Sangrur and Bhatinda were the supply points that moved fuel to storage depots about 900 km away.

45,2019-03-01,IOC,"A 14.2-kg subsidised LPG cylinder will now cost  ₹495.61 in the national capital from March 1 as against  ₹493.53 currentlyPrior to this, prices had been reduced by a total of  ₹13.39 per cylinder

New Delhi: Domestic cooking gas (LPG) price was Thursday hiked by Rs2.08 per cylinder and non-subsidised gas by  ₹42.50 per bottle, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) said.
The increase comes after three straight monthly reduction in rates.
The rise has been necessitated due to tax impact on increased market rate of the fuel, IOC said in a statement. A 14.2-kg subsidised LPG cylinder will now cost  ₹495.61 in the national capital from March 1 as against  ₹493.53 currently.
Prior to this, prices had been reduced by a total of  ₹13.39 per cylinder.
IOC said non-subsidised or market-priced LPG rates have been hiked by  ₹42.50 per cylinder ""mainly due to change in international price and foreign exchange fluctuations.""	It will now cost  ₹701.50 per 14.2-kg cylinder in Delhi.
All LPG consumers buy the fuel at market price. The government, however, subsidises 12 cylinders of 14.2 kg each per households in a year by providing the subsidy amount directly in bank accounts of users.
This subsidy amount varies from month to month depending on the changes in the average international benchmark LPG rate and foreign exchange rate.
When international rates move up, the government provides a higher subsidy. And when they come down, subsidy is cut.
According to tax rules, the goods and services tax on LPG has to be calculated at the market rate of the fuel. The government may choose to subsidise a part of the price but tax will have to be paid at market rates.
So, with the rise in market price or non-subsidised LPG price, the tax incidence on subsidised cooking fuel has also increased, leading to the current price hike.
IOC said subsidy transfer has been increased to  ₹205.89 per cylinder in March 2019 as against  ₹165.47 in February.
Oil firms revise LPG price on 1st of every month."

NEW DELHI :
The government is likely to launch an additional offering of CPSE-Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) on March 19 to raise at least  ₹3,500 crore, officials said Tuesday.
The ETF sale through follow-on fund offer (FFO) will come with the option of retaining up to  ₹5,000 crore through green shoe option, they said.
""The additional offering of ETF would be on March 19. The base issue size has been fixed at  ₹3,500 crore, with an option to retain additional subscription,"" the officials said.
During the last offering in November, the government mopped up  ₹17,000 crore, the biggest disinvestment transaction through ETF.
The proceeds from the ETF sale will help the government move towards meeting the  ₹80,000 crore disinvestment target set for the current fiscal.
As on February 28, the government has realised  ₹56,473.32 crore as disinvestment proceeds against the target of  ₹80,000 crore during the current financial year (2018-19).
The CPSE (central public sector enterprises) ETF comprises shares of the 11 state-owned companies, including Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Coal India, Indian Oil Company, Oil India, Power Finance Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation and Bharat Electronics. NTPC, SJVN, NLC and NBCC are the new entrants in the ETF basket.
CPSE ETF was set up in 2014 and the government has so far sold stake in 10 companies in the basket in four tranches, raising  ₹28,500 crore.
NTPC carries the highest weight in the index at 19.59%, followed by Coal India at 19.17%, Indian Oil Corp at 18.98%, and ONGC at 18.92%."
41,2019-03-13,IOC,"Sources said the government is struggling to meet the revised fiscal deficit target of 3.4 % ONGC has told the government that it will need a SEBI approval if it has to pay a second interim dividend within a month

NEW DELHI :
Grappling a shortfall in tax revenues, the government has pressed cash-rich PSUs like Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) to pay a second interim dividend for the current fiscal after seeking regulatory nods.
While IOC has called a board meeting on 19 March to consider paying a second interim dividend, ONGC has declined saying it does not have surplus cash to make such payments within a month of an interim dividend payout, sources with direct knowledge of the development said.
As per regulations, a company cannot declare a second dividend within a month of the previous payout and companies like ONGC would need to seek an approval of the market regulator SEBI to make such a payment.
Sources said the government is struggling to meet the revised fiscal deficit target of 3.4 % in view of shortfall in Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections.
GST shortfall is likely to be around  ₹30,000-40,000 crore and a similar shortfall is expected in direct tax collections as well, they said.
In a regulatory filing, IOC said: ""A board meeting of the company is scheduled on Tuesday, 19 March, 2019...to consider declaration of 2nd interim dividend for the financial year 2018-19.""
IOC had in December declared  ₹6.75 per share interim dividend alongside a  ₹4,435 crore share buyback to help the government meet its revenue targets.
ONGC had announced an interim dividend of  ₹5.25 per equity share on February 14. It too had approved a  ₹4,022 crore share buyback.
Sources said ONGC has told the government that it will need a SEBI approval if it has to pay a second interim dividend within a month.
Also, it does not have surplus cash after payment of interim dividend and share buyback.
Sources said the government had two years back hurriedly got SEBI nod to get PSUs like IOC to pay a second interim dividend.
Last month, while presenting the annual budget for 2019-20, the government had revised upward its fiscal deficit target to 3.4 per cent of GDP for the current fiscal year from the previously estimated 3.3 per cent budgeted target.
In absolute terms, the fiscal deficit - the gap between the Centre's expenditure and revenue - has been pegged at  ₹6.34 lakh crore.
During April-January, fiscal deficit touched  ₹7.70 lakh crore, or 121.5 per cent of the budgeted target for the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2019, government data showed.
For the current fiscal, direct tax collection has been pegged at  ₹12 lakh crore while the revised estimate for GST collections has been put at  ₹6.43 lakh crore, which is lower than the targeted  ₹7.43 lakh crore.

40,2019-03-26,IOC,"Before the Gujarat and Karnataka state elections, the govt had asked oil companies to temporarily freeze the prices of petrol, diesel and other fuelsThe BJP-led NDA, if voted back to power, could allow oil companies to recover their losses post elections,  Moody's said in a report

New Delhi: Profitability of state-owned refiners such as Indian Oil Corp (IOC) may come under pressure if the government asks them to temporarily freeze the prices of petrol, diesel and other fuels ahead of general elections, Moody's Investors Service said Tuesday.
Before the Gujarat and Karnataka state elections, the government had asked oil companies to temporarily suspend the practice of adjusting the prices of petrol and diesel on a daily basis.
""Given India's upcoming general election in April-May, we expect the refiners' profitability may come under pressure if they are asked by the government to temporarily freeze the prices of petroleum products,"" Moody's said in a report.
The BJP-led NDA, if voted back to power, could allow oil companies to recover their losses post elections as it has done in previous state-level elections, it said.
""A change in government may expose the oil companies to a new set of challenges that are harder to anticipate because the oil and gas sector policy of other parties contesting in the elections is not yet clear.""
State-owned IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) had temporarily stopped revising fuel prices first in December 2017, ahead of assembly elections in Gujarat and then in April/May 2018 before Karnataka elections.
So far, they have continued to change prices on a daily basis.
India goes to polls in seven phases beginning April 11.
Moody's expects India's state-owned oil companies will continue to pay high dividends in the next fiscal year, which will be negative for refiners but the oil producers will not be as significantly affected.
In a report on the country's state-owned oil and gas companies, Moody's said: ""High shareholder returns will increase the oil companies' aggregate borrowings and constrain their credit profiles.""
It expected Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), IOC, Oil India Ltd (OIL) and BPCL to maintain high dividends payments as well as conduct share buybacks in fiscal 2020.
""High dividend payments will further stress the refiners' credit metrics at a time when refining margins have weakened and capital spending is high. We expect the regional refining margin, which has weakened significantly since June 2018, to meaningfully improve only in the second half of 2019,"" it said.
Refiners IOC and BPCL also need to invest in upgrading their refineries over the next 12-18 months to comply with tighter emission norms.
IOC, it said, is better positioned than BPCL to maintain its credit quality given its large scale and stronger credit metrics.
Moody's said despite the increase in dividends and share buybacks by the upstream companies ONGC and OIL, their total outflow to the government has significantly declined since 2015, because they have stopped sharing the country's fuel subsidy burden.
The companies will continue to invest in exploration and development activities, which will likely be funded with retained cash flow. As a result, their borrowings are unlikely to increase meaningfully.
Dividend payments will remain at a similar level in fiscal 2020 but share buyback amounts will likely fall as the oil companies' reduce their cash balances so that they do not qualify for share buybacks under the capital restructuring guidelines issued by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management in May 2016, it said.
ONGC and IOC are unlikely to conduct further share buybacks in fiscal 2020 as there needs to be at least a 12-month gap between two share buybacks. Both firms conducted buybacks in the current fiscal.
As per policy, all government-owned companies have to pay a minimum dividend of the higher of 30 per cent of the net income or 5 per cent of net worth. In addition, government-owned companies should look to pay maximum dividend permissible by law.
These firms have to conduct share buybacks if both net worth exceeds  ₹2,000 crore and cash and bank balances exceed  ₹1,000 crore.
Moody's said the oil companies' shareholder returns will provide the Government of India with the cash to meet its fiscal deficit target.
""The government has been increasing its reliance on the oil and gas sector as a source of revenue over the years. As oil prices fell in early 2016, the government imposed taxes on the production of petroleum products which accounted for about 24 per cent of government revenue for fiscal 2018.
""Following the recent increase in oil prices, the government had to cut these taxes to limit the impact of high prices on consumers in India. We believe the government is unlikely to raise these taxes so close to general elections in April and May 2019 because the taxes are ultimately passed on to end consumers,"" it said.
And so, dividend payments and share buybacks by the oil companies will continue to be a source of revenue for the government.
""High shareholder returns – because of government policy -- will increase the oil companies' borrowings and constrain their credit profiles, and upstream companies will be better positioned than the refiners to maintain credit quality,"" said Vikas Halan, a Moody's Senior Vice President.

MUMBAI :
Air passengers may have to spend more as oil marketing companies have increased the price of aviation turbine fuel (ATF).
ATF now costs  ₹63,472.22 per kilolitre in Delhi, up  ₹677 (over 1%) from  ₹62,795 per kl last month, according to the notification by the Indian Oil Corporation. A similar hike in the prices was seen in Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai.
""The 1% increase in ATF price is expected to affect air travel especially ahead of the peak travel season,"" said Sharat Dhall, COO (B2C), Yatra.com.
""The prices may fluctuate in short to medium term. But with capacity expansion underway there might be stabilisation as we head further into the travel season,"" Dhall said.
The prices are revised on the first day of every month.
Aloke Bajpai, CEO and Co-founder, Ixigo, said, ""With peak summer travel season round the corner and an ongoing capacity crunch due to grounding of planes, hike in ATF can lead to an increase in last-minute fares and aggrevate the increasing airfare situation seen since February.""
""But average domestic fares might normalise and even dip 15-20 per cent if attempts to get some grounded planes operational come through,"" Bajpai added.
The aviation sector is seeing flared-up fares due to capacity constraints caused by reasons like shortage of aircraft in the wake of grounding of Boeing MAX 737 globally over safety concerns.
Jet Airways might feel the pinch more given its ongoing struggle to stay afloat."
38,2019-04-09,IOC,"India, Iran's top oil client after China, was allowed to buy about 9 million barrels a monthSince November only state-run Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp, Hindustan Petroleum and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals have been buying Iranian oil

New Delhi: Indian refiners are holding back from ordering Iranian oil for loading in May pending clarity on whether Washington will extend a waiver from U.S. sanctions against the OPEC-member, four sources said.
In November, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and re-imposed broad economic sanctions.
Washington, however, gave a six-month waiver to eight nations including India, allowing them to import some Iranian oil until early May. India, Iran's top oil client after China, was allowed to buy about 9 million barrels a month.
India hopes to get clarity in seven to 10 days on any extension of the waiver, as well as the amount of oil that could be purchased if an extension is given, the sources said.
""We don't know about U.S. thinking, whether they will allow India to buy oil or not,"" said one of the sources, all of whom declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.
Under the current waiver, India can buy about 300,000 bpd of Iranian oil - about half the amount before the sanctions were imposed - and New Delhi wants to keep buying Iranian oil at that level, Indian sources said last month.
Since November only state-run Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp, Hindustan Petroleum and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals have been buying Iranian oil.
State-refiners and India's oil ministry did not respond to Reuters request for comments.
Brian Hook, the special U.S. envoy for Iran, in March said Washington is pursuing its plan to bring Iranian crude exports to zero. Last week Hook said three of eight importers granted waivers by Washington have cut shipments to zero.
""Sanctions against IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) have also added to the uncertainty over supply of Iranian oil ... in the current scenario when enough alternatives are available it is better to wait for a clarity,"" said another of the sources.
Trump on Monday designated Iran's Guards a foreign terrorist organization. Iran's president Rouhani said Tehran will resist U.S. pressure and hailed IRGC as defenders of Iranians.

NEW DELHI :
India imported about 5% more oil from Iran in the last fiscal year through March as companies raised purchases ahead of US sanctions against Tehran from November, preliminary tanker arrival data obtained from shipping and industry sources showed.
Despite Washington restricting India's purchases from Tehran, refiners shipped in about 479,500 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian oil in 2018/19 compared with about 458,000 bpd a year before, according to the data.
The United States introduced sanctions in November but gave a six-month waiver to eight nations, including India, which allowed them to import some Iranian oil.
India was allowed by Washington to continue to buy about 300,000 bpd oil until early May.
In March India's oil imports from Iran rose to about 405,000 bpd, about 56 percent higher than February, the data showed. March volumes were however about 6 percent lower than the purchase in the same month a year earlier.
A lack of ships delayed lifting of some cargoes to end-February, leading to higher arrivals in March, sources said. BPCL could not lift a cargo from Iran as tanker was not available, a company source said.
Since November, when India received the sanctions waiver, only state-run Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum Corp, Hindustan Petroleum and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals have been buying Iranian oil.
India's overall imports from Iran in 2018/19 were lower than the 500,000 bpd that Iran was hoping to sell to its second-biggest oil client after China. Indian refiners raised purchases from Iran in April-October 2018, drawn to almost free shipping and extended credit offered by Tehran to boost sales.
In the first quarter of 2019, India shipped in about 40 percent less oil from Iran at about 313,400 bpd, the data showed.
The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media.
Indian refiners have not yet placed orders to lift Iranian oil in May pending clarity on whether Washington will extend a the sanctions waiver.
India wants to keep buying Iranian oil at a level of 300,000 bpd, Indian sources said last month.
Refiners placed orders to buy 8 million barrels in April but India would receive higher volumes as some delayed cargoes of March arrive at Indian ports this month."

NEW DELHI :
State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) Tuesday said its research and development centre at Faridabad has become the first public sector oil and gas company to cross the milestone of filing 1,000 patents.
The Centre filed the 1,001st patent this week, the company said in a statement here.
""The R&D Centre's IP (Intellectual Property) portfolio comprises 794 active patents, of which 542 patents were granted abroad and 252 in India. The centre has also registered a healthy commercialisation rate for its patents, higher than the global average,"" it said.
Complimenting the R&D team for lending a competitive edge to IOC's business through innovative products, processes and technologies, company chairman Sanjiv Singh said several quality upgradation projects implemented at its refineries for production of ultra-clean BS-VI grde fuels are based on deep desulphurisation, isomerisation and dimerisation technology patents developed in-house.
IOC's internationally-awarded INDMAX technology patent, successfully commercialised at Paradip Refinery, improves LPG yields by 40 per cent besides ensuring the highest propylene yields in its class, the statement said adding the centre's bio-methanation technology is best-in-class in methane yields and is being implemented at the Namakkal (Tamil Nadu) plant for production of compressed bio-gas (CBG).
Established in 1972, the centre is a pioneer in downstream petroleum sector R&D and has received wide acclaim for indigenising lubricants technology by launching the SERVO brand. With over 5,000 formulations and over 800 active grades covering all conceivable applications, including rail-road and marine oils, SERVO has grown to be the largest selling lubricant brand in India.
From being the birth place of the highly successful, fuel-efficient 'Nutan' kerosene wick-stove in the late 70s, the R&D centre has come a long way in the past four decades.
According to SSV Ramakumar, Director (R&D), IOC, the centre has been focussing on developing high-quality, environment-friendly products and innovative refinery processes that boost resource efficiency, enhance refinery-petrochemicals integration, and offer flexibility in product pattern and yields in line with market demand.
With 50 per cent of its active patents in the refining category, followed by 16 per cent in bio-technology, the R&D team has made considerable progress even in the highly IP-crowded field of Ziegler-Natta catalysts, used in production of polymers (plastics). ""We have not only created white space here but succeeded in earning a rich haul of patent grants that are well recognised by global majors,"" he said.
In line with IOC's business objectives, the R&D centre has expanded its research domain to cover petrochemicals, nano-technology, alternative fuels, energy storage solutions and Hydrogen-based fuel cell research, among others, the statement added.

NEW DELHI :
State-run Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC) on Friday said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit surged 17% to  ₹6,099 crore, driven by higher exchange gains. IOC had reported a profit of  ₹5,218 crore in the corresponding year-ago period.
The state run fuel retailer posted a revenue of  ₹144,472 crore in the fourth quarter of 2018-19 as compared to  ₹136,716 crore in the corresponding year ago period.
This comes against the backdrop of diesel and petrol retail prices in the country remaining subdued as the elections for the 17th Lok Sabha are on. IOC and the two other state-run firms—Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd—has also refrained from raising prices while the Karnataka poll campaign was on.
Chairman Sanjiv Singh told reporters that the country’s largest refiner registered an annual revenue of  ₹605,924 crore in the financial year 2018-19, a 19.64% increase over  ₹506,428 crore revenue posted in 2017-18. The increase in revenue was on account of higher volumes and value of products sold. However, the net profit for the year fell by 21% to  ₹16,894 crore on account of exchange losses and lower inventory gain.
The gross refining margin— the difference between the cost of processing crude and the revenue earned from the sale of finished products—was $5.41 per barrel in 2018-19, against $8.49 per barrel in 2017-18.
IOC also registered  ₹2,655 crore as inventory gain in the quarter ended March.

Gains from the marketing segment helped state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) including Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd make up for the muted performance of the refining segment in the March quarter.
Marketing margins of OMCs for the March quarter were higher than expected, as these companies had not passed on the drop in product prices to customers, pointed out analysts from Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd.
But the good news could well end there on the marketing segment, especially since oil prices have now risen. “As OMCs have not taken the required price increases with increased oil/product prices, marketing margins seem to have declined in 1QFY20F,"" wrote Nomura analysts in a report on 21 May.
In the near term, the focus will be on how OMCs change petrol/diesel prices post-elections, added the brokerage firm.
Coming back to the March quarter results, gross refining margin (GRM), a key measure of profitability for refining firms, was rather muted after adjusting for inventory gains. The chart alongside has the details. In this backdrop, it was helpful that the marketing segment performed better.
But the worry is that the general refining environment may remain muted going ahead. For one, demand is not expected to be robust. Secondly, global refining capacity is expected to be higher. Both these factors are expected to keep refining margins in check.
It goes without saying that investors are likely to welcome any surprise improvement in refining margins.
The implementation of the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) new regulations from 2020 is expected to give a boost to margins.
Sure, OMC stocks have recovered from the lows seen in early October when the government had asked the companies to sacrifice a portion of their marketing margins. But, these shares have underperformed in the past one year vis-à-vis the Nifty 100 index, as earnings predictability has taken a knock.
According to ICICI Securities Ltd, the outlook for FY20 would depend on two factors. One, the strength of the new government, which would determine the outlook for auto fuel marketing margins. Two, “Whether IMO-mandated cut in sulphur content in marine fuel from Jan ’20 significantly boosts GRM,"" analysts from the brokerage firm wrote in a recent note.
Some analysts also worry about high debt levels at OMCs. In short, various uncertainties could well mean investors will look for refined gains elsewhere."
30,2019-05-22,IOC,"IOCL reported a 17% rise in its fourth quarter profit, driven by foreign exchange gainsThe key difference between the stages of BS norms is the amount of sulphur content in emissions

Mumbai: Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL), India's largest refiner and fuel retailer, has earmarked  ₹25,000 crore for 2019-20 to expand its operations, of which  ₹4,000 crore will be spent on BS-VI upgradation, IOCL told analysts after its fourth-quarter results announced on 17 May. At  ₹25,000 crore, the capex is down 5.6% year-on-year.
""Capex this year is only  ₹25,000 crores and with robust internal accruals that we are predicting, we are estimating probably we will have a marginal growth in debt,"" the IOCL management said in a conference call for analysts.
On 17 May, IOCL reported a 17% rise in its fourth quarter profit, driven by foreign exchange gains. Profit rose to  ₹6,099 crore in Jan-March from  ₹5,218 crore in the year-ago period. Revenue from operations grew 5.6% to  ₹1,44,472 crore.
The company reported foreign exchange gains worth  ₹837 crore during the quarter compared to a loss of  ₹676 crore in the corresponding period in the previous fiscal.
During the quarter under review, gross refining margin or what a refiner makes from processing a barrel of crude fell to $4.09 from $9.12 a year ago. Inventory gains for Jan-March quarter fell to  ₹2,655 crore from  ₹3,428 crore a year earlier.
However, IOCL reported a significant rise in debt due to outstanding dues from the government.
""The company’s debt has increased substantially from  ₹580 bn to  ₹860 bn owing to outstanding dues from the government of about  ₹100 bn, higher capex, and higher working capital needs. The management expects debt to be in the range of  ₹700 bn- ₹750 bn once the dues are cleared by the government,"" said IDBI Capital in its report dated 21 May.
BS VI is the sixth stage of the Bharat Stage Emission norms that will come into effect on 1 April 2020. Fashioned on the lines of European emission norms, these guidelines will lay out stringent emission norms for vehicles.
The key difference between the stages of BS norms is the amount of sulphur content in emissions. While BS IV-compliant vehicles release 50 parts per million sulphur, BS VI compliant vehicles will release only 10 parts per million sulphur."

New Delhi: ONGC, India's top oil and gas producer, has toppled Indian Oil Corp (IOC) to regain crown of being the country's most profitable public sector company.
According to earnings statements of the listed companies, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) reported a 34% jump its in 2018-19 fiscal net profit to  ₹26‎,716 crore. In comparison, IOC registered a net profit of  ₹17.274 crore for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. ONGC, in the previous two financial years, had lost the most profitable PSU tag to IOC.
With its refining margins under pressure due to falling oil prices, IOC had also lost the title of being India's largest company by turnover tag to billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries in FY19.
IOC had in the previous 2017-18 fiscal posted a record net profit of  ₹21,346 crore. That year ONGC had a net profit of  ₹19,945 crore.
Reliance has been India's most profitable company for the fourth year in a row. RIL, which was about half the size of IOC till about a decade back but its bet on burgeoning consumer base and foray into new businesses such as telecom, retail, and digital services vastly expanded its business, clocked a net profit of  ₹39,588 crore in FY19.
Reliance in the 2018-19 reported a turnover of  ₹6.23 lakh crore. In comparison, IOC posted a turnover of  ₹6.17 trillion for the fiscal, according to regulatory filings by the two companies.
It is now India's biggest firm in terms of revenue, profit and market capitalisation.
With strong refining margin and robust retail business, Reliance clocked a 44% rise in revenue in FY19 over the previous year and posted a compounded annual growth rate of over 14% between FY10 and FY19. In contrast, IOC turnover rose 20% in FY19 and 6.3% during FY10 and FY19.
Interestingly, Reliance which boasts of the highest cash reserves of  ₹1.33 trillion on the book, also has the highest gross debt of  ₹2.87 trillion at the end of March 2019.
In contrast, IOC had short and long-term loans totalling  ₹92,700 crore. ONGC had a debt of abo‎ut  ₹20,000 crore."

Kuala Lumpur: Growth in India's demand for gasoline and jet fuel is expected to slow slightly this year, the head of the country's largest refiner said on Tuesday, as prospects for world trade deteriorate.
""Growth in the first six months ""has been slightly subdued because of many different reasons including monsoon impact,"" Indian Oil Corp Chairman Sanjiv Singh told Reuters.
IOC's Singh said overall demand will remain at 4% to 4.5%.
""Anything between 4% and 4.5% is fairly decent,"" he said.
Still, the growth rate could be lowest for the country since fiscal year 2013-2014, according to government data, a sign that demand in India, one of the two pillars driving global oil consumption growth other than China, is slowing.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) has revised down its 2019 oil demand growth estimate by 100,000 barrels to 1.2 million barrels per day due to the worsening prospects for world trade, although stimulus packages and developing countries should boost growth going into 2020.
Simon Flowers, chief analyst at Wood Mackenzie said at the Asia Oil and Gas Conference on Tuesday that further US tariffs on Chinese goods could cut global oil demand growth by 400,000 bpd by 2020.
Demand for gasoline and jet fuel demand is expected to rise by 7-8% this year, Singh said, down from rates of 9-10% in the previous year.
Diesel consumption could increase by 3% this year, which is ""still a decent growth,"" IOC's Singh said on the sidelines of the conference.
The country's plans to add smaller airports to improve domestic transport systems will drive appetite for jet fuel, he added.
The nation is preparing to raise its fuel quality to so-called Euro 6 standards from Euro 4 from April 2020 to fight pollution. Several refineries in India are scheduled to shut throughout 2019 to prepare for the upgrade.
India could increase fuel imports slightly during the refinery shutdowns, Singh added.
IOC, along with other refiners in India, have halted Iranian oil imports because of US sanctions.
""All of our supplies have optional (additional) volumes so depending on availability month to month, we source extra oil from other suppliers,"" Singh said.
""Saudi percentage will be a little more because they have a little more spare capacity compared to others.""
IOC, which has term contracts with US oil sellers, is also open to buying more spot cargoes but this will depend on economics, Singh said."

Equities likely to remain sluggish; bank stocks in focus

Indian stock markets may remain under pressure on Wednesday following weak global cues.
Asian equities were subdued in early trade on Wednesday, rattled by fresh trade war concern following President Donald Trump’s threats to Beijing, while increasing worries about a no-deal Brexit kept the sterling pound under pressure.
Later in the day, the US Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis more than a decade ago. The expected easing has supported sentiment for riskier assets worldwide.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.04%, while Japan's Nikkei slid 0.84%. Major Wall Street stock averages ended slightly lower on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 losing 0.26%, after Trump warned China against waiting out his current presidential term before finalizing a trade deal.
As a new round of US-China trade negotiations started in Shanghai, Trump tweeted that if he wins the re-election in November 2020, the outcome could be no agreement or a harsher one.
The S&P 500 index has risen 2.4% so far this month, bolstered by expectation of a Fed easing.
Fed funds rate futures are now fully pricing in a 25 basis point rate cut on Wednesday and another 25 basis point reduction by September. US consumer spending and prices rose moderately in June, pointing to slower economic growth and benign inflation that cemented expectation of a rate cut by the Fed.
Back home, companies including like Eicher Motors, Indian Oil Corporation, UPL, Ashok Leyland, Apollo Tyres, Zee Media Corporation, Allahabad Bank, and Tata Global Beverages, among others, will declare June quarter results today.
Back stocks will likely remain in focus as Coffee Day Enterprises incident may deepen the liquidity crisis.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Tuesday relaxed norms for end-use of money raised through external commercial borrowings (ECBs). The central bank said ECBs with a minimum average maturity period of seven years can be availed for repayment of rupee loans availed domestically for capital expenditure as also by non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) for on-lending for the same purpose.
In the currency market, the British pound remained near a 28-month low hit the previous day on growing concern about a disorderly Brexit.
The pound sterling traded at $1.216, up 0.13% so far today, but not far from $1.2120 marked on Tuesday. It has fallen 4.2% so far this month, on course to log its worst monthly performance since October 2016.
Other major currencies were less volatile with the yen flat at 108.58 yen to the dollar. The euro stood little changed at $1.1158.
Oil prices held firm near two-week high after 2% gains on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI :
State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) have got two new directors on their respective boards to replace ones superannuating.
ONGC in a statement said Rajesh Kumar Srivastava has taken over as the new director (exploration), replacing A K Dwivedi who superannuated last week.
Separately, IOC said Sandeep Kumar Gupta has taken over as the director (finance) of the company. He replaces A K Sharma who retired from service in May.
A postgraduate from Lucknow University with a Masters Degree in Engineering Geology from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, Srivastava joined ONGC as a geologist in 1984 at Krishna Godavari Basin, Rajahmundry.
Gupta, a commerce graduate and a chartered accountant by qualification, was executive director (corporate finance) at IOC's Corporate Office prior to his elevation. He was also functioning as the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer-in-charge of Corporate Accounts, Treasury, Investment Appraisal and Risk Management.

24,2019-08-08,IOC,"Compared to its peer Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, HPCL reported a weak set of results, says NomuraHPCL’s marketing margin wasn’t encouraging as well, moderating quite a bit on a sequential basis

State-run oil refining and marketing company Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd’s (HPCL) June quarter results are nothing to write home about. Net profit of  ₹811 crore missed Bloomberg’s consensus estimate of  ₹1,002.5 crore.
“Compared to its peer Indian Oil Corp. Ltd that reported strong results last week, HPCL reported a weak set of results,"" said brokerage firm Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd. “Higher inventory loss was one reason for the miss (IOC had reported inventory gains), but adjusted for inventory loss, both refining and marketing earnings were weaker.""
HPCL’s Ebitda of  ₹1644 crore too was below forecast. Gross refining margin (GRM) stood at $0.75 per barrel in April-June compared with $7.15 per barrel for the same period last year. GRM is a key measure of profitability for refining companies and refers to the realisation from turning a barrel of crude oil into finished products. Adjusted for inventory loss, HPCL’s core GRM worked out to be $3.3 a barrel. Indian Oil had reported a core GRM of $3.6 per barrel.
HPCL’s marketing margin wasn’t encouraging as well, moderating quite a bit on a sequential basis. “Gross marketing margin, adjusted for inventory losses, came in at $8.9 per barrel (versus $13.8 a barrel in 4Q and our estimate of $9.8 per barrel),"" wrote Nomura analysts in a report on 8 August.
Going ahead, investors would do well to follow the trend in the refining environment and whether margins improve. In this context, the extent of gains that play out from the International Maritime Organization’s 2020 rules, which require ships to use fuel oil with lower sulphur content, will be crucial to watch out for. Additionally, whether these companies are able to pass on higher crude oil prices to consumers is worth tracking.
In the past one month, the shares of HPCL have declined by over 10%. Analysts reckon, valuations of the HPCL stock are not demanding. Slower than expected pace of recovery in refining margins is a key risk from investors’ point of view."
23,2019-08-28,IOC,"Indian Oil Corporation, along with Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum, had stopped jet fuel supplies to Air India at six airportsFrom IOC's point of view, it is a big call as it is a commitment beyond business and that is why it has been supporting the national carrier so far

MUMBAI :
 Indian Oil chairman on Wednesday defended cutting jet fuel supplies to the flag carrier Air India at six airports over non-payment saying that the national oil refiner is not a cash-surplus company.
Last week, Indian Oil Corporation, along with Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum, had stopped jet fuel supplies to Air India at six airports--Kochi, Pune, Patna, Ranchi, Vizag and Mohali--over payment defaults, which amounted to around  ₹4,500 crore and pending since the past 240 days.
The supplies are yet to be resumed even after a week.
""We ourselves are borrowing around  ₹75,000 crore annually; that means we are a net borrower and not a cash- surplus company. To support credit to Air India, we need to borrow from markets,"" chairman Sanjiv Singh told reporters.
He said IOC provides 90 days credit to Air India but the dues have been mounting and this must be 240 days now.
""So the total dues to us, including interest, is more than  ₹2,900 crore. Although we don't take any formal bank guarantee from a public sector entity which we do from private airlines, now we are a little worried and cannot continuously support the airline,"" Singh explained.
He further said, ""the decision to stop the fuel supply was not to cause any discomfort to the passengers but was to primarily indicate that IOC cannot continue to give credit indefinitely.""
From IOC's point of view, it is a big call as it is a commitment beyond business and that is why it has been supporting the national carrier so far.
""We feel we have given them the right signal, but this was after a lot of follow-up with them. Unfortunately, we are still not seeing any improvement in Air India which is fighting its own problems as well,"" Singh added."
22,2019-08-29,IOC,"He also said it was clear that there should be total privatisation of the national airlineThis is a second attempt by the Modi government to privatise the cash-strapped Air India. Its efforts to sell 76 per cent stake failed in 2018

NEW DELHI :
Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Thursday that people are very interested in acquiring national carrier Air India and he has been receiving calls from all over the world in this regard.
He also said it was clear that there should be total privatisation of the national airline and ""we have to get the best possible deal"" in the shortest time available.
This is a second attempt by the Modi government to privatise the cash-strapped Air India. Its efforts to sell 76 per cent stake failed in 2018.
""Are people interested in acquiring Air India? I would say yes. Very much so. Why are they keen on acquiring it?...(Because) it is a first rate airline, and whoever acquires it will be very fortunate and well...he will be (able to) run it according to private sector principles,"" the minister told a press conference here after a media workshop for civil aviation correspondents.
After analysing the Air India's disinvestment process of 2018, the then transaction adviser 'EY' in its report cited the government retaining 24 per cent stake and corresponding rights and high debt as reasons for the failure of the disinvestment process.
The minister said on Thursday, ""The interest has to be expressed in a formal manner after the Expression of Interest has been released. A lot of people come to Pradeep (Kharola). they come to Ashwini (Lohani), they come and speak to me, and I get calls from all over the world.""
Pradeep Singh Kharola is Secretary in the Ministry of Civil Aviation. Ashwani Lohani is the Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) for Air India.
The Central government is expected to release the Expression of Interest by October to invite formal bids.
""It is very clear that there should be a total privatisation. We have to get the best possible deal. And we have to get it in the shortest time available. We will not be doing any wavering of the kind that we witnessed earlier where we found a situation in which we hold back 24 per cent,"" Puri said.
In 2018-19, Air India incurred losses of around  ₹7,600 crore. By the end of 2018-19, it had a debt burden of around  ₹58,300 crore.
About the failed disinvestment process of 2018, the minister said, ""There are lessons to be learnt. If you go down that route once, and if you encounter obstacles or there are perceptions of lack of success, surely you subject that to clinical and professional analysis. You get consultants to look at. You yourself look at it that what is it that went wrong.""
Oil marketing companies led by Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) last week stopped supplying fuel to Air India's aircraft at Kochi, Pune, Patna, Ranchi, Visakhapatnam and Mohali airports over payment defaults, amid their combined dues mounting to around  ₹5,000 crore.
On this matter, the minister said, ""Air India has got a severe backlog of debt which it is trying to service. All the fuel that the airline is picking at a daily basis, it is paying for. The issue here is that of back bill.""
""Airline operations are going on very well (currently). There are no disruptions. Wherever there were issues, they are looking for a letter of comfort. I have told the Air India CMD to provide that letter of comfort,"" he added.
On July 3, Puri had said in the Rajya Sabha that the government was committed to the disinvestment of Air India and the plan is to make it more operationally viable before stake sale.

21,2019-09-03,IOC,"The Negative macroeconomic data led to a steep correction in Indian equitiesThe rupee also depreciated sharply against the US dollar on economic growth woes

Market participants had a tough time digesting the slew of negative macroeconomic data served over the weekend. And, the sharp fall in Indian stock market indices mirrors that pain very well.
The Nifty and the Sensex shed more than 2% each on Tuesday, pushing the fear gauge India VIX (volatility index) up 11% to the 18-mark. Global cues weren’t very supportive either, with the Asian markets closing on a mixed note. But the decline in Indian stocks was largely due to domestic concerns.
Analysts say while the market may have factored in most of the poor data, fresh buying may not come in a hurry.
“There are media reports that the government may sell its stake in BPCL (Bharat Petroleum Corp.) to IOC (Indian Oil Corp.), which has further weighed on sentiments because this route of privatization will weaken the buying profit-making government entity. Investors feel that the government’s actions in responding to economic woes are not sufficient. They also need to be more pre-emptive with their measures. That said, most negative data has been factored in after today’s steep fall. However, investors may not be in a hurry to make large fresh investments, for now,"" said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities Ltd.
Sharing a similar view, Dhananjay Sinha, head of strategy and chief economist at IDFC Securities Ltd, said: “For equities, selling pressure from foreign institutional investors continues. Feedback from mutual fund distributors indicates that retail investors are wary of investing right now. Value erosion has happened in midcap and smallcap space, where mutual funds haven’t performed well. So, the appetite for fresh investments remains low.""
Not just the equity indices, the rupee also took a knock, weighed down by growth concerns. The Indian currency depreciated sharply against the greenback, sliding past the 72-mark once again. It ended Tuesday’s session at a nine-month low of 72.39/US dollar (USD).
“The current valuation of Nifty at PEG (price earnings to growth ratio) of 5 times indicates that multiples haven’t moderated much despite the recent correction. However, the Indian rupee has convincingly crossed the 72/USD mark, indicating that risk aversion is happening. Given the economic woes, we foresee depreciation in the rupee to around 74/USD in the near term,"" added Sinha of IDFC Securities.
The June quarter gross domestic product data, which was released on 30 August, was much below expectations. That apart, lower goods and services tax collections for August, falling auto sales, manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index survey and subdued core sector growth data, pointed to further stress in the economy.
Also, D-Street wasn’t too impressed with the government’s move to consolidate 10 public sector banks into four entities. Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said this was unlikely to revive credit growth to the liquidity-starved non-banking financial companies or have meaningful cost synergies."
20,2019-09-05,IOC,"These stocks have been hammered ever since the govt announced plans to raise over  ₹1 trillion through divestmentsDivestments tend to cause a spike in free-floats

Low valuations and high dividend yield did not quite prove to be the mantra to generate returns for investors in stocks of state-run companies. On the contrary, public sector unit stocks have been facing rough weather. The Nifty PSE index has lost 15.6% in the last two months. During that time, the Nifty 500 index fell about 9.6%. PSE is public sector enterprise.
In that backdrop, the rebound in these shares on Thursday is a welcome development. A news report that the government is reviewing divestment through the exchange-traded fund (ETF) route provided the much-needed breather for public sector unit stocks. The Nifty PSE index gained 3.1% on Thursday. Some of the gainers in the index were the stocks of Coal India Ltd (7.3%), Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (5.3%), and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (4.5%).
These stocks have been hammered ever since the budget announcement that the government plans to raise more than  ₹1 trillion through divestments—one of its largest divestment programmes. In fact, in the last four fiscal years, the government divested stocks worth about  ₹78,000 crore through several divestments in both the CPSE ETF and the Bharat 22 ETF.
As divestments go, the free-float of stocks increased. Divestments tend to cause a spike in free-floats. Both institutional and retail investors lap up the offerings made through the ETF route because of arbitrage opportunities. As public sector unit divestments have often been made at a small discount to prevailing market prices, they generate considerable interest from investors. The retained oversubscription in such cases then eventually finds its way into the equity market.
Public shareholding in Coal India increased from 21.6% in June 2018 to 29.04% in the same month of 2019. The public float of Indian Oil Corp. Ltd’s stock increased from 43.25% to 47.82% in the same period.
“PSU stocks’ free-floats have increased appreciably in the past few years as investors used to invest in ETFs and redeem the units in the market. PSUs have seen an increase in their public floats, and that has been weighing heavily on these stocks. Postponing the divestment in a weak market may bring some relief, though we have yet to see how much divestment will be done at a later stage,"" said a market strategist at a domestic brokerage firm, who did not want to be named.
As such, much would depend on when and which listed companies make the next tranche of divestments, particularly considering that the broader markets have been weak. Given enough time before the next divestment, perhaps some of these stocks may be able to outperform for now."
19,2019-09-13,IOC,"Government selling its BPCL stake to IOC can create a monopoly in the oil marketing businessPrivatization would realize a higher price and may help take politics out of auto fuel pricing

The government has set a tall divestment target of  ₹1.05 trillion for FY20. Needless to say, it would need to sell stakes in some of the large public sector companies to achieve the target.
Here, state-run oil marketing and refining company, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), seems to be on the radar. Earlier this month, a Business Standard report said that the government is considering selling its entire stake worth over  ₹40,000 crore in BPCL. Of course, like similar such deals in the recent past, the stake sale will most likely be to another government-owned entity, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC).
But there is a twist to this tale. CNBC-TV18 reported that the finance ministry has raised objections on the government’s stake sale to IOC, as it can create a monopoly in the oil marketing business (see chart). So will the government consider selling its stake to a private sector firm?
A moot question then is whether the privatization of BPCL would be a good thing for investors. “Privatisation would realise a higher price, may help take politics out of auto fuel pricing, would ensure IOC’s ability to pay hefty dividend to the government of India is not impaired and may improve market sentiment as it would be seen as big bang reforms,"" said analysts from ICICI Securities Ltd in a note to clients.
Besides, as analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd point out, the real price discovery of BPCL will happen with a stake sale to foreign/private sector firms.
The government had earlier sold its stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) to Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd at a roughly 18% premium to prevailing prices. Prabhudas Lilladher analysts believe the premium can be much higher in the case of privatization.
HPCL along with BPCL and IOC are commonly referred to as oil marketing companies.
Moreover, a merger with IOC will create an unusually large behemoth in the energy sector. According to ICICI Securities, BPCL’s stake sale to IOC would further raise the latter’s market share dominance in transportation fuels, which may discourage proposed private sector investment in these areas.
While investors closely watch how this story develops, the recent strength in gross refining margins is encouraging to say the least.
More recently, investors have taken note of the improved refining environment. BPCL and HPCL shares have risen 23% and 16%, respectively, in the past three weeks thanks to the improvement in gross refining margins.
Still, valuations are subdued, having corrected substantially since end- 2017. According to analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, “Valuations are not demanding vis-à-vis historical averages; the government of India (GoI) stake sale overhang remains."""

After a lacklustre start, the 30-share BSE Sensex saw buying momentum in late-afternoon trade to close 280.71 points, or 0.76 per cent, higher at 37,384.99.
On similar lines, the broader NSE Nifty settled 93.10 points, or 0.85 per cent, higher at 11,075.90.
During the week, the Sensex advanced 403.22 points or 1.09 per cent, while the Nifty gained 129.70 points or 1.18 per cent.
According to official data released post market hours on Thursday, retail inflation inched up marginally to 3.21 per cent in August, while industrial production growth slowed to 4.3 per cent in July, raising chances of a rate cut by the RBI next month.
Top gainers in the Sensex pack included Vedanta, ICICI Bank, ONGC, Kotak Bank, Axis Bank, SBI, M&M, Infosys, PowerGrid, HCL Tech, NTPC, Bajaj Finance and Reliance Industries, rising up to 2.72 per cent
On the other hand, Bharti Airtel, Sun Pharma, HDFC Bank, Yes Bank, ITC and HUL were among the losers, shedding up to 1.35 per cent.
""Subdued inflation kept hopes alive for rate cut and positive vibes to support the auto sector lifted the markets. Broad based recovery in rate sensitive stocks fuelled domestic market while additional policy measures from European Central bank powered global peers,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.
Sectorally, BSE oil and gas, energy, metal, realty, utilities, bankex, power, auto and IT stocks ended up to 2.73 per cent higher.
Oil marketing companies led gains on the blue-chip index, with Bharat Petroleum Corp closing up 6.34% and Indian Oil Corp ending 4.58% higher, as oil prices slipped to around $60 a barrel on Friday.
However, telecom and healthcare dropped up to 0.94 per cent. Indiabulls Housing Finance was the top loser and closed 1.59% lower.
Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices settled up to 0.82 per cent higher.
Bourses in Hong Kong and Japan ended significantly higher amid signs of easing trade war tensions between the US and China.

Petrol prices have soared by  ₹1.59 a litre and diesel by  ₹1.31 in the last six days -- the most since daily price revision was introduced in 2017, as a massive strike at Saudi Arabian oil facilities jolted oil markets.
Petrol price was on Sunday hiked by 27 paise to  ₹73.62 a litre in the Delhi market -- the benchmark for national rates, according to a price notification by state-owned oil firms.
Price of diesel was increased by 18 paise to  ₹66.74 per litre in Delhi.
This is the sixth straight daily increase and has taken the cumulative price hike since September 17 to  ₹1.59 per litre in case of petrol and  ₹1.31 for diesel.
Global oil prices shot up the most since the Gulf war in the immediate aftermath of the unprecedented drone missile strikes on key oil facilities in Saudi Arabia that disabled 5 per cent of the global supply.
Oil prices have cooled since the spike on September 16 but remain on the edge.
Attackers using low-flying drones and cruise missiles knocked out 5.7 million barrels of production, or about 60 per cent of what Saudi Arabia currently produces. It was the largest supply disruption in history. On Monday, Brent oil futures soared 15 per cent.
Analysts have warned that the style of the attacks on Saudi Aramco's Abqaiq and Khurais oil facilities may add a permanent risk premium to oil and gasoline prices.
While Saudi Arabia is saying it can quickly bring supply back online, experts say the shock to the global oil market will be felt for years.
India depends on Saudi Arabia for a fifth of its oil imports and has been in constant touch with Kingdom officials on securing its supplies.
Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Thursday spoke to Saudi Arabia's new oil minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman to discuss the supply plan. Saudi Arabia, according to Pradhan, has assured India of meeting all its committed oil supplies.
Saudi Arabia, which is India's second-largest oil supplier, sells close to 2 million tonnes of crude every month. Of this, 1.2-1.3 million tonnes of supplies for September have already been taken and the rest too has been assured.
However, Saudi has sought deferment of some LPG supplies, but they have assured to make up for all the quantities, Indian Oil Corp (IOC) Chairman Sanjiv Singh said, adding any shortfall can be bought from Qatar.
Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) has already tendered for import of LPG in October, possibly to make up for the shortfall from Saudi Arabia.
India buys around 2,00,000 tonnes of LPG every month from Saudi Arabia.
Industry sources said Saudi Arabia has cut throughput at its refineries to meet its crude oil supply commitments.
India imports 83 per cent of its oil needs, with Saudi Arabia supplying a fifth of the purchases. Saudi Arabia is its second-biggest supplier after Iraq. It sold 40.33 million tonnes of crude oil to India in 2018-19 fiscal, when the country had imported 207.3 million tonnes of oil.
China, South Korea, Japan and India are the biggest takers of the Saudi oil in Asia, with China and Japan leading the pack at an average of 900-1,100 kilo barrels per day each. India could be most exposed as its reserves are the lowest."

Indian Oil has taken a step that can help in solving one of the biggest problems that the common man is facing in his daily life. The issue of how to dispose of single-use plastic.
The research and development wing of the oil firm has carried out test on to make road with bituminous concrete mixed with single-use plastic waste.
The R&D Centre of Indian Oil has the effect of shredded waste plastic on bituminous concrete. According to the reports available, the waste plastic roads have the advantages of higher strength, increased durability, lesser rain water seepage due to plastic in the aggregates, better binding/bonding of mix and lesser stripping with less potholes.
A 850 meters of road outside Indian Oil R&D Centre in Faridabad was chosen as the testing area in Faridabad.
The test was conducted with varying concentrations (1%-3%) of single use plastic and to see its effects for paving bituminous roads.
According to press release by the company, about 16 MT of waste plastic was used to carry out the test. The products used were single-use carry bags/packaging film waste. The R&D department will monitor the stretch along with the CSIR-CRRI’s association and will also fine-tune the concentration of single-use plastics.
The plastic road was inspected and test launched for use by Dr. SSV Ramakumar, Director (R&D), Indian Oil and other IndianOil officials on Wednesday at Faridabad.
The project to use plastic in the building of roads was a part of the initiative by the Indian Oil to reduce, reuse and recycle plastics.
The company also announced its another initiative was the introduction of Soluble Bitumen Poly Bags for bitumen filling which was produced from 100% single-use waste plastic, which solubilise fully in the bitumen at the time of road paving."

ExxonMobil India LNG Limited, an affiliate of ExxonMobil, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IndianOil), to expanding its liquefied natural gas (LNG) business initiatives in the country.
""The companies together will focus on exploring new models of delivering cost-effective natural gas in India where it is most needed to complement traditional pipelines,"" said ExxonMobil in a press statement.
“What really matters is how we accelerate India’s access to affordable, cleaner energy,"" said Bill Davis, Lead Country Manager, South Asia, ExxonMobil. “We see great potential here, and are delighted to join forces with IndianOil to unlock lasting value for India,"" he added.
IndianOil is India’s largest state-owned downstream petroleum company by earnings. Its core businesses are refining, transportation, and marketing of petroleum products. Over the years, IndianOil has not only expanded in the downstream gas marketing in India but also ventured into petrochemicals.
ExxonMobil has been delivering natural gas to India for nearly two decades, it said.
Gas currently accounts for just under 6% of energy demand in India. The government plans to increase this share to 15% by 2030.
According to Wood Mackenzie forecast, LNG demand will double from some 37 billion m3 in 2018 to reach 75 billion m3 by 2030, equivalent to 7% of the energy mix. LNG will meet approximately 50% of this demand growth, providing a major growth opportunity for Total."

NEW DELHI :
State-owned oil companies on Tuesday accused Air India of not honouring its commitment to pay  ₹100 crore every month to clear overdue ATF outstanding of over  ₹5,000 crore and will be forced to snap supplies at major airports from Friday if no solution is offered.
""Air India had back in June and again in September agreed to pay the three oil marketing companies  ₹100 crore every month to clear past ATF dues. But unfortunately it hasn't met its commitment,"" said Sandeep Kumar Gupta, Director (Finance), Indian Oil Corp (IOC).
IOC and two other oil marketing companies, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), have served a notice on Air India that they will be forced to stop jet fuel (ATF) supplies if payments are not made, he said.
The monthly payment was besides the airline being put on cash-and-carry where it was given fuel only against cash payment.
""We have said we will stop supplies at major airports. Let's see what is the outcome of negotiations before the October 18 deadline,"" Gupta said.
Air India owes IOC about  ₹2,700 crore in unpaid fuel bills. This includes  ₹450 crore of interest. It's outstanding towards the three oil firms is about  ₹5,000 crore including interest.
Gupta said the oil companies haven't indicated the airports where supplies will be stopped but they will be major airports, unlike the six small airports where fuel supplies to Air India aircraft were stopped in August.
Supplies were resumed last month after Air India committed to paying  ₹100 crore every month to oil firms to clear past dues, he said adding Air India buys about  ₹13-14 crore worth of fuel every day from IOC.
IOC controls about 50 per cent of the market share.
August 22, IOC, BPCL and HPCL had stopped fuel supplies to Air India at six airports of Kochi, Mohali, Pune, Patna, Ranchi and Vizag over payment defaults.
However, after the intervention of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, they resumed fuel supply on September 7.
On October 5, the oil companies had told Air India that if it did not make the monthly lump sum payment, they will stop fuel supply from October 11 at ""six major domestic airports"". Subsequently, Air India wrote to them requesting not to stop the fuel supply.
The OMCs wrote back on Thursday itself, stating that ""while we are in receipt of your letter dated 10th October 2019, requesting OMCs against stoppage of fuel supply, it has been observed that no timelines have been mentioned with respect to the lump sum payment"".
""However, taking into consideration your request, we are deferring our decision to suspend supplies to October 18, 2019,"" they said.
The OMCs requested the national carrier to adhere to its commitment to making lump sum payment towards ""overdue outstanding, failing which we will be reviewing our decision and stop supplies as per above notice"".
In Thursday's letter, they mentioned that the ""commitment towards daily payment has been mostly adhered to by Air India... the outstanding has not come down considerably in the absence of the committed monthly lump sum payment"".
The Centre is planning to initiate the process of divestment of its stake in Air India, which has a debt of over  ₹60,000 crore, from November this year. In 2018-19, the national carrier posted a net loss of around  ₹8,400 crore.‎

The government on Wednesday opened up fuel retailing norms, allowing non-oil companies to set up petrol pumps to increase competition.
Briefing reporters about the decisions taken by the Cabinet, I&B Minister Prakash Javadekar said the opening up the fuel retailing will increase investment and competition.
At present, to obtain a fuel retailing licence in India, a company needs to invest  ₹2,000 crore in either hydrocarbon exploration and production, refining, pipelines or liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals.

SBI: Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Wednesday pitched analysts for a higher valuation of the bank’s enterprise value, asking them to take into account the growth prospects of its subsidiaries and better-than-expected performance in the fiscal ending March 2021 due to improvement in asset quality and higher growth.
RIL: Reliance Jio on Wednesday said the Cellular Operators Association of India’s plea to the government seeking relief for the sector after an unfavourable Supreme Court verdict on the definition of adjusted gross revenue is “unwarranted"" and does not “represent the industry view by any stretch of imagination"".
IndiGo: Budget carrier IndiGo, owned and operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, has joined the International Air Transport Association as a member on Wednesday. The move will help the airline develop strong partnerships in international markets and help it align with global practices. Air India and SpiceJet are already members of the global trade association.
Bharti Airtel: The telecom operator has no plan to shut down its 2G network, which continues too generate “substantial revenue"". Chief Executive Gopal Vittal said older devices do not have VoLTE or Voice Over Long-Term Evolution integration, which is a standard for high-speed wireless communication for mobile phones.
Vodafone Idea: Shares may be in focus due to talks of the company shutting down its India operations. According to an IANS report, the telecom regulatory world is abuzz with talks of Vodafone Idea exiting India. Meanwhile, traders fear that the company may end up in bankruptcy as the penalty levied in the adjusted gross revenue case is higher than the cash on its books.
United Bank: Shares gained 20% on Wednesday after the bank reported a profit of  ₹124 crore during July-September due to lower provisions and healthy growth in net interest income compared with a loss of  ₹883.2 crore in the same period last year. Asset quality also improved sequentially. Net interest income grew by 74.6% on year to  ₹773 crore in the quarter ended September.
TVS Motor: The auto company has collaborated with Cadisa Group, which has a large business presence across South-American nations Guatemala and El Salvador. Cadisa will facilitate the opening of 15 flagship outlets for TVS Motor Company Ltd in a phase-wise manner.

10,2019-10-31,IOC,"Without accounting for inventory losses, the GRM was $3.99 per barrel in Q2Net profit in July-September at  ₹564 crore was 82.6% lower than  ₹3,247 crore net profit in the year-ago period

NEW DELHI :
State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) on Thursday reported an 83% drop in second quarter net profit on the back of slump in refinery margins and inventory losses.
Net profit in July-September at  ₹564 crore was 82.6% lower than  ₹3,247 crore net profit in the year-ago period, IOC Chairman Sanjiv Singh told reporters here.
""The major reason for the decline in net profit was inventory losses in Q2 as against inventory gain during corresponding quarter of previous year,"" he said.
The company earned $1.28 on turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel in July-September as compared to gross refining margin of $6.79 per barrel in Q2 of the previous fiscal.
Without accounting for inventory losses, the GRM was $3.99 per barrel in Q2.
He said the company recorded an inventory loss of  ₹1,807 crore in the quarter as opposed to an inventory gain of  ₹2,895 crore a year back.
A company suffers inventory loss when it buys raw material (crude oil in case of IOC) at a particular price but by the time it is able to ship it to refineries and process it into fuel, global rates have fallen. Because pump rates are benchmarked at prevailing international rate, it books an inventory loss. Inventory gains are booked if the reverse happens.
Singh said the company also booked a forex loss of  ₹1,135 crore in Q2.
Turnover slipped to  ₹1.32 lakh crore from  ₹1.51 lakh crore due to dip in prices.
Petroleum product sales stood at 21.4 million tonnes while refinery throughput was 17.5 million tonnes in Q2.
The drop in profit in Q2 also pulled down overall profitability of the company in the first half of the current fiscal year that started in April. Its net profit dropped to  ₹4,160 crore in April-September 2019 as compared to  ₹10,078 crore a year back.
""This was mainly on account of lower refining margins, lower inventory gain during current period partly offset by lower exchange losses,"" Singh said.
Revenue from operations also fell to  ₹2.82 lakh crore in the first half of 2019-20 fiscal year as compared to  ₹3.01 lakh crore in the corresponding period of the previous financial year.
GRM during the first half of current fiscal was $2.96 per barrel as compared to USD 8.45 a barrel a year back.
Singh said IOC's refineries have started producing International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) low sulphur compliant fuel for ships.
The first such supply was made on October 26, 2019 to an LPG tanker at Kandla port and same quality bunker fuel deliveries at other Indian ports in Mumbai, Mangalore, Tuticorin, Chennai, Visakhapatnam, Paradip and Haldia shall start by mid-November, he said."
9,2019-11-03,IOC,"DIPAM has started the process to appoint advisors for the sale of entire government stake in BPCLThe government stake is worth over  ₹60,000 crore at the prevailing price of BPCL shares on the BSE

New Delhi: The government may consider two-phased disinvestment for public sector oil refiner and retailer Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), if the initial strategic sale of the entire 53.29% government stake in the company fails to get requisite response.
According to official sources, there is fear that no company, including global majors, may commit to invest close to  ₹1 lakh crore required to complete the transanction at one go. Thus, the government may sell half or around 26-27% of its share first and consider complete exit from BPCL at a later stage when the valuation improves after the fund infusion by the strategic investor.
The government has tried this model earlier during the strategic disinvestment of metal and mining PSUs -- Hindustan Zinc Ltd and BALCO. Then Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had retained minority shareholding in these PSUs after sale and change of management control.
""The strategic sale of BSNL would require investors to put in close to  ₹1 lakh crore. While large global oil corporations have the financial muscle to commit such kind of investment, nobody would like to take such a huge risk at a time when oil markets are subdued and there is a gradual shift in energy mix towards renewables and electric mobility,"" said a top official of oil PSU on condition of anonymity.
The Disinvestment Department (DIPAM) has started the process to appoint advisors for the sale of entire government stake in BPCL. While the mandate of advisors is to come up with fair valuation, identify investors and close the deal, sources said they might also present two scenarios -- one where 53.29% stake is sold to a strategic investor, and the other where strategic investor will pick up half of this and take the management control by virtue of having the largest shareholding.
In the second scenario, the government will continue with up to 26% holding in BPCL, a portion of which it might dilute when the strategic investor comes up with an open offer. It may also keep a portion for sale at a later stage at higher valuations after the investor pumps in money and lets it grow.
The government stake is worth over  ₹60,000 crore at the prevailing price of BPCL shares on the BSE. If the buyer has to further acquire 25 per cent share in an open offer as per the takeover code, the total amount will rise close to  ₹1 lakh crore. This is considered too high even by international standards.
On its part, the DIPAM is working out a plan to offload entire government equity to a strategic partner, possibly a large overseas oil entity, like Saudi Aramco, Total, ExxonMobil and Shell. But with the global oil market facing a slump with demand not growing despite supply squeeze, the appetite for a large acquisition becomes difficult.
While no Indian company looks like mobilising such huge funds for BPCL buy, industry experts indicated that companies from Russia and the Gulf could be targeted to get the necessary investment. This, sources said, could be done through government to government talks as most oil companies in the region are state-controlled.
BPCL could be an attractive buy for firms, ranging from Saudi Aramco to French energy giant Total, which are vying to enter the world's fastest-growing fuel retail market, where BPCL has significant presence.
Alternatively, the government could also keep other oil PSUs, like Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and OIL India, on a standby to go in for share buybacks in the event strategic sale to a private partner having little success.
BPCL operates four refineries at Mumbai, Kochi in Kerala, Bina in Madhya Pradesh and Numaligarh in Assam with a combined capacity to convert 38.3 million tonnes of crude oil into fuel. It has 15,078 petrol pumps and 6,004 LPG distributors.
The government proposes to raise  ₹1.05 lakh crore from disinvestment in this financial year. It had exceeded asset-sale targets of  ₹1 lakh crore in FY18 and  ₹80,000 crore in FY19."
8,2019-11-08,IOC,"The state-owned Bharat Petroleum is being put on the block, but many expect another PSU, Indian Oil Corporation, to be the chief bidder

India’s Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said that the government has “no business to be in business"". Coming from a top minister, this is interesting, to say the least. State participation in business has remained high in India despite periodic avowals to privatize public sector units (PSUs)—a legacy of an Indian policy in the early decades of freedom, when the State wanted control of the “commanding heights"" of the economy. After liberalization, the government’s withdrawal from assorted businesses has proceeded only in fits and starts. Pradhan’s emphatic endorsement of this free-market agenda makes one wonder if the government indeed wants to offload its ownership of oil companies.
True, the state-owned Bharat Petroleum is being put on the block, but many expect another PSU, Indian Oil Corporation, to be the chief bidder. Pradhan, though, said that his statement was not just a slogan but a philosophy for him. Encouraging private competition in the oil sector would benefit consumers the most, he said, citing aviation and telecommunications as examples of the wonders of opening up.
If the Centre intends to withdraw from the oil sector entirely, it would be welcome. Privatization would turn the industry more efficient, reduce prices and spur innovation—so long as sufficient rivalry prevails. For this, foreign investment would have to play a role. Disinvestment needs to be seen as a programme aimed at better outcomes for the economy, and not
just as a revenue raising measure for the government to contain its fiscal deficit. What’s philosophy for Pradhan needs to become practice."
7,2019-11-12,IOC,"Stretched balance sheets of households, corporates and the government are impeding a growth recovery

With India’s economy growing at the slowest pace in six years, many wonder why consumers, companies and even the public sector can’t set it right. Why can’t households buy more? Why can’t corporates invest more? Why can’t the government spend more?
The answer can be traced back to the debt-laden balance sheets of Indian corporations from around 2010. The heavy borrowing of those days spilled over to the balance sheets of banks, which lent heavily and often to those who struggled to pay back.
This balance sheet malaise has not been fully overcome. For a time, it was forgotten as India’s economy got a welcome boost from falling oil prices, a surge in lending from shadow banks, and a rise in public sector investment. But these positives were temporary. Oil prices stabilized, alarm grew over the unsustainable growth model of shadow banks, and a sharp rise in public sector debt raised borrowing costs.
Meanwhile, corporates remained over-leveraged, while the elevated stock of non-performing loans at banks prevented them from lending efficiently. All this manifested itself in the form of weak investment growth and a sluggish labour market over the last decade. This, in turn, has led to the demand problem that we are now witnessing with wages weak and consumption slowing.
Moreover, because of these stretched balance sheets, major players in the economy—namely companies, banks, households and the government—are now unable to spend their way out of the ongoing slowdown.
Let’s highlight the major balance sheet issues that need to be resolved.
At first glance, companies appear to be deleveraging. After having risen sharply, the debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio has been falling since 2016. But this ratio does not fully reflect the actual stress that corporations are facing. When we look at the debt-to-equity ratio—a more company-specific indicator—we find that the indebtedness of Indian firms has been rising, and is also high compared to their regional peers.
Banks’ balance sheets have not been completely repaired. Non-performing loans remain elevated; and they still bear a large exposure to non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), which took up the slack in lending aggressively, but have since struggled with funding issues. Consequently, banks are not likely to lend excessively.
Consumption had become the key driver of economic growth over the last few years, despite weak household income growth. This is noteworthy because the only way consumption can grow when incomes are weak is by consumers taking on debt and essentially leveraging up. Already, household debt has been rising and is now notably higher than the long-term average. But if incomes continue to remain weak, consumers may not be keen to take on new debt, fearful of finding it tough to repay loans in the future. Households, therefore, cannot be counted upon to spend their way out of the current slowdown.
The government’s fiscal situation is tight, too. Public sector borrowing is elevated at 8% of GDP. Besides, the central and state governments are likely to run higher-than-budgeted fiscal deficits in 2019-20. All this hurts growth, as the strains of heavy borrowing keep borrowing rates elevated even though the central bank is cutting key rates.
One lesson, therefore, has become clear. Because the roots of the current slowdown are closely linked to the supply side (i.e. impaired balance sheets), even if the government were to try boosting demand—say, through tax cuts—this must be accompanied by measures to ease the supply side, or else any growth recovery will be short-lived. So, what are the solutions?
One is to strengthen the new bankruptcy regime to ensure it resolves the deluge of stressed assets that burden corporate and bank balance sheets faster. This will also help credit to start flowing to the right places .
Another is to untangle all the stalled investment projects that litter the country. One-third of them are on hold due to policy-related problems such as land acquisition, limited access to raw material like coal, and environmental approvals.
A comprehensive strategy for what role banks and NBFCs should play is critical, too. For banks, corporate governance issues need to be ironed out and the number of government mandates reduced. For NBFCs, the government has already taken an important step by announcing a stimulus package to revive stalled housing projects. But a second step may also be needed. Given the deep interlinks with the rest of the economy, some NBFCs and real estate developers may need a direct search-and-rescue operation. For instance, the government or Reserve Bank of India could identify the more systemically important firms, supervise them more closely, and find buyers or get owners to recapitalize them, while also making sure that private shareholders shoulder losses.
Finally, divesting government stakes in companies and selling various government-owned assets, such as roads, ports and airports, will also improve the health of the government’s balance sheet.
The good news is that none of these initiatives are new. They are already being debated and implemented at varying levels. The challenge, then, is to have them taken up on a war footing. Pushing them through to completion will not only clean up the economy’s balance sheet, so to speak, but also reunite the country with the higher growth it deserves.

NEW DELHI :
India plans to reduce its stake in Indian Oil Corp. to below 51% while ensuring the government and state-run companies retain control of the nation’s largest oil refiner, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet will consider, as early as next week, a proposal to sell shares in some companies, including Indian Oil, to below 51%, the people said, asking not to be identified as the plan is not public. India directly holds 51.5% in Indian Oil, and another 25.9% through state-run Life Insurance Corp. of India, and explorers Oil & Natural Gas Corp. and Oil India Ltd.
Sluggish revenue collections has left Modi’s administration with little choice but to push ahead with a plan to raise a record  ₹1.05 trillion ($14.6 billion) through asset sales in the financial year through March. A slippage will put the government’s goal of capping its budget deficit at 3.3% of gross domestic product at risk, and prompt rating companies to put India’s credit score on a path for a downgrade to junk.
Government can sell as much as 26.4% its holding in Indian Oil — valued at about  ₹33,000 crore — and still retain indirect control. Finance ministry spokesman Rajesh Malhotra could not be immediately reached for a comment.
The South Asian nation is likely to start selling shares in Indian Oil through an exchange-traded fund in January, according to the people. The ministers’ panel is also expected to take up other crucial proposals such as privatization of Bharat Petroleum Corp., Shipping Corp. of India and Container Corp. of India, they said.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her budget speech, announced plan to lower direct holdings in some state-run companies below 51% on a “case-to-case basis."" The government later identified the biggest energy companies such as Indian Oil, ONGC, NTPC Ltd. and GAIL India Ltd. as probable candidates for such reductions.
Shares of Indian Oil have dropped 3.8% this year. The broader benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has risen 11.4% in the period.
Indian Oil, along with its unit Chennai Petroleum Corp., operates 11 refineries, controlling more than 35% of the nation’s total crude oil processing capacity. It’s also India’s biggest fuel retailer, owning about half the country’s refilling stations."

NEW DELHI :
World's largest oil company Aramco is yet to make up its mind to participate in disinvestment of Indian fuel refiner and retailer Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) where government intends to sell its entire 53.29 per cent stake to a strategic investor.
Sources privy to the development said that Aramco, which kicked off the final phase of its $25 billion IPO on Sunday, is focused on Indian investment primarily to conclude the purchase of 20 per cent stake in Reliance Industries' oil to chemical division and expansion of its upstream business in high growth markets including India. Entering India with a large scale investment in a public sector oil refiner and retailer is not on the horizon as on now, sources said.
When asked specifically on its plan to acquire majority stake in BPCL whether solely or in a consortium, Saudi Aramco declined to comment.
Aramco's lesser focus on BPCL disinvestment may be a cause of worry for the Indian government that is betting big on the oil giant to takeover its entire equity in BPCL. 
In fact, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has indicated that BPCL disinvestment may be completed in current fiscal. While government is expected to launch a roadshow for BPCL disinvestment in key global markets soon, there is a strong belief that Aramco fits the bill perfectly with its sheer scale of operations and large size of the balance sheet.
""For Aramco, its huge IPO is of prime concern now. It is selling 1.5 per cent stake in the market that could fetch over $25 billion.Other things, including investments in key markets would come thereafter. Moreover, with BPCL disinvestment requiring investor to pump in close to  ₹1lakh crore (about  ₹60,000 crore for government's stake and balance for open offer), even a company of the size of Aramco will think twice,"" said an global oil and gas analyst who did not wish to be named on the issue.
Aramco in the past has remained upbeat about the prospect of investment in the Indian market, which is among the largest oil consumers in the world and where demand scenario is expected to remain firm next few decades.This mood has also reflected in the 658 page prospectus filed by the company in the run up to its IPO where apart from its intention to invest in RIL, it has said that company is focussing its downstream investments in areas of high-growth, including India.
Indian government is also looking at Aramco's investment in $60 billion oil refinery proposed in Maharashtra as well get its investment in oil marketing and retailing in the country.
""The bag seems too full for Aramco already and if at all a decision of BPCL stake purchase is taken, Aramco may join hands with some other Indian or overseas player to pick government of India's equity in the company,"" said the source quoted earlier.
Public sector Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has also not ruled out its interest for BPCL but is waiting for a green signal from the government to consider placing its interest. However, IOC may not have the financial muscle to for large stake buy and government does not want to add debt burden on PSUs. In such a scenario, analysts believe a possible collaboration between Aramco and IOC may work out. IOC also has started limited foray in Saudi Arabia by helping set up few fuel stations. However, government officials denied build up of any such collaboration at this juncture.
Government's stake is worth over  ₹60,000 crore at prevailing price of BPCL shares on BSE. If the buyer has to further acquire 25 per cent share in an open offer as per takeover code, the total amount with rise close to  ₹1 lakh crore. This is considered too high even by international standards.
On its part, DIPAM is working out a plan to offload entire government equity to a strategic partner, possibly a large overseas oil entity like Saudi Aramco, Total, ExxonMobil, Shell. However, with oil market globally facing a slowdown with demand not picking up despite supply squeeze, the appetite for a large acquisition becomes difficult.
BPCL operates four refineries at Mumbai, Kochi in Kerala, Bina in Madhya Pradesh and Numaligarh in Assam with a combined capacity to convert 38.3 million tonnes of crude oil into fuel. It has 15,078 petrol pumps and 6,004 LPG distributors.
The government proposes to raise  ₹1.05 lakh crore from disinvestment in the current financial year. It had exceeded asset-sale targets of  ₹1 lakh crore in FY18 and  ₹80,000 crore in FY19."

1,2019-12-13,IOC,"Indian Oil Corp has been forced to shut down its Digboi refinery in Assam and is operating Guwahati unit at minimal throughputSources said the agitation has blocked the movement of tankers and trucks, which are mostly used to supply petrol, diesel and LPG

NEW DELHI :
Assam and other North Eastern states may face fuel supply issues if the agitation against the Citizenship Amendment Act continues for another week, as it has already led to the shutdown of refineries and oil-producing facilities in the region.
Indian Oil Corp (IOC) has been forced to shut down its Digboi refinery in Assam and is operating Guwahati unit at minimal throughput, while Oil India Ltd has been forced to shut LPG production and its crude oil production has dropped by 15-20 per cent, multiple sources at the state-owned companies said.
Sources said the agitation has blocked the movement of tankers and trucks, which are mostly used to supply petrol, diesel and LPG from the refineries to different parts of the North East.
With limited storage capacity, the companies have been forced to curtail production in absence of products being evacuated, they said.
Oil India Ltd has shut LPG production for the same reason, they said, adding the agitation has also limited movement of employees and officers who work at the refineries and oil installations.
""No employee could reach OIL facilities on Thursday,"" a source said, adding things improved a bit on Friday but attendance was low.
Protesters pulled out employees from IOC refineries in Guwahati and Digboi, forcing curtailment of operations.
Sources said if the agitation were to continue for another 7-10 days, the region may face fuel supply issues as in the absence of fresh replenishment the current stocks will exhaust and supply dry up.
Bongaigaon, the third refinery in Assam, was already under maintenance shutdown when the agitation broke out.
Two people were killed and 11 injured in police firing on protestors who have taken to streets since the Parliament approved the Citizenship Amendment Bill that would convert thousands of illegal immigrants into legal residents.
Sources said OIL suspended LPG as IOC was not able to lift the cooking fuel due to protests. OIL has also stopped all drilling operations as the staff was not able to reach work.
OIL supplies crude mainly to IOC's Digboi refinery and BPCL's Numaligarh unit.
The firm has also stopped production from several gas wells, curtailing supplies to tea gardens and power and fertilizer plants. However, operations at Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) fields have been largely unaffected even though employees could not reach plants at some places, they said. PTI ANZ ABM"
0,2019-12-26,IOC,"Anticipating higher diesel demand from new IMO rules, refineries added capacity. But demand has not kept paceUnder regulations issued in October 2016 by IMO, the marine sector must reduce sulphur emissions by 80% by switching to lower sulphur fuels

As the shipping industry prepares to implement tough International Maritime Organization (IMO) norms in the new year, refiners’ hopes of generating higher revenue from diesel sales look dim against what was anticipated a year ago. Refiners are attributing this to a slowdown in fuel demand.
Under regulations issued in October 2016 by IMO, the marine sector must reduce sulphur emissions by 80% by switching to lower sulphur fuels. Sulphur content in marine fuels will have to be reduced to 0.5% from the present 3.5%. Higher sulphur content in fuel is a major contributor to air pollution.
There are essentially two ways to do this: one, to clean up fuel oil by installing scrubbers—also known as marine exhaust equipment. But Indian refiners do not produce much fuel oil. The other alternative to high sulphur fuel oil is diesel, the Indian refiners’ preferred option, and the reason they anticipated an increase in diesel demand.
High-speed diesel of the kind produced by Indian refiners have reduced level of sulphur as necessitated by the Bharat Stage emission standards. Hence, the new IMO rule was expected to boost the gross refining margins of refiners such as Reliance Industries, Nayara Energy, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd. But in the absence of a global recovery in oil demand, analysts anticipate that gross refining margins would remain suppressed for a few more months. Anticipating higher diesel demand post mandatory implementation of the new IMO norms on 1 January, refineries across the world added capacity. Demand, however, has not kept pace.
Higher demand was expected to improve diesel’s ‘crack spread’—the difference between the price of crude oil and petroleum products extracted from it—to as high as $20-30 a barrel by FY21.
Consumption of diesel as a marine fuel is expected to increase from 0.75mnbpd (million barrels per day) to 3.3mnbpd in 2020. This would result in additional demand of 2.6mnbpd of diesel. Since refineries may not be able to meet this incremental demand due to limited refining capacity, it may lead to a spike in diesel margins racks, ultimately improving overall refining margins.
“Since we don’t make fuel oil, we are in an advantageous position. We get the benefit of IMO if the gasoil (petrol) prices go up; then you expect better economics which everyone expected for gasoil cracks to be substantially higher,"" said B. Anand, CEO, Nayara Energy.
Fuel oil, also called furnace oil, is another by-product of crude oil distillation. It is used in ships, power plants and other industrial plants. Diesel typically forms 40% of the output for a complex refinery in Asia—45% for RIL and refineries at Paradip (IOCL), Bina (BPCL) and Bhatinda (HPCL). Gross refining marginsat such plants could improve by $4-6 per barrel from next fiscal."
