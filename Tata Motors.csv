New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd on Tuesday reported a 52.48% jump in total sales at 54,627 units in December. The company had sold 35,825 units in the same month previous year, Tata Motors said in a statement.
Domestic sales of commercial vehicles (CV) last month stood at 40,447 units as against 24,998 units in the same month of 2016, up 61.8%. The growth of CV sales in December was on the on the back of new product introductions across segments and improved availability of the new range of BS4 vehicles, said Tata Motors head of commercial vehicle business unit Girish Wagh.
“Increased demand for new tonnage vehicles, infrastructure development led by government funding and keen focus on customer requirements has helped reviving the M&HCV performance...With a well-defined CV strategy in place, we are confident of improving our performance across segments."" he added.
In the passenger vehicles (PV) segment, Tata Motors said its domestic sales were up 30.96% at 14,180 units last month as against 10,827 units in December 2016.

New Delhi: Homegrown auto major Tata Motors Ltd managing director and chief executive officer Guenter Butschek has called employees to bolster accountability and drive performance within the organisation as the firm seeks to build on the positives of its turnaround drive that is expected to be completed by March.  
New Delhi: Homegrown auto major Tata Motors Ltd managing director and chief executive officer Guenter Butschek has called employees to bolster accountability and drive performance within the organisation as the firm seeks to build on the positives of its turnaround drive that is expected to be completed by March. 
In his New Year message to employees, Butschek said several steps taken in 2017 such as “accelerated efforts on sales enhancement, rigorous cost reduction have shown quick results on market share and bottom-line improvement, but the effort needs to continue."" 
The company has made considerable progress and the good performances in second and third quarters were reflections of its efforts, he said adding that with structural de-bottlenecking of supply chain Tata Motors has started to build a future ready highly capable strategic supplier base. 
“With all elements of OE (organisation effectiveness) rpt organisation effectiveness finally on the right track, we need to bolster accountability levels and drive performance within the organisation,"" Butschek said. He further said, “The turnaround demonstrated the new structure’s effectiveness - speed, simplicity, agility! These are the key characteristics driving a high-performance culture.""
Last year, Tata Motors had announced a turnaround plan for its domestic business, with a special focus on the ailing commercial vehicles business that lost market share, reaching 44.4% in March 2017 from a high of nearly 60%, five years back. In 2016-17, Tata Motors had posted a loss after tax, on a standalone basis, of Rs2,480 crore compared to Rs62 crore in the previous year. Its standalone gross revenue was Rs49,100 crore, up 3.6% from the previous year.
“While our ‘Transformation’ journey started to gain speed in 2017, we had to shift gears to Turnaround with a single- minded focus on execution,"" Butschek said. Both the commercial vehicles (CV) and passenger vehicles (PV) business units clocked best sales in September 2017 in the last 4-5 year period as a result of focussing energies on achieving new heights, he said. While terming the ‘turnaround’ as a sprint, he said the company’s employees are running a marathon for sustainable and profitable growth. “While we continue to scale new heights, the turnaround momentum should roll up into a sustainable ‘way of living’ at Tata Motors - determining our aggression in the market place. We need to consolidate our actions and ensure that the turnaround plan gets fully accomplished giving strong returns by March 2018,"" Butschek said.
Looking ahead, he said the respective strategies of CV and PV business needed to be adapted due to changes in the macro environment and align to business objectives accordingly. “We also need to conclude on our strategic blueprint and execution plan on Smart Energy solution,"" he added. 
Last year, Tata Motors forayed into electric mobility with the bagging of EESL order, he said adding, “Today, we lead the e-mobility movement supporting the government’s vision and we will keep leading it - in PV and CV!"""

London: The Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is mulling a new software hub at Shannon in Ireland as part of its wider plans to invest in electric and driver-less technology. 
According to ‘The Sunday Times’, the UK-based luxury car maker plans to create 150 jobs at the site, where it will research new technologies related to battery-powered cars and automated driving. 
“The new facility provides an exciting opportunity for us to pioneer future autonomous and electrification technologies,"" said Nick Rogers, JLR’s executive director of product engineering. 
The Irish town of Shannon is seen as a hi-tech hotbed, with companies including American chip giant Intel setting up base there. JLR said its new site would “complement"" more than 10,000 engineers in the UK, in a move backed by Ireland’s Investment Development Agency (IDA). 
“Having a globally recognised company of such international standing will greatly enhance Shannon’s reputation as a centre of excellence for such business. The 150 jobs will be of significant benefit to Clare and the midwest region,"" said Martin Shanahan of IDA Ireland. 
The latest expansion plans come after another record year for the Tata Motors’ owned company, which sold 621,109 cars in 2017, up 1% on 2016. 
Last year, the company had announced that from 2020, all new models under the Jaguar and Land Rover brands will be offered with electric versions and the firm has committed to a range of hybrid, plug-in and full electric power options in the coming years. 
The firm’s first fully electric SUV, the Jaguar I-Pace, goes on sale later this year. For its new research and development (R&D) hub in Ireland, it will look for software engineers with experience in a range of disciplines such as artificial intelligence, safety critical systems and vehicle architecture."
400,2018-01-16,Tata Motors,"BlackBerry says it had already tested Jarvis with automaker Tata Motors' Jaguar Land Rover unit, whose chief executive said Jarvis reduced the time needed to assess code from 30 days to seven minutes

Bengaluru/Toronto: Canadian software maker BlackBerry Ltd on Monday launched a new cybersecurity software, which identifies vulnerabilities in programs used in self-driving cars. 
Bengaluru/Toronto: Canadian software maker BlackBerry Ltd on Monday launched a new cybersecurity software, which identifies vulnerabilities in programs used in self-driving cars.
The product, called Blackberry Jarvis, is being marketed first to automakers—a group of customers the former smartphone maker is hoping will power its turnaround efforts—but could also have applications in healthcare and industrial automation.
BlackBerry said it was offering Jarvis on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Once initiated, automakers will have online access to Jarvis and can scan files at every stage of software development, the company said.
Last year, the global “ransomware"" attack, dubbed WannaCry, helped raise awareness of BlackBerry’s security software business, which is largely focused on managing secure connections to mobile devices. 
BlackBerry said it had already tested Jarvis with automaker Tata Motors’ Jaguar Land Rover unit, whose chief executive said Jarvis reduced the time needed to assess code from 30 days to seven minutes. 
BlackBerry in September announced it would partner with auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc <DLPH.N> on a software operating system for self-driving cars.
Earlier this month BlackBerry and Chinese internet search firm Baidu Inc <BIDU.O> signed a deal to jointly develop self-driving vehicle technology.
BlackBerry has also recently signed automotive-related deals with chipmaker Qualcomm, auto supplier Denso and Ford Motor Co <F.N>."

Mumbai: India’s largest commercial vehicle (CV) maker Tata Motors Ltd is set to unveil 15 models and concepts at the Auto Expo, to be held in Noida on Delhi’s outskirts, from 9 to 14 February, a senior executive said on Wednesday.
The Tata group flagship will showcase four new trucks—a light commercial truck based on a new platform akin to the company’s advanced modular platform (AMP) for passenger vehicles, a 43-tonne rigid truck which the company claims has the highest tonnage in India, a light CV based on the platform shared by the Ultra truck, in addition to a truck running on LNG (liquefied natural gas) based on the same platform.
According to Girish Wagh, president of the CV unit at the Mumbai-based firm, “a purely electric 12-metre bus and an industry-first inter-city coach bus,"" developed through its joint venture Tata Marcopolo Motors Ltd, with Brazilian bus manufacturer Marcopolo S.A., will also be showcased.
Tata Motors has launched over 35 new models and variants in the fiscal year up to December, with 20 more planned for the quarter ending March, said Wagh, adding that “all the new CV models will be based on the new modular platform"".
In addition to the vehicles, the maker of the Ace mini truck will also display its range of new engines developed in-house over the past two to three years, having spent close to Rs300 crore on development.
“Branded as the Turbotronn range, we have 3-litre and 5-litre engines, along with a 3.3-litre variant. These can be upgraded to BS6 (Bharat Stage 6 emission norms) with minimal change"", Wagh said.
The flurry of launches comes on the back of a steady fall in market share since fiscal 2014 when Tata Motors accounted for more than half the CV market. In the current fiscal year up to December, Tata Motors had a 44.5% share of the broader CV market, a mere 0.3% rise over the year-ago period, Wagh said, adding that the company would “like to exit this fiscal with the previous fiscal’s market share"", which was close to 50%."

New Delhi: Homegrown auto major Tata Motors will showcase an extended range of six electric vehicles, in personal and mass mobility segments in the upcoming Auto Expo. 
The company has already announced that it will present 26 smart mobility solutions across its passenger and commercial vehicles at the expo to be held from 9-14 February. These six electric vehicles will be among those exhibits. 
“While we cannot comment on specifics, we can confirm that Tata Motors will indeed showcase an extended range of six electric vehicles, enabling personal and mass mobility, further reiterating our commitment to the government’s vision for electrification by 2030,"" a Tata Motors spokesperson said. 
This year, the company’s focus of the Auto Expo will be journey towards the future of integrated mobility solutions, outlining plans for the future of India’s Smart Cities and its connected generation, the spokesperson added. 
Tata Motors had bagged order from state-owned EESL to supply 350 electric cars, while rival Mahindra & Mahindra will supply 150 electric cars. 
The company has rolled out the first batch of electric version of its compact sedan Tigor from Sanand plant to be supplied to Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL). 
Commenting on the company’s EV roadmap, Tata Motors CEO and managing director Guenter Butschek said, “Working collaboratively with the government to facilitate faster adoption of EVs, we at Tata Motors, are completely ready to drive the EV revolution and build a sustainable future for India."""
396,2018-02-05,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors' net profit for the December quarter came in at Rs1,214.6 crore  versus Rs111.57 crore a year earlier, the biggest jump in seven quarters

Tata Motors Ltd reported a near 11-fold rise in fiscal third-quarter profit as a surprise turnaround in its India business helped offset a slowdown in its Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) unit. Earnings still missed analysts’ estimates. 
Tata Motors Ltd reported a near 11-fold rise in fiscal third-quarter profit as a surprise turnaround in its India business helped offset a slowdown in its Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) unit. Earnings still missed analysts’ estimates.
Net profit, including those of its units, rose to Rs1,214.6 crore for the three months ended December from Rs111.57 crore in the same period a year earlier, the biggest jump in seven quarters. A Bloomberg poll of 19 analysts had pegged quarterly profit at Rs2,349.1 crore. 
The key reason for the lower-than-expected profit was a weak performance by JLR. Sales in that unit rose just 3.45% from a year ago to 154,447 units. While sales in the US and Europe declined, sales growth in China slowed to 14.6%.
JLR’s sales were weighed by few launches and model refreshes during the year, the unit’s chief executive officer Ralf Speth said in an investor call. He also cited cyclicality in sales in the US, uncertainty over policy treatment of diesel vehicles in Europe and Brexit as other factors. 
The UK-based unit, however, expects to maintain an Ebitda margin of 8-10% in the medium term, said Speth. He also forecast stronger performance in the fourth quarter owing to new models. Ebitda—or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization—is a measure of operating profitability.
In the December quarter, JLR’s Ebitda margin narrowed 1.3 percentage points from a year earlier to 10.9%. The unit’s revenue rose 4.3% to £6.3 billion (about Rs56,900 crore). 
“JLR’s performance was below our estimates, though it is not worrying because double-digit margins have been maintained under difficult conditions. The fourth quarter will be better in terms of profitability on the back of increased deliveries of the Velar and refreshed Discovery,"" said Jigar Shah, chief executive and head of research at Maybank Kim Eng Securities India Pvt. Ltd.
The UK-based unit’s performance was compensated by an unexpected return to profitability in the domestic business. Tata Motors’ India operations reported a 58.6% jump in revenue to Rs16,102 crore, albeit off a low base. The business swung to a profit of Rs184 crore in the quarter ended December from a loss of Rs1,046 crore in the same quarter the previous year.
Ebitda margin widened 7.5 percentage points to 9% owing to an increase in net realizations from higher sales of heavy and medium commercial vehicles. 
 “The turnaround strategy is delivering results, in addition to filling product gaps and stepping up market presence,"" said Tata Motors chief executive and managing director Guenter Butschek. The firm started cutting costs aggressively in 2016 as part of its turnaround strategy.
Domestic sales rose 34.9% year-on-year to 155,977 units in the December quarter. Commercial vehicles led the way, with sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles rising 54% to 40,070 units on increased demand for higher tonnage trucks, pre-buying ahead of the ventilation norms that kicked in from 1 January and the government’s infrastructure push, the firm said in a statement. “The India business will improve on the base of a rise in investments, a reduction in depreciation and interest costs, and stronger operating leverage,"" said Shah of Maybank.
On Monday, shares of Tata Motors rose 3.12% to Rs396.05 on BSE, while the benchmark Sensex shed 0.88% to 34,757.16 points. The firm released its December quarter results after market hours."

395,2018-02-06,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors and Warburg Pincus have mutually agreed to call off the US private equity firm's proposed investment of around $360 million in Tata Technologies

Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd and Warburg Pincus Llc have mutually agreed to call off the US private equity firm’s proposed investment of around $360 million in Tata Technologies Ltd, Tata Motors said in a stock exchange filing on Monday. 
Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd and Warburg Pincus Llc have mutually agreed to call off the US private equity firm’s proposed investment of around $360 million in Tata Technologies Ltd, Tata Motors said in a stock exchange filing on Monday.
“Due to delays in securing regulatory approvals as well as due to the recent performance of the company not meeting internal thresholds because of market challenges, the parties to the transaction have mutually decided not to proceed with the closure of the transaction,"" Tata Motors said in its statement to the stock exchange. 
Tata Motors will continue to explore strategic options to sell its stake in Tata Technologies and remains positive in its outlook, the statement added.
In June, Tata Motors and two other group entities had announced the sale of a 43% stake in engineering unit Tata Technologies to an affiliate of Warburg Pincus. Warburg was to acquire 30% from Tata Motors and its unit Sheba Properties Ltd, and another 13% from Tata Capital Ltd. Tata Motors owns 70.4% of the Singapore-based firm, according to its annual report.
The proposed stake sale to Warburg was the first big divestment announced by Tata Motors since N. Chandrasekaran took over in February as chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, and some of its group firms, including Tata Motors.
The transaction was aimed at helping Tata Motors pare debt. Its consolidated debt (including that at UK subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc) stood at Rs79,323.36 crore at the end of fiscal 2016-17.
Tata Technologies provides design, research and development services to the automotive, aerospace and industrial machinery industries.
The proposed investment in Tata Technologies was one of the major investments announced by Warburg Pincus in 2017. 
In 2017, Warburg made several investments in Indian companies such as a $350 billion investment in Airtel DTH and $120 million investment in multiplex firm PVR Ltd.
Tata Motors shares closed at Rs396.05, up 3.12% on BSE; while the benchmark Sensex closed at 34,757.16 points, down by 0.88%. The announcement was made after the market closed on Monday."
394,2018-02-07,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors's main worry is due to the disappointing performance of its cash-cow Jaguar Land Rover, which has been churning out healthy profits for several years

Going by Tata Motors Ltd’s December quarter performance that missed profit estimates by a wide margin, the road ahead is likely to be a rough one. The main worry is due to the disappointing performance of its cash-cow Jaguar Land Rover Ltd (JLR) that has been churning out healthy profits for several years and which churned out 90% to 100% of the consolidated profits. 
Going by Tata Motors Ltd’s December quarter performance that missed profit estimates by a wide margin, the road ahead is likely to be a rough one. The main worry is due to the disappointing performance of its cash-cow Jaguar Land Rover Ltd (JLR) that has been churning out healthy profits for several years and which churned out 90% to 100% of the consolidated profits.
For the quarter, Tata Motors’ consolidated net profit of  ₹ 1,212 crore missed Bloomberg’s 15-broker average estimate by a huge 48%. More importantly, its operating profit, although higher than the year-ago period, was also just three-fourths of what the Street had forecast. All this, in spite of a 16% jump in consolidated net revenue on the back of strong sales volumes, especially on the home ground.
What this clearly shows is that the costs during the quarter overtook realizations. The glaring miss is JLR’s operating margin of 10.9% against estimates of 11.5%. In fact, fiscal year 2018 has been a challenging one so far, with operating margins in the first and second quarters at 7.9% and 11.8%, respectively, coming lower than forecasts. While the management attributes the sales slowdown to the changeover of some Range Rover models and introduction of new ones, there are other concerns too.
Barring China, where sales grew by 14% year-on-year during the quarter, markets in the UK, Europe and North America have been challenging. The investor presentation clearly indicates that the changing trends towards fewer diesel vehicles in Europe and the UK and the trend towards electric vehicles in North America have led to a steep drop in sales in these regions (see chart). Even growth in China has simmered down compared to a few quarters ago.
Reiterating this, the management in the conference call said that the cost of responding to higher competition and product changes led to higher variable costs. Along with adverse currency movements, this weighed on profitability. 
The worry is that the market product cycle uncertainty could see a trend reversal in JLR’s performance, at least in the near term. One can anticipate higher product development costs and depreciation costs with a strain on working capital too for some time ahead, signalling negative free cash flows. 
Fortunately, the downturn in JLR was partially offset by a recovery in Tata Motors’ stand-alone business, as sales of domestic commercial vehicles shot through the roof (see chart) and passenger cars too recovered. Indeed, the company’s turnaround strategy was followed by a recovery in the domestic commercial vehicle market as a whole. Robust sales aided the transition from a loss in the year-ago period to a profit this quarter.
However, the stand-alone profit hardly matters except that it prevents a further drain on cash flows.
Without doubt, JLR’s poor performance will eclipse the uptrend in domestic business. This is already mirrored in Tata Motors’ stock price that has fallen 24% in a year, while shares of its competitor on the home turf—Ashok Leyland Ltd—have risen by 37%. Tata Motors’ shares have hugely underperformed even the benchmark indices in FY18 so far and are unlikely to see better days until JLR is on a firm footing once again."

New Delhi: The country’s largest automaker by revenue, Tata Motors Ltd, showcased close to 25 vehicles, including six electric vehicles (EVs) and two novel platforms for its passenger vehicles segment at the Auto Expo on Wednesday. 
Built around the theme of “Smart Mobility, Smart Cities"", the Tata Motors pavilion showcased an electric version of its compact sedan Tigor, a fully electric bus, an electric version of its first race car RaceMo and a truck running on liquefied natural gas (LNG), among others. 
“Tata Motors is committed to future mobility with significant investments being made in the electric, passenger and commercial vehicles segments,"" said N. Chandrasekaran, chairman, Tata Sons, the holding company of the Tata group.

Butschek has, in fact, acknowledged some of the problems, taking the first step to fix them. In August 2016, he admitted Tata Motors is not on the top of potential customers’ consideration list in passenger vehicles, and pointed to problems such as a silo approach, lack of accountability and no clear definition of excellence.
He reiterated that on Wednesday.
“Overview of Tata Motors in terms of product portfolio, capacity utilisation, base line profitability, was not entirely wrong,"" Butschek said. 
“We wanted to make sure that there is an ownership on the executive committee, dedicated project teams, which would go beyond developing concepts, focus on execution and improving baseline,"" he added."

New Delhi: As the auto industry goes through disruptions brought by new technologies, Tata Motors is banking on group strength, particularly on software major TCS, in its bid to position itself as a mobility solutions provider, according to its MD and CEO Guenter Butschek.  
New Delhi: As the auto industry goes through disruptions brought by new technologies, Tata Motors is banking on group strength, particularly on software major TCS, in its bid to position itself as a mobility solutions provider, according to its MD and CEO Guenter Butschek. 
With the current discussions in auto industry revolving around autonomous, connected, electric and sharing (ACES), he said Tata Motors also needs to reinvent itself to a certain extent, moving towards new technology and business models. 
In an interview with PTI, Butschek said the tender for supplying over 350 electric buses to 11 cities under the FAME scheme provided a big opportunity to the company to leverage on group competencies for “an incredibly powerful play in the new space"". “We, as a company, are going to move towards technology but we are also going to move towards new business models,"" he said, adding all mega trends in the industry suggested that as a company Tata Motors need to “reinvent ourselves to a certain extent"". 
Currently, he said the auto industry discussion is determined by ACES. “If you look into the four letters, it is all software,"" Butschek said, adding that within the software package, there is a need for dedicated specialities. “This is where the group competency kicks in,"" he said, reiterating Tata group chairman N. Chandrasekaran’s ‘One Tata’ approach.
Stressing the need for such an approach, he added, “not just because we are one of the largest companies within the Tata group but because of the fact that we are undergoing such disruptions that we require competencies, which we do not have in our portfolio to the full extent today. “But, we have highly competent other group companies, my references in particular go in towards TCS"". 
With a strong group relationship and connecting competencies Butschek said, “technology might play in our favour and we can become much more powerful and we could even get in the position to lead this movement"". 
When asked if Tata Motors has started conversation with TCS on the new front, he said replied in the affirmative saying Tata Motors has a long lasting strategic relationship with TCS. “These conversations are almost natural because we are no foreigners to each other. We work together on all kinds of different platforms. And as we work together on the present you naturally talk about future,"" he added. These talks, he said are “more about future in the context of new technologies and certainly with some additional push by the clear call to leverage the competences of the group"". 
Butschek said the tender for supplying electric buses was an ideal platform to leverage on the group’s strength in terms of providing the actual vehicle, IT-related and maintenance services. “All of a sudden you realise that there is a set of strength, a set of competency within the Tata Group, which you can just leverage, which gives us an incredibly powerful play in the new space,"" he added. 
Tata Motors will bid for all the 11 cities, on the back of its new 12-metre, ‘state-of-the-art indigenous’ electric bus, he added."

New Delhi: Truck makers are preparing to boost production, encouraged by the government’s proposal to raise allocation for infrastructure by more than Rs1 trillion for the year starting 1 April, two people aware of the matter said. 
New Delhi: Truck makers are preparing to boost production, encouraged by the government’s proposal to raise allocation for infrastructure by more than Rs1 trillion for the year starting 1 April, two people aware of the matter said.
India’s top three truck makers—Tata Motors Ltd, Ashok Leyland Ltd and Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles Ltd—have asked their suppliers to ramp up capacity, anticipating an increase in demand for trucks and tippers which are used for road construction, transportation and mining. 
Truck makers are hoping that the increased spending on infrastructure by the government will translate into rising demand for their products. 
Total expenditure on infrastructure for the next fiscal is expected to rise 21% to Rs5.97 trillion from Rs4.94 trillion for 2017-18, according to budget estimates. A substantial part of that allocation will fund the ambitious Bharatmala road project, which aims to link about 75% of India’s districts through a network of highways.
Tata Motors has asked its engine supplier Cummins India Ltd to increase monthly supply of engines to 20,000 units from an average of 14,000-16,000 units that it now supplies to India’s largest truck maker, one of the two people cited above said, requesting anonymity.
“This would also include exports but the main focus will be the domestic market,"" the person said.
A Tata Motors spokesperson said that the company has been experiencing an increase in demand for medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCV). 
“We are aligning our production with the increasing demand,"" he said.
Demand in the commercial vehicle segment has started to look up after the implementation of overloading rules, barring trucks from carrying loads beyond prescribed limits. The BS VI emission norms that will come into effect from 2020 will also create replacement demand, the executives cited earlier said.
Sales of commercial vehicles rose 10.45% to 257,001 units in the 10 months ended 31 January. This has prompted Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers to raise its FY18 forecast for M&HCV sales to 13% from 5-6% projected at the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Chennai-based Ashok Leyland, India’s second-largest truck maker, has increased orders for tippers, the second person said. One of the firm’s suppliers has been asked to supply 250 tippers in February and 300 in March, up from an average 200 units now, the person said. 
Ashok Leyland is working closely with all its suppliers to meet demand, managing director Vinod K. Dasari said in response to an emailed query.
Volvo Eicher has also asked its suppliers to increase output, the second person said. The company may also commission a new factory in Bhopal in 2019 to meet demand, the person added.
Sales of trucks are likely to touch a new peak in March, said Vinod Aggarwal, managing director and CEO of Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles, a joint venture between Eicher Motors Ltd and Volvo AB."

New Delhi: Tata Motors on Thursday reported 38% jump in domestic sales at 58,993 units in February, led by continued strong sales in commercial and passenger vehicle (PV) segments in the domestic market. 
The company had sold 42,679 units during the same month last year, Tata Motors said in a statement.
Domestic sales of commercial vehicles in the month grew 36% to 41,222 units compared to 30,407 units in the year-ago period, fuelled by robust infrastructural developments, fresh tenders in car carriers, coal movement and the petroleum sector. 
Passenger vehicle (PV) sales stood at 17,771 units as against 12,272 units in February 2017, up 45%.
The company said the jump in PV sales was due to increasing demand of Tiago and Tigor along with Nexon and Hexa gaining traction in the steadily growing UV segment. 
However, sales from exports in February 2018 declined 3% to 4,768 units over last year. 
“The passenger car segment registered a strong growth of 17% while the UV segment grew 165%, clearly showing a trend of growing customer base across segments,"" Tata Motors said. 
With regard to spike in commercial vehicle sales, it said the growth was also bolstered by increasing demand from construction, growing logistics, e-commerce and FMCG applications."

Geneva: Tata Motors plans to completely overhaul its passenger vehicle portfolio over the next five years as part of its plans to grow sales volume and market share in the highly competitive Indian market, the company’s top executive said on Tuesday. 
Speaking to PTI on the sidelines of Geneva Motor Show, Tata Motors chief executive officer and managing director Guenter Butschek said the company’s new products would be based on two architectures—optimal modular efficient global advanced (OMEGA) and agile light advanced architecture (ALFA). 
“In the five years time, roughly by 2023-24, we will most probably have complete new product portfolio,"" Butschek said after unveiling the E-Vision Sedan Concept. The future products are going to be based on two new architectures, he added. 
While the ALFA architecture is going to cover all vehicles from 3.7 metre to 4.3 metre the OMEGA architecture is going to accommodate all products from 4.3 metre and above region, Butschek said. 
Elaborating on the product strategy, he added that the company would be ‘certainly’ very strongly represented in the 50% of the passenger vehicle (PV) market—the sub compact segment. “We will also develop new sub segments in order to make the play in the 50 per cent segment more attractive and giving the customer in this market segment more opportunities in terms of body styles in terms of features etc,"" Butschek said. 
The company at the same point of time would also continue to have strong presence in the segments above 4.3 metre in order to make Tata Motors as a more aspirational brand, he added. “We also want to play the game more aggressively in the SUV segment. We believe as the market is further going to develop and there will be a shift from the sub compact to compact and from the compact to big sized vehicles,"" Butschek said. 
The two new architectures will give commonality to the company’s products, he added. “While we leverage the initial investment in the architecture we can very effectively spread our base across lots of different sub segments. It means the play of Tata Motors is going to be larger while providing economies of scale because of two architectures,"" Butschek said. 
The richer and wider product portfolio will give Tata Motors opportunity to grow its volumes, he added. “As we grow in volume we have a clear ambition to also grow the market share as well,"" Butschek said. He however did not elaborate on the market share target going ahead but said that as per the company’s vision document it plans to be number three in the domestic PV segment by the end of next fiscal. 
“This is the target for the end of next fiscal year. What is going to happen in the next five years, with two platforms, taking the lead in design and technology particularly in electrification, our future market position I would say we have good opportunity to be even more aspirational,"" Butschek added.
When asked about company’s plans regarding sales network expansion, he said: “If we would like to grow, one of the pre-conditions is have a network which provides density in order to really reach our full customer potential across the nation."" 
The company also needs to upgrade its dealers in terms of appearance, location and even more importantly as far as the capabilities are concerned, he added. “We have a strong belief that with product, sales and after sales experience is also important. In the past we had dropped focus on after sales but now we are putting a lot of focus on after sales service quality,"" Butschek said. PTI"

Mumbai: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Tuesday directed Tata Motors Ltd to conduct an internal probe into an alleged leak of certain sensitive data revealing the auto maker’s financial results through the popular instant messaging application WhatsApp, ahead of their formal release.
The market regulator ordered the company to strengthen its existing processes and controls to prevent any leakage of unpublished price sensitive information or (UPSI) in future so that no entity is able to take undue advantage of the privileged information and trade in the company’s shares to make unfair market gains, breaching Sebi’s insider trading norms.
Any leak or misuse of a listed firm’s information by any entity, before the company’s official announcement on exchanges, and trading on the basis of this information amounts to insider trading, considered a serious violation of securities market laws. If any entity is found to be trading in a listed company’s shares on the basis of privileged information (which is not published on the stock exchange) to make gains, Sebi is authorized to take serious action against such an entity. 
Sebi ordered Tata Motors to submit a report on the present systems, the details of the entities responsible for monitoring such systems and the periodicity of such monitoring within three months. 
Following its initial probe, Sebi found that for the financial year 2016, while the actual December quarter results of Tata Motors were announced to exchanges at 1516 hours on 11 February 2016, key financial figures were already in circulation among certain WhatsApp groups since 1229 hours on the same day.
“..the messages circulated in WhatsApp matched with the quarterly financial results of the company for 31 December, 2015, which were published subsequently,"" said the Sebi order.
Replying to an email from Mint, a spokesperson from the company said, “Tata Motors would like to state that it is fully committed to ensuring confidentiality of such price sensitive information. This lapse pertains to an incident in 2015. While the company has robust policies and processes to manage such price sensitive information, we will investigate this lapse thoroughly to identify and address process gaps and fix accountability.""
This is the third Sebi order on cases relating to leak of sensitive financial information leaked on WhatsApp. Sebi has passed similar orders against Axis Bank Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd on 28 December and 23 February respectively.
The Sebi probe into Tata Motors revealed that while WhatsApp messages by some private groups had showed their users the company’s quarterly turnover as Rs72,256 crore, the subsequent official announcement stated this figure at Rs72,256.40 crore. Similarly, the leaked numbers showed the company’s margins to be at 14.20% for the quarter against the actual figure of 14.17%. The company’s net profit too was leaked on WhatsApp, the Sebi probe found.
Sebi has also asked Tata Motors to find out the role of the members of its various committees involved in generation of the original data for the purpose of determination of key figures pertaining to financial figures.
In its reply to a show cause notice by Sebi, Tata Motors said the work relating to preparation of financial results for the quarter ended December 2015 had started on 15 January, 2016. The financials were then shared with the statutory auditors. Subsequently, the investor relations department received the company’s financial results from the accounts team and then the financials were presented in the audit committee meeting held on 9 February, 2016. Finally, the results were officially declared on 11 February, 2016 at 1516 hours, Tata motors said.
Sebi was not able to ascertain the source of the leak.
“Such leakage is prima facie attributable to the inadequacy of the processes controls systems that Tata Motors as a listed company had put in place,"" read the Sebi order.

379,2018-03-08,Tata Motors,"Boosting the share of women workforce in socially conservative India is a challenge for Tata Motors

Mumbai: Jaguar Land Rover owner Tata Motors Ltd had just about 200 women on the shop floor three years ago. Now, it has 10 times that number and is looking to hire more. 
Mumbai: Jaguar Land Rover owner Tata Motors Ltd had just about 200 women on the shop floor three years ago. Now, it has 10 times that number and is looking to hire more.
In socially conservative India, that may be a tall order. Better educated women from wealthier families aren’t encouraged to work and it’s usually when a man’s salary falls short that women seek jobs. Many drop out to take care of children and older family members, shrinking the share of women in the workforce to around 24% in 2015-2016 from 36% a decade earlier, according to government data.
The cost of going backward is real for India: Asia’s third-largest economy would see gross domestic product increase 27% if it were able to boost female workforce participation to the levels seen for men, International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde has said. For Tata Motors, the benefits are already apparent.
“What we also found was besides discipline, productivity, safety and quality of work were outstanding with the women workforce on the shop floor, putting pressure to recruit more such people,"" said Gajendra Chandel, chief human resource officer at Tata Motors. “We have set a target of 25% for all future hiring.""
Still, boosting the share of women in the workforce is a challenge, particularly for companies such as Tata Motors.
Women make up just 18% of those employed in manufacturing and construction, well behind the 22% in services and the 60% in farming, according to the World Bank. Those figures broadly match a recent survey by the Swedish Consulate that showed participation by women in manufacturing in India was between 3% and 12%.
Tata Motors has started by setting an internal target of ensuring a third of workers on the shop floor are women and Chandel expects to progressively move their share of all employees up to 25% from 5% now.
Government policies are also forcing companies to create a more women-friendly environment. India recently instituted paid maternity leave of 26 weeks and also requires larger companies to offer convenient childcare facilities.
In this year’s Economic survey, the government’s chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian pointed to a greater need for jobs that women say they prefer—regular, part-time employment that provides steady income and allows them to reconcile household duties. Just as India committed to improving its ranking on ease of doing business indicators, the nation “should perhaps do so on gender outcomes as well,"" he wrote.
“India stands the risk of losing out if women’s participation levels keep falling,"" said Priyanka Kishore, lead Asia economist at Oxford Economics in Singapore. “Socio-cultural issues inhibit female participation in the labour force. So, enabling conditions like safety, better childcare, more maternity leave will help in retaining women."" Bloomberg"

New Delhi: Auto makers who rushed to Gujarat to set up manufacturing plants are now facing the problem of a shortfall in the number of auto parts vendors as car makers seek to boost capacity to meet rising demand. 
The problem is not having an “adequate"" number of vendors and capacity constraints at the facilities of existing vendors, three people aware of the matter said. 
For its part, the Auto Component Manufacturers Association (Acma) has decided to hold a roadshow in Gujarat on 18 and 19 March. Vinnie Mehta, director general of Acma, said that the idea is to help original equipment makers (OEMs) find new suppliers in Gujarat and provide a forum for the industry to get in touch with government officials.
“Since the state is tipped to become the next hub (for auto manufacturing), a lot of issues need to be resolved by the state government,"" explained Mehta. 
The race to set up car factories in Gujarat started when then chief minister Narendra Modi managed to convince Ratan Tata to set up a factory for his ambitious Nano project in Sanand. Tata was struggling to start production of Nano, which was originally planned at Singur, West Bengal.
The production of Nano cars in Gujarat put the state on the world map of auto manufacturing, attracting billions of dollars in investments from companies such as Suzuki Motor Corp., Honda Motorcycle and Scooters India Pvt. Ltd and Ford India Pvt. Ltd for setting up manufacturing units.
After having exhausted existing capacities, some of these manufacturers are now planning to expand.
For instance, Suzui Motor has already set up an assembly line of 250,000 units in the state, and a second line will be in place by the end of next year. Suzuki has a contract manufacturing agreement with its subsidiary Maruti Suzuki India Ltd under which the former sells products at cost price to the latter. 
According to one supplier who supplies to both Suzuki and Tata Motors, only 10-15% of the total tier one suppliers in the country are in Gujarat. “Also a negligible number of tier two suppliers are present in the state,"" the supplier said, requesting anonymity.
Most of the new production for Maruti Suzuki will come from Suzuki’s plant in Gujarat as two of its other manufacturing plants in Manesar and Gurugram in Haryana are running at full capacity.
“Both Maruti Suzuki and Suzuki Motor are in constant dialogue with the suppliers and encouraging them to expand capacity in line with the expansion plans. Several leading suppliers have already set up facilities in the area. This is likely to gather momentum, and further promote growth and job creation in the region,"" a Maruti spokesperson said in response to an email query from Mint.
According to the vendor cited above, suppliers find it difficult to hire skilled workers in the state. “Also workers from other states who eat non-vegetarian food find it difficult to get a place to stay. That’s why there are negligible amount of suppliers. Also our tier two suppliers are not convinced about moving there,"" the vendor added.
But carmakers are hopeful. “It is not as if the suppliers do not want to come. The business opportunity there was very limited and now some of them have started moving there as the production capacity of manufacturers has started to increase,"" said a senior executive of a car maker present in Gujarat, requesting anonymity.
According to a consultant, Suzuki’s move to expand in the state will ramp up supplier presence. “With Maruti Suzuki moving to Gujarat, the component suppliers will have to move there, which will be one of the automobile manufacturing hubs in the coming years. Also most of the vehicle manufacturers follow the just-in-time model of production which makes it imperative for suppliers to set up capacities around that of an OEM,"" said Puneet Gupta, associate director at forecasting firm IHS Markit. 
According to a spokesperson for Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India, on Acma’s request and overall interest of the auto industry in the region, Honda management will attend the roadshow. A spokesperson for Ford India also confirmed that managing director Anurag Mehrotra will attend the event.
The manufacturers mentioned above did not comment on the shortfall in the number of auto parts makers based in Gujarat. Tata Motors declined to comment on the issue."

New York/San Francisco: Waymo is teaming up with Jaguar Land Rover on autonomous vehicles, its second major automaker partnership and a big boost for the nascent technology that has come under scrutiny recently. 
New York/San Francisco: Waymo is teaming up with Jaguar Land Rover on autonomous vehicles, its second major automaker partnership and a big boost for the nascent technology that has come under scrutiny recently.
Under the accord, Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo will integrate its self-driving system into Jaguar’s I-Pace electric SUVs, the first all-electric offering from the luxury unit of Tata Motors Ltd. Waymo said it plans to place 20,000 autonomous I-Pace vehicles on the road for tests in 2018. By 2020, the vehicles will become part of Waymo’s ride-hailing taxi service, set to begin this year.
“It ended up being a really terrific next vehicle for us and fit one of the key aspects of our business plan,"" John Krafcik, Waymo’s chief executive officer, said in an interview. “We can get closer to getting just the right car for just the ride that person has requested.""
Waymo, which has racked up the most autonomous test miles on roads, is eager to work with more car companies to bolster its lead as it prepares to launch a commercial ride-hailing service. The companies didn’t disclose financial terms, but Waymo is planning to purchase the I-Pace vehicles, which sell for $69,500. That would place Waymo’s payment for the deal at more than $1.3 billion.
Jaguar CEO Ralf Speth said he’d already “ringfenced"" the 20,000 models of the I-Pace for Waymo.The vehicle will go on sale to the general public in the US towards the end of this year. He emphasized the partnership as a way for Jaguar to embrace new forms of transportation while preserving the thrill of driving that attracts new car buyers.
“It’s offering the right car, the right mobility for the right situation,"" Speth said at an event in New York announcing the deal. “If you sit in a traffic jam, you can do far more with your valuable time. But you also want to have the steering wheel to have the excitement of driving again. This is the kind of spectrum we want to offer our customers.""
A self-driving car from Uber Technologies Inc. hit and killed a pedestrian last week, which stunned the industry and kicked off a debate about the technology’s capabilities on open roads. On Saturday, Krafcik said he was confident that Waymo’s technology would have avoided the crash.
After courting major automakers for years, Waymo, the former Google self-driving project, inked its first deal with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV in 2016. Waymo then deployed Chrysler Pacifica minivans in its tests cities and, in January, said it was buying “thousands"" of the vehicles ahead of its commercial taxi service debut.
The Jaguar vehicles, like the Pacficas, will bear the Waymo logo and be part of its coming ride-hailing network. Yet Krafcik insisted that Jaguar has a financial stake in the deal. “It’s a real partnership,"" Krafcik said. “You’ll see aspects of that going forward.""
In September, Bloomberg reported that Jaguar Land Rover was weighing purchases of technology companies that could boost its efforts to roll out electric vehicles and autonomous driving systems. In June, the automaker said it had invested $25 million in Lyft Inc. as part of a funding round that closed in April. The company also said it’s working with Lyft on autonomous-driving technology and will offer vehicles for rent to the San Francisco-based startup’s drivers. Waymo has also announced a partnership with Lyft. Bloomberg"

371,2018-03-31,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors and Mahindra are speeding up their work on developing electric powertrains for their small commercial vehicles in the sub 2-tonne category

New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) Ltd are facing off once again, this time in electric engines. 
New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) Ltd are facing off once again, this time in electric engines.
Both are speeding up their work on developing electric powertrains for their small commercial vehicles in the sub 2-tonne category.
Tata Motors, India’s largest commercial vehicles maker, is developing an electric variant of its popular light commercial vehicle (LCV) Tata Ace that can carry up to 1 tonne.
“The new powertrain is already in the development stage and may hit the Indian market by late 2019 or early 2020,"" a person close to the development said, requesting anonymity.
M&M, which beat Tata Motors in LCV sales in the past two fiscal years, is also developing its own electric powertrain for its offerings in the sub 2-tonne segment, said another person aware of the issue, who also did not want to be named.
The rationale behind electric powertrains is that these vehicles would not require extensive charging stations like buses and will be used for transporting goods within a city or a town. Hence, a single charge would be enough to operate them throughout a day.
In the second avatar, or the FAME scheme, which is still being drafted by the Department of Heavy Industries, it is widely expected that the Union government will subsidize the purchase of electric vehicles for commercial purposes and both the companies think introducing an electric powertrain in its offerings in LCV segment will get a lot of traction in the market.
Both Tata Motors and M&M have already launched electric variants of their respective products—Tigor of Tata Motors and E-Verito of M&M—in the passenger vehicle segment and have been supplying these vehicles to Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) – a company floated by the ministry of power.
Vehicles like Tata Motors’ Ace and M&M’s Jeeto are used to move freight within cities. Hence, these vehicles with electric powertrains can be used by fleet owners as operational cost will be much lower and acquisition cost would also come down once subsidies are in place.
“Tata Motors is developing an electric variant of the small commercial vehicle Ace and is at the development stage now. It should be in the market by late 2019 or 2020. Given the way the Union government wants to encourage the use of EVs in commercial purposes, this is perfectly suitable for ferrying goods and passengers within city limits,"" said a person directly aware of the development. 
Tata Motors though showcased an electric variant of its small commercial vehicle Magic—used for ferrying passengers—at the Auto Expo 2018. “As you are aware, we had showcased Magic EV at the Auto Expo 2018. However, as a policy, we do not comment on future product innovations and launches,"" the firm said in response to an email query.
M&M did not respond to a query sent by Mint on Friday.
“Tata Motors is trying to consolidate its position in the electric commercial vehicle front. It has already launched electric buses and has been testing some of them in different states. With the introduction of the electric variant of Ace, the firm will further try to cement its position. Also, in the long run, this may help them get some lost market share back from M&M in the LCV space,"" said the person mentioned above, requesting anonymity.
According to the second person mentioned above, pricing will be key to its success since one section of the users are first-time customers and getting the vehicle financed is a problem initially.
“The LCV segment will get a lot of traction if an electric powertrain is introduced as these run within towns and cities and if the government decides to subsidize, fleet owners will buy electric variants,"" said Puneet Gupta, associate director, vehicle forecast, IHS Markit."

Mumbai: Tata Sons chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran has asked Tata Motors Ltd to create value for the group, especially from its domestic business, in line with his objective of making Tata group companies more accountable.
“The expectations on this company are very high. If you look at the market cap of Tata Motors group, actually there is no value, which is accorded to the Tata Motors domestic business, and I’m very confident that will change this year,"" Chandrasekaran said during a town hall meeting on Monday at Tata Motors Ltd’s manufacturing facility in Pune.
“Last year, if I said something positive, I was saying it with hope; but this year I’m saying all these positive statements not with hope but with confidence,"" Chandrasekaran said.
Although Chandra’s statement sets up a new task for the company, which is still undergoing a turnaround, it also instils confidence in the company and in its managing director and chief executive, Guenter Butschek, who has been spearheading the turnaround.
Tata Motors’ Indian unit reported a net profit of Rs184 crore in the three months ended 31 December. That helped the owner of British luxury car firm Jaguar Land Rover Plc post an 11-fold jump in its consolidated profit for the quarter.
Since February 2016, when Butschek took charge, Tata Motors has expanded its market share in the passenger vehicle category by 160 basis points (bps) to 6.2%. In the commercial vehicles category, its market share has increased by 130 bps to 47.5%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
“Tata Motors celebrates over 70 years of existence and on a lighter note, I complete two years of the challenge of leading this company,"" Butschek said in his speech during the town hall meeting.
“The turnaround is not over yet. Not when we still have to meet our board’s expectations, our chairman’s vision...,"" Butschek said, adding that it is important for the company that its passenger vehicle business becomes “financially self-sustainable"".
“We need to prove that investing in PV is the right value proposition.

Our FY 19 business plan will continue to remain extremely demanding with stretched targets, in terms of sales, market share and financial performance,"" he said. 
That would comfort Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata group. “It hurt me that we lost market share in the last four-to-five years and we became the company that the country looked at as a failing company.

Sales at Mahindra came in at 26,555 units, a 4.04% rise over the year ago. Rajan Wadhera, president of the automotive division at M&M, is confident of increasing market share in the UV segment on the back of three “critical"" launches lined up during fiscal year 2019.
During fiscal year 2018, the Mumbai-based auto conglomerate sold 549,154 cars, an 8.2% rise over the year ago, selling over 500,000 units after a gap of five years, the company said in a press release on Monday.
Tata Motors posted a 31.3% rise in sales to 20,266 units during the month on the back of increasing demand for SUVs Nexon and Hexa as the utility vehicle segment grew by 223%, showing a trend of growing customer base for the segment, the company said in a press release on Sunday. 
Demand was also driven by the Tiago hatchback and Tigor compact sedan, but the overall passenger car segment declined by 4%, the company added.
Fiscal year 2018 was a roller-coaster ride for the automobile industry. Even as the lows of demonetisation were beginning to wear off at the beginning of the fiscal, the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) put the brakes on sales mid-year. Nevertheless, sales of passenger cars and utility vehicles grew at a healthy pace, clocking low double-digit growth.
Going forward, Icra has forecast a 9-10% growth in passenger vehicle sales for fiscal year 2019, Ray said. New model launches, in addition to sustained demand from non-metro areas, are expected to drive volumes for auto OEMs, he added."

New Delhi: Shares of Tata Motors on Monday settled nearly 5% down on Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) job cut plans to scale back production at some of its UK sites.
Company’s scrip opened at Rs351.50, then fell to an intra-day low of Rs337.90 and finally settled for the day at Rs338.95, down 4.96% over its previous close. On NSE, the stock had fallen to an intra-day low of Rs337.55, then recovered some lost ground and finally settled at Rs340, down 4.78%.
Following the trend, the market capitalisation of the company fell by Rs5,110.62 crore to Rs97,866.68 crore at the end of Monday’s trade. Tata Motors-owned JLR on 13 April said it is planning to cut jobs as it scales back production at some of its UK sites amid “headwinds"" impacting the automotive industry. 
While JLR is yet to confirm the exact number of jobs to be lost, some reports indicate that around 1,000 temporary workers are likely to be hit. “In light of the continuing headwinds impacting the car industry, we are making some adjustments to our production schedules and the level of agency staff,"" a JLR statement had said."
360,2018-04-17,Tata Motors,"Reacting to the news of JLR job cuts, Tata Motors shares fell 5% to Rs338.95 apiece on Monday. Tata Motors is now down 27% since 1 April 2017as compared to BSE Auto index, which has rallied by 16%

The weekend was not a happy one for employees of Tata Motors Ltd’s unit Jaguar Land Rover Ltd (JLR) in the UK. The firm announced about 1,000 job cuts and relocation of some of its employees around plant locations. Reacting to this, on Monday investors dumped shares of Tata Motors that fell 5% to Rs338.95 apiece at the close of trading. The stock is now 27% down since 1 April 2017, a pathetic performance compared to benchmark indices such as the Sensex and BSE Auto index, both of which have rallied by 16%.  
The weekend was not a happy one for employees of Tata Motors Ltd’s unit Jaguar Land Rover Ltd (JLR) in the UK.

The stock is now 27% down since 1 April 2017, a pathetic performance compared to benchmark indices such as the Sensex and BSE Auto index, both of which have rallied by 16%. 
Indeed, the management may justify the job cuts as affecting only temporary jobs, which is done to manage the business and production cycles. However, the writing on the wall is clear. JLR is facing tough times with a sales slowdown. For the first time in eight quarters, the company’s sales contracted by 3.8%, although growth rates were coming off for a while now (see chart).
An analysis of region-wise sales numbers shows that JLR is losing heavily in the UK. Retail sales fell by 13% in fiscal year 2018 (FY18) after double-digit growth for three years. The story is similar in Europe, where sales contracted by 5%. That’s not all—growth in North America plummeted to 5% from 24% and 27% in the earlier two years. For JLR, these three regions account for about two-thirds the total vehicle sales. 
Reasons for the drop in sales range from stiff competition in the luxury segment to high tax rates on diesel cars to curb use of the fuel. However, some critics say the company has lost out on innovative new launches, which are important to lure customers in the high-end luxury market. 
With US protectionism gaining momentum, there could be taxes on imported vehicles, which may further thwart JLR sales in the region.
The company ’s only saving grace is China, where sales are rising, although there too growth is slowing.
Certainly, a firm’s products going downhill in the market is the first sign of trouble from an investor standpoint as it affects the ability to grow earnings. The next is employee layoffs as it implies weak cash flows and the need to trim costs. 
All this is against a backdrop of an imminent need for JLR to cough up billions to fund research on the next new wave of electric vehicles. This will hurt profit margins that are already ebbing away. 
The March quarter forecast for JLR is about 10% operating margin, down from its heydays of 15-16%. Add to this the foreign exchange losses on hedges during Brexit that have also eroded profitability. 
Thankfully, there is a sweet spot in that Tata Motors’ stand-alone business is booming on the back of a strong uptrend in commercial vehicle sales on home ground. 
But the fact remains that it is JLR that accounts for more than 90% of consolidated profits at Tata Motors. Even a small sneeze in that company sends shivers down the Tata Motors’ stock. 
One can anticipate a cut in earnings estimate on weak sales numbers and a tense outlook for FY19."
359,2018-04-19,Tata Motors,"Within the light commercial vehicles (LCV) segment, Ashok Leyland currently lags Mahindra and Mahindra and Tata Motors by over 100,000 units in sales

Mumbai: The Hinduja Group flagship, Chennai-based Ashok Leyland, plans to redesign its light commercial vehicles (LCVs) to serve the fast-growing Indian e-commerce industry’s last-mile delivery needs, according to a senior company executive. 
Mumbai: The Hinduja Group flagship, Chennai-based Ashok Leyland, plans to redesign its light commercial vehicles (LCVs) to serve the fast-growing Indian e-commerce industry’s last-mile delivery needs, according to a senior company executive.
LCVs are defined by industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) as vehicles having a maximum mass under 7.5 tonnes. The move puts India’s second-largest truck maker, with a no-discount policy for this segment, in direct competition with Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles Ltd (VECV), among others.
Online retailers, who outsource transportation to third-party logistics providers, require LCVs to have a wider and taller loading area (at the rear of the vehicle) to accommodate larger, but not necessarily heavier, cartons.
“One of the areas we are working on is to make our rear body area wider and taller to accommodate larger volumes of goods which are primarily sold by e-commerce companies, meaning white goods which are larger in size but not proportionately heavy,"" Nitin Seth, president of the LCV division at Ashok Leyland, said in an interview last week.
The effective working of the hub-and-spoke model (a pared-down network in which smaller centres are connected to large distribution stations) post the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) prompted the move as well.
“LCVs are the biggest beneficiary of GST. We saw much higher growth in the second half of the fiscal, a good part of which came from GST,"" Seth said.
“The hub-and-spoke model, which was the intention of the GST, is coming into play very, very effectively in the market as the truck can carry loads from the hub more effectively and the LCV serves the spokes (in last-mile deliveries),"" Seth added.
For the 2018 fiscal, Ashok Leyland’s LCV sales (of goods carriers) grew 34.07% to 41,156 units, according to Siam data. Within this segment, the company falls behind Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd by over a lakh units in sales.
Seth did not spell out the quantum of this growth that could be attributed to the e-commerce industry because the vehicles are not directly bought from original equipment makers, though he added that the market was seeing good traction in “purchases of hub-and spoke-models with higher capacity"".
To be sure, the company already caters to the e-commerce industry with the Dost+, launched in September last year with a higher tonnage and a larger and wider loading area.
Analysts say there is scope for growth within the LCV segment, especially when catering to the e-commerce industry.
“E-commerce, education, hospitals and hospitality are driving LCV sales. Ashok Leyland should bank on these and keep growing its LCV division at 25-30% for the next two to three years to achieve significant volumes,"" said Shaukat Ali, an analyst with Quantum Securities Ltd.
Though the LCV segment is getting crowded, there is scope for growth with product differentiation because it is not mature yet, Ali added.
Competition to cater to e-tailers is set to heat up. VECV is set to increase its thrust on the e-commerce industry. 
“This is a segment which no company worth its salt can afford to overlook. We are absolutely focused and clearly want to have a customer preference being given,"" said Shyam Maller, senior vice-president of sales and marketing at VECV. 
Late last year, VECV created close to 10 variants to cater to e-commerce transportation based on a combination of three cargo body lengths and as many payload-carrying capacities.
Ashok Leyland also aims to grow its LCV numbers by exporting to “very developed markets such as the Gulf and Russia"" during the next two fiscal years with the development of left-hand drive vehicles.
“The broader strategy is to introduce more products across categories and expand the distribution network as we address only 38% of the LCV market,"" Seth said.
The target is not to remain a small player, he added.
More variants in the Dost range are to be expected every quarter with Rs400 crore allocated to the LCV division late last year.
Analysts say the emphasis on diversification between divisions and markets will help Ashok Leyland beat the cyclicality and stiff competition in the domestic medium and heavy commercial vehicles market."

New Delhi: Homegrown auto major Tata Motors saw its market share in commercial vehicles (CVs) segment in the domestic market inch closer to 44% in 2017-18 riding on its turnaround strategy which aims at regaining lost ground to rivals. 
According to Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) data, Tata Motors sold a total of 3,76,456 units of CVs in 2017-18 as against 3,05,620 units in 2016-17, a growth of 23.17%. The overall industry CVs sales in 2017-18 were at 8,56,453 units in 2017-18 as against 7,14,082 units in 2016-17. 
In terms of market share, Tata Motors increased it to 43.95% in FY18 from 42.79% in FY17. 
Last August, while addressing shareholders, Tata Motors chairman N. Chandrasekaran expressed concern over the company’s falling CVs market share from a high of nearly 60% five years back and emphasised on the turnaround plan for its domestic business with a special focus on the ailing commercial vehicles business. 
“FY18 has been landmark year for the CV business of Tata Motors. Reviving the domestic CVs business was one of the key focus areas in the company’s turnaround strategy. We are delighted that we have gained good momentum and shown growth on the back of strong product portfolio across segments and intense customer engagement,"" Tata Motors president (commercial vehicles business) Girish Wagh told PTI. The execution of sales enhancement, rigorous cost reduction and timely product launches, delivered quick results on CV volumes, market share grew and bottom-line improved during the year, he added. 
“Besides significant ramp-up of production, structural de-bottlenecking of the supply chain and rationalisation of strategic supplier base were also undertaken as major projects,"" Wagh said. 
The company’s domestic sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles in FY18 stood at 1,68,013 units as against 1,48,901 units in FY17, a growth of 12.83%. In the light CV category, Tata Motors posted a growth of 33% in FY18 at 2,08,443 units as against 1,56,719 units in FY17. 
On the outlook for the new fiscal, Wagh said, “With the successful last year, the company is now changing gears to move one level higher with Turnaround 2.0 in FY19. We are confident that these measures will help us achieve our targets while improving our performance and taking customer centricity to the next level."""

Pune: Despite an improvement in market share in fiscal 2017-18, nine months after implementing a turnaround strategy, Guenter Butschek, the 57-year-old managing director of Tata Motors Ltd, is “uncomfortable"" about admitting progress. 
Pune: Despite an improvement in market share in fiscal 2017-18, nine months after implementing a turnaround strategy, Guenter Butschek, the 57-year-old managing director of Tata Motors Ltd, is “uncomfortable"" about admitting progress.
The turnaround strategy refers to Butschek’s mid-2016 plan to enhance the company’s top and bottom line performance by overhauling the domestic supply chain, product portfolio and organizational structure.
The initiative showed results when Tata Motors’ Indian unit reported a net profit of Rs184 crore in the three months ended 31 December. That helped the owner of British luxury car firm Jaguar Land Rover Plc post an 11-fold jump in its consolidated profit for the quarter.
India’s largest automaker by revenue has continued the programme, terming it Turnaround 2.0, with a special focus on its passenger vehicles division, which has languished over the past few years.
“What we have learned is that a single focused mindset is the benefit of a turnaround; it is the proper answer for the ...highly competitive and volatile India market. The turnaround mindset needs to get into the DNA of the company to deal with the volatility in the market,"" Butschek said on Wednesday, on the sidelines of the launch of the Ultra range of commercial vehicles (CVs).
“We will continue our (turnaround) journey into fiscal 2018-19. Success creates hunger for further success and we are hungry. As we further ramp up our capacity, we will certainly further enhance our sales to the extent that we would like to outpace the market across all segments. This means we are bound to gain further market share,"" he added.
Having clawed back market share losses in the commercial vehicles segment, Tata aims to break into the top three passenger carmakers by the end of the year.
“For us as an organization, it was critical to get the revenue and profitability right, which was in terms of CVs. The logical consequence was that because it (the turnaround) worked for CVs, it should work for PVs as well,"" Butschek said.
However, the turnaround is not yet complete for CVs. Despite investing in additional capacities, de-bottlenecking its own machine operations and supply chain to increase overall output by 70%, Butschek “certainly regrets a good number of restrictions in MHCV (medium and heavy commercial vehicles)"", demand for which significantly rose due to an overloading ban imposed in some states during the year. 
Butschek describes the failure to de-bottleneck the supply chain and ramp up capacity in line with demand as “the strongest admission of failure in the past"".
The restrictions were not in terms of volumes, but the mix the flagship of the Tata group could manufacture, Butschek said. “The restrictions we had were lesser on our side but on the suppliers’ side. These are constraining our movement in market share,"" he said.
“We expect to be almost unconstrained by the second quarter except as we move forward, something else will pop up which we don’t have on our radar,"" Butschek added.
Speaking of how sustainable the turnaround has been after showing initial results in the December quarter, Butschek said that the company witnessed “higher sales volumes, multiplied with products with better contribution margins and profitability in the fourth quarter. It would be a surprise if it hadn’t led to a positive operating profit before tax (PBT)"", without disclosing details since the company will announce its March quarter earnings after mid-May."

Greater modularity not only reduced costs but also helped the company build in “a lot of specific points of not only tonnage but also wheel bases and more so applications (and uses)"", which will enable Tata Motors to address a large part of the market, according to Wagh.
Wagh also hopes to take advantage of the trend of the industry moving “clearly towards higher payload vehicles, even in small CVs"", with the modular range.
With the new range of Ultra trucks, Tata “is poised very well to address a lot of requirements which are coming due to a changing economy"", apart from “the micro and macro factors that will anyway lead to demand"", Wagh said.
“The new range will help us cater to more uses and therefore increase our volumes and share,"" he said.
Modularity and commonization of platforms also help with capacity utilisation, reducing risks, improving vehicle reliability and reducing time to market.
Tata Motors has also built a bus on the Ultra platform, which is seeing “very good demand"", according to Wagh.
Driving down costs is a vital part of managing director Guenter Butschek’s mid-2016 plan to turn around the domestic division of Tata Motors, which reported its first quarterly profit after five quarters in the three months ended December. Tata Motors decided to pare the number of platforms used in its passenger vehicle (PV) business as well in mid-2016 to reduce costs and inefficiencies.
With Tata’s ILCV division set up only in 2014 as the company began to take cognizance of the segment’s growing prominence in terms of volumes, Wagh expects the segment to do better than some others in the industry, clocking a low double-digit growth. In the 2018 fiscal, Tata held a market share of around 44.2%, selling over 46,500 vehicles."

London: Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover took centre-stage as newly-wed Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, headed to their wedding reception in Windsor.  
London: Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover took centre-stage as newly-wed Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, headed to their wedding reception in Windsor. 
A silver-blue classic 1960s Jaguar E-Type, remodelled into Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) electric-powered Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero, was waiting for Harry last evening to drive his new wife to Frogmore House for an intimate wedding reception for 200 friends and family being hosted by his father Prince Charles. 
The car bore a special registration number in honour of the royal wedding—E190518—marking the date of their wedding. With the tag line of “the most beautiful electric car in the world"", the vehicle symbolised the couple’s eco-friendly side.
“Our aim with Concept Zero is to give Classic Jaguars a sustainable future in changing environmental and economic conditions,"" said Tim Hannig, Director of Jaguar Land Rover Classic. As she stepped out hand-in-hand with Harry in a formal suit, Markle had changed into a white Stella McCartney halter-neck silk crepe gown and Aquazzura shoes with baby blue soles for the black-tie reception. 
In a break from tradition, she gave a speech at the event to thank her father-in-law the Prince of Wales for stepping into the role of walking her down the aisle at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle earlier in the day after her own father Thomas Markle was a no-show due to health reasons. 
The 36-year-old former actress also wore a special wedding gift from her new husband in memory of his mother Princess Diana—an emerald-cut aquamarine ring which belonged to the late Diana, Princess of Wales. Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra, one of Markle’s close friends invited to the wedding, took to social media to post a special tribute to the new bride and congratulate the newly-weds. 
In an emotional Instagram post alongside a series of images of the new couple, she wrote, “Every once in a while there is a moment when time stands still... That happened today...You, my friend, were the epitome of grace, love and beauty. Every choice made at this wedding by you both will go down in history, not just because it was your wedding but because this incredible wedding stood for change and hope. Both things that the world needs desperately. Thank you for being the perfect picture of all things good,"" she wrote. 
The 33-year-old actress, now famous in Hollywood for her role as Agent Alex Parish in Quantico, changed her lavender Vivian Westwood suit from earlier in the day to a golden Dior gown for the evening reception.
After performing some of his classics at the lunch reception hosted by Queen Elizabeth II at St George’s Hall in Windsor Castle soon after the wedding ceremony at the chapel, pop star Elton John paid tribute to the couple on Twitter, quoting the poet Maya Angelou: “Love recognises no barriers. It jumps hurdles, leaps fences, penetrates walls to arrive at its destination, full of hope"". 
The highlight of the Queen’s reception was John singing his hits ‘Your Song’ and ‘Tiny Dancer’, both of which he had previously sung at a benefit concert for Diana organised by Prince Harry and Prince William in honour of their mother in 2007. 
William, his brother’s best man at the wedding ceremony, later struck a poignant note in memory of their mother during his speech at the evening reception. The couple had selected celebrity DJ Sam Totolee to get the guests dancing into the night. They have put off their honeymoon for now and plan to spend some time in the UK before a getaway."

Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd’s March quarter profit fell by half from a year ago as vehicle sales declined at its British unit Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) Automotive Plc and its Indian operation reported a loss. 
Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd’s March quarter profit fell by half from a year ago as vehicle sales declined at its British unit Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) Automotive Plc and its Indian operation reported a loss.
Net profit, including those of its units, fell to Rs2,175.16 crore for the three months ended 31 March from Rs4,336.43 crore in the same period a year earlier. Sales rose 15.9% to Rs91,279.09 crore from Rs78,746.61 crore a year ago.
A Bloomberg poll of 16 analysts had estimated a quarterly profit at Rs3,748 crore on sales of Rs88,196 crore.
Profit was hit by a weak performance by JLR—which accounts for over 80% of Tata Motors’ profit—in addition to a loss at the domestic unit.
JLR posted a 3.8% year-on-year decline in sales to 172,709 units. Sales in Europe, including the UK, continued to decline, while sales growth in China slowed to 11%. The American market sprang a surprise with a 3.48% rise in sales to 36,325 units during the quarter.
JLR saw a “tough and challenging"" year, with sales weighed down by factors such as Brexit, adverse taxation on diesel cars in the UK and Europe, and market cyclicality in the US and UK, Ralf Speth, chief executive at the luxury carmaker, said at a press conference after the results announcement. Going forward, JLR is “absolutely confident"" and is “going in the right direction"" on the back of a strong demand from India and China, and a strengthened product portfolio, with five new models and refreshes coming in last year, including the best-selling Range Rover Velar and Discovery. These will gain traction and volumes this fiscal, Speth added.
For the coming fiscal, JLR will spend close to £4.5 billion on the development of new vehicles and next-gen technologies, as it aims to have an electric variant for each model by 2020.
The UK-based unit posted an Ebitda margin of 12.2% during the fiscal, down 1.8 percentage points from a year ago. Ebitda—or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization—is a measure of operating profitability.
The unit’s revenue rose about 4% to £7.6 billion.
After a one-off profit in the December quarter, Tata Motors’ domestic business reported a loss in the March quarter. The business, however, narrowed its loss to Rs499.94 crore in the quarter from a loss of Rs805.93 crore in the year-ago quarter.

New Delhi: Tata Motors has stopped production of its once popular compact car Indica and Indigo CS sedan since the demand for these products plummeted over the past two years. 
The capacity will now be used to manufacture the recently launched and upcoming products of the company.
Indica—launched in 1998—was one of the popular offerings from the company’s stable and was the preferred choice in the commercial taxi segment as well. Even after the launch of Zest (a compact sedan) and Bolt (a hatchback), in 2014, Indica continued to be the best selling model of Tata Motors until Tiago was introduced.
“With the changing market dynamics and the evolution of Tata Motors design language towards impactful design, we have decided to phase out the Indica and the Indigo CS, a common phenomenon in a product lifecycle. We will continue to serve our extended family of Indica and Indigo customers by providing them the necessary service support,"" said a spokesperson of the company in a statement.
In order to revive its fortunes in the domestic market, the Mumbai-based car maker has launched four new products in the domestic market—Tiago, Hexa, Tigor and Nexon—in the last two fiscal years and the existing capacity of the firm in Pune and Sanand will be used to manufacture these products. Tata Motors is also expected to launch a compact utility vehicle in India in collaboration with British subsidiary Jaguar and Land Rover.
“We have stopped the production of these vehicles since there was no demand for such products anymore in the domestic market. The new offerings are doing well and a decision has been taken to increase the manufacturing of the new products,"" said a person directly aware of the development requesting anonymity. The production of Indica in FY17 stood at 19,042 units and in FY18 it dropped substantially to 1,686 units. The same for Indigo CS stood at 14,976 units in FY17 while it nosedived to just 556 units in the following year.
“For the past two decades, the Tata Indica—India’s first, fully indigenous passenger car—has been the frontrunner of Tata Motors’ PV line-up. Establishing itself as a ‘coming of age car’ for India, the Indica has been a much loved and admired brand. The Indica was followed by the Indigo launch in 2002. The Indigo too was received well in the PV market,"" said spokesperson of Tata Motors in the above mentioned statement."

Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd, India’s largest automaker by sales revenue and second largest by net profit, will report its March quarter (Q4 FY18) results on Wednesday. 
Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd, India’s largest automaker by sales revenue and second largest by net profit, will report its March quarter (Q4 FY18) results on Wednesday.
Driven by a sharp turnaround in the domestic business, but dragged by a slowdown in demand faced by the UK subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) Automotive Plc, the Tata Group flagship is expected to report a net profit of Rs3,748 crore on net sales of Rs88,196 crore, according to a Bloomberg poll of 16 analysts.
JLR sales volume fell in the single digits, while the domestic market was buoyed by higher passenger and commercial vehicle sales.
Analysts estimate consolidated margins to fall by over 140 basis points during the quarter—primarily dragged by JLR’s weak performance due to a model run-down cycle and disfavour for its diesel-heavy portfolio, despite lower foreign exchange and hedging losses, gains from expressing pound revenues in rupee terms (as the pound appreciated about 8% against the rupee during the quarter) and higher scale in JLR’s operations.
One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Here are a few factors to track in the fourth quarter results for FY18:
JLR volumes
Total JLR volumes during the quarter fell 3.8% over the year-ago to 172,709 units, with only three models out of 13 posting growth, according to company data. Total JLR sales weighed in most on the decline with a 7.49% decline to 49,931 units, led by a 41.33% fall in sales of the XE, whereas Land Rover sales fell 2.2% to 122,778 units, with the Defender dragging sales.
Among international markets, North America, China and other markets performed better over the year ago, with China contributing the most with an 11.06% rise in sales to 37,306 units on the back of the long-wheelbase Jaguar XFL. However, China had been posting growth upwards of 20% in the past few quarters up to September.
Margins
Analysts expect a sharp year-on-year fall in the UK subsidiary’s margins, on the back of rising competition in the premium SUVs segment, higher discounting in larger markets such as the USA and Europe, and an overall slowdown in demand.
JLR’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin for the three months ended 31 March is estimated at 12.7%, a fall of 181 bps from the year-ago, wrote Joseph George and Suraj Chheda of IIFL Institutional Equities in a 9 April research note. The Ebitda margin is a key measure of operating profitability.
Domestic operations
Total domestic sales during the March quarter rose by a significant 38.74% to 187,874 units, as per the company’s monthly wholesales releases.
These numbers were driven primarily by passenger vehicles, with the division clocking 43.04% growth to 58,092 units on the back of increasing demand for new launches such as the Nexon and Hexa UVs, in addition to the Tiago hatchback and Tigor compact sedan, the company said in the release.
The commercial vehicles division, the cash cow at the firm, also posted a stellar 36.9% jump in growth during the quarter to 129,782 units, with medium and heavy commercial vehicles clocking a 19.9% growth in sales to 45,111 units on the back of the government’s push towards infrastructure development, restriction on overloading in select states, an uptick in road construction and mining activities, along with an increasing demand from e-commerce and other retail applications.
The company’s standalone Ebitda margin is expected to rise by nearly five percentage points to 9% over the year ago on the back of the company’s focus on cost‐cutting initiatives to drive profitability,wrote George and Chheda of IIFL.
During the March quarter, Tata Motors share price fell 24.06% to Rs327.45 on the BSE, while the benchmark Sensex lost 3.2% during the period to 32,968.68 points."

Tata Motors Ltd’s consolidated revenue increased 18% in the March quarter (Q4). Revenue of the standalone entity, consisting largely of its India business, jumped 45%, making a meaningful contribution to overall growth. Excluding the translation gains (revenue conversion from the UK pound to the Indian rupee—the pound appreciated against the rupee last quarter), revenue growth will stand at around 12%, which is decent. 
Tata Motors Ltd’s consolidated revenue increased 18% in the March quarter (Q4). Revenue of the standalone entity, consisting largely of its India business, jumped 45%, making a meaningful contribution to overall growth. Excluding the translation gains (revenue conversion from the UK pound to the Indian rupee—the pound appreciated against the rupee last quarter), revenue growth will stand at around 12%, which is decent.
But this double-digit revenue growth did not count for much. Profitability at the consolidated entity softened as expenses grew at a faster pace. As a consequence, Q4 profit of Tata Motors almost halved from the year-ago quarter.
The drop in earnings is largely due to the weak show at the company’s UK Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) unit which generates most of Tata Motors’ revenue and profit. Profit before tax at the division slumped 46% due to a sharp rise in depreciation and amortization expenses. The quarter has seen a development expense charge to the tune of £97 million. But even adjusted for this, the operating margin at JLR has seen a noticeable reduction from the year- ago quarter.
The expenses would not have looked this high had JLR been doing well on the sales front. But the scenario here remains dull. Retail sales at the division are down 3.8% during the quarter. The demand environment remains challenging. Except India and China, none of the key markets—the UK, Europe and the US—are looking up for JLR.
Sales in the UK and Europe have been hit by the Brexit transition and increasing regulations on diesel cars, while the US is seeing a cyclical slowdown in volume. To counter the regulatory headwinds and changing consumer preferences, such as the shift to electric vehicles and new-age cars, JLR has stepped up investments. It has invested £4.2 billion in the previous fiscal year and plans to invest an additional £4.5 billion in the current fiscal year, developing new models and technologies.
The product portfolio is expected to begin reflecting the investments from 2019. By 2020, the management expects the company to have a fairly relevant portfolio in terms of electric vehicles and other offerings. But while these investments are the need of the hour, it will also induce near-term pain.
High investments at JLR are leading to negative free cash flows and have driven up debt levels. With raw material costs on an upswing, the fear is that high capex will weigh on JLR, thereby affecting the consolidated entity’s profitability in the near term. The management plans to focus on the premium part of the business and extract better cost efficiencies. But much depends on sales momentum at JLR. To be sure, the management expects better sales at the division in FY19. But improvement in profitability at the unit can be rather gradual, with noticeable gains expected to be seen only after FY19. 
The Tata Motors’ stock is reflecting some of these concerns. Compared to a 13% rise in the Sensex, the stock lost 31% over the last year as the slowdown at JLR became more visible. But with the March quarter results showing no let-up in pressure on profitability and the company projecting a rather gradual recovery in margins, the outlook continues to look dim."

Mumbai: Tata Motors shares plunged about 8% on Thursday hitting a 27-month low with brokerages slashing the target price on the back of a 50% fall in the company’s profit for the March quarter. 
The stock closed at Rs288.95, a level last seen on 11 February 2016. Tata Motors has been the worst performing stock in the 50-share index Nifty, losing 34% in this year. 
Dragged by Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) weak performance Tata Motors reported consolidated net profit fell to Rs2,175.16 crore for the fourth quarter from Rs4,336.43 crore in the year-ago period. The auto major’s performance in the quarter was impacted on account of exceptional and additional charges of Rs2,113 crore for projects, which are yet to be taken forward. 
Analysts said that the near-term demand outlook for JLR remains challenging due to weakness in key markets, including the UK, Europe and the US. Most analysts have trimmed their target prices on the stock citing headwinds for the British subsidiary.
Revising its target price to Rs398 per share from Rs477, Kotak Securities Ltd said that JLR’s Ebitda margin is expected to face headwinds from change in product development cost capitalisation policy, higher incentives and weak demand in certain markets. The brokerage firm has a buy rating on the stock. 
Edelweiss Securities Ltd has also cut the target price to Rs351 from Rs442 a piece. Though it has a hold rating, Edelweiss Securities has revised down the FY19-20 Ebitda by 12%, each, and earnings per share (EPS) by 31% and 21%, respectively, due to the changes in the company’s accounting policy for capitalisation of research and development spends.
“We are enthused by intensified restructuring initiatives to improve cash flow, efficiency, and non-core assets sale, and JLR’s strong product pipeline; and volume and margin revival in India. However, sustained demand headwinds in the UK, the EU and the US for JLR, and the higher capex of GBP 4.5 billion in FY19, are anticipated to lead to another year of negative FCF (free cash flow),"" it said in a report on 23 May. It maintains hold rating on the stock."

New Delhi: Tata Motors has shelved its ambitious sports car project, RaceMo, which was unveiled with much fanfare at the Geneva international motor show last year.
The RaceMo is among the projects in both passenger vehicles (PV) and commercial vehicles (CV) segments which the company has decided to pull the plug after a review of its capitalisation policy on product development.
“...now we’ve introduced a new capitalisation gateway in our product approval process on affordability, which means even though if there’s a business case that is valid, we’ll take it forward only if it meets the affordability gateway,"" Tata Motors group CFO P.B. Balaji told analysts.
The company has made an impairment provision of Rs1,641.38 crore for quarter ended 31 March 2018 related to under development and capital work-in-progress after reviewing its product development programmes. 
Balaji said some of it were exceptional in nature because these projects were not going to be taken forward at all, and some of it were “just asset write-offs that had to be taken because these are restructuring projects that we have also taken to save cash"".
“All products or categories that we are not intending to continue further have all been taken in exceptional (items) for Tata Motors,"" he added.
When asked about details of the shelved projects, a Tata Motors spokesperson said, “The projects are both in CV and PV and include projects like RaceMo in the case of PV, launch of new products in other export markets which we don’t intend to proceed further and write-offs taken to release assets that will be redeployed to save cash flows.""
Balaji has also stated if Tata Motors could get a good buyer who could invest money in the RaceMo project, the company would consider working together. When it was unveiled in Geneva last year in March, Tata Motors had planned to sell the RaceMo sports car under TAMO badge. 
It was proposed to be powered by a rear-mounted 1.2 litre petrol engine delivering 190 PS of power. Tata Motors had built it on patented MOFlex Multi-Material Sandwich (MMS) structure — a structural technology, enabling greater freedom in surface design, efficient large-scale part integration leading to modularity and faster time to market.
Things, however, did not go as planned for the RaceMo when the company under the stewardship of new Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran started reviewing projects with a focus on turning around the ailing domestic business."

Mumbai: It was smooth sailing for automakers during the month of May as new launches buoyed sales, spurred by robust retail demand on the back of continued economic recovery. 
Mumbai: It was smooth sailing for automakers during the month of May as new launches buoyed sales, spurred by robust retail demand on the back of continued economic recovery.
India’s top five carmakers, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd and Honda Cars India Ltd, collectively sold 243,856 units during the month, up 20.6% from 202,187 units a year ago.
Automakers in India consider dispatches to dealerships as sales. New model launches by five of the seven carmakers reporting sales led to a jump in numbers because they filled inventory channels.
Moreover, a broader economic recovery, led by non-metro geographies, also spurred demand. This uptick in demand was reflected in the 7.7% GDP growth during the three months ended March, up from 7.2% in the December quarter. Growth had been lagging below 7% since demonetization in November 2016.
To be sure, the broader manufacturing industry cooled off in May. The Nikkei manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 51.2 in the month from 51.6 in April, led by weaker domestic demand and output expansion, said Sonal Varma, managing director and chief India economist, Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd, in a 1 June note.
The index remained above 50, which indicates growth, for the tenth month in a row.
Passenger car market leader Maruti Suzuki’s domestic sales (excluding vans and commercial vehicles) jumped 23% to 144,780 units in May over the year-ago period, as the compact car segment led growth with a 50.8% jump to 77,263 units. The local arm of Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor Corp. is facing robust demand for the next-generation Swift, premium hatchback Baleno and compact sedan Dzire in this segment.
The utility vehicles segment, including the best-selling Vitara Brezza and S-Cross models, also contributed with a 13.4% rise in sales to 25,629 units over May last year. An automatic transmission variant of the Brezza was launched during the month.
However, old workhorses Alto and WagonR and the mid-sized sedan Ciaz continued to be in the red, declining 3.1% and 14.8%, respectively.
With new variants of the three models, in addition to the next-gen Ertiga MUV (multi-utility vehicle), to be launched later this fiscal, Maruti is expected to maintain its leadership position in the short term, analysts said.
The local arm of South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co. reported a 7.14% rise in sales to 45,008 units in May, on the back of next-generation models such as compact SUV Creta and Elite i20 hatchback launched during the month. The Grand i10 hatchback and Verna mid-sized sedan also continued to drive growth, according to Rakesh Srivastava, director of sales and marketing at the firm.
Sales at homegrown automaker Mahindra were almost flat at 20,715 units during “the relatively subdued month"", according to Rajan Wadhera, president of the automotive division at the firm.
“With the forecast of an upcoming normal monsoon, we are confident of good growth in the coming months,"" he added.
It was a “challenging"" month for Tata Motors as well, with “retail slowing down"", according to Mayank Pareek, president of the passenger vehicles business at the firm. However, the Tata group flagship posted a 61.11% jump in sales to 17,489 units during the month on the back of continued demand for the new crop of models, namely the Nexon compact SUV and Hexa SUV, followed by the Tiago hatchback and Tigor sedan.
Pareek said the automatic transmission variant of the Nexon, launched during May, has received “an overwhelming response"", adding that Tata “will continue to strive towards driving volumes and increasing market share as part of the ongoing turnaround journey"".
The maker of the City sedan, Honda Cars India, reported a 40.66% rise in sales to 15,864 units, on the back of the next-generation Amaze sedan launched in May, according to Rajesh Goel, senior vice-president and director of sales and marketing at the firm.
Going forward, the prediction of a normal monsoon across the country by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) will buttress demand, in addition to the government’s continued focus on developing infrastructure and the rural sector.
However, higher prices of raw materials such as oil and steel may weigh on profit margins and build inflationary pressures, said Varma of Nomura.
The Reserve Bank of India expects India’s economic growth to strengthen to 7.4% in the current fiscal, from 6.7% in 2017-18."
340,2018-06-04,Tata Motors,"Further cash demands from parent Tata Motors may threaten Jaguar Land Rover's ability to raise finance for future investment needs

Big trucks are all the rage in India, but Tata Motors Ltd’s fortunes are still riding on a luxury marque that isn’t quite built for the subcontinent’s roads. 
Big trucks are all the rage in India, but Tata Motors Ltd’s fortunes are still riding on a luxury marque that isn’t quite built for the subcontinent’s roads.
Medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicles have been the fastest-growing segment of India’s rapidly expanding auto market, with sales up more than 60% in May from a year earlier as transport companies upgrade fleets. That’s been a tailwind for Tata Motors, one of the country’s biggest truck manufacturers: the company reduced net losses at its local operations in the financial year ended 31 March and managed to expand still-slim Ebitda margins, despite large one-time restructuring charges.
That’s a stark turnaround from what CEO Guenter Butschek called a “crisis situation"" less than a year ago. Yet investors haven’t been impressed. Tata Motors stock has fallen around 7% in Mumbai since it announced Q4 results in May.
They’re right to be cautious. Tata Motors’ previous attempts to boost its India business haven’t worked out so well. When the automaker started ramping up its consumer finance arm to back purchases of trucks, it ended up with non-performing assets (NPAs) equal to 25% of the loan book. In September, the company completely wrote off a portfolio of loans on which it had provided guarantees in an effort to boost sales.
With truck sales back in an upcycle, Tata Motors Finance Ltd has returned to growth mode: loan disbursements grew 66% over the past year and, worryingly, its corporate lending book doubled.
Still, if the India trend turns against Tata Motors again, there’s always its crown jewel, Jaguar Land Rover. The UK unit contributes most of the company’s value anyway: on a sum-of-the-parts valuation basis, it accounts for more than 70% of Tata Motors’ value per share. The trouble now is that Jaguar’s value is being eroded.
JLR is doing what most car companies have so far shied away from: spend. Others such as Toyota Motor Corp. are squarely in cost-cutting mode or, like General Motors Co., leaning on deep-pocketed investors like SoftBank Group Corp. to steer forward their dreams of electrification and autonomy. It’s impressive then that Jaguar has plowed more than £4 billion ($5.4 billion) into new products and technology, or north of 16% of revenue. At the same time, that investment is necessary because the company remains highly exposed to diesel fuel and sagging auto markets.
Despite the cash burn, JLR has continued to send dividends up to its parent—averaging £150 million a year. The payout increased to £225 million this year, around a fifth of Jaguar’s net income, and will rise further to a quarter of the unit’s profit.
The quantum isn’t large in absolute terms, but raising the dividend when Jaguar needs to preserve cash begs the question: why now? Especially since the Indian business has started generating free cash flow for the first time in five years, as CFO P. B. Balaji boasted last month. (Admittedly, its balance sheet is still weak, with cash equal to about 40% of short-term debt.)
Bond investors haven’t liked the manoeuvre: Jaguar’s bonds due 2027 are trading at 88 cents on the dollar after dropping more than 10% this year. For all the halo of security that a parent provides, Tata Motors doesn’t guarantee or assume any liability for the British carmaker’s notes. The Mumbai-based company exerts significant control over any matter that requires shareholders’ approval, Jaguar’s bond prospectus states. That would include bigger and bigger dividends (though these are capped at 50% of Jaguar’s net income or cumulative profits since 2011). 
Further cash demands from Tata Motors may threaten Jaguar’s ability to raise finance for future investment needs. The unit’s profitability is squeezed and it has pinned its hopes on China. Tata Motors could also imperil its plans to leverage the premium brand’s technology to put mass-market cars on India’s roads. One option would be to spin off Jaguar into a listed company, but with the Indian business still relatively weak, that might be too much for Tata Motors to accept.
Luxury vehicles offer a smooth and comfortable ride. Drive them on the wrong roads, though, and there’s always the risk of hitting a pothole."

New Delhi: Tata Motors is open to divesting stake in its financing arm, Tata Motors Finance, which is expected to have Rs50,000 crore of assets under management by 2020, according to company officials. 
The auto major, however, intends to keep control in Tata Motors Finance Ltd (TMFL), an entity which it expects to play a key role in its future growth even as it sells a stake in other businesses or winds up some operations abroad as part of a restructuring exercise. “Of course, we are very clear that we will now continue to invest as far as Tata Motors Finance is concerned. We will maintain control as far as Tata Motors Finance is concerned. But clearly, there is no intention to say that it should always hold at 100%. That is also clear,"" Tata Motors group CFO P.B. Balaji told analysts. 
He said the company expects “a very strong broad-based rebound"" in TMFL, which saw 24% increase in assets under management (AUM) in 2017-18 at Rs27,932 crore as against Rs22,517 crore in 2016-17. 
“Probably the most heartening to see is gross NPA has gone from 18% last year (FY17) down to 4% (in FY18) and the business actually generates an ROE (return on equity) of 17%,"" Balaji added. 
Elaborating on strategic goals, Tata Motors Finance Ltd(TMFL) CEO Samrat Gupta said in an investor presentation that the company is aiming to be a “Rs50,000 crore asset under management group"" by 2020. As part of the plan, TMFL also plans to expand its reach by increasing total branches across India to 500 by 2020 from 270 at present, he added. 
Moreover, Gupta said TMFL is also targeting to “attain 20% sustainable ROE"" by 2020. Apart from driving up financing of its new vehicles by TMFL, Tata Motors also looking at the financing arm to help its partner suppliers with poor financial health. 
Conducting the financial risk assessment of stressed vendors, providing assistance in correcting capital structure and financial working capital requirements are some of the areas that Tata Motors is looking to leverage on TMFL. The significance of TMFL to Tata Motors is in contrast to other businesses such as defence the sale of which is in progress. 
Balaji said Tata Motors is “now holding for sale of a stake in Tata Technologies as well as Tata Hitachi"" and some small shareholding in other companies like Tata Steel. 
“We are winding up our Spain business (Tata Hispano), which is already in final stages as well as Tata Precision in Singapore has been wound up,"" he added."
336,2018-06-13,Tata Motors,"JLR sales rose 11.87% and 6.14% in April and May on the back of recent launches such as Range Rover Velar, Land Rover Discovery and Jaguar E-Pace

Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd-owned Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc (JLR) is showing early signs of recovery in sales volumes on the back of refreshed models. The British auto maker had witnessed a severe downturn during the quarter to March, owing to a model rundown cycle. 
Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd-owned Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc (JLR) is showing early signs of recovery in sales volumes on the back of refreshed models. The British auto maker had witnessed a severe downturn during the quarter to March, owing to a model rundown cycle.
Following the launch of the new Range Rover Velar and Land Rover Discovery SUVs, and the compact Jaguar SUV E-Pace, the firm’s sales rose 11.87% and 6.14% in April and May, respectively. The UK’s largest auto maker said in a 7 June release that April sales were at 45,180 units, while in May the firm sold 48,281 units.
However, the more established models, which have not received a facelift, were still weighing down on sales, with only five out of the 13 JLR cars witnessing sales growth during the period.
JLR sales slowed during the December quarter, with a mere 3.45% rise from a year ago to 154,447 units, while sales in the quarter ended March had fallen by 3.8% to 172,709 units.
Between April and May, JLR did well across markets, except in Europe. The firm’s UK sales were back in the black with a 3.4% rise. And, despite the Chinese deferring their buying decisions with the government expected to cut import duty on cars from 25% to 10%, effective 1 July, analysts said the 12% growth witnessed in China (on an adjusted basis) was “significant"".
“China is a key market for us and we welcome the reduction in import tariffs announced in May,"" said Felix Brautigam, chief commercial officer, JLR. He added that the deferring of purchases “will be temporary and will further strengthen demand"".
JLR will begin retailing the E-Pace compact SUV in China in August, which is also expected to boost sales.
Analysts estimate sales to rise in the low single-digits this fiscal year and low double-digits in FY20 following the launch of new models and the import duty cut in China, where customers are expected to hold off the purchases in June as well. However, sales in the US, UK and Europe are expected to weaken in the current financial year due to several factors, including cyclicality in demand, rising competition in the premium SUV segment, and the uncertainty over taxation on diesel vehicles, besides Brexit.
In a 1 June note, Jinesh Gandhi, senior vice president, equity research, Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, said that over the next one to two years, several factors will drive an improved operating performance at JLR on the back of a “demand recovery as the base normalises and the full benefit of new launches reflects in FY19"". 
A continued moderation in foreign exchange, hedging losses in the first half of FY19 and lower costs at the newly-established Slovakia plant, will also support profitability, he added.
Since JLR accounts for a lion’s share of its parent Tata Motors’ profit, it is of no surprise that the scrip has lost nearly 21.2% since October 2017. Weak JLR numbers during the December and March quarters had resulted in a lower-than-expected consolidated net profit for Tata Motors. With the revival in fortunes of the British subsidiary, Gandhi of Motilal Oswal sees “a very favourable risk-reward scenario for the scrip, with a worst-case downside of close to 13% and a base case upside of about 66%, at current prices""."

New Delhi: Tata Motors plans to launch around 50 commercial vehicles (CVs) this fiscal as it looks to further consolidate its position in the segment, a top company official said. 
New Delhi: Tata Motors plans to launch around 50 commercial vehicles (CVs) this fiscal as it looks to further consolidate its position in the segment, a top company official said.
The auto major, which saved close to  ₹ 1,900 crore in 2017-18 by enforcing cost-saving measures across CV and passenger vehicle segments, aims to achieve similar kind of savings in the current fiscal as well.
The company has also lined up a capex in the range of  ₹ 1,500 crore for CV vertical for the current fiscal. The amount would go into R&D, capacity expansion and towards making products compliant with BS VI emission norms before government deadline of 1 April 2020.
“Last year we launched more than 50 new products including variants and facelifts. This year also we will continue at the same rate in terms of new product launches,"" Tata Motors president (commercial vehicles business) Girish Wagh told PTI in an interview.
In order to set up a long-term strategy to introduce new products in the country, the firm is in the process of putting up a very strong product planning vertical in the company, he added.
“The focus of this entity is only to look into the future, see how customer requirements are changing, how global markets are and how things have changed there,"" Wagh said. The entity is tasked with the job of creating a five-year product plan, he added. 
Tata Motors is the leading player in the CV space in the country. At the end of last fiscal, the company’s market share in the segment in domestic market stood at 45.1%, up from 44.4% in 2016-17.
Commenting on the cost saving measures adopted by the company, Wagh said the initiative helped accrue good cost reduction last fiscal. “With the ideas generated last year, we continue to work during this year as well and there is a very good potential for cost reduction even this year,"" he added. 
With significant increase in commodity prices this year, the cost reduction measures would further help the company in negating some of the cost increase, he added. When asked about the quantum of cost saving last fiscal, Wagh did not share details. 
However, Tata Motors in an analyst meet earlier this month, confirmed that it had realised savings of  ₹ 1,900 crore in 2017-18 as part of turnaround strategy. When asked about capex for the current fiscal, Wagh said, “Our capex generally has been around  ₹ 1,500 crore a year in CV business...We will continue at the same rate and infact the rate may go up slightly over the next two years especially because of the BS VI coming into force."" 
He added that a significant amount of effort is going on in the company to meet BS VI emission norm compliance before the government deadline. “We are tracking it on a weekly basis and as of now we are on track...,"" Wagh said.
The company, which usually exports around 12-15% of its total CV production during a year, is now scouting for new markets besides strengthening its presence in regions where it is already present.
“Our plan in a way is two fold. Our first focus will be on increasing our presence in the existing markets and at the same time we are also exploring some of the new markets. So we are looking at Latin America for example,"" Wagh said.
The company has already entered some of the countries in the region, he added."

New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd-owned Jaguar Land Rover has lined up investment worth £13.5 billion (around Rs1.2 trillion) in the next three years on new models, technology development and capacity addition.
The company will launch four new models by FY24 taking the total nameplates in its portfolio to 16 from 12 at present. Besides, it has also lined up a total of 99 different ‘product actions’ during the time period.
Investment will be £4.5 billion per annum from FY19 to FY21 and subsequently targeted at 12-13% of turnover, JLR said in an investor presentation. The investments will be on new models, technology, capacity with significant amount of it on electrification and on a new platform, modular longitudinal architecture (MLA).
“Our roll out to MLA will be fully complete by 2025, at which point every product can cater for an ICE (internal combustion engine), BEV (battery electric vehicle) or PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicle) derivative,"" JLR said.
Sharing a break up of the planned long-term investment by activity, the company said 51% will be on products, 27% on capacity and other activities, 13% on electrification of vehicles and 9% on powertrain.
JLR has been investing heavily over a period of time with an aim to have a significance presence in the global luxury automotive market which is currently dominated by German firms Mercedes, BMW and Audi.
During FY11 to FY18, JLR has invested over £20 billion in new products, technology, capacity and infrastructure, it said in the investor presentation.
Targeting sustainable profitable growth with positive cash flow over the medium to long term, JLR said it is “moderating investment to 12-13% of revenue whilst ensuring competitiveness"".
On the product programme, JLR said it has 12 nameplates in FY18 which will grow to 16 by FY24. There will be “four new nameplates from FY18 to FY23, including the stunning I-PACE with the all new Defender in development"", it said. In FY19 there will be 19 ‘product actions’—which include upgrades or variants of existing models or bringing new version of older models.

New Delhi: Senior government officials have refused to use electric cars made by Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd citing poor performance and low mileage, said three people aware of the development. 
New Delhi: Senior government officials have refused to use electric cars made by Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd citing poor performance and low mileage, said three people aware of the development.
The vehicles are procured and deployed by Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL), a public sector unit under the ministry of power. Initially, due to lack of charging infrastructure, the supply of electric variants of Mahindra’s Verito and Tata Motors’ Tigor was delayed.
Tata Motors and Mahindra were to supply 350 units and 150 units, respectively, to the Union government in the first phase. Subsequently, the auto makers were to give another 9,500 units of electric vehicles to EESL, with M&M accounting for 40% of the total.
Taking into consideration the shortcomings of E-Verito, Mahindra is developing a new electric vehicle that gives more mileage, said the second of the three people mentioned above, requesting anonymity.
According to a senior official from one of the ministries involved in formulating rules and regulations for electric mobility, both models failed to run even 80-82km on a single charge within city limits. Battery capacity was not up to the mark, compared to global standards, the official added, requesting anonymity.
In reply to an emailed query, EESL said there are more than 150 electric vehicles on the roads in Delhi and Andhra Pradesh. The company did not specify the reason for the delay in procuring vehicles for government use nor deny that officials had refused to use the vehicles.
“Since it is a new technology, we wanted to gain confidence on our products before delivering it to our clients,"" an EESL spokesperson said. “We will be deploying about 200-250 electric vehicles by mid-July. The conditions of the second tender are being re-evaluated and will be released soon. EESL will continue to enable more energy and fuel savings by creating a robust market for e-mobility in India."" 
On 1 January, Mint had reported that the entire fleet of electric vehicles was supposed to be delivered by 30 November 2017. Subsequently, the deadline was pushed to 30 December 2017 due to lack of charging infrastructure. So far, only around 150 vehicles have been supplied, according to EESL.
According to a senior industry executive, these two models have limited range. Their battery packs are of 17 kilowatt (kW), while the global standard is 27-35kW. Hence, the apprehensions of officials are genuine and the refusals to use the vehicles acceptable, said the executive. “On top of that, government officials get huge sums as car fuel allowance. If they take these vehicles, they cannot claim fuel expenses,"" said the executive, requesting anonymity.
“As part of our tender with Energy Efficiency Services, we have already completed the production of 250 cars and initiated the execution of phase II orders,"" a Tata Motors spokesperson said in response to an emailed query. 
“We are committed to the government’s e-mobility mission by 2030, and continue to work in a collaborative manner to facilitate faster adoption of electric vehicles and to build a sustainable future for India,"" the spokesperson added.
The Mumbai-based company did not mention the number of cars supplied to EESL, nor did it answer questions on the quality of vehicles.
A spokesperson for Mahindra and Mahindra declined to comment. 
Recently, Bloomberg reported the second tender of 10,000 units had been postponed to 2019 due to lack of charging infrastructure. 
“The real reason behind the postponement of the third tender is the unavailability of quality products in the electric vehicles market at this point in time,"" said the third of the three people mentioned in the beginning. EESL did not reply to the question about the reasons that led to the postponement of the tender for the third phase to 2019."

The automaker, which already makes the gasoline-powered E-Pace compact sport utility vehicle locally with its Chinese partner Chery Automobile Co., will try to fully use its current capability in the Asian country to produce an electric car such as the I-Pace, Murray Dietsch, president of the joint venture, said in an interview Wednesday in the eastern Chinese city of Changshu. The details will be disclosed within a year, he said.
“Our expectation is the penetration of EV will continue to grow more than linearly,"" Dietsch said. “With the combination of the enhancement in SUV market and the expectation of higher penetration of battery-electric vehicles, you will see more battery-electric SUVs in the market in the future.""
Jaguar Land Rover, owned by Tata Motors Ltd, is seeking to tap growing demand for electric cars in China as the government promotes zero-emission automobiles to fight pollution and cut oil imports. In the race for market share, it faces formidable rivals. Billionaire Elon Musk is already preparing to set up a local Tesla Inc. factory, while Volkswagen AG’s Audi plans five new-energy models for the country by 2022. Daimler AG is spending 655 million euros ($764 million) to make Mercedes EVs with a domestic partner.
China is moving to cap carbon emissions by 2030, which means automakers will need battery-powered vehicles for the market. Sales of new-energy vehicles—a category that includes battery-powered, plug-in hybrid and fuel-cell automobiles—reached 777,000 units last year and could surpass 1 million this year, according to estimates by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. The government’s target is 7 million vehicles a year by 2025.
“For the next three to five years, obviously our focus is getting ourselves ready for the policy changes on new-energy vehicles,"" Dietsch said. “We’ve got a very detailed plan for us to be able to comply as you expect.""
As the Chinese market may be “more demanding"" than the rest of the world, Chery Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Co. will first introduce “derivatives"" of vehicles here before they get launched elsewhere, Dietsch said. The partnership is boosting spending on research and development and also plans to produce one new vehicle in China annually over the next three to five years, he said.
European makers aren’t JLR’s only competitors. While the brand clocked a 23% jump in sales last year in China to 146,399 units, it is still trying to catch up with the American Cadillac that grew faster at 45%, selling 174,437 cars. It also needs to contend with some of the aspiring Chinese brands such as Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd’s Lynk & Co.
With the E-Pace compact SUV added to its local portfolio, Dietsch expects sales of Jaguar Land Rover in China will outpace the overall growth of the premium car segment, which is set to jump 15% to 18% this year."
329,2018-06-29,Tata Motors,"Most analysts still have 'buy' rating on the Tata Motors stock, but they are worried about its subsidiary JLR business as its volumes are expected to be subdued over the next few quarters because of global headwinds

Mumbai: The Tata Motors stock, which shed 38.8% in the first six months of 2018, is the worst performer in both Nifty and Sensex. In contrast, the benchmark indices have gained nearly 3%, though the BSE Auto index also slipped 10.90% in the January-June period. In 2017, Tata Motors had dropped 8.52%.

In contrast, the benchmark indices have gained nearly 3%, though the BSE Auto index also slipped 10.90% in the January-June period. In 2017, Tata Motors had dropped 8.52%.
Most analysts still have buy rating on the Tata company stock, but they are worried about its British subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover business as its volumes are expected to be subdued over the next few quarters because of global headwinds and uncertainty over diesel engines. Tata Motors has 27 ‘buy’, 10 ‘holds’ and 2 ‘sell’ ratings, according to Bloomberg data.
The main risks for the company include imposition of high tariffs on exports to the US and a further slowdown in industry volume growth, especially for the diesel segment, according to Nomura.
“For JLR, we currently factor in volume growth of 9%/11%/9%, EBIT margins at 3.8%/4.9%/5.1% and capex of £4.5bn/£4.6bn/£4.5bn over FY19/20/21...Current valuation is at 3.7 times / 3 times FY19/20 consolidated EBITDA is at the lowest end of the trading band, which is quite attractive,"" it said in a note on 24 June. 
In its investors meet, Tata Motors had given its medium-term guidance for JLR suggesting that it plans to grow volumes much faster than the premium industry, have EBIT margins in the range of 4-7%, and have a capex of £4.5 billion over FY19-21. 
Kotak Institutional Equities believes JLR’s management is taking steps to achieve its financial targets despite significant near-term challenges. The research firm expects its China volume mix to increase over FY2018-21 and thinks that new model launches will be largely offset by decline in volumes of existing model. Kotak sees consolidated earnings per share (EPS) to grow at 26% CAGR over FY2018-21.
Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd has cut Tata Motors’ consolidated EPS estimates by 7%/15% for FY19/20 respectively to factor in for weaker volumes, currency appreciation and lower capex guidance.
Prabhudas Lilladher said that the recent slowdown in volumes and overall unfavourable market conditions over the last few years have resulted in an increased focus on cost reduction measures and cut back in investments, with the management maintaining its near term EBIT guidance of 4-7%. 
“The management aims to outperform the overall industry growth and will launch four new models over FY19-23. We maintain our buy recommendation though being cautious on the JLR numbers as the main markets are seeing challenges. We have not made any changes to our FY20 earnings forecasts as our numbers are already built in for the challenges,"" it said in a note on 26 June. 
While Edelweiss Securities Limited sees its free cash flow (FCF) to remain negative, it expects a sharp dip from £1.2bn in FY18 to £100million in FY20. “The management commentary during JLR’s investor day reaffirms our core concern on free cash flow due to the higher-than-expected capex and lower volumes. Moreover, we perceive normalising margin in China as an incremental negative. On the positive front, JLR has effectively bridged the technological gap with peers over the past eight years, enabling it to be at the fore front of electrification and adopt flexible manufacturing,"" it said in a note on 25 June."

Korean automakers have scored a trifecta, with the Genesis, Kia Motors Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. brands topping Porsche and taking the top three spots in J.D. Power’s closely watched annual study of new car quality. 
Korean automakers have scored a trifecta, with the Genesis, Kia Motors Corp. and Hyundai Motor Co. brands topping Porsche and taking the top three spots in J.D. Power’s closely watched annual study of new car quality.
Genesis, Hyundai Motor Co.’s luxury line, ranked No.1 with 68 problems reported per 100 vehicles, and Kia and Hyundai trailed closely behind. The trio have displaced long-time Japanese leaders Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. Both are below average in the 2018 Initial Quality Study, which is based on consumer surveys after 90 days of ownership.
“It starts from the top at Hyundai,"" said Dave Sargent, vice president of global vehicle research for J.D. Power. “When they first conceive a vehicle, they are voracious consumers of customer input.""
Reliability has gotten better for most auto models in the US market. The average number of problems per 100 vehicles fell by four compared with last year to 93. Many of the reported defects are design issues, especially with electronics. When consumers have a hard time getting the audio system to do what they want, it can’t be fixed with a trip to the dealer the way an oil leak can be.
“Mechanical problems are not as prevalent as they used to be,"" Sargent said. “Infotainment is the highest problem area on a vehicle. Those design issues drive customers more crazy than breakdowns.""
Keeping it simple
The Korean brands and Porsche rank highest in part because they’ve kept their electronics and infotainment systems simple and avoided the complexity that leads to software problems or confusion, Sargent said. Kia, which is 34% owned by Hyundai, had its namesake brand place second, with 72 problems per 100 vehicles. Hyundai moved up from sixth place last year to third with a score of 74, five fewer problems than Porsche.
On the other side of the study’s spectrum is Volvo. The Swedish brand owned by China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. finished 29th out of 31 brands in the study, with complex infotainment system being the primary culprit for issues consumers experienced, Sargent said. Tata Motors Ltd’s Jaguar and Land Rover (JLR) had similar issues and ranked in the bottom two spots.
Germany’s BMW AG and Daimler AG’s main brands each have a lot of complex electronics, but more experience limiting issues with them. BMW and Mercedes-Benz finished slightly better than the industry average, with scores of 87 and 92, respectively.
Detroit tops Japan
Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co.’s namesake lines have fallen back because of complaints about electronics. Once stalwarts that were routinely toward the top of rankings, their cars still aren’t known for breakdowns. But both have had issues with new technologies, Sargent said. Toyota finished 17th and Honda finished 23rd.
The two Japanese brands have remained relatively stable in terms of the number of problems that their customers report, but other companies have moved ahead, including American car nameplates. The Ford brand finished fifth with a score of 81 problems per 100 cars, and Chevrolet was sixth with 82. Ram tied for eighth with 84.
The trouble for Detroit, Sargent said, is that Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV don’t get credit for their progress.
“If you ask the average person on the street, they will probably tell you that the Japanese have better quality,"" Sargent said."
325,2018-07-02,Tata Motors,"Collective car sales of India's top five automobile firmsMaruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Mahindra, Tata Motors and Toyotajumped 43.7% in June from 150,772 units a year ago

Mumbai: Automobile sales that grew in May picked up further speed in June, aided by new model launches and the low base of the previous year. India’s top five carmakers, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd collectively sold 216,660 units during the month, up 43.7% from 150,772 units a year ago. 
Mumbai: Automobile sales that grew in May picked up further speed in June, aided by new model launches and the low base of the previous year. India’s top five carmakers, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd collectively sold 216,660 units during the month, up 43.7% from 150,772 units a year ago.
Automakers in India consider dispatches to dealerships as sales. The low base of the previous year was due to the goods and service tax (GST) regime, which was implemented on 1 July last year, as firms slowed dispatches starting May.
New model launches by four of the five carmakers reporting sales, also led to a jump in numbers because they filled inventory channels. Passenger car market leader Maruti Suzuki’s domestic sales (excluding vans and commercial vehicles) jumped 45.32% to 121,851 units in June over a year ago, as the compact car segment led growth with a 76.7% jump to 71,570 units.
The local arm of Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor Corp. continues to face robust demand for the next-generation Swift, premium hatchback Baleno and compact sedan Dzire in this segment.
The utility vehicles segment, including the best-selling Vitara Brezza and S-Cross models, also contributed with a 39.2% rise in sales to 19,321 units over June last year. An automatic transmission variant of the Brezza was launched in May.
Old workhorses Alto and WagonR also contributed with a 15.1% rise in sales, a change from the declines in April and May. Sales of mid-sized sedan Ciaz continued to slow, declining 60% during the month.
Hyundai Motor India clocked 45,371 units in sales during June, a 20.8% growth over the year-ago period, on the back of a new variant of the compact SUV Creta launched in May, and continued demand for other models such as the Grand i10 and Elite i20 hatchbacks and Verna sedan, according to Rakesh Srivastava, director of sales and marketing at the firm.
Tata Motors reported a 62.9% rise in sales to 18,213 units in June, on the back of continued demand for its four new vehicles—the Tiago hatchback, Tigor sedan, compact SUV Nexon and full-bodied SUV Hexa, said Mayank Pareek, president of the passenger vehicles division at the firm.
Tata Motors saw the combined production of Tiago and Tigor cross 200,000 units in June at its Sanand facility, added Pareek.
The maker of the rugged Bolero SUV, Mahindra and Mahindra, posted an 11.9% rise in sales to 18,137 units during the month. Rajan Wadhera, president of the automotive sector at the firm “hopes that macro (economic) conditions such as fuel prices, interest rates and raw material prices remain at satisfactory levels"" in the coming months in order to propel growth.
However, analysts say retail sales, especially in non-urban geographies, have slowed down in June, breaking a trend prevalent since the quarter ended December."
326,2018-07-02,Tata Motors,"While a meaningful upside to Tata Motors's stock is unlikely in the near term, investors would be watchful of how well it steers JLR through the market risks

Last week, Tata Motors Ltd’s UK subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover Plc (JLR) in its first “Investors Day"" spelt out its ongoing strategy to shift towards the new electric mobility platform, reduce the diesel vehicle component in overall sales and drive margins through efficiency. The efforts, however, failed to fire the parent firm’s stock. On the contrary, the Trump-led rumpus about trade wars precipitated the weakness in investor sentiment for Tata Motors Ltd.  
Last week, Tata Motors Ltd’s UK subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover Plc (JLR) in its first “Investors Day"" spelt out its ongoing strategy to shift towards the new electric mobility platform, reduce the diesel vehicle component in overall sales and drive margins through efficiency. The efforts, however, failed to fire the parent firm’s stock. On the contrary, the Trump-led rumpus about trade wars precipitated the weakness in investor sentiment for Tata Motors Ltd. 
Its shares tumbled by 12.6% last week, far harder than the benchmark BSE Auto index and BSE Sensex that retraced by 3.4% and 0.8% respectively. Moreover, the 38% fall in a year makes it the worst performer among listed auto original equipment (OE) makers.
The recent fall reflects equity investors’ speculation that global trade tensions and the resultant tariffs on automobile imports into US will hurt JLR sales. This will be critical as the region accounts for a fifth of its total sales. Moreover, it has been the only region clocking growth within developed markets in FY2018, while the UK and Europe are contracting.
These trade tensions only added to the existing market risks put forth in its Q4FY2018 presentation. There were signals that barring the Asian region’s prospects, market cyclicality could slowdown sales in US. Another risk to sales growth is the shift away from diesel vehicles in Europe and UK along with the Brexit trade barriers. Note that a little over a third of JLR’s sales comprise diesel vehicles. Also, globally, the luxury car market is in a state of flux. 
Hopes, therefore, hinge on China to bump sales up in the near term. Indeed, this is the only region where JLR has posted 20% year-on-year growth, for several quarters.
This is not all. There are some inherent balance sheet risks that may weigh on earnings in the next two years. JLR needs capital expenditure towards new technology and product development given the wave of changes in emission norms and fuel use. Its committed capex will comprise 15-16% of its revenue in FY2019. Unfortunately, it comes at a time when margins are at their worst. Note that JLR’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin plummeted by 220 basis points (bps) in the quarter gone by (Q4FY2018) to 12.2%, dragging down Tata Motors’ overall margins too. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.
Weak margins and high capex together is not something that JLR can cruise through comfortably. This will translate into negative free cash flows until FY2020 (see chart). Any adverse currency movements will further elevate risks to earnings.
The only silver lining to the cloud is that Tata Motors’ standalone performance that was a drag on consolidated earnings for several years is shining bright on the back of soaring commercial vehicle sales. Yet, its profits earned hardly make a difference in the consolidated books.
Little wonder then that most brokerages, although convinced about JLR’s product line up, have trimmed earnings estimates for the near term. This column had forecast a cut in earnings estimate following job cuts and falling sales in Q42018. Echoing a similar sentiment, a recent report by Motilal Oswal Financial Securities Ltd, while keeping a target price way beyond the current market price of  ₹ 268, has cut earnings estimate by 7% and 15% for FY2019 and FY2020 respectively. 
So, while a meaningful upside to the stock is unlikely in the near term, investors would be watchful of how well Tata Motors steers JLR through the market risks arising out of global trade wars and Brexit and the outcome of its committed capex."
324,2018-07-05,Tata Motors,"In a regulatory filing, Tata Motors said there was no export of Nano in June this year, compared to 25 units in June 2017

New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd’s small car Nano is inching closer towards the end of its journey with just one unit produced in June, although the company maintained that no decision has been taken yet on stopping its production. The entry level car, brainchild of Ratan Tata who envisaged giving a safer and affordable alternative to families riding on two-wheelers, sold just three units last month in the domestic market. 
New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd’s small car Nano is inching closer towards the end of its journey with just one unit produced in June, although the company maintained that no decision has been taken yet on stopping its production. The entry level car, brainchild of Ratan Tata who envisaged giving a safer and affordable alternative to families riding on two-wheelers, sold just three units last month in the domestic market.
In a regulatory filing, Tata Motors said there was no export of Nano in June this year. It had shipped 25 units in the same month last year. In terms of production, only one unit was produced last month as against 275 units in June 2017. Domestic sales were at three units in June as against 167 units in the year-ago month.
When contacted for comments on whether the company has taken a decision to stop Nano production, a Tata Motors spokesperson said, “We are well aware that the Nano in its present form cannot continue beyond 2019 and may need fresh investments to survive. No decision has been made yet in this regard.""
The spokesperson further said, “Meanwhile, we continue to produce Nano catering to customer demand in key markets.""
Nano, which was unveiled in January 2008 at the Auto Expo with much expectations of being the people’s car, could not live up to the billing. The car was launched in the market in March 2009 with an initial price of close to Rs1 lakh for the basic model despite cost escalations, with Ratan Tata insisting that “a promise is a promise"".
However, from the beginning, Nano courted trouble. It was originally planned to be rolled out from Tata Motors’ proposed plant at Singur in West Bengal, where it faced intense political and farmer protests against land acquisition. The company had to shift its production to a new plant at Sanand in Gujarat.
Instances of the car catching fire initially after it was launched didn’t help its cause either. Ratan Tata had admitted that the company made the mistake of promoting the Nano as ‘the cheapest car’. It become a loss-making model for Tata Motors with ex-Tata Sons chairman Mistry, who was abruptly removed from the post, even went on to claim that the Nano “consistently lost value, peaking at Rs1,000 crore"".
Mistry also termed the Nano as one of the “legacy hotspots"" and there was “no line of sight to profitability for the Nano, any turnaround strategy"". He had also claimed that Tata Motors did not stop producing the car due to “emotional reasons""."

New Delhi: A bad Brexit deal would put Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR’s) plan to invest £80 billion (₹7.3 trillion) more in the UK in the next five years in jeopardy, the company’s chief executive officer Ralf Speth said.
If the UK leaves the European Union (EU) without maintaining a smooth trading relationship with the 28-member bloc, it would cost JLR, Britain’s biggest car manufacturer, £1.2 billion worth of net profit each year. In such a situation, the company, which has spent around £50 billion in the UK in the past five years, would have to drastically adjust its spending profile, Speth said on Thursday.
Britain’s decision to exit from the bloc is in “no one’s interest"" and will only increase bureaucracy and reduce competitiveness in the industry, said the management of JLR and its parent company, Tata Motors Ltd.
The company has already been reeling under the adverse impact of the unfavourable movement of the pound against the dollar in the aftermath of Britain’s decision to leave the EU. As such, it has stated that it will need access to the single market beyond Brexit and greater certainty to remain competitive and continue to invest in the UK.
“Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Motors have always maintained that the uncertainties from Brexit are avoidable and the business seeks clarity to ensure that industry takes timely and right decisions to manage the transition. Additionally, Jaguar Land Rover needs free and full access to the single market beyond transition to remain competitive, which we also firmly believe is in the best long-term interests of the UK,"" said P. Balaji, chief financial officer, Tata Motors Ltd. 
“The recent statement from JLR only reaffirms this position that a Brexit which increases bureaucracy, reduces productivity and competitiveness of the UK industry is in no one’s interest. As this worst case Brexit scenario is just one of the many possibilities, our plans which were shared at the JLR analyst meet in the UK did not factor them and we continue to stand by what was shared,"" said Balaji.
JLR is trying to reduce its dependence on the UK by shifting some of its manufacturing to production capacities outside the UK."

Mumbai: In a development that signals the movement of the traditional transport and logistics business to more technology-based solutions, India’s largest commercial vehicle maker, Tata Motors Ltd, on Tuesday bought a 26% stake in TruckEasy, a tech-based freight aggregator owned by Loginomics Technologies Solutions Pvt. Ltd, a Bengaluru-based logistics start-up. 
Mumbai: In a development that signals the movement of the traditional transport and logistics business to more technology-based solutions, India’s largest commercial vehicle maker, Tata Motors Ltd, on Tuesday bought a 26% stake in TruckEasy, a tech-based freight aggregator owned by Loginomics Technologies Solutions Pvt. Ltd, a Bengaluru-based logistics start-up.
The investment, for an undisclosed amount, is being made through Tata Motors Finance Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Motors, the home-grown auto conglomerate said.
TruckEasy, which provides intra-city logistics solutions only in Bengaluru at present, was incorporated in May 2015 by Nikhil Thomas, Vikram Kodgi and Avinash Achar. Thomas and Kodgi have previously worked at Tata Motors in the logistics domain, apart from other areas within the company and other multinational firms.
Through over TruckEasy’s 8,000 customers serviced by more than 3,000 driver partners, Tata Motors aims to gain a foothold in mobility services to be “future ready"", said a company spokesperson in response to e-mailed Mint queries.
The “strategic"" investment would provide Tata Motors with an insight into the “rapidly-growing, technology-driven transformation"" in the freight logistics domain and obtain “an understanding of the market dynamics in intra-city freight movement"", the company said.
Tata Motors aims to utilize data analytics (on small commercial vehicle (SCV) usage) provided by TruckEasy to better customize products and solutions according to market requirements, as the maker of the Ace mini-truck will “be closer to the final customer"".
TruckEasy will gain access to Tata Motors’ “wide network to grow the supply side"" and “expand to multiple locations countrywide"", said Girish Wagh, president of the commercial vehicles unit.
Tata Motors, with its Ace and Super Ace models, is one of the top two players along with Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd in the SCV segment, which is defined as having a gross vehicle weight of less than 3.5 tonnes.
After personal transportation was disrupted by tech start-ups such as Ola (ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd) and Uber Technolgies Inc., the commercial vehicle landscape has been redefined by young transportation companies such as Rivigo Services Pvt. Ltd, who rely heavily on technology and new business models such as Rivigo’s driver relay model.
Even traditional companies such as DHL International GmbH, the world’s largest logistics provider, are reinventing themselves in India, with DHL launching SmarTrucking, a technology-enabled logistics solution, in early June.
Analysts welcome the development, citing “the coming of age"" of the trucking and fleet industry in India.
“It makes tremendous sense for OEMs like Tata (to invest in freight start-ups) as establishing direct communication with large and small fleet operators will improve profitability,"" said Anil Sharma, associate director at MarketsandMarkets, a market research firm.
More such applications will be seen in the trucking and fleet operation industry as the “mobility as a service"" concept will gain traction in the market, with OEMs seeing more transactions in this domain, he said."

A moment of silence, please, for the world’s cheapest car, which has all but died in India. It was almost 10 years old. The Tata Nano’s death was confirmed by production numbers: Tata Motors Ltd produced 1 unit in June, down from 275 in the same month last year. Exports were zero, versus 25 in June 2017. The company acknowledged that the car in its “present form cannot continue beyond 2019"".

The company acknowledged that the car in its “present form cannot continue beyond 2019"".
The expiry of the “people’s car,"" as Tata Motors branded it in 2008, holds lessons for automakers hoping to make it in India: While consumers may be value-conscious, cutting costs to the bone in pursuit of a gimmicky claim to fame is no use if the end result is a second-rate vehicle with a tendency to catch fire.
The Tata Nano’s failure to sell stands in stark contrast to the rest of the Indian car market. From motorbikes to cars and trucks, growth in every segment is picking up. Passenger vehicles, including SUVs, jumped 38% in June. Commercial vehicles climbed 42%, while two-wheelers—which dominate the market—gained 22%.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the nation’s biggest carmaker, posted volume growth of more than 40%. Even a newly defined segment, the quadricycle—a vehicle that weighs less than 475kg—is showing signs of an uptick.
This is a market where electric vehicles are non-existent and the chatter over fancy ideas such as future mobility and autonomous vehicles, which pervades the rest of the auto world, is muted.
Still, Indian automakers have tried to get innovative. A widely held view is that they have largely misread the value-oriented psyche of a proud and aspirational middle-class, which scorns handout-like product propositions.
The much-touted Tata Nano—hailed as a “milestone in frugal engineering""—fell short on safety, ran behind schedule and produced questionable crash test results. Eicher Motors Ltd’s Multix pickup truck that doubled up as an electricity generator was also unsuccessful. Both companies have written off millions of dollars in investment costs.
Tata remains hopeful: a spokesman for the group said the Tata Nano “may need fresh investments to survive."" Yet the evidence suggests that pursuit of the lowest price above all else was misconceived. A more realistic view is that India is squarely a high-volume, few-models game and consumers are focused on value—which means getting as many features as possible for their money.
Large numbers haven’t led to price wars yet, and probably won’t for a while. Indeed, India’s car market has the brightest profitability outlook globally, according to Nomura Holdings Inc. analysts.
Take Hyundai Motor Co., for instance, which has the second-biggest market share after Maruti Suzuki. With some input costs rising, the South Korean carmaker has raised prices of several models and, after decades in India, has started repositioning itself as a high-end brand.
Maruti Suzuki is following a similar trajectory. The company has begun churning out higher-margin vehicles, with its Baleno, DZire and Vitara Brezza models now accounting for a larger part of the sales mix than the more basic Alto and Wagon-R. 
The market leader continues to win out, with a share of close to 50% across India’s various regions. Maruti Suzuki has been adding capacity and announced last week that it would produce another 750,000 cars over the next two years at its Gujarat plant.
Scale has protected Maruti Suzuki so far. The last time the likes of Volkswagen AG and other foreign carmakers entered the heavily protected Indian market, between 2011 and 2014, its share fell to 40 to 45%. This could repeat on the margins if Maruti Suzuki doesn’t keep up with the supply pressure. Demand is strong but waiting times are also rising for its cars. In such a market, volume is a good defence as long as it’s sustained.
Past follies will probably be repeated. The idea of recasting the Nano as an electric vehicle for fleet sales has been floated. That’s misguided. Ultimately, the barrier to electric cars is high costs, making the technology unsuitable for an ultra-low-price brand.
Meanwhile, the Indian government isn’t helping by wavering on its grand electrification plans. The high initial price gap means that “we do see a need for incentives to kick-start EV adoption,"" analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. note. This is probably why Maruti hasn’t waded into this market in a big way – it can’t do big numbers that make sense.
India may not be ready for the pizazz of futuristic vehicles. But it’s past the point of no-frills metal shells. In between, there’s a sweet spot where carmakers with the right strategy can do well."

Unveiled at the 2018 Auto Expo as the H5X Concept, the Harrier will be launched in the first quarter of 2019.
The Harrier sports sleek looks and dynamism, and offers “a glimpse of the future generation of Tata Motors vehicles in terms of styling, technology and performance capabilities"", Tata Motors said in a statement. “Its architecture is derived from the legendary Land Rover D8 and is adapted to suit the Indian conditions by Tata Motors engineers,"" the carmaker added.
“With Turnaround 2.0 into play, we are geared to win sustainably in the market. We are proudly speeding towards our next market introduction ‘Tata Harrier’ that will take our brand value to the next level. “We are preparing for commercial launch in the first quarter of 2019,"" said Mayank Pareek, president for passenger vehicle business unit at Tata Motors.
Driven by the success of its first compact SUV Tata Nexon, and also new cars Tigor and Tiago, Tata Motors has made a strong comeback in the Indian car market. In June, it overtook Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd as India third-largest automaker—less than a year after it pipped Honda Cars India for the No.4 slot."

Mumbai: Amidst stronger headwinds in the global economy, Tata Sons chairman N. Chandrasekaran has called for Tata Motors Ltd and its British subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) Automotive Plc to be “more agile than ever"" and work towards being “future ready"".
“Some of the key operating markets for the group are faced with diverse market dynamics requiring specific interventions to ensure sustainable profitable growth,"" he said in a letter to shareholders in Tata Motors’ FY18 annual report.
Describing the state of disruption faced by the automobile industry the world over, the report said: “We are entering the largest, fastest industrial revolution ever, driven by decarbonization, air quality, digitization, connectivity, automation and technology"".
In the letter, Chandrasekaran cited factors such as market cyclicality and muted near-term demand in the US, in addition to uncertainties in the UK and Europe over Brexit and taxation on diesel cars, as forming the “diverse market dynamics"" for JLR.
To address these headwinds, the UK’s largest automaker will “focus on optimization, drive operating leverage and manage capital spends prudently"", Chandrasekaran said.
JLR is set to spend at least £4.5 billion (around  ₹ 40,520 crore), or about 15% of its FY19 revenue, in capital expenditure (capex) over three years, starting this fiscal. If this is to happen, it would be the highest cumulative capex figure for the maker of the Range Rover and F-PACE SUVs. The announcement came at a time when margins are at their worst, failing to fire up the Tata Motors stock, Mint reported on 2 July. 
Chandrasekaran believes the “key"" Asian markets of China and India “offer high growth opportunities led by GDP (gross domestic product) growth, strong domestic consumption and favourable demographic support"" for JLR.
On the home front, the “Indian auto industry is not without its challenges"", he noted, listing the impending “structural"" shift towards electric vehicles (EVs), the rise of shared mobility and an overhaul of emission and safety norms, among other factors.
“As such, we will have to be more agile than ever and work towards being future-ready"", Chandrasekaran added.
However, the Indian automobile is “well-positioned for growth, given low rates of auto penetration, rising incomes and increasing affordability"", Chandrasekaran said.
Though the domestic entity continued to post net losses at  ₹ 1,034.85 crore in FY18, sales growth outpaced the broader market, resulting in market share gains in the commercial as well as passenger vehicles.
Net losses, however, narrowed from  ₹ 2,429.6 crore a year ago. Tata’s stand-alone business has been posting yearly losses since FY15. The company will continue to focus on product development, network expansion and cost reduction, Chandrasekaran said.
Analysts remain upbeat on the stock, but the optimism has been wearing marginally since May, data from Bloomberg shows.
Out of 39 analysts, 27 have a “Buy"" rating on the scrip, while 10 recommend holding it. Two analysts have a “Sell"" rating on the scrip. The number of analysts with a “Buy"" rating in May and June was 29 and 28 respectively."

Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd., the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, has restarted talks on the sale of a stake in its engineering unit just months after a deal with Warburg Pincus was called off, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The carmaker has started preliminary discussions with a private equity firm that expressed interest in buying a stake in Singapore-headquartered Tata Technologies Ltd., according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Tata Motors plans to use proceeds from the sale on capital expenditures for its domestic automotive business, one of the people said.
Warburg Pincus agreed last year to buy a 43% stake in Tata Technologies for about $360 million. It was planning to buy about 30% of the business from Tata Motors, as well as the entire 13% holding owned by Tata Capital Ltd., according to a statement at the time. In February, Tata Motors and Warburg Pincus agreed to call off the transaction.
The deal was scrapped due to delays securing regulatory approvals and a decline in Tata Technologies’s business performance, the Indian company said in a statement at the time. Any sale would help Tata Motors reduce its debt which has risen to  ₹ 88,970 crore ($12.9 billion) at the end of March, from  ₹ 78,630 crore a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Tata Motors is planning further divestments after selling a stake in Tata Technologies, one of the people said. It has classified its investment in Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. as held for sale, according to its latest annual report. The carmaker also has holdings in fellow group companies Tata Steel Ltd. and Tata Chemicals Ltd.
A representative for Tata Motors said the company has nothing new to share. A spokeswoman for Tata Technologies didn’t immediately respond to emailed queries.
Tata Technologies provides outsourced design, research and development services to the automotive, aerospace and industrial machinery industries. Tata Motors owns 72.3% of the company, the carmaker’s annual report shows."

New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd, India’s largest automaker by sales revenue, will report its June quarter (Q1 FY19) results on Tuesday. The sustained turnaround in the domestic business, helped by a low base, is unlikely to offset a muted performance by the UK subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) Automotive Plc, as the Tata Group flagship is expected to report a net profit of  ₹ 909.1 crore on net sales of  ₹ 70,900.8 crore, according to a Bloomberg poll of 10 analysts. 
New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd, India’s largest automaker by sales revenue, will report its June quarter (Q1 FY19) results on Tuesday. The sustained turnaround in the domestic business, helped by a low base, is unlikely to offset a muted performance by the UK subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) Automotive Plc, as the Tata Group flagship is expected to report a net profit of  ₹ 909.1 crore on net sales of  ₹ 70,900.8 crore, according to a Bloomberg poll of 10 analysts.
During the corresponding quarter a year ago, Tata Motors reported a net profit of  ₹ 3,200 crore on net sales of  ₹ 58,651 crore. If not for a one-time gain owing to a change in pension plans at JLR, Tata Motors would have swung to a loss of  ₹ 409 crore.
During the three months to June, JLR sales volume showed strong signs of recovery with a 5.85% growth, while the domestic market was buoyed by higher passenger and commercial vehicle sales.
Analysts estimate consolidated margins to expand by about 60 to 150 basis points during the quarter, driven by lower raw material and manufacturing costs at JLR, gains from expressing pound revenues in rupee terms (as the pound appreciated about 11% against the rupee during the quarter), and a richer product mix for commercial vehicles in the domestic market. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Here are a few factors to track in the Q1 results:
JLR volumes
JLR’s retail sales during the quarter rose 5.85% over the year-ago to 145,510 units, with only five models out of 13 posting growth, according to company data. Jaguar and Land Rover sales were both buoyed by the introduction of new models such as the E-Pace compact SUV and Range Rover Velar SUV.
Among international markets, North America, China, the UK and other markets performed better over the year ago, with other markets contributing the most with a 20.3% rise in sales to 22, 776 units. Sales in China, JLR’s largest market, slowed during the quarter owing to an impending reduction in import tariffs effective 1 July.
JLR margins
Analysts expect lower raw material costs to expand the UK subsidiary’s margins, on a low base since higher marketing expenditure in the US and an overall slowdown in demand during the corresponding quarter last year impacted margins and profitability. A slowdown in the Chinese market is also expected to impact profitability.
JLR’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin is expected to expand 2.5 percentage points to 10.4%, said Jinesh Gandhi of Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd in a 10 July note, adding that an adverse product mix would crimp net realisations by 2.5%.
The Ebitda margin is a key measure of operating profitability.
Domestic operations
Off a low base, total domestic sales during the March quarter rose by a stellar 64.32% to 164,579 units, as per data provided by industry body Siam (Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers). These numbers were driven primarily by commercial vehicles, with the division clocking 74.72% growth to 105,610 units, on the back of heavy pre-buying in the March quarter last year, in addition to infrastructure-building and broad-based economic growth creating robust demand in sectors such as road construction, mining, retail and e-commerce. The passenger vehicle division grew by 48.49% to 58,969 units.
Led by higher operating leverage, Tata Motors’ standalone Ebitda margin is expected at 8.1%, said Abhishek Jain of HDFC Securities in a 9 July note.
At 10.51am, Tata Motors shares traded 1.20% down at  ₹ 264.10 per share on BSE. During the June quarter, the Tata Motors stock declined 17.76%, while the benchmark Sensex gained 7.45%."
314,2018-07-31,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors made a net loss of  1,902 crore ($277 million), compared with a profit of  3,182 crore in the same quarter a year ago

Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd, India’s largest automaker by sales, turned to a surprise consolidated quarterly loss, weighed down by a tepid performance at its British unit Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) Automotive Plc. 
Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd, India’s largest automaker by sales, turned to a surprise consolidated quarterly loss, weighed down by a tepid performance at its British unit Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) Automotive Plc.
The Mumbai-based auto maker posted a loss of  ₹ 1,862.57 crore in the three months through June, compared with a year-earlier profit of  ₹ 3,199.93 crore, it said in a regulatory filing. It was the firm’s first quarterly loss in three years, and the worst since a  ₹ 2,598.83 crore loss in the December quarter of 2008.
A Bloomberg poll of 10 analysts forecast Tata Motors to post a net profit of  ₹ 909.1 crore. 
Slowing sales in China—JLR’s biggest and one of its most profitable markets—hit earnings in the just-ended quarter. 
Consumers in the world’s largest automobile market deferred purchases during the April to June period ahead of the reduction in import taxes from 1 July, Tata Motors said.
Sales in China grew a marginal 2.5% last quarter to 34,358 units. As a result, JLR turned in a quarterly loss of £210 million (about  ₹ 1,900 crore) on a 6.7% drop in sales to £5.2 billion (about  ₹ 47,000 crore). 
Global retail sales of the maker of Jaguar F-Pace and Range Rover Evoque sport-utility vehicles rose 5.8% from a year earlier to 145,510 vehicles last quarter. The company posted an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization margin of 6.2% during the quarter, trailing analyst expectations of about 10%.
JLR however expects to sustain margins between 4% and 7% in the medium term, P. Balaji, group chief financial officer at Tata Motors, said in a conference call with reporters. He didn’t give any time frame.
Apart from the slowdown in China, profitability and margins were hit by lower operating leverage due to a 7.7% drop in dealer dispatches, higher discounts in the US, UK and China, foreign currency fluctuations, and higher depreciation and amortization costs, according to Tata Motors.
However, existing headwinds such as geopolitical factors, a model run down cycle, disfavour for its diesel-heavy portfolio and cyclicality in the US continue to persist as only five out of 13 JLR models posted growth during the June quarter. 
To address these challenges in the near future, JLR plans to grow volumes with new models, attain cost efficiencies and operating leverage, and manage capital expenditure “prudently"", Balaji said.
“Operating leverage needs to come back at JLR, so we will do whatever it takes to secure it. As the demand scenario clears up, capital will be aligned accordingly,"" he added.
Analysts said the results were disappointing on a majority of parameters, and expect JLR’s performance to remain subdued in the near to medium term.
Even the import duty reduction in China may not help matters much, said Mitul Shah, vice president (research), Reliance Securities, referring to lower price tags on JLR vehicles after the tax cut.
“Apart from a number of overhangs in other markets for JLR, profitability in China will have to be gauged after the tax structure changes depending on the final price, though volumes will definitely be high in July,"" he said, adding that rising raw materials and incentives are a concern in an increasingly competitive market environment.
Meanwhile, Tata Motors recorded a robust performance in its home market of India.
The local operations swung to a net profit of  ₹ 1,187.65 crore in the quarter from a year-earlier loss of  ₹ 463.14 crore thanks to higher commercial and passenger vehicle sales. Sales climbed 63% to  ₹ 16,592.33 crore, albeit off a lower base.
The Ebitda margin widened 8.9 percentage points to 8.3% as higher sales of bigger trucks and buses improved net realisations.
Tata Motors’ chief executive and managing director Guenter Butschek said he is satisfied with the company’s ongoing turnaround strategy for the domestic business and said he is “remains “positive on the long-term potential of the Indian market"". Butschek however cited short-term challenges on the commercial vehicle front with implementation of new norms on axle loads.
Total domestic sales rose 64% on-year to 164,579 vehicles in the June quarter. Commercial vehicles led the way, with sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles doubling on launch of new product launches, higher industrial activity, robust consumption demand and government spending on infrastructure, the company said.
Shah at Reliance Securities said the India’s economic expansion will help Tata Motors sustain growth in its domestic business helped by a strong product pipeline and the turnaround strategy. 
Ahead of the results, shares of Tata Motors fell 1.18% to  ₹ 264.15 on BSE, underperforming a 0.3% rise in the Sensex, which touched a record high of 37,606.58 points."

Investors of Tata Motors Ltd were jittery on Tuesday, sending the company’s shares 1.2% lower. It was almost a warning of what was to come in the June quarter results. And indeed, the global automotive giant’s performance dashed investor hopes of a near-term recovery. The consolidated net loss of  ₹  1,863 crore is baffling especially when analysts’ much-toned-down estimate was of a net profit of around  ₹  920 crore. 
Investors of Tata Motors Ltd were jittery on Tuesday, sending the company’s shares 1.2% lower. It was almost a warning of what was to come in the June quarter results. And indeed, the global automotive giant’s performance dashed investor hopes of a near-term recovery. The consolidated net loss of  ₹  1,863 crore is baffling especially when analysts’ much-toned-down estimate was of a net profit of around  ₹  920 crore.
Without doubt, the already-beaten-down stock will get a pounding on the Street on Wednesday. 
Its iconic UK-based subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover Ltd (JLR) continued to bleed, dragging the parent down after negating the strong profitability posted by its stand-alone business. Consolidated Ebitda (earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortization) margin of 7.5% was way below Bloomberg’s average estimate of 10.5%. 
True, the story of Tata Motors’ losses is not new. The problem is that there is not even a glimmer of a recovery. The headwinds for JLR are only getting stronger. The adverse impact of Brexit-linked changes in trade policy or steadily falling demand for diesel vehicles in the UK, Europe and even the US, that is the mainstay of JLR, is well-known. Sales growth has fallen to single-digits since the third quarter of FY17. 
June quarter sales declined by 5% year-on-year as the lower import duties on vehicles in China led to customers deferring sales. Inventory mounted too. Consequently, JLR’s pain increased, adding to its existing headwinds. So, the China situation, destocking in the region and adverse forex movement led to a 7% drop in net revenue.
With lower operating leverage and mounting costs, JLR’s Ebitda margin narrowed by 170 basis points to a dismal 6.2%—the lowest since its recovery after acquisition by Tata Motors and way below the Street’s forecast of 10.5%.
True, the stand-alone entity’s operations brought some succour. Fortunately, the commercial vehicle (CV) segment is churning out strong numbers, even as the passenger vehicle business is improving in size and profitability. The 83% year-on-year jump in net revenue and 890 basis points Ebitda margin expansion certainly limited the fall in consolidated performance to some extent. 
That said, it is not a smooth road ahead in CVs as the impact of the new axle load norms on truck sales will be known in the months ahead. For now, the stand-alone entity is turning out healthy profits. 
Yet, this is not sufficient to pull Tata Motors out of the quagmire that it is sinking into. Ultimately, the consolidated performance hinges on JLR, which has more pain along the way. 
Already, the weak operating performance, and JLR’s need to keep abreast of technology and markets in the near future has begun weighing on its balance sheet. Net debt has ballooned. 
Certainly, JLR is in for a major refit. The efforts may be on. But it would cost Tata Motors and its investors much pain."

Mumbai: Passenger car sales, which had a stellar run since January 2018 on the back of new launches and a recovery in rural demand, saw a slowdown in July because of a high base in the same month last year and a planned inventory reduction by auto makers ahead of the launch of new models and refreshes during the festive season beginning later this month. 
Mumbai: Passenger car sales, which had a stellar run since January 2018 on the back of new launches and a recovery in rural demand, saw a slowdown in July because of a high base in the same month last year and a planned inventory reduction by auto makers ahead of the launch of new models and refreshes during the festive season beginning later this month.
A nationwide transporters’ strike in mid-July also impacted production and distribution of vehicles. Auto makers in India consider dispatches to dealerships as sales. 
India’s top five carmakers, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Honda Cars India Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd, collectively sold 236,947 units during the month, up 1.14% from 233,643 units a year ago.
During July last year, inventory stocking was unusually high as consumers deferred purchases in the preceding months expecting a lower tax outgo post the implementation of the goods and service tax on 1 July. 
The slowdown in sales this month is an aberration as underlying retail demand, primarily from semi-urban and rural areas, has remained stable as expected, analysts said. 
“As auto makers look to fill inventory channels with new products for the festive season in August and September, they did not push inventory aggressively in July,"" said Darshini Kansara, deputy manager, industry research at CARE Ratings Ltd.
“The rural recovery is still positive, as is the broader economy. The recent MSP (minimum support price) hike, near-normal monsoon, and revision in the central government employees’ dearness allowance are positive factors,"" Kansara said.
Passenger car market leader Maruti Suzuki reported a marginal fall in domestic car sales (excluding vans and commercial vehicles) to 136,636 units in July from 137,584 units a year ago, the first decline since December 2016. 
Sales of the premium sedan of the local subsidiary of Suzuki Motor Corp. stood at 48 units in July as compared to 6,377 units a year ago. The company plans to introduce the next-gen Ciaz on 20 August.
Other segments also reported lower-than-expected sales. The compact car segment, which makes up the bulk of Maruti Suzuki sales, grew 17.8% to 74,373 units because of the demand for the 2018 Swift hatchback and continued interest in premium hatchback Baleno and compact sedan Dzire. In the past few months, this segment had been reporting growth upwards of 20%.
The sport utility vehicles (SUV) segment, including the best-selling Vitara Brezza and S-Cross models, posted a 4.9% decline to 24,5050 units over July last year.
Sales of entry-level cars Alto and WagonR declined even further by 10.9% to 37,710 units.
Hyundai Motor India clocked 43,481 units in sales during July, an 1.1% growth over the year-ago period, on the back of refreshed models such as the Creta compact SUV, Verna sedan and Elite i20 hatchback, according to Y.K. Koo, managing director and chief executive at the local subsidiary of the South Korean carmaker.
“A positive growth trend is visible with the stabilisation of macroeconomic factors and a good monsoon, along with increase in customer confidence and sentiment towards new vehicle purchases,"" he said.
Honda Cars India clocked a 16.9% rise in sales to 19,970 units during July on the back of greater production of the Amaze compact sedan and sustained momentum for the City sedan and WR-V SUV, said Rajesh Goel, senior vice-president and director of sales and marketing at the firm.
The maker of the rugged Bolero SUV, Mahindra, posted an 5.96% decline in sales to 19,781 units during the month. Rajan Wadhera, president of the automotive sector at the firm cited “certain uncertainties with the truckers’ strike and sluggishness on the retail front"" as challenges during the month. The firm is “confident of seeing a turnaround in the overall buying sentiment"" as the festive season approaches, he said.
Analysts expect the quarters ending September and December to contribute handsomely to sales on the back of the festive season, a positive economic environment, stable inflation and interest rates, and expectations of a normal monsoon, though rising crude oil and commodity prices may play spoilsport.
Kansara of CARE Ratings expects passenger vehicle sales to clock 8-10% growth for the fiscal."

So far this year, Tata Motors shares have fallen 41%. Tata Motors DVR shares fell 3% to  ₹ 139.90 a share.
Tata Motors posted a consolidated loss of  ₹ 1,862.57 crore, its worst since  ₹ 2,599 crore loss in December 2009 quarter. Analysts expected the company to post consolidated profit of  ₹ 920 crore. Consolidated revenue rose 14.7% to  ₹ 67,081.30 crore.
JLR performance was impacted by headwinds such as a decline in wholesales, led by planned de-stocking and sales deferral in China post import duty cuts. In addition, impact of Brexit and diesel uncertainly continued to dampen the performance.
“JLR earnings were sharply below estimate due to channel de-stocking, higher incentives in China ahead of tariff cuts and number of other factors. While many seem one-offs, such disappointments have been a recurring issue for JLR in a weak environment. India business delivered a large beat helped by sharp improvement in passenger vehicles. We cut our price target to factor in weaker prospects for JLR but undemanding valuation post steep correction makes risk-reward favorable,"" said Jefferies India in a note to its investors.
The brokerage firm has maintained its “buy"" rating but cut its target price to  ₹ 355 a share from  ₹ 440 a share.
On standalone basis, the company posted a profit of  ₹ 1,188 crore, compared to a loss of  ₹ 500 crore. Revenue rose 83% to  ₹ 16,803 crore.
Management has maintained its EBIT margin guidance for both JLR and standalone business at 4-7% and 3-5% respectively over FY19-21 estimates.
“Basis the current headwinds in major market like UK, Europe and to some extent US, we estimate 5% CAGR in JLR volumes (wholesale excl. China) over FY18-20E. During the same period, domestic CVs and PVs are likely to record 15%/12% CAGR, driven by new models launches and network expansion. Higher-than-estimated stress in JLR volume / margin and adverse currency movements are key risks to our view,"" said JM Financial in a note to its investors. JM Financial has maintained its buy rating on the stock and cut ints target price to  ₹ 400 from  ₹ 490 a share
Brokerage firm Emkay Global has maintained its buy rating and cut its target price to  ₹ 420 a share from  ₹ 450 a share. BoBCaps has cut its target price to  ₹ 410 from  ₹ 450 and maintained buy rating.
Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained buy rating but reduced its target price to  ₹ 420 a share from  ₹ 445 earlier. “The cut in target price is driven by 2-6% cut in our earnings estimates largely due to significant reduction in JLR China JV estimates,"" Kotak said in a report.

Mumbai: India’s largest automaker by revenue, Tata Motors Ltd, is “hoping to turn the corner"" on its domestic business this fiscal year, chairman N. Chandrasekaran said at the company’s 73rd annual general meeting on Friday, referring to sustained performance at the domestic unit.
“The turnaround is going extremely well. I hope we will turn the corner on the domestic business this fiscal,"" he said.
Tata Motors has been overhauling the domestic supply chain, product portfolio and organizational structure, as part of a turnaround strategy put in place by managing director and CEO Guenter Butschek in mid-2016 to enhance the company’s revenues and profits.
The strategy bore fruit first in the December quarter of FY18, when Tata Motors posted a quarterly profit (of  ₹ 184 crore) after five quarters. The March quarter earnings fell back in the red because of one-time expenses related to undisclosed product development programmes, but the domestic unit ended FY18 with a positive free cash flow (of about  ₹ 1,380 crore) after five years.
The India business returned to profitability in the three months ended June, albeit off a low base.
Chandrasekaran is “very bullish"" on the company’s commercial vehicle division on the back of new product launches, and expects the passenger vehicle division to corner a larger share of the market and deliver an improved financial performance.
Analysts believe the profitability in the domestic business is sustainable and expect it to be “directionally positive"" on the back of a strong product pipeline and the turnaround strategy. India’s underlying economic expansion story will also help, said Mitul Shah, vice president (research) at Reliance Securities Ltd."

Mumbai: Protracted Brexit talks are weighing on the recovery prospects of Tata Motors Ltd’s Jaguar Land Rover Plc (JLR), the carmaker that is already under pressure to keep up as the global automobile industry moves toward electrification and automation, according to its Indian owner.
The focus of Tata Motors, which bought the maker of the iconic British marquees in 2008, is to ensure Jaguar Land Rover remains financially strong in the face of the challenges, Tata Sons chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran said in an interview over the weekend. Tata Sons is the parent of Tata Motors.
“For them, because they are in the UK, they don’t know what the outcome of Brexit is and results of trade agreements are going to be,"" Chandrasekaran told Bloomberg Television’s Amanda Lang in Canada. “So there are three or four things, all happening at the same time, so they are having to deal with all of this.""
After reporting a loss of £210 million ($271 million) in the quarter through June, JLR warned the UK government that failing to secure a good deal over the terms of UK’s departure from the European Union would wipe out billions from its coffers and hobble its operations. David Lidington, the de facto British deputy prime minister, said last week that an agreement is 85% complete, with the Northern Ireland border the main outstanding issue.
A “bad Brexit"" would jeopardize as much as £80 billion in spending by Jaguar Land Rover over the next five years, chief executive officer Ralf Speth has cautioned, adding extra costs and delays in parts deliveries coming from outside the UK would cut profit by £1.2 billion a year.
JLR has also seen demand for its vehicles in Europe wane amid uncertainty over diesel vehicles and additional taxes on the fuel in the UK.
“We want to make it financially stronger,"" Chandrasekaran said, without elaborating. “We believe in that company."""
302,2018-09-14,Tata Motors,"Demand in China, JLR's largest market, has dampened in the past month over fears of a trade war with the US

Mumbai: Global ratings agency Fitch Ratings Ltd late on Thursday revised its outlook on British automaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) Automotive Plc from ‘stable’ to ‘negative’. 
Mumbai: Global ratings agency Fitch Ratings Ltd late on Thursday revised its outlook on British automaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) Automotive Plc from ‘stable’ to ‘negative’.
The revision, which adds to the woes of the Tata Motors Ltd-owned luxury carmaker, reflects Fitch’s projections of a further fall in JLR’s free cash flow (FCF) over the next two years, wrote Emmanuel Bulle, senior director at the American ratings agency, in a 13 September note.
The long-term credit rating remained ‘BB+’, which is a non-investment grade rating, Bulle said.
JLR’s free cash flow fell significantly during FY18 to negative £1 billion (about 4.2% of sales), with Bulle expecting this metric to fall further to about -6% by the end of the current fiscal.
Bulle expects JLR’s free cash flow to enter positive territory from the end of FY21, but pointed to heavy investments, falling profitability, “material"" Brexit risks and limited scale and product diversity as factors influencing JLR’s credit ratings and outlook.
JLR has, since the past fiscal, been facing a range of issues from market cyclicality and muted near-term demand in the US, to uncertainties in the UK and Europe over Brexit and taxation on diesel cars, which make up about 90% of JLR’s Europe sales.
Further, demand in China, JLR’s largest market, has dampened in the past month over fears of a trade war with the US.
Fitch Ratings is the only large global ratings agency to have a negative outlook on the UK’s largest automaker, with Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s having a ‘stable’ outlook, according to Bloomberg data.
Fitch has assigned JLR a negative outlook for the first time, since it began rating the maker of the Range Rover and E-Pace models in May 2011.
However, its long-term credit rating has moved a rung up to BB+ from BB- during the period.
“Higher production and labour costs burdened JLR’s profitability but margins were particularly impacted by rising depreciation costs from recent investments,"" Bulle said.
Depreciation would continue to weigh on profitability but would be partly offset in the medium term, led by improvements in productivity and savings in the manufacturing process, he said.
JLR reported its worst Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) margins at 12.2% in the quarter ended March, only to fall further to 6.2% during the three months ended June.
Further, JLR is set to spend at least £4.5 billion (around  ₹ 40,520 crore), or about 15% of its FY19 revenue, in capital expenditure (capex) over three years, starting this fiscal. This would be the highest cumulative capex figure for the maker of the Range Rover and F-PACE SUVs. JLR has targeted a capex level of 12-13% of annual turnover in the years ahead.
Fitch expects these investments to improve JLR’s manufacturing footprint outside the UK, widen a “limited"" product portfolio, and enhance the automaker’s ability to respond to ever-changing sector dynamics.
However, with about 20% of sales coming from Europe and the US, JLR is exposed to the twin risks of an unfavourable Brexit and increased global tariffs. JLR chief executive Ralf Speth said earlier this week that a “bad"" Brexit could put “tens of thousands"" of jobs at risk and cost the company “more than £1.2 billion a year"" since JLR’s supply chain would be disrupted and free access to Europe’s single market curtailed.
JLR has four plants in the UK that produce 3,000 cars a day, use 25 million components and are dependent on a ‘just in time’ model of manufacturing. Any delays would cost the company £60 million a day, according to Speth.
While Fitch believes new assembly plants in Slovakia and Brazil, and a manufacturing agreement with Austrian auto maker Magna Steyr would “somewhat"" ease JLR’s production issues in the medium term, the automaker remains “heavily"" at risk in the short-term.
Fitch has estimated that JLR’s FY19 revenue would fall by about 5%, primarily led by deterioration in the product mix, before recovering to a mid to high-single digit growth through to FY22."

300,2018-09-20,Tata Motors,"Fitch Ratings revises the outlook on Tata Motors to 'negative' from 'stable' on expectations that higher capital spending at Jaguar Land Rover will result in negative free cash flow in the current and the next financial year

New Delhi: Fitch Ratings on Thursday said that it has revised the outlook on Tata Motors to ‘negative’ from ‘stable’ on expectations that higher capital spending at Jaguar Land Rover will result in negative free cash flow in the current and the next financial year. 
New Delhi: Fitch Ratings on Thursday said that it has revised the outlook on Tata Motors to ‘negative’ from ‘stable’ on expectations that higher capital spending at Jaguar Land Rover will result in negative free cash flow in the current and the next financial year.
In a statement, Fitch said it believes that a disorderly Brexit (UK exiting from European Union) could significantly disrupt JLR’s supply chain and affect the company’s earnings and cash generation. It affirmed the long-term issuer default rating of Tata Motors’ at ‘BB+’.
“The revision of the outlook reflects Fitch’s expectations of rising negative free cash flow (FCF) over the fiscal years ending March 2019 (FY19) and FY20, following upward capex revisions at Tata Motor’s fully owned subsidiary, Jaguar Land Rover Automotive plc,"" Fitch said in the statement Thursday.
Free cash flows are likely to improve post FY20, but “the ratings may be downgraded if we believe Tata Motor’s FCF is not likely to improve in line with our expectations,"" it said. The outlook revision, it said, also takes into account evolving risks, including a disorderly Brexit, higher global tariffs and slower execution of JLR’s plan to move away from diesel-based powertrains in Europe.
The affirmation of Tata Motors’ rating reflects the robust positioning of JLR - which accounts for more than 65 per cent of the company’s EBITDA - in the premium segment and a financial profile that will remain solid even after considering substantial investment in capacity expansion and new technologies over the next few years.
“The rating, which includes a one-notch uplift from Tata Motors’ ‘BB’ standalone rating on its linkage with its parent, Tata Sons Ltd, also reflects its leading position in India’s commercial-vehicle market and the recovering passenger vehicle business, after successful new-product launches in the previous few years,"" it said.
Fitch expects a gradual improvement in the company’s profitability that has weakened in the previous few years due to weaker profitability at JLR. This should help free cash flow turn positive in FY21 and curb deterioration in consolidated leverage. Besides disorderly Brexit, risks may also come from the fluid global tariff situation and if JLR is slow to adopt non-diesel drivetrains in Europe.
JLR’s EBITDA margin fell to 9.7 per cent in FY18 (FY17: 11.6 per cent) due to higher costs, leaving Tata Motors’ margin at around 11 per cent (FY18: 11.2 per cent, FY17: 10.6 per cent), despite an improvement in its Indian business.
“We expect a gradual lift in Tata Motors’ profitability over the medium-term following launches and model refreshes at JLR along with enhanced productivity and a shift in production mix towards low-cost locations, such as the new plant in Slovakia. “We also expect Tata Motors’ Indian business to benefit from volume growth and its strategy to reduce the number of passenger-vehicle platforms, which will support margins despite intense competition,"" Fitch said.
The rating agency said it expects JLR’s continuing large investments to keep Tata Motors’ free cash flow negative over FY19 and FY20, compared with earlier expectations of them turning positive by FY20. “The investments are driven by JLR’s increased focus on electrification, autonomous driving and shared mobility,"" it said. “The company investments in emerging mobility technologies have gained traction, as evidenced by positive reviews of its first all-electric sport-utility vehicle (SUV), I-PACE, which was launched recently,"" it added.
JLR is also developing a new modular platform to help it move away from diesel drivetrains, notably in Europe. “Nonetheless, we expect the investments to improve the group’s ability to respond to emerging sector trends and strengthen its business profile in the long run,"" Fitch said.
Tata Motors has further strengthened its leading position in India’s commercial-vehicle segment, with robust growth over the five months to August 2018. Sales volume rose by 62 per cent in medium and heavy commercial vehicles and 39 per cent in light commercial vehicles. Sales volume in the expanding SUV market also surged by more than 200 per cent. Although this growth came off a low base, it reflects progress in the company’s strategy to regain lost passenger-vehicles segment market share, it said.
Tata Motors has an available cash balance of more than  ₹ 40,000 crore at FYE18 that was adequate to meet  ₹ 18,000 crore of debt maturing in FY19.

Mumbai: Passenger car sales fell for the third straight month in September, hit by a slew of factors led by erratic monsoon rainfall and a devastating flood in Kerala. Car makers on Monday said unfavourable macroeconomic conditions and the high base of last year also contributed to the decline.
India’s top five carmakers—Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd and Honda Cars India Ltd—together sold 237,009 units last month, a 2% drop from the figure a year ago. Auto makers in the country consider factory dispatches to dealerships as sales.
While car sales had been growing at a healthy pace since November 2017, boosted by new launches and a recovery in rural demand, they have shown a downtrend for the third consecutive month in September—they fell in July due to a high base effect of the year-earlier month and generally tepid demand during the monsoon season, and as customers waited to order new models in the festive season. In the next month, sales dropped because of reasons similar to the ones cited for September.
Before July, car sales declined in June last year, when buyers held back purchases to benefit from lower rates under the goods and services tax (GST) regime, rolled out on 1 July 2017.
Auto makers begin to build up inventory in anticipation of higher demand in the forthcoming festival season. However, the first 10 days of October are likely to see muted sales in some regions, especially North India, as it marks the Shraadh period, considered inauspicious for big purchases such as cars, gold and real estate.
An early festival season, beginning in September last year, as opposed to October this year, caused a high base, while a change in the GST cess for multi-utility vehicles led to some pre-buying in September, said Subrata Ray, senior group vice president (corporate sector ratings) at ratings agency Icra Ltd.
“If you combine September and October this year and compare year-on-year, growth should be normal,"" he said, adding that there was “some"" impact due to flooding in Kerala, while urban demand took a hit due to rising interest rates, inflation and fuel prices.
India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, on Monday posted a marginal rise in local car sales in September to 136,876 units from 136,786 units a year ago, stemming two consecutive months of decline. The figures exclude sales of Maruti Suzuki’s Omni and Eeco vans and light commercial vehicle Super Carry.
The local unit of Suzuki Motor Corp. reported a decline in sales in July and August after several months of robust demand for its wide range of cars, on the back of uneven monsoon rains and devastating floods in Kerala.
Maruti Suzuki this year has introduced facelifts of models such as the Swift hatchback, the DZire compact sedan and the Ciaz mid-sized sedan, expecting robust sales to end the year with double-digit growth.
The compact car segment, which makes up the bulk of Maruti Suzuki’s sales, rose 1.7% to 74,011 units in September. With the exception of July and August, this segment had been reporting growth upwards of 20% in the past few months mainly on account of demand for the 2018 Swift hatchback and Dzire compact sedan, and continued popularity of premium hatchback Baleno.
While sales of entry-level cars Alto and WagonR fell 9.1% to 34,971 units last month, the sports utility vehicle segment comprising Vitara Brezza and S-Cross models, posted a rise of 8.7% to 21,639 units over that of 2017. Sales of the Ciaz grew 11.5% to 6,246 units.
The unfavourable demand environment affected Hyundai India, as the local unit of the South Korean firm posted a 4.5% drop in domestic sales to 47,781 units last month.
“Despite some ongoing market challenges, we expect this festival season will induce positive sentiments among customers and the industry would witness a strong positive growth,"" said Vikas Jain, national sales head at Hyundai India.
The maker of the rugged Bolero and Scorpio SUVs, Mahindra, posted a sharp decline of 16% in sales to 21,411 units in September despite the launch of the Marazzo multi-purpose vehicle. Rajan Wadhera, president of Mahindra’s automotive sector, said September was “muted"" due to factors such as “low consumer buying sentiment, high fuel prices and the effects of monsoon in many parts of the country"".
“We remain hopeful that the upcoming festive season will augur well for us as well as the automotive industry,"" he added.
Ray of Icra expects local passenger vehicle sales to rise 9% this fiscal, a forecast that has remained unchanged since the start of the year.
“The rural market would remain the key driver for overall growth as we expect the steady, strong, positive traction to continue. Overall rural sentiment will remain positive,"" he said."

The company said it would stop production at the Solihull plant in the UK for two weeks. The plant has 9,000 staff after cutting 1,000 temporary workers this year.
“As a business we are continuing to experience challenging conditions in some of our key markets.

294,2018-10-09,Tata Motors,"News of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) shuttering a UK plant for two weeks because of sinking demand in China plunges Tata Motors share prices by 13%, the biggest drop in nine years

Mumbai: Europe’s luxury car titans are bearing the brunt of a slump in Chinese auto demand, and investors in India are paying the price. 
Mumbai: Europe’s luxury car titans are bearing the brunt of a slump in Chinese auto demand, and investors in India are paying the price.
Jaguar Land Rover’s announcement late Monday about shuttering production for two weeks in October at its Solihull plant in the UK—because of sinking demand in China—sent shares of its owner Tata Motors Ltd plunging 13% in Mumbai. That wiped out $1.2 billion of its market value, or enough money to buy about 25,000 Jaguar F-Pace SUVs, each priced at about $47,000.
The British marquee brands, which featured in several James Bond movies, said sales in China declined 46% last month amid an uncertainty resulting from import duty changes and continued trade tensions. The world’s biggest luxury automakers BMW AG and Daimler AG have both previously cited the tit-for-tat trade war between the US and China among reasons for issuing profit warnings as Chinese consumers stay away from showrooms.
Performance of the marquee brands in China is critical for Tata Motors, which gets more than three-fourths of its revenue from the UK units it bought from Ford Motor Co. about a decade ago.
“JLR is the real backbone of Tata Motors in terms of profitability,"" said Deepesh Rathore, London-based director at Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors. “Any slide of JLR fortunes will adversely impact Tata Motors.""
Tata Motors fell 13% to  ₹  184.35, the largest drop in nine years. The stock was the biggest mover in India’s benchmark Sensex index, which slipped 0.5%. The Mumbai-based automaker is trading at its lowest level January 2012.
Chinese vehicle sales have been tumbling for carmakers including General Motors Co., as slowing economic growth, a weakening currency and losses in the stock market add to the woes from the trade war. The conflict is adding to unprecedented pressure on an industry grappling with the shift to electric cars.
BMW is among the most-affected from higher tariffs, as it ships popular sport utility models like the X5 from its US plant in Spartanburg to China.
Jaguar Land Rover’s weak performance in China comes as the company braces for the possibility of a hard Brexit. Last month, chief executive officer Ralf Speth warned Prime Minister Theresa May that a bad Brexit deal could put tens of thousands of jobs at risk and cost the company more than £1.2 billion a year."

News of Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR’s) two-week plant shutdown at Solihull in the UK did not go down well with investors of Tata Motors Ltd. After hitting new lows almost every day in the last five trading sessions, the stock plunged over 13% on Tuesday. The Solihull plant shutdown follows an earlier announcement of a three-day week at its Bromwich plant, also in the UK. The 12.3% year-on-year drop in JLR’s September retail sales accelerated the fall over the last three months. According to the company, the China market continues to be unsettled following “tariff changes and trade tensions"" that pulled down retail sales by 46.2% in the region. 
News of Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR’s) two-week plant shutdown at Solihull in the UK did not go down well with investors of Tata Motors Ltd. After hitting new lows almost every day in the last five trading sessions, the stock plunged over 13% on Tuesday. The Solihull plant shutdown follows an earlier announcement of a three-day week at its Bromwich plant, also in the UK. The 12.3% year-on-year drop in JLR’s September retail sales accelerated the fall over the last three months. According to the company, the China market continues to be unsettled following “tariff changes and trade tensions"" that pulled down retail sales by 46.2% in the region.
Naturally, the dashing of the hopes of cashing in on China, which readily accepted its vehicles earlier and where JLR cars sold like hot cakes until recently, is likely to be a severe blow to revenue and profits. 
That’s not all. UK and Germany sales fell by 20% and 31% year-on-year, respectively, due to reduced diesel demand, while US sales, which were growing, also dipped by 5.5%.
Certainly, all is not well at JLR. About two years ago, trouble started with currency woes, following Brexit, which impacted profitability. Then they had falling sales due to makeovers and new model introduction. And now, macroeconomic issues such as the US-China trade war and the global drive towards lower carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles have led to a slump in sales of luxury diesel cars. 
Braving these headwinds has not been easy for JLR. Its profitability, which grew by leaps and bounds after the turnaround, has been under pressure since the last 8-10 quarters. Its June quarter Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin was an abysmal 6.2%, the lowest in several quarters. 
So, with Tata Motors’ cash cow in dire straits, there is little hope for a quick turnaround for the company as a whole. The firm posted a consolidated loss in the June quarter, which is likely to deepen in the September quarter. To be sure, the stand-alone commercial vehicle and passenger car business is riding a high, but it is hardly material to earnings.
A report by Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd that mirrors the sentiment on the Street indicates a 35% and 13% cut in earnings estimates for FY19 and FY20, respectively. This was prior to the news of the Solihull plant shutdown. 
True, given the company’s pedigree, there is some confidence that the storm will pass and there will be brighter days ahead. But how long it would be before Tata Motors and the stock recoup their losses is anybody’s guess."

New Delhi: Even as rupee depreciation is adding to the stress in the automobile market, Tata Motors will evaluate passing on its impact to consumers only around December to avoid price hike during the festive season, a senior company official said on Wednesday.
The company, which introduced an upgraded version of its compact sedan Tigor priced between  ₹ 5.20 lakh and  ₹ 7.38 lakh (ex-showroom), is also looking at launching a premium hatchback next year to widen its product offering.
“That’s a stress. Till a point we can absorb and we will absorb, but otherwise we are running a sustainable project and we have to win sustainably,"" Tata Motors President, Passenger Vehicles Business Unit, Mayank Pareek told PTI.
He was responding to a query on the impact of rupee depreciation against the dollar on the company’s cost of imports.
Pareek further said, “We have about 25-30% import content both directly and indirectly."" On Tuesday, the rupee slumped by 33 paise to finish at a fresh lifetime low of 74.39 against the US dollar on high crude oil prices, strengthening of the greenback and unabated foreign fund outflows.
When asked if the company planned to pass on the impact to customers, he said, “We will watch but for the festive season we would not like to disturb the pricing."" By year-end, around December, the company could decide on the price hike, Pareek said adding, “Certainly we will have to do, but we cannot completely pass on the entire burden to customers."" Commenting on the market sentiment, he said there is “stress"" due to factors such as high fuel prices and non-availability of vehicle finance.
“However, at Tata Motors we are looking forward to a good festive season on the back of the actions we have taken up, such as introduction of new products to build on the growth we have had this year,"" Pareek said.
In the second quarter, when the industry PV sales have declined by 3.2%, Tata Motors grew by 19.1%, he added.
On the new Tigor, Pareek said the company expects the model to be a strong player in the compact sedan segment which has witnessed growth in the last two years after witnessing a decline previously.
“Customers had moved to compact SUV from compact sedan. However, in the last two-three years with the introduction of new exciting products, people have again started buying products in this segment,"" he added.
The new Tigor will be available in petrol version powered by 1.2 litre engine and diesel with 1.05 litre powertrain.
The petrol variants of the model are priced between  ₹ 5.20 lakh and  ₹ 6.65 lakh, while the diesel trims are tagged between  ₹ 6.09 lakh and  ₹ 7.38 lakh.
On new product plans, Pareek said the company is looking to fill gaps in its portfolio to enhance its presence in the overall market segments.
“Around three years ago, we were present in only 50% of the market. We have increased in to around 55-60% now. The aim is to be present in 90% of the overall PV segment,"" he said.
While Tata Motors is gearing up to launch its SUV Harrier early next year, Pareek said, “We are still not present in the premium hatchback segment, which is also something we will look to address next year."""

Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd is working on plans to revamp its entire dealership network as it seeks to bolster attempts to stage a turnaround in its passenger vehicle business in India, said a senior company executive. 
Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd is working on plans to revamp its entire dealership network as it seeks to bolster attempts to stage a turnaround in its passenger vehicle business in India, said a senior company executive.
The nationwide revamp will commence next year because the Mumbai-based auto maker feels its current showrooms are not equipped enough to handle its latest range of cars and sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) including those set to be launched in the future. The product portfolio includes the Tata Harrier SUV set to go on sale early next year.
Tata Motors will leverage technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) at shopping malls and other popular locations to inform customers about its products, Mayank Pareek, president of passenger vehicle business at Tata Motors said in an interview.
“We are making world-class cars and they can’t be sold through these kind of places (current dealerships), so we have to make world-class showrooms,"" said Pareek. “So, we have worked on a new showroom design and layout which you haven’t seen yet because it is still getting approved. Next year, we will make 100 showrooms change in to this new concept.""
Tata Motors, the parent of UK-based auto maker Jaguar Land Rover, has been trying to revive fortunes of its namesake brand of passenger vehicles in India for the past four years. To achieve its aim, the company started the so-called Impact 2.0 language in designing its new vehicles, while also implementing changes to make vendors more efficient.
Tata Motors’ new products comprising the Tiago hatchback, Tigor compact sedan and Nexon compact SUV have helped the company revive sales and close the gap with Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, India’s third-largest auto maker.
Puneet Gupta, associate director, IHS Markit, said Tata Motors’ passenger vehicle business has made a turnaround in the last one year as sales have risen as well market share. He said it is right time for the company to change the way its dealerships function as showrooms need to complement the improved products.
“The dealers now have an idea of the company’s intent when it comes to making improvement in products and other aspects of the business. So, the channel partners will be convinced to make investments in their business which will help the company,"" said Gupta.
Tata Motors will be the second carmaker after Maruti Suzuki India Ltd to initiate a complete overhaul of its showrooms to attract a new generation of customers. In 2015, Maruti started the Nexa range of premium dealerships for its new range of premium vehicles, and in 2017, the company decided to upgrade existing showrooms under the Arena theme.
Tata Motors has currently around 770 dealerships which is expected to increase to 2,000 by 2022.
Pareek, who was earlier the marketing and sales chief at Maruti Suzuki, said Tata Motors will refrain from giving any name to its revamped showrooms.
In addition to changing the way the dealerships function, Pareek said the company will tap technologies like augmented reality virtual reality (AR/VR) so that the expansion can be implemented at a fast clip.
“In the future, you will not expect customers to come to you. We have to go to places where customers are going. So, let’s say if we are going to create a AR/VR thing in Select City Mall (in New Delhi) which has a footfall of one lakh people every day and even if 10% of the footfall visits our AR/VR, then you will have 10,000 people very day,"" he said.
Tata Motors recorded a 31% rise in passenger vehicle sales in the domestic market in the first half of this fiscal year to 106,865 vehicles thanks to demand for its new models."

Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd believes its money-spinner Jaguar Land Rover Plc (JLR) has lost operating leverage amid lower sales in China and Brexit, said a top executive at the Mumbai-based auto maker. The woes at the UK-based unit have raised concerns among investors and shareholders about how Tata Motors shares will fare going forward and the auto maker’s ability to continue paying dividends, said P.B. Balaji, Tata Motors’ chief financial officer. 
Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd believes its money-spinner Jaguar Land Rover Plc (JLR) has lost operating leverage amid lower sales in China and Brexit, said a top executive at the Mumbai-based auto maker. The woes at the UK-based unit have raised concerns among investors and shareholders about how Tata Motors shares will fare going forward and the auto maker’s ability to continue paying dividends, said P.B. Balaji, Tata Motors’ chief financial officer.
Declining sales of diesel vehicles, Brexit concerns, tariffs and the need for high investments in the face of the technology disruption happening in the auto industry are among the big challenges that British luxury marques are facing, Balaji told Tata Review, an internal company magazine that comes out every quarter. Mint has a copy of the magazine.
“These are compounded by internal cost challenges. The teams are facing a new normal—of lower growths with higher capex needs—and are working actively to reduce costs and improve cash flows,"" Balaji said.
JLR’s retail sales fell 12% from the year earlier in September, accelerating the fall over the last three months. The China market continues to be unsettled following “tariff changes and trade tensions"" that led to a 46% drop in retail sales in the key market. Sales in the UK and Germany fell 20% and 31% respectively due to reduced diesel demand, while US sales, which were growing so far, also declined 5.5% last month. Then, there are execution challenges, said Balaji, adding in the last 12 months, JLR sales grew 2%, a drop from an average of 20-25% in previous years.
“The business has lost operating leverage over the last few years...,"" he said. “The shareholders are concerned about the share price performance and the lack of dividend payments. It is imperative that we address these concerns fast,"" Balaji said.
Trouble at JLR started about two years ago with currency woes, following Brexit. Profitability was impacted, compounded by falling sales due to makeovers and new model introduction. And now, macroeconomic issues such as the US-China trade war and the global drive towards lower carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles have led to a slump in sales of luxury diesel cars.
The state of affairs at JLR casts a shadow on a quick turnaround for the domestic business of Tata Motors as a whole. The firm posted a consolidated loss in the June quarter, which is likely to deepen in the September quarter. To be sure, the standalone commercial vehicle and passenger car business is on the upswing but Balaji prefers to remain conservative.

“The domestic business has had a good run, but we cannot get complacent; we should not forget we are in a cyclical industry. We need to regain our lost shares. We need to deliver cash break-evens in our PV business...,"" he said.
Also read | There’s little hope for Tata Motors with JLR in dire straits
For Balaji, the primary concerns are China, where JLR models earlier sold like hot cakes. “These form the largest component of our stock price. China in particular is critical for us as it contributes disproportionately to our profitability.""

New Delhi: Shares of Tata Motors Ltd have lost over 60% in FY19 on concerns about the profitability of its subsidiary, Jaguar Land Rover Plc (JLR). Tata Motors’ domestic business, though, continues to recover and is likely to post profits in the September quarter (Q2). Mint analyses the prospects.

Is a turnaround in the China market imperative for JLR?
JLR, which saw sales in China plunging 46% in September, is one of the several companies caught in the trade war between China and the US. Customers in China appear to have postponed their vehicle purchases, as the government is expected to reduce import duties on vehicles to 15% from the existing 25%, which would substantially reduce the cost of imported vehicles. The firm also had to offer more incentives or discounts to customers, impacting realizations per unit from China. JLR manufactures its products in China though a joint venture with state-owned Cherry Automobiles.
What are the other challenges for JLR?
JLR sales have slowed in its home market Britain and other key markets. Production was halted at the Solihull and Castle Bromwich plants for a week and three days, respectively, to match production with retail demand. A decline in the sales of diesel cars in Europe and the huge investments JLR has to make to develop alternative technologies such as electric are taking a toll on its finances. A report by brokerage house Motilal Oswal says retail sales in the UK fell 20%, while in Germany the decline is around 30%, as new homologation norms took effect and diesel vehicle sales dropped in September. Its US sales slipped 5%.
Will Brexit hurt?
JLR still exports a substantial number of the vehicles it makes in Britain. A hard Brexit may lead to job losses. In order to diversify and offset a hard Brexit, JLR has established production units in Brazil, Slovakia.
How is Tata Motors’ Indian business faring?
It is close to a turnaround. According to a report by analysts of the brokerage firm Jefferies, the domestic business is expected to report profits in the second quarter of this fiscal. Unwavering government focus on infrastructure investment through different schemes has led to sustained demand for trucks and Tata Motors being the largest manufacturer of commercial vehicles (CVs) benefited from this. The CV business contributes 80% of the revenues of the stand-alone business of Tata Motors.
How is the local passenger vehicles business performing?
In the last two years, Tata Motors has improved its brand perception by introducing cars such as the Tiago hatchback and the Nexon compact sports utility vehicle (SUV). It has dislodged Honda cars from the fourth spot in the Indian market and is aiming to become the third largest. The carmaker will launch another SUV, Harrier, in 2019, which will be the first product from the Tata Motors-JLR collaboration. The firm is planning an overhaul of its dealerships from the next year."
287,2018-10-17,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors has created a separate division to explore ways to tap its entire range of passenger and commercial vehicles for offering shared mobility solutions

New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd has created a separate division to explore ways to tap its entire range of passenger and commercial vehicles for offering shared mobility solutions, said two people aware of the development. Named Mobility Innovations Hub, the new department is headed by Pankaj Jhunja, formerly with Tata Technologies, said the people cited above, who did not want to be named. 
New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd has created a separate division to explore ways to tap its entire range of passenger and commercial vehicles for offering shared mobility solutions, said two people aware of the development. Named Mobility Innovations Hub, the new department is headed by Pankaj Jhunja, formerly with Tata Technologies, said the people cited above, who did not want to be named.
The new department will also look at collaborating with startups such as Ola, Uber and other freight aggregators. Tata Motors is the first auto maker in India to create a separate division exclusively for shared mobility as the company manufactures an entire gamut of vehicles needed for last mile connectivity ranging from small cars to trucks and buses.
Confirming the appointment of Jhunja to run the shared mobility business, a spokesperson for Tata Motors said Jhunja will report to Shailesh Chandra, president, electric mobility business and corporate strategy.
“We have mentioned before, as part of our turnaround journey, we will be creating ring-fenced teams to lead projects in our endeavour to act fast in the market place,"" the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson however declined to elaborate on the plans as Tata Motors is in a silent period ahead of its quarterly results scheduled for 31 October.
The first person mentioned above said the new division will explore the entire aspect of shared mobility but its role will evolve in the future as the subject is still a concept in India.
The division will also work on new technologies like augmented reality, virtual reality and big data to help create certain mobility solutions.
“Tata Motors wants to provide end-to-end connectivity to the customers and the company has the range of vehicles in different segments to provide such services,"" the person said.
“Shared mobility is yet to evolve as a concept but this move from Tata Motors makes sense since these measures may hold the company in good stead once the concept evolves in India.""
Underscoring Tata Motors’ focus on shared and connected mobility, Guenter Butschek, managing director and chief executive of Tata Motors, said at a recent conference of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association that auto makers need to explore new technologies and focus on startups as the industry needs to learn the ability to take risks.
“We need to think beyond products and focus on solutions and new business models. We need to redefine ourselves,"" said Butschek.
Shared mobility as a concept has different facets to it and ride-sharing is probably one of the main aspects that has become popular in India with companies like Ola and Uber.
In the future, Tata Motors plans to connect with customers in the commercial vehicle space for providing end-to-end connectivity since it offers products across the entire range.
The second person mentioned above said Tata Motors will work in the domain of freight aggregation and as the top commercial vehicle maker, it has the data base of its customers to offer its services.
“Tata Motors will work with a lot of startups in different areas of mobility and provide solutions in the domain of smart mobility solutions,"" the person said, requesting anonymity. “In passenger vehicle space as well, the company will be working with its customers and other tech companies to provide solutions. This new department will be in charge of all this activities and much more.""
According to Avik Chattopadhyay, founder of Expereal, a brand consultancy firm, the new department will likely have a mandate to help Tata Motors connect with the right partners to offer solutions in the mobility space.
“These departments in automobile companies will also try to work with lots of new technologies like AR and VR. Going forward, companies have to look at developing softwares along with the products and for that an entirely new approach is needed which is difficult to build in a traditional manufacturing company,"" he said."

 London: Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover on Thursday announced the opening of its new state-of-the-art $1.6 billion manufacturing facility in Slovakia, a first for a British automotive brand setting up in the central European country. JLR said its investment is expected to lead to an annual production of 100,000 cars at the new Slovak plant by 2020.
“Global businesses require global operational footprints. While Jaguar Land Rover’s heart and soul remain firmly anchored in the UK, expanding internationally only enriches and strengthens our UK business,"" Ralf Speth, JLR CEO, said at the opening ceremony.
He hailed the move as the start of a new era in manufacturing for the luxury car brands and the culmination of four years of planning. “As with our existing manufacturing facilities located in the UK, China, Brazil, India and Austria, this high-tech plant in Slovakia will complement and support our corporate, R&D and engineering functions headquartered in the UK,"" Speth said.
The UK-based company, which was acquired by the Tata Group a decade ago, said the creation of new international factories allows JLR to “offer customers even more exciting new models, protect against currency fluctuations and support a globally competitive business"".
The company described the setting up of the new Slovak plant in Nitara as the latest step in its global expansion strategy, which follows the opening of JLR’s Chinese joint venture in 2014 and Brazilian plant in 2016, supported by contract manufacturing in India from 2011 and Austria from 2017.
JLR currently employs around 1,500 people in Nitra, with 98% Slovak nationals and 30% women. It will launch its second phase of local recruitment in November, looking for an additional 850 people to join the team in Nitra. All manufacturing employees have taken part in a bespoke 12-week training programme in the company’s first overseas Training Academy, representing an investment of €7.5 million. “Our diverse workforce brings a wealth of experience from both automotive and broader industries,"" Speth noted.
The new 300,000m² facility has been billed as being at the forefront of aluminium manufacturing and engineering expertise in Slovakia, with an annual capacity of 150,000 vehicles a year. Supporting the company’s ongoing commitment to deliver high technology lightweight vehicles to its customers, the first Land Rover Discovery rolled off the production line in September. “The plant incorporates cutting-edge technologies and is the first in Europe to use Kuka’s Pulse carrier system which is 30% faster transfer times than conventional conveyance systems. It will also feature a highly automated paint shop process to ensure the highest quality and minimise the environment impact,"" JLR said.
The factory has been designed with the flexibility to enable smart, connected manufacturing technologies, such as shop floor visualisation by using real-time data to solve issues which will support improved process efficiency, delivery and quality. Slovakia has an established premium automotive sector, which represents 44% of the country’s overall industry. JLR, which is the UK’s largest automotive manufacturer, has the largest number of retailers for its cars in Europe, with around 800 outlets across 42 countries. Since the beginning of 2018, Jaguar Land Rover has sold more than 94,000 vehicles in Europe.

Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd, India’s largest automaker by sales revenue, will report its September quarter (Q2 FY19) results on Wednesday.
The sustained turnaround in the domestic business is unlikely to offset a disappointing performance by the UK subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) Automotive Plc, as the Tata Group flagship is expected to report a consolidated net loss of Rs874.4 crore on consolidated net sales of Rs72,976.7 crore, according to a Bloomberg poll of six analysts.
During the corresponding quarter a year ago, Tata Motors reported a net profit of Rs2,502 crore on net sales of Rs70,156 crore on the back of a strong performance by JLR and a better-than-expected performance by the domestic subsidiary.
During the three months to June, JLR retail sales fell by 13.23% to 129,887 units, while the domestic market was buoyed by higher passenger and commercial vehicle sales.
Analysts estimate consolidated margins to shrink about 4 percentage points to about 9% during the quarter, driven by negative operating leverage, commodity cost pressures and restructuring of the capitalization structure at JLR. Gains from expressing pound revenues in rupee terms (as the pound appreciated about 5% against the rupee during the quarter) and a richer product mix for commercial vehicles in the domestic market are not expected to outweigh JLR’s poor performance.
Here are a few factors to track in the Q2 results:
JLR volumes
JLR’s retail sales during the quarter slumped 13.23% over the year-ago period to 129,887 units, with only three models out of 13 posting growth, according to company data. These are the new launches—the E-Pace compact SUV, I-Pace electric SUV and Range Rover Velar SUV.
Factors such as a model rundown cycle, geopolitical tensions and disfavor for diesel affected sales in large markets such as North America, the UK and Europe, while there was deferment of purchases in China due to a reduction in import duty.
JLR margins
Analysts expect lower operating leverage, commodity cost pressures and restructuring of the capitalization structure at JLR to shrink the UK subsidiary’s margins. A slowdown in the Chinese market is also expected to impact profitability.
JLR’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin is expected to shrink to 7.5%, lower by 4.3 percentage points, said analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd in a 5 October note. The Ebitda margin is a key measure of operating profitability.
Domestic operations
Despite a high base last year, total domestic sales during the September quarter rose by a stellar 29.9% to 174,773 units, as per company data. These numbers were driven primarily by commercial vehicles, with the division clocking 32.84% growth to 120,845 units, on the back of infrastructure-building and broad-based economic growth creating robust demand in sectors such as road construction, mining, retail and e-commerce. The passenger vehicle division grew by 23.65% to 53,928 units.
Led by a richer product mix (of high-tonnage trucks) and higher operating leverage, Tata Motors’ standalone Ebitda margin is expected at 9.7%, up 2.7 percentage points, said analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd in an early October note.

JLR, which contributes to the bulk of the earnings at Tata Motors, was hammered by fluctuating political events globally, especially the ongoing trade war between the US and China. Sales in India stayed on the growth path, thanks to demand for passenger as well as commercial vehicles.

Sales in India stayed on the growth path, thanks to demand for passenger as well as commercial vehicles.
Tata Motors reported a net loss of  ₹ 1,009.49 crore in the three months through September, compared with a year earlier net profit of  ₹ 2,502 crore. It is the company’s second quarterly loss in three years, since a  ₹ 1,902 crore loss in the June quarter.
A Bloomberg poll of six analysts estimated Tata Motors to post a loss of  ₹ 874.4 crore last quarter.
Slowing sales in China—JLR’s single-biggest market and one of its most profitable—hit earnings in the just-ended quarter as retails there fell 44% to 21,096 units. As a result, JLR turned in a quarterly loss of £101 million on an 11% drop in sales to £5.6 billion.
“I haven’t seen so many political developments affecting the business. I can’t do anything about it,"" said Ralf Speth, chief executive officer at JLR, referring to the various geopolitical headwinds faced by JLR at the moment.
“It’s the slowest growth (in sales)—in perhaps a decade,"" Speth said, adding he sees “a very, very weak market situation in the premium segment"" in China owing to a slowdown in economic growth and uncertainty due to the trade war with US.
JLR’s global retail sales fell 13% from a year earlier to 129,887 vehicles last quarter. The UK unit posted an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin of 9.1%, surpassing analyst expectations of about 7.5%. JLR’s profits were also hit by a 15% drop in overall dealer dispatches and higher depreciation and amortization costs, according to Tata Motors.
Existing headwinds such as a model rundown cycle, the possibility of an adverse Brexit and regulatory and customer disfavour for its diesel-heavy portfolio continue to persist as only three out of 13 JLR models recorded sales growth last quarter.
To address these challenges, JLR has drawn up a turnaround plan to save £2.5 billion over the next 18 months through sales rejuvenation, improving cash flows and profitability, and fixing some long-term structural issues, said P. Balaji, group chief financial officer at Tata Motors. Of the £2.5 billion, £1 billion will come from reducing capital expenditure of £500 million each in FY19 and FY20. It will be the first time when capex for JLR has been scaled down, Balaji said, adding demand is expected to remain muted for JLR in the near-term.
Another £500 million would come from generating cash from working capital by pulling back inventory from showrooms, while the remainder would come from rationalising internal cost structures.
To rejuvenate sales, JLR plans to have 16 nameplates by 2024. It aims to drive profitable growth in China by capitalizing on the growing premium market there, in addition to taking advantage of reduced import duty from 1 July.
Meanwhile, Tata Motors posted robust performance in its home market of India. The local operations recorded a net profit of  ₹ 109 crore thanks to higher commercial and passenger vehicle sales, and a cost-saving programme implemented since August 2016. Sales climbed 33% to  ₹ 17,759 crore, albeit off a lower base.
The Ebitda margin widened 2.1 percentage points to 8.7% due to higher volumes and operating leverage, and a richer product mix of bigger trucks and buses.
Balaji said the Ebit margin guidance for FY19-21 has been increased to 4-6% from 3-5% given the success of the turnaround plan.
Total domestic sales of Tata’s namesake brand of vehicles jumped 30% year-on-year to 174,773 units in the September quarter. Commercial vehicles led the way, clocking a 33% increase to 120,845 units on the back of infrastructure-building and broad-based economic growth creating robust demand in sectors such as road construction, mining, retail and e-commerce. Passenger vehicle sales surged 24% to 53,928 units.

The story in the US and UK markets was equally woeful, though the reasons were different—lower demand for diesel vehicles, market cyclicality and Brexit-linked issues. Sales in these two regions contracted by 4.6% and 11.4%, respectively.
All this translated into weak cash flows as revenues were not sufficient to cover costs and drive profits. JLR’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin drop of 270 basis points year-on-year to 9.1% dragged down the consolidated margin of Tata Motors too down by 130 basis points to 9.9%. One hundred basis points equal one percentage points."

Mumbai/Bengaluru: India’s Tata Motors Ltd on Wednesday announced a turnaround plan for its luxury car unit Jaguar Land Rover which has been hit hard by trade tensions between China and the US, low demand for diesel cars in Europe and worries over Brexit. Under “Project Charge"" Tata Motors said it plans to cut costs and improve cash flows at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) by 2.5 billion pounds ($3.2 billion) over 18 months. JLR also plans to launch several new vehicles including the Jaguar I-Pace and the new Range Rover Defender over the next few years and will offer a hybrid or electric version of all its models by 2020.

JLR also plans to launch several new vehicles including the Jaguar I-Pace and the new Range Rover Defender over the next few years and will offer a hybrid or electric version of all its models by 2020.
“Together with our ongoing product offensive and calibrated investment plans, these efforts will lay the foundations for long-term sustainable growth,"" JLR CEO Ralf Speth said after Tata Motors reported a loss for the second-quarter.
JLR has trimmed its pre-tax profit expectations for the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 and expects to break even, Speth said, versus an earlier target of profit growth.
As part of the turnaround plan, JLR will first focus on cash saving “quick wins"" like reducing non-product investments and speeding up asset sales, Tata Motors said in an investor presentation.
In the near term it will improve efficiency in areas including purchasing and material cost, manufacturing and logistics and people and will focus on strategic and non-core asset sales. JLR has already reduced the number of production days at its UK plants in Castle Bromwich and Solihull.
The company said in its presentation it has saved 300 million pounds since it initiated the turnaround plan six weeks ago and is working on 500 ideas for the future.
Tata Motors made a loss of 10.49 billion rupees ($141.9 million) for the July-September quarter, compared with a profit of 24.83 billion rupees in the year-ago period. That was worse than the estimate of a loss of 2.40 billion rupees, according to Refinitiv data.
JLR reported a loss of 101 million pounds during the quarter and its margin on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell 130 basis points to 9.9 percent.
Retail sales of its Jaguar saloons and Land Rover sport utility vehicles (SUVs) fell 13.2 percent to about 130,000 units, hurt particularly by tariff changes in China and escalating trade tensions.
Demand in China remained muted even after the country cut import tariffs for cars and car parts to 15 percent for most vehicles from 25 percent from July.
Tata Motors’ domestic business reported a profit of 1.09 billion rupees and EBITDA margin rose 210 basis points to 8.7 percent during the quarter from a year ago. The automaker incurred a one-off charge of 4.37 billion rupees due to the closure of operations at its Thailand-based subsidiary.

In an interview, Kartik Sharma, chief executive – South Asia, Wavemaker, talks about 2018 being their best year so far, focus on content and the challenges that media agencies face today. Edited excerpts.
How has been the year in terms of client wins and new business?
We have added close to  ₹ 1,000 crore worth of business so far, the largest win being the Mondelez account which we won globally and locally. We also won Eureka Forbes, Bisleri, direct selling firm Amway and Mother Dairy. Apart from this, the agency has also retained couple of big clients such as confectionery conglomerate Perfetti Van Melle, insurance comparison website Policybazaar and direct-to-home (DTH) service provider Tata Sky.
Any new category of brands that you have started working on?
We have started working with Dreams11 which is a fantasy gaming firm. It’s an emerging but a high growth category. Dreams11 was launched during the Indian Premier League (IPL) and they have been doing well. We have recently won another business in the health category which we will announce soon. I believe that these firms are set to become big players probably redefining the category in the future.
What are you doing in content?
I believe everything can be made into content. A good content piece could be a static image on Instagram or five to ten-minute video on Facebook or YouTube. Content can also be a good website created for a brand. In India, the content partnerships have been for relatively smaller period (one year) or are often campaign led. We have signed a four-year long partnership with e-commerce website Myntra and entertainment channel Zoom where viewers will get a chance to buy clothes that celebrities are seen wearing in Zoom’s shows on Myntra. Apart from this we do video led content for clients.
A lot is being said about ad fatigue especially among young consumers, what kind of ad formats they are consuming especially on digital?
Video, as a format, continues to dominate the consumption pattern of millennials. The larger question to ask is why people experience fatigue because the time spent on a digital screen has increased significantly. Therefore, a brand must find interesting ways to narrate a story. Young consumers, especially under 25 years of age, are constantly demanding novelty from brands so any kind of repetition will be ignored by them. Advertising must be informative as well as entertaining to be impactful. Vodafone does powerful storytelling and all its ads brings smile to your face while integrating product. Netflix marketing promotions are also intriguing enough to draw viewers to watch their show.
2019 is the crucial year for media agencies with elections dominating advertising spends. What kind of media platforms will be leveraged by the political parties?
I think political parties might leverage chat platform WhatsApp in the upcoming elections because of its large userbase and penetration across the country. Apart from that, digital platforms such as YouTube and Facebook will also play a crucial role.
I believe in General Elections radio will be an impactful medium as it reaches tier II and III towns as well as media dark rural areas. The use of multimedia will happen including outdoor and cinema, but it is difficult to pin point the proportion of different mediums because it would depend on whether a political party or a state is promoting. A national campaign would see mass media promotion such as television and print while a state level campaign can heavily rely on outdoor and radio.
What are the key challenges that media agencies face?
There has been a squeeze on expected compensation from clients’ side. Rise of self-served platforms such as Facebook and Google has led to this school of thought that media agencies are not required any more. It could be an opportunity for agencies to prove their worth or can also be a threat for those who are not ready to take this challenge. Today our competition is not another media agency alone but other software companies, media platform owners even clients who are investing in these platforms."

Buyers of luxury cars in China appear to have postponed their purchases, as the government is expected to reduce the import duty on vehicles to 15% from the existing 25%.

JLR sales have also slowed in its home market Britain and other key markets. Production in the company’s British factories was shut for a week in Solihull and three days at Castle Bromwich to match production with retail demand in September.

The launch provides a lift for JLR following disappointing sales in China and a slump in UK demand that it has blamed on Brexit jitters and government moves to outlaw diesel engines. JLR announced 1,000 job cuts earlier this year, mainly at Solihull, central England, and said it would scale back output at Halewood, near Liverpool, where the new Evoque will be built.
The Evoque refresh is also crucial to JLR, a unit of India’s Tata Motors Ltd, because the original model, introduced in 2010, helped define a new category of luxury SUV aimed at the younger urban driver. That car is also credited with enhancing the appeal of Land Rover and its Range Rover brand among women.

The new Evoque will debut JLR’s Ground View technology, which uses cameras in the front grill combined with a head-up display system to create the illusion of a transparent hood that allows drivers to see the road ahead even on the steepest incline. The back window also has a camera feed to the rear-view mirror meant to aid visibility if the direct line of sight is blocked by luggage.
The mild-hybrid powertrain harvests energy lost during deceleration and redeploys it to assist the engine when the driver accelerates, reducing fuel burn. A plug-in hybrid option will also be available in 12 months. JLR, Britain’s biggest carmaker, has said all new models will come with hybrid or fully electric variants by 2020."

Here are 10 things to know about stock market fall today
1) Among 30 Sensex stocks, just two stocks - Maruti Suzuki and Coal India - managed to close in the green. Sun Pharma, Bharti Airtel, Adani Ports, Tata Motors, Asian Paints and Reliance Industries fell between 3% and 4% . Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank slumped 6% after the private sector lender said that it has challenged in court the RBI’s decision to disregard the issue of preference shares to reduce promoter stake in bank.
2) The broader markets were also under strong selling pressure BSE midcap and smallcap indices also falling nearly 2% each. 
3) Some analysts expect a knee-jerk reaction from the markets, depending on the outcome of the state election results. G Chokkalingam, founder & managing director of Equinomics Research & Advisor, said: “There may be knee-jerk reaction in the markets depending upon the outcome. We firmly believe that the results of state elections do not matter much for the stock markets for the long term.""
4) Sanjiv Bhasin, executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, says: “Any correction may be gradually bought into as markets will discount state election results as macros are improving for India."" Global oil prices are down from around $86 a barrel in October to around $60 now. This had sparked a 5% rally in Nifty in November. 
5) Rahul Sharma, senior research analyst at Equity99, said investors should stay cautious ahead of the outcome of state elections. On the economic front, industrial production data for October and retail inflation data for November will be declared on Wednesday. 
6) Asian markets slid today, extending their recent slide on worries over slowing global growth and fears that a fresh flare-up in tensions between Washington and Beijing could quash any chances of a trade deal. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.7%, falling to a two-week low.
7) Global markets were already reeling on news last week that Canadian officials had arrested the chief financial officer of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei for extradition to the US. The arrest was seen as an added threat to the resolution of a trade war between the world’s top two economies.
8) White House trade adviser Peter Navarro’s comments that US officials would raise tariff rates on Chinese imports if the two countries could not come to an agreement during a 90-day negotiating period fanned fresh concerns over US-China trade relations.
9) Data released over the weekend showed China reporting far weaker than expected November exports and imports, underscoring concerns over slower global growth. 
10) Further adding to concerns for the Indian markets, oil prices rose today, extending gains from Friday when producers club OPEC and some non-affiliated producers agreed a supply cut of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from January. Brent crude edged up 0.2% to $61.79 per barrel."

New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd, which is on a comeback trail, is betting big on its upcoming SUV Tata Harrier to place itself among the top three passenger vehicle manufacturers on a sustainable basis, a top company executive said.The company, which has been working on a strategy to revive its fortunes in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment for the last couple of years, now believes it has the products and scale to be among the leaders in the segment. 
New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd, which is on a comeback trail, is betting big on its upcoming SUV Tata Harrier to place itself among the top three passenger vehicle manufacturers on a sustainable basis, a top company executive said.The company, which has been working on a strategy to revive its fortunes in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment for the last couple of years, now believes it has the products and scale to be among the leaders in the segment.
In an interview with the Press Trust of India, Tata Motors chief executive officer and managing director, Guenter Butschek, said the company had decided in 2016 to aim for the No.3 spot in the PV segment by the end of 2018-19 financial year. “We were number seven at that point in time. When we became number three for the first time in October last year on a monthly basis, we surprised ourselves. At no given point of time the organization really had a belief that this is going to be possible,"" Butschek said.
In the past one year, the company has broken into top three positions thrice on monthly sales basis behind leaders Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor India Pvt. Ltd.
“At least in three of the (last) 12 months we made it even with limited scope of new products,"" Butschek said.
In the April-October period this fiscal, Tata Motors was at No.4 position with sales of 1,38,732 units, a growth of 25.65% over the same period of 2017-18.
Maruti Suzuki is at the top with sales of 10,44,749 units followed by Hyundai at second position with 3,26,178 units. Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd is at the third position with 1,45,462 units, marginal growth over same period of last fiscal.
Having made its presence felt with products like Nexon, Tiago and Hexa, Tata Motors now expects its new offering—the Tata Harrier—to further cement its position in the domestic market.
“We feel very comfortable as far as onward journey is concerned. Tata Harrier plays a fundamental role as it is expected to get us one step forward to a sustainable number three position,"" Butschek said. “The kind of response we have seen so far for the vehicle, we are pretty positive that this car is really going to turn the needle of our destiny in multiple respects."" 
The Tata Harrier, which is based on Land Rover’s D8 Architecture, is scheduled for launch next month. It will take on popular products like Jeep Compass and Mahindra XUV500.
Butschek said the new product would help the company move from “value offerings to a premium offering"". “It improves attractiveness of the brand. It brings us a wider set of customers if we get the sales and after sales experience right,"" he said.
Tata Motors president (passenger vehicles business) Mayank Pareek said the company’s vision is to be the mobility provider for all sections of the society.
“We don’t want to restrict ourselves to few segments. Our new portfolio strategy started from 2016. With each launch since then we have tried to push the envelope a little further and increase our market coverage. Today we cover 60-odd percent of the market,"" he said.
Emphasising on how the company’s approach has changed in the past couple of years, Pareek said earlier Tata Motors used to be the last one to launch a car in any segment. However, with Tata Harrier, Tata Motors has changed that, targeting “those customers who want a pure SUV experience""."

JLR’s euro-denominated bonds due in 2026 have fallen to about 84 cents on the euro since they were sold at par in September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
JLR is also bracing for Brexit next year without a deal, threatening to disrupt auto-industry supply chains. chief executive officer Ralf Speth warned Prime Minister Theresa May in September that a bad Brexit deal could put tens of thousands of jobs at risk and cost the company more than £1.2 billion a year.

Short sellers are still circling bonds from Jaguar Land Rover even as the British luxury carmaker embarks on a savings plan to tackle larger-than-expected losses.
Shorts on JLR’s bonds have more than tripled since the start of the year to $283 million across the carmaker’s notes in dollars, euros and pounds, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. The positions are holding near a record $328 million reached last month, the data show.
JLR is pursuing a 2.5 billion-pound ($3.2 billion) turnaround plan after its parent, India’s Tata Motors Ltd., posted larger-than-expected losses in the second quarter. Still, the restructuring plan will not be enough to remove negative pressure on the company’s credit grade in the short-term, Fitch Ratings said on Wednesday.
A spokeswoman at JLR declined to comment on the short positions.
Junk-rated JLR has already seen downgrades this year from the three largest ratings companies as it battles weakened demand in China, unfavourable diesel regulations and potential adverse impacts from Brexit negotiations.
The cost of insuring JLR’s bonds against losses in the credit-default swaps market jumped to the equivalent of 744 basis points earlier this month, an all-time high, according to data from CMA.

London: Jaguar Land Rover owner Tata Motors has reportedly assured Prime Minister Theresa May of the company’s commitment to Britain’s automotive industry despite the ongoing turmoil of Brexit.
According to The Sunday Times, Tata Sons chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran is understood to have written to the British premier to stress that the Tata Group plans to keep investing in JLR and has no intention of selling the firm.
The UK newspaper quoted sources as saying that the letter was designed to reassure ministers in Britain about its long-term commitment to the UK as it seeks government support for electric and driverless technology, and for building a battery factory in the Midlands region of England.
The report comes amid reports of JLR being forced to make job cuts, shedding more than 1,000 agency staff and putting 2,000 workers at its Castle Bromwich plant in the West Midlands on a three-day week.
JLR CEO Ralf Speth has made regular interventions to warn against a “hard Brexit"", or crashing out of the European Union (EU) without a good deal in place, which would adversely hit the car maker’s supply chains and sales.
The Tata Group had acquired the iconic British luxury car brand from Ford in 2008 for $2.3 billion, reviving its sagging fortunes to a profitable company employing 40,000 staff. However, falling diesel sales, waning consumer confidence, a collapse in the Chinese market and Brexit contingency planning have wreaked havoc in recent months.
The Midlands-based company racked up half-year losses of £354 million between March and September, reversing profits of £953 million for the same period a year earlier.
The Tata Group declined to comment on the letter quoted in UK media.

258,2019-01-16,Tata Motors,"While cost-cutting might arrest losses, JLR's plummeting sales graph may not change course before FY20

Tata Motors Ltd has a history of facing massive setbacks, only to rise stronger in the future. It finds itself in the midst of another perfect storm, with declining sales at its UK unit Jaguar Land Rover Ltd (JLR) resulting in a huge correction in its value. Tata Motors’ market value has plunged 62% in a year. 
Tata Motors Ltd has a history of facing massive setbacks, only to rise stronger in the future. It finds itself in the midst of another perfect storm, with declining sales at its UK unit Jaguar Land Rover Ltd (JLR) resulting in a huge correction in its value. Tata Motors’ market value has plunged 62% in a year.
So will Tata Motors’ Project Charge and Accelerate plan at JLR to cut costs and improve cash flows by a total £2.5 billion over 18 months work? Will investments into new car models and electric vehicles pay off amid heightened competition from long-standing auto giants, and in the face of global auto gloom?
What’s worrisome for investors is that the crisis seems to be deepening on all fronts.
JLR’s latest performance was pitiful. December vehicle sales shifted into reverse gear, dropping 6% year-on-year. Cumulative sales in the April-December period are down 5%.
Worse, JLR sales fell 42% in China, amid a general gloom in the region. China’s auto sales for 2018 closed 2.8% lower than the previous year, making it the first reversal since the 1990s. The country, which comprises nearly 30% of the world’s auto market, has guided for flat volumes in 2019.
In addition, there are the Brexit-related worries, the shift away from diesel cars in Europe, plateauing sales in North America and the impact of China-US trade tariffs to be reckoned with. While these regions together comprise a third of JLR’s sales, China alone had a 24% share in the company’s sales, until a few quarters back.
But it is not just JLR that is in trouble. The global auto slowdown and the resultant production glut is turning more severe than expected. Sales of other luxury brands such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz are falling as well.
As such, JLR is not alone in its decision to shut down some production facilities and cut employee strength. Ford and General Motors too are taking similar steps. A report by Nomura Research portrays a dull calendar for 2019, with a 1.4% contraction expected in global auto demand.
In short, while cost-cutting might arrest losses, JLR’s plummeting sales graph may not change course before FY20. Nomura forecasts a 7% year-on-year drop in the company’s FY19 sales, which could turn positive in FY20 on a weak base and with new launches.
But hefty discounts offer dim hopes of a near-term improvement in cash flows. FY18’s free cash flows that were negative £1.05 billion, continued the trend in the first two quarters of FY19 at -£1.67 billion and -£624 million, respectively. Tata Motors’ management is hopeful of generating positive free cash flows through inventory liquidation and sales of new models. This should also pull back Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin into higher-single digits by FY20-21.
It is no mean task however. JLR’s Ebit slipped into losses in the September quarter from a profit in the year-ago period. This dragged Tata Motors into a consolidated loss of  ₹ 1,000 crore, compared to a profit in the year-ago period. A turnaround depends on success of new launches and its electric or hybrid vehicles. True, the company has a strong brand in JLR, but competition is likely to be stiff in new-age vehicles, with leading brands also in the fray.
Meanwhile, the Indian business of trucks and passenger cars has been doing well, with rising sales and market share gains. That said, the last quarter saw a sudden dip in truck sales, leaving the Street a bit worried on that front as well.
Of course, in the final analysis, JLR accounts for over 90% of the auto giant’s profits, and its fortunes will drive the company’s valuations. As pointed above, while Tata Motors may be taking measures to cut costs and improve profitability, there is little it can do about the global slowdown. Little wonder then that its new restructuring initiative was not convincing enough for rating agencies to turn positive on the company.
Some analysts have forecast an increase in JLR’s profit margin due to revenue increase and favourable foreign exchange gains in the December quarter. But, this must not be mistaken for a turnaround in fortunes."

On Wall Street, all three major U.S. equity indexes closed in positive territory, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average booking the largest gains on upbeat quarterly results from IBM and other major firms. The S&P 500 gained 0.22%. But gains were capped by uncertainty over the partial U.S. government shutdown, slowing global economic growth and the yet-unresolved trade standoff between the United States and China. 
White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said in a CNN interview the US economy could see zero growth in the first three months if the partial government shutdown lasts for the whole quarter. On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said that the United States was doing well in trade talks with China, saying at a White House event that China ""very much wants to make a deal.""
Indian rupee was trading higher against the US dollar. Other Asian currencies also strengthened as dollar held steady amid optimism about improvements in the US-China trade relations. In early trade, the currency was trading at 71.22 a dollar, higher than its previous close of 71.33. The home currency opened at 71.26 a dollar.

256,2019-01-24,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors has indicated that from April 2020, the production and sales of Tata Nano would stopSome of the other existing products of Tata Motors would also be discontinued owing to the BS-VI norms

HYDERABAD :
Tata Motors has no plans to invest and upgrade Ratan Tata's dream car Nano to meet BS-VI standards, a senior company official said Thursday indicating that the production and sales of the vehicle would stop from April 2020.
""Nano is produced at our Sanad plant (Gujarat)....in January new safety norms came, in April some more new norms will come and in October new safety norms will come and BS-VI is going to happen from April 1 of 2020, so all products may not meet (BS-VI norms) and we may not invest in upgrading all the products...and Nano is one of them,"" President of Passenger Vehicle Business Unit, Tata Motors, Mayank Pareek told reporters.
The entry level car, brainchild of Ratan Tata who envisaged giving a safer and affordable alternative to families riding on two-wheelers, received lacklustre response from the Indian consumer.
It was launched in 2009 with an initial price of about  ₹one lakh.
Pareek also indicated that some of the existing products of Tata Motors would also be discontinued owing to the BS-VI norms.
However, he did not specify the other passenger vehicles that would be discontinued.
On the BS-VI vehicles, he said it was a challenge for auto makers as the Supreme Court guidelines do not allow car registrations other than BS-VI after April 1, 2020.
""Basically today we (Tata Motors) have 5 or 6 products (in passenger vehicle segment). They will be refurbished and modified. For Industry is the biggest challenge. BS-IV stock should become zero by April 1, 2020,"" he said.
Pareek said during the last 36 months, Tata Motors outperformed the market.
For April-December period, the company has grown by 22.4 per cent. While the industry grew by 4.4 per cent.
Three years back Tata Motors had market share of 2.8 per cent in passenger car segment and it has not reached to nearly seven per cent.
Currently it caters only 60 per cent of the car market and aims at covering 90 per cent by launching new products by 2021-22.
According to him, the last festival season was not good in terms of car sales in the country as there was ""stress"" in the liquidity market and as a result people getting loans has become ""slower"".
On electric vehicles, he said though they have technology to develop EVs, there is no enough charging infrastructure available in the country.
Pareek Thursday launched ""Harrier,"" the new SUV from Tata Motors stable in the Telangana market.
To a query, he said the waiting period for the new vehicle is roughly three months.

LONDON :
Britain's car exports to India registered a 4.81% hike over the previous year, even as the automotive industry battled with Brexit uncertainties to record a 9.1% fall in production figures, according to the latest figures released here on Thursday.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders (SMMT) found that UK manufacturers sold 1,199 units to India in 2018, which marks a rise from 1,144 units in 2017.
It meant that India retains its place as the 12th largest Asian market for the UK's car industry, a market led by China and Japan.
Tata Motors owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) was the frontrunner in terms of popularity, with UK-manufactured Range Rover Sport and Range Rover among the most bought models by Indians, alongside BMW's Mini Hatch.
The overall size of the Indian new car market also registered a 6% hike to hit 2.55 million cars in 2018, with the UK importing 14,064 cars built in India.
""Despite challenges as the UK leaves the EU, the fundamental strengths of British automotive manufacturing have not changed, but it's imperative we have economic and political stability to safeguard future growth and our mutually beneficial trading relationships,"" said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.
""The UK has a global reputation for automotive engineering, thanks to a rich history, highly skilled workforce and a diverse array of desirable brands.
""The industry trades globally, benefitting from strong government support for the sector, a competitive business environment and free and fair trading arrangements with the EU and other global markets,"" he said.
The industry body has been calling for frictionless arrangements with the European Union (EU) – its largest export market – as the UK negotiates its exit from the economic bloc.
The SMMT, the influential representative body for the British auto industry, said the investment fell by 50% last year as companies held back spending due to Brexit-related uncertainty.
""We need a deal,"" said Hawes, in reference to shaky negotiations over Britain's Withdrawal Agreement with the EU.
The EU remains Britain's largest trading partner, taking a 52.6% share of all UK car exports in 2018, equivalent to 650,628 units. At the same time, 68.4% of all new cars registered on UK roads were imported from European factories.
""Every day, more than 1,100 trucks cross into the UK from the continent to deliver some GBP 35 million worth of components to UK vehicle and engine plants – emphasising the importance of free and frictionless trade between Britain and Europe,"" the SMMT notes.
""Critical as this is, uninterrupted bilateral trade between the UK and other key global destinations must also continue. Some 15.7% of all UK car exports go to global destinations with which the UK enjoys mutually preferential trading arrangements as part of the EU,"" it said.
The data show that while the output for UK and overseas markets were down 16.3% and 7.3% respectively, export volumes remain near record high, with 8 in 10 cars produced for international customers.
As many as 1,237,608 cars were built for export in the year, highlighting the industry's export-led growth.
The figures show that demand for British-made cars grew substantially in a number of international markets, such as Japan (26.0%), South Korea (23.5%), Russia (10.3 %) and the US (5.3%).

253,2019-02-01,Tata Motors,"Maruti, Hyundai, Mahindra and Tata Motors report flat growth or decline in wholesalesMost of the passenger vehicle manufacturers still have substantial inventory with dealers

Passenger vehicle manufacturers took to a cautious approach while dispatching vehicles to the respective dealerships in January, as retail sales continue to decline due to subdued customer sentiment across the country. The top four passenger vehicles manufacturers – Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd , Mahindra and Mahindra ltd and Tata Motors Ltd – reported flat growth or decline in wholesales in order to balance the inventory at dealerships.
The wholesales of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd--country’s largest vehicle manufacture – increased by 1% year-on-year to 140,600 units, indicating that all is not well for the automotive industry. Hyundai also reported a marginal increase of 0.6% y-o-y to 45,803 units in its wholesale dispatches.
Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd also saw its sales increase by just 1% y-o-y to 23,872 units while Tata Motors saw volumes decline sharply by 11% y-o-y to 17,826 units.
Honda Cars India Ltd has been the only exception since its sales increased by a whopping 23% y-o-y to 18,261 units.
“The first month of the new calendar year continues to be on an overall growth path. There is buoyancy in rural growth, commodity costs are levelling, fuel prices are coming down and we see improvement in forex movement, which in turn will drive positive customer sentiment,"" said Rajan Wadhera, president, automotive sector, Mahindra and Mahindra.
Wholesales over the last two months have been under pressure since the automobile companies have been correcting the inventory piled up at dealerships since decline in customer sentiment resulted in worst retail sales in six year during the festival period of Navaratri and Diwali.
Most of the passenger vehicle manufacturers still have substantial inventory with dealers which will prevent them from pushing more wholesales on the dealers.
On the other hand, wholesales of commercial vehicles continue to decline as result of the liquidity crisis in non-banking financial corporations and introduction of the new truck axle norms which has increased the load carrying capacity of the vehicles.
Tata Motors Ltd--country’s largest commercial vehicle manufacturer--reported a staggering 9% y-o-y decline in sales to 11,694 units. Overall, sales of commercial vehicles also declined by 6% y-o-y to 37,089 units.
Ashok Leyland Ltd--country’s second largest commercial vehicle manufacturer--though reported a 13% increase in medium and heavy vehicle sales after double digit decline in the last two months.
“Domestic sales of commercial vehicles have dipped by 6% this month as compared to January 2018. The muted growth of the CV Industry is due to the low customer sentiments with the base effect also playing a role in the in H2 FY19 . Factors like higher interest rates and lagged effect of axle load norms continues to affect our MHCV segment with a drop of 9% in January 2019,"" said Girish Wagh, president, commercial vehicles, business unit, Tata Motors."
251,2019-02-05,Tata Motors,"Fitch said the review was prompted by uncertainty ahead of Brexit, which could lead to lower sales and higher costsJLR also plans to prune its workforce as it battles to return to profitability

Bengaluru: Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday it has placed the credit ratings of Britain's biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover under review for possible downgrades, citing increasing risks of a disorderly Brexit.
Jaguar Land Rover, owned by Tata Motors Ltd , had said in January that there would be a week-long pause in production in April due to potential disruption from Brexit and trimmed production.
""The group has a significant trade imbalance and production bias to the UK and could be significantly affected by trade barriers and various logistic issues,"" the credit rating agency said, placing JLR's long-term ratings and senior obligations at 'BB' on ""Watch Negative"".
Fitch said the review was prompted by uncertainty ahead of Brexit, which could lead to lower sales and higher costs that could strain the company's liquidity position.
Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal was rejected in parliament last month and the government is trying to make changes to win the support of lawmakers even as the divorce date for Britain's departure from the European Union looms less than two months away.
JLR, based in central England, is also planning to prune its workforce as it battles to return to profitability amid lower Chinese demand and a slump in European diesel sales.

252,2019-02-05,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors said zero unit of Nano was produced in January this year as against 83 units in the same month last yearThere were no sales of Nano in the domestic market last month as compared to 62 units in January 2018

NEW DELHI :
Amid speculation over the future of Tata Motors' Nano, the company in January did not produce nor sell even a single unit of the small car, which was once dubbed as the 'people's car'. Recently, company officials had hinted that production and sales of the Nano would stop from April 2020 as Tata Motors has no plans to invest further on Ratan Tata's dream car to meet strict emission norm under BS-VI and other upcoming safety regulations.
According to a regulatory filing, Tata Motors said zero unit of Nano was produced in January this year as against 83 units in the same month last year.
Similarly, there were no sales of Nano in the domestic market last month as compared to 62 units in January 2018.
In terms of exports, the company did not ship any unit of the model last month same as it was in the year-ago month.
When contacted, a Tata Motors spokesperson said, ""As mentioned before, the Nano in its current form will not meet the new safety and emission norms and may need infusion of fresh investments. ""No decision has been made yet in this regard. We continue to produce Nano catering to customer demands.""	The spokesperson further said decisions on product life cycle are a holistic view taken after considering the market developments, regulations and emerging competitive landscape and decisions are announced as and when they are taken.
""Production planning of a car is a conscious management of demand, system inventory and planned efficiencies. Therefore, speculating on the fate of a car based on a month's production figure is something the company would not like to participate in,"" the spokesperson added.
In June last year, the company produced just one unit of the Nano and sold three units in the domestic market. After that the company continued to produce Nano at its Sanand plant based on market demand and has insisted that it hasn't taken a decision on the future of Nano.
The Nano, which was unveiled in January 2008 at the Auto Expo with much expectations of being the people's car, could not live up to the billing. The car was launched in the market in March 2009 with an initial price of close to  ₹1 lakh for the basic model despite cost escalations, with Ratan Tata insisting that ""a promise is a promise"".
However, from the beginning, Nano courted trouble. It was originally planned to be rolled out from Tata Motors' proposed plant at Singur in West Bengal, where it faced intense political and farmer protests against land acquisition. The company had to shift its production to a new plant at Sanand in Gujarat. Instances of the car catching fire initially after it was launched didn't help its cause either.
Ratan Tata had admitted that the company made the mistake of promoting the Nano as 'the cheapest car'.
It became a loss-making model for Tata Motors with ex-Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry, who was abruptly removed from the post, even going on to claim that the Nano ""consistently lost value, peaking at  ₹1,000 crore"".
Mistry had also termed the Nano as one of the ""legacy hotspots"" and there was ""no line of sight to profitability for the Nano, any turnaround strategy"". He had also claimed that Tata Motors did not stop producing the car due to ""emotional reasons"".

250,2019-02-06,Tata Motors,"Firm plans to raise Rs. 25,000 crore, which means minority shareholders are expected to bring in nearly a billion dollarsTo start with, because of the drop in the share price, the dilution of Vodafone Idea’s current equity will be about 15% more

Vodafone Idea Ltd’s shares have fallen 27% since its promoters said in mid-November that they would contribute up to  ₹18,250 crore to its planned capital raise. That creates sizeable problems for the company, which later said that the route used for the fundraising would be a rights issue.
To start with, because of the drop in the share price, the dilution of Vodafone Idea’s current equity will be about 15% more compared to mid-November, when the company first talked of the fundraise. At current prices, the dilution in the equity may be as much as 100%.
In 2008, when Tata Motors Ltd tried to partly fund the Jaguar Land Rover acquisition through a rights issue, its shares had fallen heavily. The promoter, Tata Sons Ltd, had to eventually bail out the issue.
There are similar worries about Vodafone Idea’s issue among analysts. The company plans to raise  ₹25,000 crore in all, which means minority shareholders are expected to bring in nearly a billion dollars, alongside the massive $2.5 billion infusion by the promoters. For a stock that’s fallen to nearly a fourth of its levels from January last year, that’s a monumental ask. “There isn’t much appetite for fresh investments into the company, especially given the stock’s past performance and the state of the industry,"" says an analyst at a multinational brokerage firm. Note that Vodafone Group Plc itself hasn’t been open to making fresh investments into India; its subscription to the rights issue will reportedly be funded through a special purpose vehicle that is, in turn, raising funds by pledging its shares in the India assets.
In any case, Vodafone Idea’s promoters can’t follow the Tata Sons script, and lap up the entire unsubscribed part of the rights issue. This is because they aren’t very far from prescribed norms for minimum non-promoter shareholding. In fact, unless minority shareholders subscribe to shares worth at least  ₹5,000 crore, the promoters will breach the 75% mark for maximum promoter shareholding set by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). And if minority shareholders commit, say, only  ₹2,500 crore to the issue, that would mean Vodafone Idea’s promoters will be able to buy equity shares worth only  ₹11,000 crore or so, which is 40% lower than the amount they have earmarked.
Of course, given the precarious state the company is in on the indebtedness front, that’s an outcome they can ill-afford. Even after using generous assumptions on cost synergies, Vodafone Idea’s net debt to Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio will improve to only around 10 times. And with continued high cash burn each quarter, this metric keeps worsening. The company needs an equity infusion urgently and a large one at that.
In fact, this seems to be the reason Vodafone Idea is leaving nothing to chance with its rights issue and the company added that it also has the option of issuing compulsory convertible debentures in the rights offer. Such an instrument would be viewed as a debt security by Sebi, helping it steer clear of the prescribed shareholding norms. At the same time, rating agencies will treat it as a quasi-equity instrument, which will help improve its debt-equity ratio. In short, it will be the best of both worlds.
But what all of the above points to is the fact that Vodafone Idea is walking a tightrope. It’s an odd place to be when your competitors are gunning for you. The company’s one big hope was that tariffs will gradually increase because they are causing cash burn for all telcos—after all, how long can even a behemoth such as Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) tolerate high cash burn? But RIL’s solution to the cash burn problem doesn’t involve higher tariffs at its subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, at least for now. Jio is instead looking at asset sales to raise cash, it said recently.
This means Vodafone Idea’s predicament could continue, making it difficult for the company to defend market share. Some analysts have turned so sceptical about its prospects that they foresee it moving from a market leadership position to a distant third. Analysts at IIFL Institutional Equities, for instance, are working with a steady-state revenue market share of merely 10% for the company, with Reliance Jio expected to take the leadership position with a share of 51%. The brokerage firm expects Bharti Airtel Ltd to maintain its revenue share of 37%.
Of course, there are others who still think the three companies will have a similar market share. But for that to happen, Vodafone Idea needs to get off the tightrope and stand on firm ground."
249,2019-02-06,Tata Motors,"Trade barriers and logistic issues arising on a disorderly Brexit may impact on JLR's competitive positioningIt will take a ""few months"" to resolve the Rating Watch Negative as clarity emerges on outcome of Brexit negotiations

NEW DELHI :
Fitch Ratings Wednesday placed Tata Motors' rating on 'Rating Watch Negative' on increasing risks of a disorderly Brexit impacting its profits mainstay Jaguar Land Rover Automotive.
JLR, which accounts for the majority of the company's profit generation, has a significant production bias to the UK despite a reasonable degree of geographic diversification in its sales mix, the global rating agency said in a note.
Trade barriers and logistic issues arising on a disorderly Brexit may impact on JLR's competitive positioning, and lead to significantly lower sales and profitability and higher working-capital needs, it added.
Fitch has a long-term issuer default rating of 'BB' on Tata Motors. The rating action Wednesday follows similar view on JLR taken a day earlier.
Risks to JLR's business emanating from a disorderly Brexit will outweigh improving operating performance Tata Motors' domestic business, and lead to significantly lower cash generation and higher leverage than the rating case, it explained.
It will take a ""few months"" to resolve the Rating Watch Negative (RWN) as clarity emerges on outcome of Brexit negotiations and impact on Tata Motors, the agency said, warning that the rating can lead to a downgrade by at least one notch.
The Tata Motors scrip gained 1.51% to close at  ₹178.20 a piece on the BSE, as against a 0.98% surge in the benchmark.

Bengaluru: Tata Motors Ltd on Thursday posted a loss for the third-quarter, hurt by an impairment charge for its luxury car unit Jaguar Land Rover. The automaker's loss came at  ₹26,993 crore ($3.78 billion) for the three months ended 31 December, compared with a profit of  ₹1,199 crore in the year-ago period.
Revenue rose 5.8% to  ₹76,265 crore, the company said.
Troubles at the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) unit, which has been hit hard by US-China trade tensions, low demand for diesel cars in Europe and Brexit worries, had tipped Tata Motors into its first loss in three years in the quarter ended June 2018.
While Tata Motors has announced plans to turn around JLR, the slide in the unit's sales has continue for now.
The company took a non-cash charge of  ₹27,838 crore ($3.90 billion) to cover the impairment at JLR in the three months to 31 December. Changes in market conditions, especially in China, technology disruptions and rising cost of debt resulted in the charge.
""...Overall performance continued to be impacted by challenging market conditions in China. We continue to work closely with Chinese retailers to respond to current market conditions with a 'Pull' based approach to vehicle sales,"" JLR CEO Ralf Speth said in a statement on Thursday.
JLR said last month it would cut 10% of its workforce, mostly in its home market, as Britain's biggest carmaker responded to lower Chinese demand and a slump in European diesel sales.
Tata Motors has been facing a decline in sales in India as well.
Fitch Ratings said on Wednesday placed the credit rating of Tata Motors Ltd on negative watch, stating increasing risks for its British luxury car unit — Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) — over a potentially chaotic Brexit.
This comes after the ratings agency placed the credit ratings of JLR, Britain's biggest carmaker, under review for possible downgrades.

MUMBAI :
Tata Motors Ltd on Thursday forecast its UK unit Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) Automotive Plc. to incur an operating loss this fiscal year mainly because of continued muted demand in JLR’s single-largest market, China.
In the quarter ended 31 December, Tata Motors plunged to a consolidated loss of  ₹26,992.54 crore due to its biggest ever write-off of £3.1 billion ( ₹28,675 crore) for JLR. Tata Motors had a year-earlier net profit of  ₹1,214.60 crore.
Brexit-related worries and a global shift away from diesel cars both in Europe and North America along with the impact of China-US trade tariffs is also hurting the maker of Land Rover Discovery and Evoque sport-utility vehicles and Jaguar XE and XF cars.
“JLR’s margin level is likely to be marginally negative during FY19. China, one of our most profitable markets, is hurting us,"" Tata Motors’ group chief financial officer P.B. Balaji said in a conference call with reporters.
The surprise non-cash write-off has been attributed to slowing sales in China, technology disruptions linked to a shift towards eco-friendly hybrid and electric vehicles, and also the rising cost of debt. The step raises questions on whether it could affect Tata Motors’ credit rating that has already been revised downward in the recent past.
While JLR, which contributes two-thirds of the earnings at Tata Motors, surpassed the overall industry growth for premium passenger vehicles in the US, UK and Europe, it continued to face sustained weakness in demand in China amid slowing economic growth, Balaji said.
“We see a gradual improvement in China ahead, and expect our numbers stabilize and now we have to work on profitability for our dealers,"" Balaji said. Tata Motors consolidated revenue grew 4.4% in the December quarter to  ₹77,582.71 crore, from  ₹74,337.70 crore a year earlier.
The non-cash write-off is expected to result in annual savings of £300 million in depreciation and amortization costs for JLR, Balaji said adding “it is a right step taken in terms of reducing our cost, improving our break-even and ensuring our competitiveness.""
JLR’s sales, which has been contracting every month since July, fell 6.4% y-o-y in the December quarter to 144,600 vehicles.
Sales in China fell 47% y-o-y last quarter offsetting 21% and 18.4% increase in North America and the UK respectively.
According to Nitesh Sharma, an analyst at Phillip Capital, “we are concerned about the magnitude of equity erosion led by investment write off that could hurt debt covenants and lead to downgrades.""
JLR, the largest car maker in the UK, shut one of its plants there in October. To prepare for a scenario where there could be disruptions due to Brexit, JLR also plans to temporarily close plants in the UK from April this year.
“It is impossible for us to stock up production material to keep us going. From the end of first week of April, we have two and half weeks to three weeks of production shutdown that will happen, which will prepare us for the worst case scenario (regarding Brexit),"" Balaji said.
“We still believe that there will be a negotiated settlement sooner or later,"" Balaji added.
JLR is impacted by growing consumer preference for eco-friendly options such as hybrid and electric as diesel vehicles comprise about 90% of its sales in Europe.
Tata Motors’ profit for its Indian operations grew three-fold from the year earlier in the December quarter to  ₹618 crore. Stand-alone revenue grew 1.85% to  ₹16,477 crore.

The RBI is expected to cut interest rates again next quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists, with a slim majority forecasting policy easing to occur before the general election in May. A Reuters snap poll taken immediately after Thursday's policy review - where the RBI unexpectedly reduced interest rates by 25 basis points - showed the central bank will make the same move next quarter. That would take the RBI's repo rate to 6.00 percent, its lowest since the middle of last year.

Shares of Tata Motors Ltd plunged as much as 30%, its maximum single day fall since February 1993, as many brokerages have downgraded the stock and cut its target price after the company posted a biggest loss in India’s corporate history due to an impairment charge for its luxury car unit Jaguar Land Rover.
The stock fell 29.45%, its biggest slump since 3 February 1993 on intraday basis and touched a low of  ₹141.90 a share. In last one year it has dropped 51%. The stock ended at  ₹151.30, down 17.28% or  ₹31.60 on the BSE.
Tata Motors reported a consolidated loss of  ₹26992.54 crore due to its biggest ever write off of GBP3.10 billion for JLR. The write-off has been attributed to slowing sales in China, technology disruptions linked to a shift towards eco-friendly hybrid and electric vehicles, and also the rising cost of debt. Last time, Indian Oil Corp for June 2012 quarter reported a loss of  ₹22450 crore.
Tata Motors consolidated revenue grew 4.4% in the December quarter to  ₹77,582.71 crore, from ₹74,337.70 crore a year earlier. JLR’s sales, which has been contracting every month since July, fell 6.4% y-o-y in the December quarter to 144,600 vehicles. Sales in China fell 47% y-o-y last quarter offsetting 21% and 18.4% increase in North America and the UK respectively
JLR faces headwinds such as China slowdown and Brexit uncertainties. Weak demand persists in China, and market share losses could continue for JLR, due to structural issues in the distribution network and rising competitive intensity, analyst expects. Moreover, Brexit can have negative implications, due to tariffs and change in manufacturing/sourcing strategies.
“We remain concerned over near-term volume pressures especially in China (management targets to reduce inventory to 1.5 month) which will lead to further de-stocking in Q4FY19 (which was expected to be complete by Q3). Post that focus would remain on Brexit and uncertainties if at all there is a no-Brexit deal. Management’s margin guidance does not factor in a no-deal Brexit"", said Elara Capital in a 8 February note. The brokerage firm has downgraded the stock to accumulate from buy earlier with a target price to  ₹195 from  ₹236 a share.
Its standalone operations grew three-fold from the year earlier in the December quarter to  ₹618 crore. Stand-alone revenue grew 1.85% to  ₹16,477 crore.
JLR’s EBITDA margin contracted steeply, by 350 basis points year on year to 7.3% mainly due to lower volumes in China, higher warranty costs, and destocking expenses. In comparison, standalone margin expanded 80 basis points year on year to 8.1%, due to a turnaround in the passenger vehicle division.
Brokerage firm Emkay has downgraded Tata Motors rating to Hold from Buy with a revised target price of  ₹192 a share from  ₹256 a share. “Despite the cost-reduction efforts, free cash flows are expected to remain negative over FY19-21, due to the large capex requirements of JLR"", Emkay Global added in its recent report.

244,2019-02-09,Tata Motors,"JLR needs to raise $1 billion within 14 months to replace maturing bonds JLR likely to increase receivables facility or turn to further options, including leasing assets and tapping export credit

London: Jaguar Land Rover, reeling from a $4 billion writedown, a slump in China sales and uncertainty around Brexit, said conditions aren’t right for it to borrow from the bond market and that it’s seeking alternative funding.
The luxury automaker needs to raise $1 billion within 14 months to replace maturing bonds, while feeding an investment programme for electric cars that’s burning through cash. To support its needs, JLR could increase a receivables facility or turn to other bank financing, with further options including leasing assets and tapping export credit, Treasurer Ben Birgbauer said in an interview.
JLR’s owner Tata Motors Ltd. shocked investors Thursday when it revealed the extent of the problems its UK arm is having in China. Sales of Jaguar sports cars and Land Rover SUVs dropped 35% in the world’s biggest auto market in the nine months to 31 December, sending the unit to a 273 million-pound ($354 million) loss and knocking as much as 30% off Tata stock.
“Market conditions presently are less favorable in general and our bonds are trading below par, reflecting our recent financial performance,"" Birgbauer said by telephone. “We have always said we monitor the debt market and look to issue debt when market conditions are more favorable.""
Britain’s biggest carmaker is slashing 4,500 jobs, or about 10% of the workforce, as it responds to slowing sales. That’s on top of the 1,500 people who left the company in 2018. The measures will trigger a one-off charge of 200 million pounds in the current quarter.
JLR’s 4.5% bonds maturing Jan. 2026 have dropped to a low of 77 cents on the euro, equivalent to a yield of about 8.9%, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.
The company is not planning to change its preference for unsecured financing, Birgbauer said. Remaining resources include a 1.9 billion-pound undrawn credit facility and 2.5 billion pounds of cash, based on the quarterly numbers published by Tata.
Dealer crisis
One major problem facing JLR in China is an ineffective dealer network, according to a presentation from the UK business. Only 18% of outlets are in so-called tier-one cities like Shanghai and Beijing, and more than one-third have been open for three years or less.
The company now plans to overhaul the operation, cutting back on deliveries to reduce stock and investing in measures to boost its brand, logo and slogans.
Executives said on a conference call with investors that it’s not possible to predict when China volumes will begin to recover, highlighting international trade tensions and how much stimulus the state chooses to provide as determining factors. JLR says it can still grow global sales in fiscal 2020 with the help of other markets and the launch of revamped Range Rover Evoque.
Prior to this week concerns about JLR’s performance had centered on the impact of Brexit and a government clampdown on diesel-powered vehicles in depressing UK car sales.
Royal London Asset Management had already reduced its exposure to JLR in response to “Brexit-specific risks and their ability to maintain access to the financial markets,"" said head of global high yield Azhar Hussain.
Appetite among investors for riskier European debt has yet to bounce back after volatility swept through the market at the end of last year. There’s been very few sales of junk debt in Europe this year and high-yield spreads remain much wider than prior to their fourth-quarter blowout.

KOLKATA :
 After bagging 255 e-buses' orders from six state transport undertakings (STUs) under the first phase of incentive scheme for electric vehicles in public transport, Tata Motors is betting big on the segment, said an official here on Wednesday.
""There are many towns and cities that are tendering for e-buses. We are participating in them. We are hopeful the demand (for electric buses) will grow. As of now, we are participating in bids for 1,000 buses, tendered by various STUs. We do not know how much we will win,"" said Rohit Srivastava, Product Line Head (passenger commercial vehicles).
The company is in discussions with all states and is confident that electrification of buses will get a boost. The auto maker is also in touch with companies as the demand in the segment is likely to increase.
Under the first round of FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric) vehicles scheme, announced by the Centre, the company won around 60 per cent of the orders. It has tenders to supply 255 electric buses to six state STUs -- WBTC (West Bengal), LCSTL (Lucknow), AICTSL (Indore), ASTC (Guwahati), J&KSRTC (Jammu) and JCTSL (Jaipur).
Kolkata's order of 80 buses was the biggest it has bagged so far, he said, adding the company received orders for 40 busses each from J&K, Indore, Lucknow, Jaipur, and 15 buses from Guwahati, Assam.
Remarking that the company has supplied 20 buses, he said in 60-90 days it would supply the rest 60 buses to the WBTC.
Manufactured at the Dharwad plant in Karnataka, the electric buses of Tata Motors can travel up to 150 km on single charge.
""We have seen growth in the past. We are developing products to address the segments where we may be having a gap,"" Srivastava said.
The auto major has 45 per cent market share in buses and plans to increase it. The company is also working on developing complete range, including electric mini buses."

According to ANI, the Indian Air Force’s Mirage 2000 fighter jets bombed Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa area at 0330 IST. The attack comes 12 days after a bomber belonging to Pakistani terrorist organization Jaish-e-Mohammad killed 40 jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force. As per reports, the terror launch pads of the banned outfit were completely destroyed in the attack.
The Indian jets are reported to have returned safely without there being any casualty. Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale told mediapersons that civilian casualties were avoided, adding that the Indian side had information that the JeM planned more attacks and hence this response had become unavoidable.
The strike assumes significance because this is the first time India has used its air force for a pre-emptive strike inside Pakistan.

Tata Motors Ltd on Friday denied media reports that it was exploring options for its ailing luxury car unit Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc.
Two media reports said the company was considering options including a minority stake sale in the JLR unit or finding a venture partner that would jointly develop vehicles and lower costs.
The reports of a potential stake sale drove Tata Motors shares up as much as 3.7 % to 184 rupees. The stock pared some of the gains and ended up 1.6%.
""There is no truth to the rumours that Tata Motors is looking to divest its stake in JLR,"" a Tata Motors spokesperson told Reuters.
Tata Motors posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss in Indian corporate history of about $4 billion last month, hurt by slumping China sales.
The company also warned the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) unit, which brings in most of its revenue, would swing to an operating loss in the year to March versus an earlier projection for breakeven, given weak sales at the luxury British carmaker.
The company may prefer to keep control of JLR, and rather seek fresh equity from investors, BloombergQuint said citing a Bloomberg report.

MUMBAI :
Tata Group, India’s biggest conglomerate, is exploring strategic options for its Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc unit including a potential stake sale in the struggling luxury carmaker, people familiar with the matter said.
Tata is considering alternatives ranging from a minority stake sale to finding a venture partner that would jointly develop vehicles and lower costs, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. The company is holding early-stage talks with potential advisers, and the deliberations may not lead to any transaction, they said.
The company would be reluctant to give up control of what was once its crown jewel, and it may prefer to seek fresh equity from investors such as a strategic partner or sovereign wealth fund, some of the people said. The Indian conglomerate’s Mumbai-listed automotive arm, Tata Motors Ltd., currently owns 100 percent of Jaguar Land Rover.
“There is no truth to the rumors that Tata Motors is looking to divest its stake in JLR, and we would not like to comment further on any market speculation,"" Tata Group said in an emailed statement. A spokeswoman for Jaguar Land Rover declined to comment on Tata’s intentions for the business.
Tata Motors’ shares surged as much as 3.7% and were trading at  ₹182, up 2.7% at 2:35 pm in Mumbai.
Jaguar Land Rover has hit several roadblocks in the past few months, prompting Tata Motors to write down the value of the business by 3.1 billion pounds ($4.1 billion). Sales in China have slumped, and Jaguar Land Rover said in January it will cut 10 percent of its workers amid flagging demand and uncertainty around Brexit.
“The U.K. stays the most important market for JLR and that market has a lot of problems due to Brexit,"" Deepesh Rathore, London-based director at Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors. “With so many headwinds, JLR needs massive investments to prepare and ride the next upturn of the market.""
Jaguar Land Rover said last month it was seeking alternative funding sources as conditions were not right to borrow from the bond market. The maker of the Jaguar XE sedan and Land Rover Discovery sport utility vehicle needs to raise $1 billion in 14 months to replace maturing bonds and is also burning cash on an investment program for electric cars.
Tata Motors bought the brands from Ford Motor Co. more than a decade ago for $2.3 billion in its biggest-ever acquisition. The company has considered listing a stake in Jaguar Land Rover in previous years, people familiar with the matter have said. Moody’s Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings all have a negative credit outlook on Tata Motors for risks related to the U.K. business.
Land Rover still ranks as the most valuable of the marquee brands owned by Tata Group, which also controls Tetley tea and New York’s luxury Pierre hotel. The automotive marque was worth an estimated $6.2 billion last year, according to Interbrand.

New Delhi: Wholesale despatches of automobiles across segments remained subdued in February as vehicle manufacturers cut production amid a slump in overall economic activity. Auto sales of major manufacturers were almost flat or declined in February while those of commercial vehicles fell because of a lack of credit and new axle norms.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest passenger vehicle manufacturer, reported a 0.9% year-on-year growth in sales to 136,912 units. This is the third straight month in which the Maruti Suzuki’s vehicle production growth has stayed flat.
Mumbai-based Tata Motors Ltd also reported a meagre 2% year-on-year increase in sales to 18,110 units, while Honda Cars India Ltd reported a 16% y-o-y growth in dispatches to 13,527 units, but from a very low base. Toyota Kirloskar Motor India Ltd also reported a 0.87% decline in sales to 11,760 units during the month.
Among the top four passenger vehicle manufacturers, only Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd managed to grow vehicle dispatches by double digits as sales grew by 17% to 26,109 units because of the launch of its new compact utility vehicle XUV300.
“The month of February has augured well for Mahindra as we have witnessed a strong double digit growth of 16% in our utility vehicle portfolio, on the back of our newly launched XUV300 model. Further, the overall growth for the month has been around 10%. On a year-to-date basis too, we have shown a strong growth of 12% at an overall level,"" said Rajan Wadhera, president (automotive business) at Mahindra.
“Passenger vehicle sales remained muted in February 2019. Given high discounts and several new launches in the recent months, there are some signs of recovery at the dealership level. However, full recovery is still some time away. With the country entering an election phase, consumer sentiment will continue to remain cautious in the near term, which will weigh on the passenger vehicle demand,"" said Ashish Modani, assistant vice president, corporate sector ratings, Icra Ltd.
In the commercial vehicle segment, sales continue to remain muted as financing options remain limited for fleet owners, after the liquidity crisis in non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and the introduction of new axle norms for heavy and medium trucks.
The biggest commercial vehicle manufacturer in the country, Tata Motors, reported a 5% drop in sales to 39,111 units, while Ashok Leyland Ltd , the second largest manufacturer, saw volumes increase by just 1% to 17,352 units.
The medium and heavy truck sales of Tata Motors decreased significantly by 18% year-on-year to 12,437 units, while for Ashok Leyland it fell by 2% year-on-year to 12,874 units during the month.
“The market continues to exhibit subdued demand on the back of high interest rates, lagged effect of the implementation of revised axle load norms, and slowing economic activity, resulting in a decline of 5% in commercial vehicle sales volume,"" said Girish Wagh, president, commercial vehicle business unit, Tata Motors Ltd.
“The MHCV (medium and heavy commercial vehicles) segment has declined by 18%. However, our new product introductions with increased axle load norms is gaining traction as customers are seeing the clear advantages of the superior operating economics,"" he added.
In two-wheelers, premium motorcycle manufacturer, Royal Enfield saw a massive 16% drop in domestic sales to 60,066 units."
234,2019-03-02,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors, whose shares fell 60% last year, posted a record loss of  ₹27,000 crore in the December quarter, as the UK unit struggledShipments have collapsed in China, plunging 35% in the nine months to 31 December

Hong Kong: The purchase of the storied Jaguar and Land Rover auto brands in 2008 handed India’s Tata Group a challenge that had long frustrated Ford Motor Co., the British marques’ previous owner: How to eke out a profit.
For a while, Tata seemed to have found the answer. Within a couple of years of the acquisition, Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc was making money. Its Range Rover Evoque, a compact SUV with a distinctive crunched rear roof, was a runaway hit — so much so that the former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham got involved in a special edition. The Evoque powered JLR’s profits for years, accounting for most of parent Tata Motors Ltd.’s earnings in the first half of the decade. The company’s market value soared above $29 billion in 2015.
Then China’s slowdown hit sales in what was once the carmaker’s most important market; the UK voted to break away from the European Union; and India’s biggest conglomerate was wracked by a power struggle as Ratan Tata fired his handpicked successor. JLR was also slow to reduce its reliance on diesel vehicles in Europe. The outlook is now so dire that Tata executives are said to be exploring the possibility of selling part of the luxury-car unit.
“JLR faces all these challenges and more, as it is the smallest of the mainstream luxury carmakers, barring Volvo,"" said Deepesh Rathore, London-based director at Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors. Sweden’s Volvo Cars is owned by China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.
Tata Motors said on Friday there was 'no truth to the rumors' that it’s looking to sell its JLR stake, and declined to comment further.
Record loss
Tata Motors, whose shares fell 60% last year, posted a record loss of  ₹27,000 crore ($3.8 billion) in the December quarter, the biggest for an Indian company, as the British unit struggled. Shipments have collapsed in China, plunging 35% in the nine months to 31 December. The company is eliminating 4,500 jobs, or about 10% of its global workforce, and on 7 February took investors aback with a plan to write down its JLR investment by $3.9 billion.
JLR, which also makes the Jaguar XE sedan and the Land Rover Discovery SUV, needs to raise $1 billion in just over a year to replace maturing bonds — a bigger challenge after S&P Global Ratings downgraded the unit in December for the second time in five months. That pushed the company’s debt deeper into S&P’s junk category.
Quality problems have weighed on both marques: A J.D. Power survey of 31 brands in June 2018 put them in the bottom two slots. Jaguar had 148 problems per 100 vehicles and Land Rover racked up a dizzying 160. Top-ranked Genesis, the luxury brand of Hyundai Motor Co., had 68.
Quality issues have added to JLR’s troubles in China, where the company had multiple recalls, said John Zeng, managing director of LMC Automotive Shanghai.
“This has greatly jeopardized Chinese consumers’ confidence in the brand value,"" said Zeng. JLR’s “quality control capability and its after-sales network are not good enough to support its volume expansion or help it compete with rivals.""
The marques were therefore especially vulnerable to China’s slowdown. The world’s largest auto market shrank about 4 percent last year, the first such decline since the early 1990s.
As JLR struggles to restructure in China, it risks falling further behind German rivals. Competition is likely to increase “as German car brands such as Mercedes, BMW and Audi build more vehicles in the country,"" Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Steve Man and Kevin Kim wrote on 8 February.
Turmoil back in Mumbai hasn’t helped. A few years after retiring, Ratan Tata in 2016 ousted his successor Cyrus Mistry as chairman of Tata Sons, the group’s holding company. That followed a feud over Mistry’s plan to shed assets and his opposition to the world’s cheapest car, the egg-shaped Nano, among other things.
Land Rover still ranks as the most valuable of the major brands owned by Tata Group, which also controls Tetley tea and New York’s luxury Pierre hotel. The automotive marque was worth an estimated $6.2 billion last year, according to Interbrand.

233,2019-03-05,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors shares have continued their rebound since hitting a 52-week low last monthOther auto stocks were also higher today

Shares of Tata Motors surged as much as 10%to  ₹198, continuing their recovery since hitting a 52-week low of  ₹141.90 last month. Tata Motors shares had hit a 52-week low of  ₹129 on 8 February, 2019, on NSE, and from that level they have rebounded over 50%.
Other auto stocks were also in the limelight today. Ashok Leyland, Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors and TVS Motors were up between 2% and 3%. Automobile stocks have underperformed the broader markets in recent months amid a sales slowdown.
On 8 February, Tata Motors shares had tumbled nearly 18% after the automobile maker reported the biggest quarterly loss in India’s corporate history. Tata Motors turned in a third-quarter loss of  ₹26,993 crore, mostly due to a massive impairment at Jaguar Land Rover subsidiary. Analysts were expecting a profit.
Last week, media reports, citing sources, had said Tata Motors was considering options, including a minority stake sale in the JLR unit or finding a partner that would jointly develop vehicles and lower costs. However, the automobile maker later denied reports of a stake sale in the JLR unit.
""There is no truth to the rumours that Tata Motors is looking to divest its stake in JLR and we would not like to comment further on any market speculation,"" the company said in a communication to the stock exchanges on March 1.
Tata Motors reported a 3% decline in domestic sales to 57,221 vehicles in February 2019 as compared with 58,993 vehicles in the same month a year ago. However, the company's passenger vehicle sales in the domestic market increased 2% to 18,110 last month, compared with 17,771 in the year-ago period.
The company said its commercial vehicle sales in the domestic market stood at 39,111 in February, down 5% from 41,222 in the same month of 2018.
In noon trade, Tata Motors shares had pared some intraday gains and were trading at  ₹194.65, up 8%, outperforming Sensex which was up 0.20%. (With Agency Inputs)"
232,2019-03-06,Tata Motors,"Had holding company Tata Sons been a publicly traded firm, it could have raised equity relatively easily to help tide JLR over

India’s Tata Group should treat the speed bump at Jaguar Land Rover as a timely memo: the $102 billion salt-to-software conglomerate can no longer put off listing its closely held parent.
UK-based Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc is burning cash on electric-vehicle technology just as the double whammy of a Chinese auto slowdown and Brexit threatens margins and sales. At average cash burn rates of £670 million ($882 million) a quarter, the British carmaker may struggle to make it through another year, my colleague Anjani Trivedi wrote last month after it took an asset impairment charge of £3.1 billion.
Had holding company Tata Sons Ltd been a publicly traded firm, it could have raised equity relatively easily to help tide JLR over.
Instead, Tata Motors Ltd, which acquired JLR in 2008, is exploring strategic options including a sale of a stake in the UK unit, Bloomberg News reported. Although Tata Motors says there’s “no truth to the rumours"", the bond market was a little relieved.
Investors’ concerns haven’t fully dissipated, and that shows the problem with the sprawling Tata Group’s structure. In the current scheme of things, the holding company and its 66% owners—who happen to be charitable trusts—depend on payouts from software services provider Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) as well as JLR to keep the empire ticking.
The insufficiency of those dividends became a sore point in a 2016 boardroom battle between patriarch Ratan Tata and chairman Cyrus Mistry, who was abruptly ousted after less than four years. Borrowing on the strength of operating companies’ cash flows has a limit. Next year will see a record $17.5 billion of debt mature, according to bonds and loans data compiled by Bloomberg. The conglomerate must step up investment in order to generate more free cash.
Last year’s $5 billion purchase of bankrupt Bhushan Steel Ltd, which supplies metal to auto and appliance makers, is a step in that direction. The move helps group boss Natarajan Chandrasekaran cut Tata Steel Ltd’s reliance on a less-than-rewarding construction industry.
Still, it’s JLR that should worry him. JLR has avoided investing in entry-level crossovers—which account for a quarter of sales at rivals BMW AG and Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz—because of its expensive focus on electric vehicles, as Deepesh Rathore, analyst at Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors, said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
Demand isn’t collapsing. Global auto sales have been growing very slowly for two years at least. Short-term volatility aside, that may not change unless income growth is disrupted, says Jonathan Wilmot, global strategist at Aletheia Capital. Even so, with potential buyers waiting for electric cars to mature, the opportunity to list JLR has been lost for the moment.
When I suggested a Jaguar Land Rover IPO in Hong Kong or London, Chandra, as he’s known, had just been named Tata Sons’ chairman. Two years on, however, it may be better to float the parent. In his recent book, Mukund Rajan, who formerly oversaw brands across the group, estimates the value of the Tata Sons assets owned by the philanthropic trusts at $80 billion to $90 billion. If the trustees sold $10 billion to the public, the offer would almost equal India’s three biggest IPOs combined. The market wouldn’t be able to digest it.
But Hong Kong could. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) might have to tweak its rules and allow Tata Sons to go overseas. The trusts could then plow the proceeds back into Tata Sons as 20-year redeemable preference shares, which is what they used to do before they prematurely liquidated them over disagreements with ex-chairman Mistry’s dividend policy.
Preferred shares would give the charities assured dividends to carry on with their social mission; Tata Sons would get liquidity to pay down debt, especially at Jaguar Land Rover; the marquee British automaker would get time to shore up its product portfolio; and the Tata Group would have a stronger hold over the (tarnished) jewel in its crown. Meanwhile, a bitter legal battle with the Mistry family, which can’t freely sell its 18 percent stake, might end if Tata Sons bought back the shares at fair market value. And Hong Kong would snag its biggest IPO since insurer AIA Group Ltd.’s 2010 float.
It’s time Chandra put an IPO plan into top gear.

231,2019-03-06,Tata Motors,"Titan’s present market cap at  ₹90,000 crore outweighs that of revenue giants like Tata Steel & Motors

In a $110 billion group, comprising 30 companies scattered across such diverse areas as steel and software, who would have thought that a small watch company would emerge as the second largest in terms of market capitalization and the fastest growing over the last three years?
Yet, this week, as a Business Standard story pointed out on Monday, Titan’s market cap scaled  ₹90,000 crore, well below that of software heavyweight Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), but nearly 60% more than that of revenue giants Tata Steel and Tata Motors.
Titan’s success is the story of steady and sterling leadership by two men, Xerxes Desai and Bhaskar Bhat, who helmed the company for all its 34 years in business. Desai, the man who wanted to be an Oxford don but came back at J.R.D. Tata’s bidding to set up a watch company, presided over the company’s first decade and a half of growth, in which time it established itself as India’s leading watch brand. Under Desai, the humble watch—till then symbolized by public sector entity HMT’s mechanical products or imports from abroad—became a fashion statement, a symbol of class best exemplified by its signature tune, an excerpt from Mozart’s 25th Symphony, personally picked by Desai.
However, by the end of the last century, as the watch business slowed, the company’s diversification into the jewellery business in 1995 was weighing heavily on its overall performance, already dragged down by debts following an ill-advised blitz into several European markets.
Enter Bhaskar Bhat as managing director in 2002. Tasked with engineering a turnaround of sorts, he faced a baptism by fire as a large-scale layoff was followed by a lockout at the company’s plant. After dousing those early fires, Bhat proceeded to execute a well-honed strategy of entering unorganized segments of the Indian market and gentrifying them. With this came crafted watches, jewellery, youth accessories such as bags and belts, eyecare products and, later, fragrances and saris.
The results have been spectacular. Titan is today one of the two jewels in the Tata crown. And, therein lies the problem, since its continuing success casts a questioning shadow over many of the other companies that are a part of India’s largest conglomerate and have, for years, been sucking up resources without really delivering results.
The conglomerate model, as rolled out by the likes of Harold Geneen and Jack Welch, was a consequence of the low interest rate regimes in the US following the Second World War, which in turn, helped finance a spate of leveraged buyouts. Conglomerates made sense till such time as capital markets lacked the depth and sophistication needed to back businesses at various stages of evolution and growth. They lost steam once those markets evolved to serve all comers.
Through the 1960s, Geneen made hundreds of acquisitions across a diverse collection of businesses ranging from telegraph equipment to insurance and hotels, to build International Telephone and Telegraph Corp., the company he headed, into a $17 billion conglomerate by 1970. Today, some four decades later, all that remains of that diversified portfolio colossus is a $2.5 billion business making specialty components for the aerospace, transportation, energy and industrial markets.
By the 1990s, most US corporations had come around to reaffirming their faith in specialization and focus, prompted in large measure by the teachings of management gurus like the late Coimbatore Krishnarao Prahalad, who in 1990 co-authored an article for the Harvard Business Review titled The Core Competence Of The Corporation, in which he urged executives to identify their organization’s core competencies that could foster growth.
It wasn’t as if the conglomerate idea fell off the cliff overnight. A 1994 study showed that for each of the years 1985, 1989 and 1992, over two-thirds of the Fortune 500 companies were active in at least five distinct lines of business.
Late last year, United Technologies, one of the best known industrial conglomerates after its acquisition of Otis Elevator in 1976 and Carrier Refrigeration in 1979, announced that it would spin off both those divisions into separate companies and focus on its core aerospace business.
This, coupled with the struggles of General Electric—once the world’s largest industrial conglomerate—as it looks to sell off pieces of its operations indicates that the era of conglomerates seems to have ended in the US.
In India though, conglomerates still rule the roost, accounting for nearly 50% of the corporate sector’s revenues. Yet, the success of focused companies in newer businesses such as IT, telecom, banking, auto, aviation and e-commerce shows that the conglomerate premium may be declining even in India. A study by Bain and Co. last year concluded: “Conglomerates in India and Southeast Asia no longer hold an advantage in total shareholder returns over pure plays and have begun to underperform in revenue growth and margin improvement.""
Significantly, the study’s list of conglomerates in the region that have continued to thrive despite the odds had a number of Indian groups, including Bajaj, Wadia, Murugappa, Lalbhai, Godrej, Emami and Torrent, but not Tata.

MUMBAI :
India’s investment banking industry has matured a lot since 1971 when Nimesh Kampani, one of India’s top investment bankers, began his career and managed the initial share sale of Andhra Steel Corp. Ltd, a company founded by the family of Lakshmi Mittal, who now controls the world’s largest steel maker.
“The size of public issues those days was less than one crore and there were no investment banks. Only brokers,"" said Kampani, chairman of JM Financial Group, on the first day of the Mint India Investment Summit 2019. Kampani was awarded the Mint India Investment Summit Hall of Fame award for his outstanding contribution to the investment banking industry in India.
The country’s stock market capitalization has grown from a paltry  ₹5,000 crore in the 1980s to around $2 trillion today, said Kampani, who founded JM Financial.
“In 1980, we did the convertible bond market issuance for Tata Motors, then known as Telco. This opened up the capital markets. I am proud that we were one of the firms that helped create investment banking and capital markets in India,"" Kampani said.
There is a lot to learn from the markets because “Mr Market is always right. We can only follow the market,"" he said.
Over the years, JM Financial has been in the midst of various consolidation waves in industries such as cement and telecom in the 1990s and 2000s, he said.
Today, technology plays a vital role in the markets, said Kampani, adding technology will change the face of the domestic market in the coming years. The first edition of the Mint India Investment Summit held on 28 February and 1 March in Mumbai, also saw Mint celebrate the best deals that India witnessed in 2018 across private equity, M&A and venture capital."
229,2019-03-08,Tata Motors,"Truck sales at Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland and Eicher Motors fell 18.2%, 3.2% and 0.4%, respectively in FebuaryAnalysts expect contraction in truck sales, which started due to new axle-load norms, to continue for two more quarters

If yield expectations on any investment avenue are on the decline, investors are likely to stay away. The same logic applies to truck rentals and truck sales. Truck rentals, one of the key indicators of future truck sales, fell 3% on key routes in February. This makes it the fourth straight month of decline, making the outlook for medium and heavy commercial vehicle sales appear dim.
Truck sales have been falling. In February, Tata Motors Ltd, the largest truckmaker in the country, reported an 18.2% year-on-year drop in local truck sales, while that of Ashok Leyland Ltd fell by 3.2%. Eicher Motors Ltd’s sales in the segment contracted too, albeit marginally by 0.4%.
Ashok Leyland’s inventory is at 15-20 days and Tata Motors’ at 25-30 days, HDFC Securities Ltd said in a note, citing dealer reports.
The turning point from heady double-digit growth came after new axle-load norms came into effect. “Trucking capacity in the country increased by 20% post the revised axle-load norms as the new norms legally allowed trucks to carry more load,"" said Bharat Gianani, analyst at Sharekhan Ltd.
The aim was to reduce the logistics cost and prevent overloading. The collateral damage, however, has been a drop in truck sales.
What has also added to the woes of truck manufacturers is the subdued movement of goods in the last few months. There has been a 10-15% reduction in movement of food and farm produce supplies to wholesale markets in February, according to the Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training. Factory dispatches, especially from small and medium enterprises (SMEs), also declined.
The question is whether the situation will improve and give a leg-up to truck rentals and sales. For now, rural distress is likely to cause more pain. After all, farm income is down to a 14-year low and with the central bank also spelling out deceleration in rural wages, this can cause a slowdown in consumption.
The situation is unlikely to improve in manufacturing and in the private sector in a hurry. Capital expenditure (capex) is down and gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 6.6% in the December quarter was the lowest in five quarters. Mining sector activity, another determinant of truck sales, is not encouraging either. If anything, government infrastructure activity is the only big lifeline for trucking activity and truck sales at present.
Also read: Indian economy is losing momentum, data shows
The fallout of weak truck rentals amid rising fuel prices is that it may lead to higher loan delinquencies. This can have a spillover effect on sales as well.
Truck sales are trending lower, with northern and western markets worse off compared to the south. Shares of Ashok Leyland, which gets most of its revenue from truck sales, have fallen hard before inching up in the last few trading sessions.
Analysts expect the contraction in truck sales to continue for another two quarters. “We expect recovery only in Q3FY20, which will be triggered by some buying ahead of the BS-VI norms that will be effective from 1 April 2020. These norms will lead to a significant increase in overall truck costs and owners may buy trucks earlier to circumvent the increase in prices,"" said Gianani of Sharekhan."

226,2019-03-14,Tata Motors,"Jaguar Land Rover will contact the owners of the affected vehicles to arrange for free-of-charge repairsThe repairs could include software updates as well as physical alterations

LONDON :
Tata Motors owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has initiated a voluntary recall of around 44,000 cars in the UK over higher than certified levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.
The UK-based luxury car-maker said on Thursday that it will contact the owners of the affected vehicles to arrange for free-of-charge repairs after regulators found 10 models were emitting more of the greenhouse gas than they had been certified to emit.
""Jaguar Land Rover is conducting a voluntary recall following the identification of CO2 performance variability with certain Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles fitted with 2.0L diesel or petrol engines,"" a JLR statement said.
""Affected vehicles will be repaired free of charge and every effort will be made to minimise inconvenience to the customer during the short time required for the work to be carried out,"" the statement noted.
The repairs could include software updates as well as physical alterations, with some Range Rover Evoque models possibly requiring new tyres.
The UK’s Vehicle Certification Agency found 10 models for the Land Rover and Jaguar brands were emitting more greenhouse gases than had been certified initially. JLR then informed the country’s Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA), which handles recalls, of the findings.
The recall will affect versions of the Land Rover Discovery, Discovery Sport, Range Rover Sport, Velar and Evoque made between 2016 and 2019. Jaguar models affected include the E-Pace, F-Pace, F-Type, XE and XF. While most affected models run on petrol, some diesel models are also part of the recall.
The European Commission’s rapid alert system warned that JLR’s cars ""may emit excessive levels of CO2 and may not conform with the certified condition"".
All European vehicle manufacturers are under pressure to reduce the average emissions of their new cars from 118.5g of CO2 per kilometre to less than 95g by 2021.
While the recall is not expected to have a major financial impact on the company, it comes at a time when Britain’s largest carmaker has already been battling Brexit-related headwinds for the automotive industry. Earlier this year, it had confirmed job cuts of around 4,500 amid sluggish global sales.
JLR has the largest number of retailers for its cars in Europe, with around 800 outlets across 42 countries. Its CEO, Ralf Speth, has repeatedly warned the UK government against a “bad Brexit deal"", which could cost the company billions per year.

Mumbai: The Bombay High Court on Monday stayed till 27 March the proceedings before a magistrate court in a 2016 criminal defamation case filed by Nusli Wadia against Ratan Tata and some other directors of Tata Sons.
A single bench of Justice Mridula Bhatkar stayed the proceedings through an interim order.
Justice Bhatkar will now hear a petition filed by Tata and other directors of Tata Sons seeking to quash the defamation case against them on 27 March.
Therefore, Justice Bhatkar directed the magistrate's court to refrain from proceeding with the hearing on the defamation case until then.
In December 2018, the magistrate court had issued notices to Ratan Tata and other directors of Tata Sons in the criminal defamation case filed by Wadia and then posted the matter for further hearing on March 25, 2019.
Wadia had filed the case in 2016 after he was voted out of the boards of some Tata Group companies.
Wadia had claimed that Tata and the others had made defamatory statements against him after they removed Cyrus Mistry on 24 October 2016 as the group chairman of Tata Sons.
Wadia was on boards as independent director of group companies such as Indian Hotels Company that runs the Taj group of hotels, TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, among others.
He was voted out by shareholders at a specially convened general meeting between December 2016 and February 2017.
He said he approached the magistrate's court as he was not satisfied with the explanation the respondents (Tata and others) had given him following his letters to them.
He therefore initiated defamation proceedings against the respondents under Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code.
Wadia is represented in the high court by advocate Abad Ponda.
Ratan Tata and others are represented by former Union Minister P Chidambaram, Congress party leader and senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi, and others.
All parties present in the high court on Monday had urged the court to stay the proceedings before the lower court until the quashing plea was heard by the court.

London: S&P said on Wednesday it had downgraded its credit rating on Jaguar Land Rover, and its owner, even deeper into junk and put it on review for a possible further downgrade due to the growing risks of a no-deal Brexit and US import tariffs.
S&P cut its rating on senior unsecured notes of Jaguar (JLR), Britain's biggest carmaker, and its owner India's Tata Motors Ltd to 'B+' from 'BB-' following JLR's weaker than expected third-quarter results.
It said it could lower the JLR rating further, most likely by one notch, if the carmaker fails to meet the base-case expectations for full-year results, Britain leaves the EU without a deal or Washington slaps new import tariffs on cars.
Fitch ratings agency also put Jaguar under review in early February.
The moves, which usually increase a company's funding costs, highlight growing concerns about disruption to industrial groups with complex supply chains spread across the EU and beyond from Britain's potentially chaotic departure from the bloc.
""The ongoing CreditWatch reflects that JLR needs to have a strong finish to fiscal year 2019 in order to maintain a 'B+' rating, while macroeconomic and geopolitical risks to JLR's business, such as a potential no-deal Brexit and/or US tariffs, remain high,"" it said.
In a separate note, S&P said JLR's woes are depressing profitability and causing a high cash burn rate for Tata.
The agency said it expects Tata to suffer negative cash flow for at least the next 12-18 months before its Chinese operations stabilise and cost cuts restore its financial health."

219,2019-04-02,Tata Motors,"Higher oil prices and a weak rupee are among factors that have affected auto sales in India since SeptemberDecision of most auto firms to reduce production in March quarter to trim their inventory seen as affecting sales

New Delhi: Auto sales in India fell in March due to tepid demand in both urban and rural areas. This has led to most of the automakers, including Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, missing their sales growth projections for the just-ended fiscal year.
Maruti Suzuki said on Monday that its total sales in March fell 0.7% year-on-year to 147,613 vehicles.
Sales for the year ended 31 March increased by a modest 6.1% to about 1.75 million vehicles as the company missed its revised forecast of an 8% growth. This is the first time since FY14 that India’s largest passenger vehicle maker has missed its sales forecast.
Vehicle sales in India are counted as factory dispatches, or wholesales, and not retail sales.
Barring its sole light commercial vehicle model, Carry, the Suzuki Motor Corp. unit recorded a 1.5% year-on-year drop in passenger vehicle sales to 145,013 vehicles in March.
Sales at Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd grew 4% to 27,646 vehicles in March helped by the compact sport-utility vehicle, XUV300, which was launched in February.
For the last fiscal year, Mahindra’s passenger vehicle sales grew by a marginal 2% underscoring a sharp contraction in demand in rural regions. The local unit of Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. recorded a 2.2% y-o-y drop in sales in March to 12,818 units.
“We have closed FY19 with robust double-digit growth of 11% at an overall level, despite strong headwinds faced by the Indian automotive industry this year. This growth has been supported by our three new product launches, which have been well received in the market,"" said Rajan Wadhera, president, automotive sector, M&M, referring to the company’s entire product range comprising passenger vehicles, three-wheelers and commercial vehicles.
One of the factors behind the subdued performance is the decision of most of the companies to reduce production in the March quarter to trim their inventory. Higher oil prices and a weaker rupee are among factors which have affected vehicle sales in India since September. Sales during the festive season fell to a five-year low in 2018.
Honda Cars India Ltd, however, bucked the trend as it reported a 27% jump in sales to 17,202 vehicles in March thanks to demand for its compact sedan Amaze. The company also witnessed an 8% increase in sales in the last fiscal year.
Rajesh Goel, senior vice- president and director, sales and marketing at Honda Cars, said strong sales efforts from dealers and the company in a tough market led to the growth.
Mirroring the slowdown in the manufacturing sector and the overall economy, medium and heavy commercial vehicle sales of Tata Motors—India’s top commercial vehicle maker—fell 9% in March to 15,327 vehicles. Such vehicles are used for transporting goods and people.
Overall sales of Tata’s commercial vehicles—combining M&HCV and light commercial vehicles—grew 4% y-o-y to 50,917 units in March. The company recorded a 12% increase in full-year sales to 1,51,105 vehicles.
Ashok Leyland Ltd, the second-largest commercial vehicle maker, also posted a 7% decline in sales of heavy and medium commercial vehicles in March to 15,235 vehicles. For the full-year, sales increased by 13% on the back of robust growth in the fiscal first half. The weak sentiment continued in the two-wheeler segment with market leader Hero MotoCorp Ltd reporting a 20% drop in sales in March to 581,279 units."

Nifty settled 0.40% higher at 11,713, it second-highest closing ever. Global markets were mostly higher, buoyed by positive factory activity data from China and the United States. Among the Sensex stocks, Tata Motors surged 8%, its second day of strong gains.
Here are 10 updates from stock markets:
1) The Supreme Court today stuck down Reserve Bank of India’s February 12, 2018, circular on bad loan resolution. The circular, commonly known as the February 12 circular, directed lenders to refer any loan account of over  ₹2,000 crore under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) if not resolved within 180 days of default.
2) Several companies, especially power firms, had sought intervention of the Supreme Court, saying the time given by the central bank was not enough time to tackle the debt issue. Many power sector stocks like JSW Energy, Adani Power and PowerGrid finished with strong gains
3) Banking shares, which significantly outperformed in last month’s rally, added on to gains. SBI, IndusInd Bank, and Yes Bank were among the top gainers.
4) Some analysts believe markets could see a consolidation in the near term after the sharp run-up over the past one month. Jayant Manglik, president of retail distribution at Religare Broking, said: ""In the near term, we expect some consolidation post the recent run-up. The upcoming RBI monetary policy on 4 April would provide further direction to the markets."" The monetary policy committee's commentary on future interest rate and inflation trajectory would be closely monitored by the market participants, he added.
5) Analysts widely believe RBI to cut rate later this week, when it announces policy decision on Thursday.
6) “We expect the RBI to cut policy rates by 25 bps and see a good chance of the policy stance shifting to accommodative/dovish (neutral currently). Since the previous monetary policy meeting, domestic growth momentum has slowed (reflected in high frequency data such as car sales, IIP, etc.) and inflation has remained benign. Further, global growth momentum has also lost substantial momentum and all major global central banks, including the US Fed, have turned decisively dovish in recent months,"" Edelweiss Securities said in a note.
7) Continuing the last month's momentum, foreign investors put in  ₹899 crore on a net basis into equities on Monday.  
8) Infosys and TCS kick off the March quarter earnings season when they announce their earnings on 12 April.
9) Market observers would be closely watching global oil prices which have risen to five-month highs. ""Movement of crude oil prices and currency would remain on market radar,"" said Jayant Manglik of Religare Broking.

217,2019-04-02,Tata Motors,"According to a regulatory filing, the company also said it did not sell even a single unit of the small car last monthWhen contacted, a Tata Motors spokesperson said no decision has been made yet on the phase out of Nano

NEW DELHI :
For the third month in a row Tata Motors did not produce any unit of its entry level small car Nano in March, heightening the uncertainty over the future of the vehicle once dubbed as 'people's car'.
According to a regulatory filing, the company also said it did not sell even a single unit of the small car last month.
Tata Motors has so far maintained that no decision has been made yet on the future of Nano, although in its current form it will not meet the new safety and emission norms and may need infusion of fresh investments.
There was zero production and sales of Nano in March. In the same month last year the company had produced 31 units of Nano and sold 29 units, Tata Motors said in a BSE filing.
In February also Tata Motors had said there was zero production of Nano although it sold just one unit in the domestic market during the month. There was no export either.
Similarly, in January this year too, Tata Motors had reported zero production and sales of the Nano.
When contacted, a Tata Motors spokesperson said no decision has been made yet on the phase out of Nano.
""Decisions on product life cycle is a holistic view taken after considering the market developments, regulations and emerging competitive landscape. Any such decisions are announced as and when it's taken,"" the spokesperson added.
Further, the spokesperson said, ""Production planning of a car is a conscious management of demand, system inventory and planned efficiencies. Therefore, speculating on the fate of a car based on a month's production figure is something the company would not like to participate in.""
Company officials had earlier hinted that production and sales of the Nano would stop from April 2020 as Tata Motors has no plans to invest further on Ratan Tata's dream car to meet strict emission norm under BS-VI and other upcoming safety regulations.

216,2019-04-10,Tata Motors,"Auto production in FY19 grew by 6.3%, not even half the growth rate clocked in FY18Soft commodity prices will not aid margins due to weak sales and a negative operating leverage

Mumbai: Automobile sales are decelerating, and incentives and discounts are not helping shore up demand. The uncertain outlook and mounting unsold inventory have compelled companies to cut production in the March quarter. The auto sector is thus faced with earnings downgrades for the next two years.
Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, a leading brokerage firm, in its March quarter preview, has cut earnings estimates for FY20 and FY21 for all 8 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that it covers. In contrast to the expectations of a turnaround in fortunes during the March quarter, which typically registers strong numbers for the sector, the net profit of almost all auto companies may witness double-digit declines for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Recent data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) shows that vehicle production in FY19 grew 6.3% year-on-year. This was not even half the growth witnessed in FY18.
The headwinds are strengthening. A truant 2019 monsoon, rampant rural distress led by weak farm income, increasing influence of shared mobility in urban areas, a rise in unemployment and the liquidity crunch are roadblocks to improved consumer sentiment. Pre-election sales of vehicles have also dipped in the past. 
All these point to a weak demand until after the elections.
Therefore, any improvement in sales can be expected only in the second half of FY20, beginning from the festival season, say analysts. There is hope of pre-buying in the March quarter of FY20, just before the BS-VI emission norms kick in. This is likely to substantially increase vehicle costs. Unfortunately, such regulatory changes have coincided with a cyclical downturn that would weigh on demand.
One would have expected some relief in margins on account of softer commodity prices. However, the forthcoming results are not expected to factor much gains. Low sales will translate to low operating leverage, which will weigh on profitability. “Weak demand is bringing in margin pressure from higher customer acquisition costs (marketing), as well as negative operating leverage,"" says IIFL Research.
ALSO READ | India's $70 billion car market could use a jump
In the auto sector, two-wheeler makers will feel more pain than commercial and passenger vehicle firms. Also, demand for two-wheelers may take longer to revive because of prolonged weakness in rural demand.
Siam’s outlook for FY20 is not encouraging with single-digit growth estimates in sales across most sub-sectors, except commercial vehicles.
No wonder auto stocks have been hammered on the Street since August, when the first signs of weakening sales were visible.
The Nifty Auto index has shed 33% in a year, widely under-pacing the Nifty 500 index for the first time in a decade. The only silver lining is that the valuations have come off."

Retail sales of automobiles in India increased 8% sequentially in March to 1.68 million vehicles as companies offered discounts and other incentives to lure buyers and reduce dealer stocks, showed data issued by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) on Wednesday.
Retail sales however fell compared with March last year because of the high base and prevailing weak market sentiments.
Retail sales of two-wheelers rose 10% month-on-month (m-o-m) in March to 1.32 million units, while those for passenger vehicles grew 5% to 242,708 units.
Sales of commercial vehicles grew at a modest 2% m-o-m to 61,896 units amid the prevailing liquidity crunch at non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), which has squeezed financing options for fleet owners.
Retail sales of automobiles started to decline since last September when customer sentiments turned negative as crude oil prices started moving north, and the rupee depreciated against the dollar to an all-time high which impacted returns in the stock markets.
The bankruptcy of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd, meanwhile, led to a liquidity crunch as NBFCs became over cautious in lending. As a result, vehicle sales fell to a six-year low during Diwali and Navratri last year.
With dealer inventories touching record high, companies had to cut production and offer increased benefits or discounts on vehicles to clear stocks.
The average inventory for passenger vehicles is, however, still in the range of 45-50 days, much higher than the inventory of 30 days typically maintained by most manufacturers, according to FADA. Two-wheeler makers managed to halve their inventories to 45-50 days from almost 90-100 days in January and February by enforcing production cuts at factories.
Showroom sales of passenger vehicles dropped 10% from the year-earlier in March, while sales in the two-wheeler segment fell 7%. Retail sales of commercial vehicles fell around 12% from the year earlier in March.
However, FADA, a lobby group for automobile dealers, said it expects customers to resume automobile purchases after the Lok Sabha elections, which conclude on 23 May.
“We at FADA believe that the worst for the automobile industry is now behind us and expect demand to stay at the current level in the months to come. We believe inquiry to conversion ratio to improve with a stable government at the centre and improvement in the liquidity situation,"" said Ashish Harsharaj Kale, president of FADA.
The subdued demand condition prevailing in the market was reflected in the wholesales data issued by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) on Monday.
Factory dispatches of passenger vehicles grew by just 2.7% to 3.37 million units in fiscal year 2019 (FY19)—the slowest since FY14 when sales fell 6%.
Anticipating continued pressure of sales volumes, Siam has projected a growth of around 3-5% in passenger vehicle sales for this fiscal year."
213,2019-04-16,Tata Motors,"Maruti Suzuki is weighing phase-out of diesel cars as BS-VI norms from 1 April 2020 will make them costlier by at least  ₹2 lakhHyundai and Tata Motors will likely to fill in the gap left by Maruti Suzuki with their own BS-VI diesel engines

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is staring at a potential drop in both sales and market share as it weighs a plan to stop selling diesel cars from April next year. India's largest carmaker garners nearly 30%, or about 450,000 units, of its annual sales from diesel cars.
Maruti Suzuki expects to push about half of those buyers to shift to petrol or CNG cars by offering incentives, and also provide CNG options in more models. It, however, fears that the remainder will shift to diesel cars of rival brands, according to an internal projection prepared by senior executives of Maruti.
Maruti is considering the drastic step on the future of its diesel range as the imposition of Bharat Stage VI emission norms from 1 April 2020 would make such vehicles costlier by at least  ₹2 lakh per unit in order to make them comply with the new rules. This is expected to particularly lead most small-car buyers to shift to petrol or CNG models.
Small cars comprise the bulk of Maruti’s sales volume.
R.C. Bhargava, Maruti’s chairman, said the company might stop producing diesel variants of some of the smaller cars as the price difference between petrol and diesel variants would be substantial. He did not say whether the company would completely stop making diesel cars.
“We have to manufacture vehicles according to what is likely to be acceptable to customers. If we have a bigger vehicle, then we may continue. Ultimately, we have to judge what the customers want and develop vehicles accordingly,"" said Bhargava.
According to the internal forecast, Maruti might lose annual sales of 125,000-150,000 vehicles if it did not have any diesel car in its portfolio, as most of its competitors were likely to be ready with BS VI diesel engines by next April, said two people aware of the development.
According to the projection, sales of high-selling Ertiga, Vitara Brezza and S-Cross models will be hit the most if Maruti pulls the plug on diesel cars.
Maruti Suzuki spokespersons didn’t reply to an email sent on Monday.
If Maruti loses market share, it will be the first since 2012-13 for the most profitable unit of Suzuki Motor Corp.
In FY13, Maruti’s market share fell to 39% as diesel vehicle sales picked up at the expense of petrol ones. The company managed to raise its market share to 51% by introducing a slew of vehicles, especially in the above  ₹7 lakh segment.
Suzuki is yet to decide on whether to upgrade its current 1.5-litre diesel engine—launched with the Ciaz sedan in March—to comply with BS-VI norms. The company may, therefore, start FY21 without a diesel engine but introduce one later in the year.
The two people cited earlier said the loss of volumes and market share was projected as the worst-case scenario and that it could be limited if Maruti managed to convert diesel car buyers.
Some senior Maruti executives wanted diesel cars to stay, as rivals Hyundai Motor Co. and Tata Motors Ltd would also have diesel cars, said the first person. “The losses can be contained by the company since the diesel vehicles will be significantly expensive, but converting 30% of the volumes will be tough since some of the customers would still want to buy diesel variants,"" the person added.
Mint reported on 15 February that Maruti was in talks with Suzuki on the future of diesel cars in India that included whether the company should cease production of diesel vehicles.
“Maruti’s absence in the diesel portfolio, especially in B and C segment cars, can impact their market share adversely, but at the same time it is an opportunity for other players,"" said Puneet Gupta, associate director-vehicle forecast (South Asia) at IHS Markit. “But we should not forget that Maruti Suzuki understands the pulse of the consumer the best. It looks like the company is banking heavily on CNG cars and on the assumption that consumers will shift to gasoline cars in the years to come.""
He said the share of diesel cars was declining, but they still made up a large share in the overall car market.
The second person quoted above said Maruti’s decision made sense, though it might cause some short-term pain.
“The commercial fleet customers of Maruti may completely shift to CNG to maintain their profitability, but how retail customers will behave nobody knows at the moment,"" the person said. “The launch of the current 1.5-litre engine took more than the expected time and a BS-VI engine needs to be tested for 1 lakh km before it gets launched. So, for Maruti, it is like running against time."""

Jaguar Land Rover is facing stiff headwinds in the UK and in China, the world’s largest car market, but the storied British automaker sees the US as a relative oasis.
Plummeting China sales, Brexit tremors and tightening European emissions rules forced JLR parent Tata Motors Ltd. to take a record $3.9 billion writedown last year. But while global deliveries fell 4.6%, the premium automaker’s 2018 sales in the US rose 7.3% to a record of almost 123,000 vehicles.
JLR’s top executive in the US is aiming for a repeat performance this year.
“If we can keep our volumes around where we were last year, I’d be more than happy,"" Joe Eberhardt, head of the company’s North America business, said in an interview at the New York auto show last week. “We focus on the things we can control.""
The U.S. is JLR’s single biggest market, and it’s betting on continued demand for SUVs like the compact E-Pace and redesigned Range Rover Evoque, even as industrywide vehicle sales are expected to dip. The automaker also is counting on a new version of the Land Rover Defender, the boxy classic that ferried British soldiers during the Korean War, to gin up sales when it arrives on U.S. shores in 2020.
“There’s always room for further growth and the growth will have to come from new product,"" Eberhardt said.
Maintaining that momentum in the U.S. is critical as the company struggles to adjust to falling sales elsewhere. In January, JLR announced plans to slash 4,500 jobs worldwide -- roughly 10 percent of its workforce -- as part of a 2.5 billion-pound ($3.2 billion) push to reduce costs and boost cash flow through 2020. Eberhardt said North America has done its part to contribute to cost savings, without elaborating.
Tata is said to be exploring strategic options for Jaguar Land Rover, including a potential stake sale in the struggling luxury carmaker, Bloomberg reported in March, citing people familiar with the matter. The automaker needs to raise $1 billion in 14 months to replace maturing bonds and is also burning cash on an investment program for electric cars.

Mumbai: Tata Steel Ltd has done well in the March quarter, despite cost pressures and weak product prices. Consolidated adjusted operating profits increased 8.3% sequentially even as profitability per tonne dropped 6.9%.
The impact of lower realization at the India business was mitigated by higher volumes. Sales volumes in India jumped 21% sequentially as the turn of the calendar year triggered fresh purchases by customers. Delivery volumes at Europe rose 9.4%. And thanks to savings on maintenance costs and the restarting of a blast furnace, operating profit at Tata Steel Europe jumped 66%, driving consolidated earnings.
The earnings exceeded Street estimates, driving up the stock by 6.7% on Friday. Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd warns soft prices can weigh on Tata Steel Europe’s profitability. Even then, deleveraging, combined with the volume expansion in India, should hold Tata Steel in good stead. The company management expects volumes in FY20 to be higher by one million tonnes, primarily due to the production ramp-up at the recently acquired Bhushan Steel plant and the Usha Martin plant. Further, normalization of raw material costs and price hikes mean operating profits are projected to improve compared to Q4 FY19.
The current slowdown in user industries, especially in the auto sector, does pose some headwinds. Automobiles is a large business segment for Tata Steel, and it offers better realizations and margins. “Management believes that Indian operations will remain relatively unaffected even if domestic auto slowdown persists as market share of the company would go up. Tata Steel BSL (Bhushan Steel Ltd) has received approvals from Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland, among others, for automotive supply. Besides, the company is also making inroads in other high value-add segments like oil and gas,"" Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a note.
The performance in the March quarter and the post-results commentary is aiding the Tata Steel stock. But what of the outlook? The subdued demand environment in developed countries, especially Europe, remains a challenge. Much of the recent increase in domestic prices is driven by cost push and seasonal restocking in China, and the sustainability of these hikes remains to be seen.
The company is trying to reduce the risk to earnings through cost rationalization measures and deleveraging. The merger of Bhushan Steel and de-bottlenecking measures are expected to drive greater synergies, providing savings on procurement and sales, and general administration expenses.
Further, it plans to strengthen the balance sheet by reducing gross debt by $1 billion by the end of FY20. The measures, coupled with the proposed demerger of the European operations into a separate joint venture, should help Tata Steel withstand product price volatility and unfavourable macroeconomic conditions. How well the company delivers on this front will be crucial."

NEW DELHI :
Homegrown automakers Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) Thursday reported decline in sales for April, hit by subdued demand in the market.
Similarly, Toyota Kirloskar Motor also reported a decline of 22.43% in its domestic sales last month.
Tata Motors said its passenger vehicle sales in the domestic market declined by 26% to 12,694 units last month, compared to 17,235 units in April 2018.
""The industry has recorded de-growth for the 10th consecutive month. Weak consumer sentiments are reflected in this demand de growth and we have also been impacted,"" Tata Motors president Passenger Vehicles Business Unit Mayank Pareek said in a statement.
Meanwhile, M&M saw its passenger vehicle sales drop 8.94% to 19,966 units in April as against 21,927 units in the year-ago period.
M&M’s President-Automotive Sector Rajan Wadhera said the ongoing elections has subdued the purchase sentiment during April.
""This, according to us, is a temporary phenomenon. We believe, following the elections the auto industry will see a revival in consumer demand. Supported by a normal monsoon, we are confident of seeing higher sales in FY20,"" he added.
Toyota Kirloskar Motor said its domestic sales last month stood at 10,112 units against 13,037 units in April 2018, a decline of 22.43%.

New Delhi: Auto major Tata Motors may phase out small diesel cars from its portfolio as demand is expected to slow down due to upcoming BS-VI emission norms that would make such vehicles expensive, according to a senior company official.
Already, market leader Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) has stated that it would discontinue diesel models from 1 April 2020, when the BS-VI norms kick in, as it expects the increased cost would put most of the diesel cars, especially the smaller ones, out of reach of small car buyers.
Tata Motors currently sells its entry-level hatchback Tiago with 1-litre diesel engine, compact sedan Tigor with 1.05-litre powertrain and older models like the Bolt and the Zest with a 1.3-litre diesel engine.
""We feel that low demand for entry- and mid-size diesel models will not justify the high costs involved in developing a new small capacity engine,"" Tata Motors president passenger vehicles business unit Mayank Pareek told PTI.
Moreover, around 80% of the demand in the said segment is for petrol variants, and thus, the additional required investment does not seem viable, he added.
The company's other products like compact SUV Nexon and recently launched SUV Harrier come with bigger 1.5-litre and 2-litre powertrains respectively and are expected to be upgraded to the next level going ahead.
The company sources the 2-litre diesel engine for Harrier from Fiat.
Pareek said the introduction of BS-VI engines will make the compliance expensive, particularly for small diesel cars.
""Given that these high costs will ultimately have to be passed on to the end customer, the sale of diesel vehicles will logically see a decline in the industry,"" he added.
With diesel cars set to become costlier from the next year with the implementation of stricter BS-VI emission norms, major automakers are contemplating about the future of such vehicles in their portfolios.
Earlier this month, MSI announced phasing out diesel cars from its portfolio with effect from 1 April 2020, coinciding with the transition of the automobile industry to stricter BS VI emission norms.
On the other hand, Ford has said that it will continue to sell diesel models in the country. The automaker, which sells models like EcoSport and Endeavour, said it would be ready with BS VI-compliant diesel powertrains for its model range before the 1 April 2020, deadline.
The Bharat Stage VI (or BS-VI) emission norm would come into force from 1 April 2020, across the country. Currently, the vehicles sold in the country conform to BS IV emission standards.
The Bharat stage emission standards are standards instituted by the government to regulate the output of air pollutants from motor vehicles."

LONDON :
Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is testing new ""Smart Wallet"" technology, which would enable future drivers of the luxury cars earn cryptocurrency and make driving related payments on the move.
The UK's largest car manufacturer said the ""earn-as-you-drive"" tests would mean future owners of its models earn credits by enabling their cars to automatically report useful road condition data, such as traffic congestion or potholes to navigation providers or local authorities.
Drivers could then redeem their rewards, such as free coffee, or use them to automatically pay tolls, parking fees and for smart charging electric vehicles.
""Smart Wallet removes the need for drivers to hunt for loose change or sign up to multiple accounts to pay for a variety of everyday services,"" JLR said in a statement.
Unlike other similar systems, due to its structure, Smart Wallet would require no transaction fee to operate and over time transactions will get faster across the entire network, forecast to include some 75 billion connected devices by 2025. Drivers could also top-up their Smart Wallets using conventional payment methods, JLR said.
JLR, the UK-based car giant, was acquired by Tata Motors in 2008.
""The connected car technologies we are developing will be transformative and truly turn your Jaguar or Land Rover into a third space, in addition to your home or office,"" said Russell Vickers, JLR Software Architect.
""In the future an autonomous car could drive itself to a charging station, recharge and pay, while its owner could choose to participate in the sharing economy – earning rewards from sharing useful data such as warning other cars of traffic jams,"" he said.
Smart Wallet, which uses the latest cryptocurrency technology, involves a JLR partnership with next-generation blockchain IOTA Foundation to harness ""distributed ledger"" technologies to make and receive such payments.
""Our distributed ledger technology is perfectly suited to enable machine-to-machine payments for smart charging, parking and tolls, in addition to creating opportunities for drivers to earn their own digital currency,"" said Holger Kother, Director of Partnerships at IOTA Foundation.
The advanced connected technology is being trialled at the new Jaguar Land Rover software engineering base at Shannon in the Republic of Ireland, where engineers have already equipped several vehicles, including the Jaguar F-PACE and Range Rover Velar, with Smart Wallet functionality.
Nick Rogers, Executive Director of Product Engineering at JLR, said: ""Working with our engineering hub in the UK, the team in Shannon are pioneering and testing these sophisticated connected technologies that will help people to make the most of the time they spend in their car.""
""Jaguar Land Rover is embracing autonomous, connected, electrified and shared mobility technology as we endeavour to make cars safer, cleaner and smarter for everybody.""
The Irish R&D facility is focussed on developing new technologies to support electrification and self-driving features on future Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles.
Supported by the Irish Development Agency, JLR said its team at Shannon is also developing the next generation of electrical architecture as well as exploring advanced driver assistance systems features for future vehicles.
The company said the technology research forms part of JLR's Destination Zero strategy, which aims to achieve zero emissions, zero accidents and zero congestion.
It adds: ""Part of reaching this target is developing a shared economy where the vehicle plays an integral role as a data gatherer in the smart city of the future.""
""For example, the connected Smart Wallet services will promote a reduction in congestion with the sharing of live traffic updates and offering alternative routes to drivers, reducing tailpipe emissions from idling in traffic.""

2) Global stocks had a rocky start to the week after Washington on Monday accused Beijing of backtracking from commitments made during trade negotiations.

5) “Indian markets have been on a shaky ground for the past couple of days driven by ambiguity associated with the US-China trade negotiations and less-than-inspiring ongoing corporate earnings season. Further, the ongoing election season is another major variable that markets are watching closely,"" says Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of research (wealth) at Centrum Broking Limited.

7) Neogen Chemicals made a strong debut on exchanges today, ending over 20% higher than its issue price.
8) China said on Tuesday that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit Washington on Thursday and Friday for trade talks, setting up a last-ditch bid to salvage a deal that would avoid a sharp increase in tariffs on Chinese goods ordered by US President Donald Trump. If the talks break down, global markets are likely to again

China’s state-owned Chery Automobile Co. Ltd is in advanced discussions with Tata Motors Ltd for a potential alliance for the Indian market, underscoring moves by Chinese companies to expand into the world’s fastest-growing major auto market.
The nature of the partnership—a joint venture, retail sales tie-up or technology sharing—and the time for Chery’s entry into India is yet to be finalized, said a person aware of the development, requesting anonymity.
“Senior management of Tata Motors was in China this year and they did visit the facilities of Chery as well. A return visit by Chery’s senior executives to India is also on the cards in the next few months. Most of the leading Chinese companies are looking at the Indian markets since the potential is huge and India is the only market projected to grow significantly in the long run,"" said the person.
Tata Motors’ Jaguar Land Rover unit and Chery have an equal joint venture in China since 2012, with a plant in Changshu. Chery is one of China’s top automakers, while Tata Motors is India’s fourth largest passenger vehicle maker.
The person cited above said Chinese automakers don’t understand the mindset of Indian customers as much as their Japanese rivals do. So, even if they are interested, it is important to have a local partner to help them understand the market, said the person.
A Tata Motors’ spokesperson said, “This is highly speculative and we do not comment on market rumours."" Chery could not be contacted for comment.
In 2017, The Economic Times reported, citing Chery chairman Yin Tongyao, that his company may explore entering India with or without partnering Tata Motors.
With auto sales in China expec-ted to stagnate in the coming years, major companies there are looking to expand to India. China’s SAIC Motor Corp. Ltd-owned British brand MG Motor will launch its first product in the next few months, while Great Wall Motors has formed a team to set up independent operations in India.

London: India's Tata Motors said on Thursday there was no truth to a report saying a sale of Jaguar Land Rover to French automotive group PSA could be imminent.
The Press Association said leaked information suggested a sale could be imminent, citing a ""post-sale integration document"", which outlines the benefits of the two companies joining forces.
""As a matter of policy, we do not comment on media speculation. But we can confirm there is no truth to these rumours,"" a Tata Motors spokesperson said."
198,2019-05-10,Tata Motors,"PSA's relative fuel-efficiency of its vehicle technologies is a valuable asset JLR faces one of the toughest challenges to comply with looming carbon dioxide goals

PSA Group said on Thursday it was ready to consider potential tie-ups, after the French carmaker's shares briefly rose on a report that it was in advanced talks with Tata Motors to acquire UK-based Jaguar Land Rover (JLR).
The Peugeot maker declined to comment on a report by British news agency The Press Association that a deal was imminent. Tata denied the report, which cited sources referring to an internal ""post-sale integration document"" describing cost savings.
""As a matter of policy, we do not comment on media speculation, but we can confirm there is no truth to these rumours,"" said a spokesperson for the Indian carmaker, which owns 100% of JLR.
PSA shares jumped after publication of the PA report, before falling back after Tata released its statement, and were down 2.85 percent as of 1431 GMT.
""On principle we are open to opportunities that could create long-term value for PSA Group and its shareholders,"" said Alain Le Gouguec, a spokesman for the Paris-based manufacturer.
PSA is setting new profitability records even as it continues to integrate Opel/Vauxhall, acquired from General Motors in 2017, and has previously signalled openness to further acquisitions.
The relative fuel-efficiency of its vehicle technologies is a valuable asset as carmakers battle to meet tougher European emissions targets and avoid huge fines.
JLR, by contrast, faces one of the toughest challenges to comply with looming carbon dioxide goals - compounded by the uncertainty and disruption of Britain's protracted departure from the European Union.
Tata posted a record $4 billion loss for its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31, and warned that JLR would swing to an operating loss in the full year to March.

197,2019-05-13,Tata Motors,"The intent to localize key parts and aggregates in a reasonable time frame will benefit all stakeholdersWhile there is a broad agreement, certain deadlines by which manufacturers have to localize specific items may not be feasible to all

MUMBAI :
Top automakers have cheered the government’s recent push to localise manufacturing for hybrid and electric vehicle (xEV) under the revised norms of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles Scheme (FAME 2).
This is in sharp contrast to the several instances over the last decade where auto industry stakeholders have clashed with government agencies on multiple fronts such as dual fuel policy, roll out of CNG stations, vehicular pollution, emission norms, safety mandates, as well as the government’s thrust on biofuels and electrification of vehicles.
Mint had on 7 May reported that the latest draft guidelines on FAME list components such as control units, chargers, and AC units that need to be built locally, with specific deadlines, for manufacturers to qualify for subsidies under a government scheme launched to encourage the adoption of such vehicles.
FAME, which was introduced on 1 April 2015, entered its second phase (FAME 2) in April 2019.
The country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki has already made significant investment in the local xEV supply chain and is setting up an EV battery plant in Gujarat and others are expected to follow suit.
“The intent to localize the key parts and aggregates in a reasonable timeframe will benefit all stakeholders in the long term,"" said Shailesh Chandra, president, electric mobility business and corporate strategy, Tata Motors. “Our team is studying the latest notification to understand its full implications. The government’s approach of defining a PMP (phased manufacturing program) does help bring clarity to the value chain, including the suppliers, to work towards progressive localization,"" he said.
“Tata Motors has a local supplier base available for most of the parts notified under the PMP and is working closely with the identified suppliers to localize the remaining parts,"" he said.
“The PMP under FAME 2 will boost local manufacturing of EV components, including the battery packs, power electronics, and electric motors to be made in India for the world,"" said Mahesh Babu, chief executive officer, Mahindra Electric.
“Our EV strategy is in line with the government’s vision of making India a sustainable EV market,"" said Puneet Anand, senior general manager and group head, marketing, Hyundai Motor India. Mint had reported on 19 April that Hyundai is talking to suppliers to develop EV parts in India.
While there is a broad agreement, certain deadlines by which manufacturers have to localize specific items may not be feasible to all.
“These issues are under discussions with the government and we hope a few alterations will be incorporated,"" said Karthick Athmanathan, head, EV and eMobility solutions, Ashok Leyland. The Chennai-based company said that as part of cost rationalization, aftermarket spare support, and inventory control, it has been engaged with its EV suppliers for the past one year.
Nishant Arya, executive director, JBM Group, also agreed that the move is a positive step towards India’s adoption of EVs but also demands clarity on incentives at the supplier level. “The key requirement here is clarity on incentives on these investments to domestic manufacturers. This shall give them an opportunity to plan and work towards investing in innovation and technology, creating an overall robust ecosystem,"" Arya said.
The incentives under FAME 2 are strictly for localization and not for funding imports, said Vinnie Mehta, director general, Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India. He, however, expects the government to relax deadlines for genuine challenges on a case-by-case basis."

Tuesday's bounce after a nine-day drop proved short-lived. Indian markets came under renewed selling pressure today as Sensex fell over 200 points amid a broad-based decline. The decline in Indian markets came despite Asian stocks bouncing from a 3-1/2-month low.

192,2019-05-20,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors had posted a loss for the third-quarter, hurt by an impairment charge for its luxury car unit Jaguar Land RoverShares of Tata Motors closed up 7.5% at  ₹190.15 ahead of the earnings release


Bengaluru: Tata Motors Ltd's fourth-quarter profit fell less than expected on Monday, with the Indian automaker saying tighter control of expenses and a turnaround at its Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) unit helped dull the impact of economic slowdown at home.
Three months ago, Tata promised ""decisive action"" to cut costs at JLR and improve cash flow after weak sales at the British luxury car brand led Tata to post the biggest-ever quarterly loss in Indian corporate history.
India's biggest automaker by revenue earned  ₹1,117 crore ($160.26 million) in net profit for the three months ended 31 March - its first quarterly profit in the fiscal year.
The result was ahead of the  ₹338 crore average of 10 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv IBES, but was still lower than  ₹2,125 crore a year earlier.
Revenue from wholly owned subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc fell 5% to  ₹65,146 crore. The unit brings in most of Tata's revenue.
Last month, rival Maruti Suzuki India Ltd booked a net profit decline of 5% and forecast a weak rate of growth for the current fiscal year ending March 2020.
Shares of Tata Motors closed up 7.5% at  ₹190.15 ahead of the earnings release. The Nifty Auto index ended up 4.2% amid a broader market rally."

Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc reported its first profit in four quarters, overcoming a continued sales slump in China and raising optimism that Britain’s largest automaker is finally on the mend.
Net income was £119 million ($151.6 million) in the three months ended March, according to a statement on Monday, while profit before tax, excluding exceptional items, was £269 million. It was an improvement from the record £3.1 billion loss posted at the end of 2018 that shocked investors, a misfortune that spilled over to JLR’s Indian parent Tata Motors Ltd.
While the latest results are encouraging for JLR, its struggles in China persist as sales tumbled 46% in April, raising questions as to how long the Indian parent will hang on to what was once its crown jewel. Tata Group is exploring strategic options for the luxury brand, including a potential stake sale, people familiar with the matter have said.
Though JLR is hardly the only carmaker suffering in China lately -- the market is going through its longest slump in a generation -- it’s not the only challenge it’s facing. JLR is particularly vulnerable to the shift away from combustion and diesel engines, and its strong historic links to the UK have fueled concern over what a disruptive Brexit could bring.
The US-listed shares of Tata Motors rose 10% in pre-market trading. Jaguar’s bonds rose on the back if its fourth-quarter results, with its euro-denominated notes with a shorter maturity gaining the most traction on the news. Its €500 million 4.5% bonds maturing in January 2026 rose 1.5 cents on the euro to a price of 91.7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That bond was bid as low as 75 cents on the euro in February when the company said conditions were not right for it to borrow from the bond market, and was seeking alternative funding.
Since 2018, the company has had its junk credit rating cut three times by S&P Global Ratings and the automaker is eliminating 4,500 jobs.
The maker of the Jaguar XE sedan and the Land Rover Discovery SUV has also been struggling with quality problems at both marques: A J.D. Power survey of 31 brands in June 2018 put them in the bottom two slots. Jaguar had 148 problems per 100 vehicles and Land Rover racked up a dizzying 160. Top-ranked Genesis, the luxury brand of Hyundai Motor Co., had 68.
Land Rover still ranks as the most valuable of the major brands owned by Tata Group, which also controls Tetley tea and New York’s luxury Pierre hotel. The automotive marque was worth an estimated $6.2 billion last year, according to Interbrand."
190,2019-05-20,Tata Motors,"A key concern for the market, that competitive pressures might push back on vehicle pricing, has been allayedCost-control measures and improvement in volumes sequentially have aided Ebitda margin in Q4

MUMBAI :
Tata Motors Ltd has been having one of its toughest years in recent history, with sales of its UK unit, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), going downhill. In this backdrop, expectations have been running low for the company’s fourth quarter (Q4) results.
But the good news is that the numbers have come close to what the Street had estimated, thanks to a steady performance from JLR. As it turns out, Tata Motors’ American depositary receipts listed on the New York Stock Exchange were up 5.5% at the time of writing.
Overall, the company’ consolidated revenue of  ₹86,422 crore in Q4 was higher than the Street’s  ₹85,165 crore, according to Bloomberg estimates. While consolidated volume growth has been marginally lower in Q4, down 3.8% year-on-year at 357,218 units, it has nevertheless been well accepted by the Street.
A key concern for the market, that competitive pressures might push back on pricing of vehicles, has been allayed. Cost-control measures and improvement in volumes sequentially have aided Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin in Q4. Ebitda stood at 9.7%. While this may seem lower than the margin picture a year ago, investors seem to have taken the numbers in their stride. A number of analysts had factored in lower margins in Q4. Note that Ebitda margin in Q3 stood at 7.9%.
This increase in margins was aided by the return to profitability of JLR in Q4. Recall that in Q3, the UK subsidiary took a huge impairment hit on technology obsolescence that impacted profitability. This quarter, its profit before tax came in at £269 million. For JLR, China continues to be a worry. Surprisingly, volume growth has been robust in its key markets of the UK and US.
“As long as there is no Brexit related major issue, which we cannot predict, Tata Motors should be able to sustain JLR performance this year. China is still an issue for them. But the rest of the markets are doing well, and so is their turnaround programme,"" said Jigar Shah, chief executive of Maybank Kim Eng Securities India Pvt. Ltd.
The domestic story is not expected to change much in the first half due to the general slowdown. While Tata Motors’ domestic volume growth in Q4 stood at 193,000 units, down 3.8% year-on- year, there has been a healthy improvement in Ebitda margin to 7%. If some of the domestic sales sheen comes back, it could add the gloss to JLR’s steady performance in the coming quarters."
187,2019-05-21,Tata Motors,"Commendably, Jaguar did lay out its progress toward restructuringThe company is hoping to cap annual investment spending at 4 billion pounds for the next few years

These days, any news seems to be good news for Jaguar Land Rover.
After Tata Motors Ltd.’s U.K. unit posted 120 million pounds ($152.8 million) of pretax profits and positive free cash flow for the quarter, the company’s U.S.-listed shares rose as much as 10% in pre-market trading and bond prices ticked up. Both numbers remain deep in the red for the year.
That leaves little to cheer. Rather than generating gains from dramatic cost cuts and other measures to boost the bottom line, its meager earnings came on the back of spending less on non-core manufacturing and working-capital improvements. Mumbai-listed Tata Motors dropped around 4.7% in early trading on Tuesday.
Outgoing Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Gregor said the company “very much over-delivered"" on inventory reduction and working capital. But there’s a bit of seasonality in those trends, and inventories are still elevated. While management said it expects free cash flow to improve, the figure is forecast to stay negative through the 2021 fiscal year. 
Commendably, Jaguar did lay out its progress toward restructuring. Since the launch of “Project Charge"" in September, the company has completed 70% of its objectives in terms of lowering investment and 80% of its working-capital goals set for March 2020.
That was the easy part: As we’ve written, Jaguar was spending far too liberally, in addition to mismanaging inventory in China. The company is hoping to cap annual investment spending at 4 billion pounds for the next few years. Yet at the current rate, that's still close to 20% of its top line. Meanwhile, Tata Motors has boosted outlays in India. With little prospect that sales and profitability will rise, expenses need to fall.
On costs and profits, however, Jaguar Land Rover is much farther behind, having reached just 20% of its goal. This is the tough part. These targets ultimately determine the company’s precarious free-cash-flow position and its ability to manage its debt. 
The initial costs to reduce core expenses will be painful and large. In a voluntary redundancy program revealed last quarter, Jaguar took a charge of around $200 million. The company didn't give much guidance about how it plans to further lower expenses, besides previously announced job cuts and spending less on marketing. Jaguar said margins would remain around a paltry  3% to 4% through fiscal 2021.
Then there’s the company’s encumbered balance sheet. Over the course of the past year, Jaguar’s debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose to 2.3 times from 1.3 times. Management said total debt – at 4.5 billion pounds, compared with 3.7 billion pounds – would remain around current levels for the next few years.  
Let’s not forget the industry-wide challenges. Demand for cars is either plateauing or slowing, while Brexit and the trade war loom. In India, the commercial-vehicle cycle looks to be peaking and consumers aren’t buying cars. Jaguar’s truck business could suffer more under new rules in areas such as freight capacity and emissions.
Instead of looking for the needle of good news in the haystack, investors may be better off wondering how meaningful these improvements really are.

Mumbai: Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc (JLR) expects a turnaround in China in the coming months to shore up efforts that have delivered the first profit in four quarters for Britain’s largest automaker.
The luxury manufacturer reported net income of 119 million pounds ($151.6 million) in the three months ended March, an improvement from the record 3.1 billion-pound loss posted at the end of 2018 that shocked investors and spilled over to JLR’s Indian parent Tata Motors Ltd.

China should return to growth “a quarter from now,"" Tata Motors’ Chief Financial Officer P.B. Balaji said on Monday, reiterating the Indian company wasn’t looking to sell its luxury cars unit. Jaguar Land Rover has “managed to stabilize"" in China after removing surplus inventory.
Though JLR is hardly the only carmaker suffering in China lately amid the market’s longest slump in a generation, other luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz and BMW have managed to grow sales. The Chinese government taking steps to bolster auto demand should help boost sales, Balaji said, while profitability at JLR’s dealers in China has started to stabilize.
The manufacturer, which announced 4,500 job cuts globally in January as part of a 2.5 billion-pound savings program, is particularly vulnerable to the shift away from combustion and diesel engines, and its strong historic links to the UK have fueled concern over what a disruptive Brexit could bring. The cost-cutting drive has yielded 1.25 billion in savings so far, JLR said.
Separately, JLR’s Chief Financial Officer Ken Gregor will step down after 11 years in the post to be replaced by current Chief Transformation Officer Adrian Mardell, the carmaker said.

Signs of a turnaround at its marquee Jaguar Land Rover unit may not be enough to ease the challenges facing India’s oldest and most-storied business empire.
The Tata Group bought the British luxury carmaker in 2008 for $2.3 billion, and it’s lately become a drag on the salt-to-software conglomerate, racking up losses in three quarters through December. Although Jaguar posted a net income of 119 million pounds ($151 million) this week, debt at owner Tata Motors Ltd. has grown to almost $14 billion, as it struggles to tide over a demand slump in China, the world’s biggest auto market.
JLR’s mixed fortunes have hit Tata — whose wider group debt load bloated to at least $40 billion, the largest among India’s conglomerates — just as it seeks to revamp the sprawling business. Making matters worse, a steel deal in Europe that would’ve eased the group’s liabilities unraveled this month. Tata Motors and Tata Steel Ltd. had a combined debt of about $27 billion, accounting for more than half of the total dues owed by the group’s top 18 units. Tata Steel Bsl Ltd. and Tata Teleservices Maharashtra Ltd., which are in the process of restructuring, had $9 billion of debt at the end of March 31.
“Tata will have to take harsh decisions to mitigate the risk of debt in the long term for the conglomerate,"" said Arun Kejriwal, a director at KRIS, a Mumbai-based investment advisory firm. “For now, Tata Motors and Tata Steel are trouble spots.""
The twin developments mark the biggest challenge facing the 151-year-old group that ventured overseas with acquisitions more than a decade ago. Debt has become a defining issue for some of India’s biggest companies as the government cracks down on bad loans following a decade of expansion.

After years serving as a cash cow, JLR hit a bump in Europe amid concerns over a disruptive Brexit and the industry’s shift away from fossil-fuel vehicles. The diminishing cash flows have raised questions as to how long Tata will hang on to what was once its crown jewel. The steel business was slammed by the financial crisis in 2008 and a commodity crisis eight years later, prompting the group to look for ways to dispose of the assets.
Tata Motors isn’t looking to sell its luxury-car unit and expects a turnaround in China in the coming months, the automotive group’s Chief Financial Officer P.B. Balaji told reporters on May 20.

What Bloomberg Opinion Says
Rather than generating gains from dramatic cost cuts and other measures to boost the bottom line, its meager earnings came on the back of spending less on non-core manufacturing and working-capital improvements.--Anjani Trivedi, columnist
Tata’s struggles echo some of those faced by other Indian conglomerates, including tycoon Anil Ambani’s group, which relied on high leverage to expand operations, only to see their business hit following a crackdown on bad loans by India’s government.
Highlighting concerns over rising debt, S&P Global Ratings cut the credit rating of Tata Motors’s long-term debt four times since July to B+, four notches below investment grade.
“We do not anticipate any more issues on debt,"" CFO Balaji told reporters on May 20. “We do not have any plans to raise funds for JLR to tide over the current debt.""
One problem is the small volume of JLR sales in China compared to the competition. In the first four months of 2019, JLR sold only 8,900 Jaguars and 20,400 Land Rovers, down from 15,100 Jaguars and 39,800 Land Rovers a year earlier, according to data collected by Bloomberg Intelligence.
That puts the Indian automaker at a significant disadvantage against luxury rivals that have much bigger scale in China, said S&P analyst Ashutosh Sharma. In April, for instance, BMW and Mercedes-Benz both sold more than 58,000 vehicles.
“Given their size, JLR is unable to match the price competition ensuing in China,"" Sharma said. “They are not trying to get into price competition, so they are facing steep volume declines."" The rating agency expects cash flow for Tata Motors will remain negative until at least next March.
Quality Perceptions
Even in its home market in the UK, the automaker struggles with the perception of poorly made cars. In the 2018 reliability ranking published by What Car?, JLR had four of the five worst performers among the 25 large and luxury SUVs surveyed.
The headwinds faced by JLR will also test the mettle of Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran, a 30-year veteran insider brought in two years ago to revamp the $110-billion group and fix faltering units. Patriarch and long-time chairman Ratan Tata handpicked him to succeed Cyrus Mistry, who was ousted in October 2016 from the top job following a board feud. The goal of the restructuring is to eventually whittle down the 100 operating companies to a more-manageable number under 10 verticals.
The bad news from JLR was compounded by Tata Steel’s decision to give up on a proposed joint venture with German rival, Thyssenkrupp AG, amid antitrust concerns. The deal would’ve helped transfer some of its debt to the joint venture, allowing the Mumbai-based company to sharpen its focus on ramping up its profitable Indian business. The group is still looking for a partner, possibly outside Europe, an executive said in an interview last week.
As part of his restructuring plan, Chandrasekaran achieved a breakthrough last week. Tata Global Beverages Ltd., which owns brands such as Tetley tea and Eight O’Clock coffee, announced plans to acquire the spice, salt and lentil brands of Tata Chemicals Ltd. The newly-enlarged food company will take on a new name, Tata Consumer Products Ltd., and will have sales of nearly 91 billion rupees ($1.3 billion).
“Tata Sons is simplifying businesses and such moves will unlock Tata Global Beverages’s valuations,"" said Chakri Lokapriya, chief investment officer at TCG Asset Management in Mumbai.
However, a fix for Tata Steel’s European business and its 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in debt is still on Chandrasekaran’s to-do list. For JLR, Tata is exploring strategic options, including a potential stake sale, Bloomberg News reported in March.

Ashok Leyland’s volumes had risen 1% year-on-year, and were driven by sales of light commercial vehicles (CVs), which rose by more than 8%. As such, average price realizations were expected to drop on account of the change in the product mix. What’s more, the auto slowdown has resulted in increased discounts. Put together, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities were factoring in a 3% decline in average price realizations, leading to a decline in revenues as well. But the company has managed to maintain realizations, which is a positive surprise.
Oddly though, despite this advantage and the backing of softening commodity prices, profit margins were slightly below expectations. The consensus estimate on the Street for operating profit margin stood at 11.5%, while Ashok Leyland reported margins of 11.1%.
“It makes sense to compare Ashok Leyland’s margin performance to that of Tata Motors’ India performance,"" says an analyst at an institutional brokerage firm, who declined to be named. “By that measure, the former’s performance looks good because it reported a sequential improvement in margins from 10.3% in the December quarter, while Tata Motors reported a 200 basis points drop in margins on a stand-alone basis.""
But as Tata Motors Ltd had highlighted in its call with analysts post-results, demand remains a challenge in the near term. Liquidity constraints faced by non-banking financial companies and increase in tonnage post-new axle load norms have hit sales since the second half of FY19, and these constraints still apply.
Of course, post-elections, investors are hoping for a quick resolution to the liquidity crisis, as well as a boost for infrastructure. These, coupled with the new BS-VI norms, should aid demand for new CVs. Such a thesis has driven Ashok Leyland shares in recent trading sessions. But the fact that the shares are still considerably lower than a year ago means that investors are still being cautious"
182,2019-05-30,Tata Motors,"Jaguar’s other numbers looked dismal – profits were down and debt was up from a year earlierOver the years, the company pushed a large volume of cars into the mainland market, offering some models at steep discounts

Cash is fungible. So if a company suddenly has $1 billion more of it, does it matter where it comes from? For Jaguar Land Rover, it should.
In its latest results, the iconic U.K. car company, owned by Tata Motors Ltd., posted around 1.4 billion pounds of free cash flow ($1.77 billion). That's a sharp turnaround from a running cash-burn rate of more than 500 million pounds per quarter over the last two years, and around negative 2.7 billion pounds over the last nine months alone. The company attributed the sharp rise to its efforts to manage working capital, including inventory reductions.
Meanwhile, Jaguar’s other numbers looked dismal – profits were down and debt was up from a year earlier. Free cash flow was “the only positive in these results,"" Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts wrote in a note.
With a jump in cash flow that big, it’s worth asking how Jaguar pulled it off – particularly given its checkered performance in China.
Over the years, the company pushed a large volume of cars into the mainland market, offering some models at steep discounts. That ended up clogging inventory channels and burdening dealers. Around 70% of them lost money in the third quarter. At the same time, roughly 40% of the company’s dealers were based in tier 3 to tier 5 cities, and have been operating for less than three years. It takes a good deal more than an inexperienced staff to sell luxury cars in China’s poorest urban areas.
Jaguar has also spent aggressively on research and development and capital expenditure, with investment outlays comprising almost a fifth of total revenue. The company’s debt burden ticked up in tandem – to 4.5 billion pounds over the past year – and its leverage ratio rose to 2.3 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization from 1.3 times at the end of last year.
To shore up the quarters of cash burn, Jaguar reduced spending and made around 100 million pounds in profit in the fourth quarter. Part of it was seasonal, too. But another maneuver also helped the company manage its working capital.
The company expanded a so-called factoring facility – a working-capital loan – to $700 million from $295 million. For this to work, a company sells its receivables at a discount to raise money. When the dealer pays the company back, it can then repay its lenders. There’s a steep cost associated with this, of course. Such facilities are also typically used for fast-moving, high-margin businesses that can absorb the cost of the debt (and fees to lenders) – a position Jaguar isn’t in.
The company’s larger secured loan facility is essentially backed by cars it sells to dealers. According to the prospectus, that applies to Land Rovers and Range Rovers. It immediately drew down more than $500 million from this loan, on top of $150 million previously. That facility can’t be expanded without new banks and is capped at $800 million. As a result, cash in hand rose to 3.8 billion pounds from 2.5 billion.
It’s fairly common for companies to use working-capital management strategies. For Jaguar, however, its volatile liquidity position makes this unsustainable. If China’s car market doesn’t turn around, it’s unclear when the receivables will get paid back. The longer repayment stretches out, the larger the fees. Prospects of significantly higher margins are also dim, which means such financing will become more expensive. Already such expenses have been growing. Starting next quarter, the receivables facility will be accounted as sold instead of debt.
In its results, the U.K. unit said it had other funding avenues, including secured ones like export credit-agency funding, new finance leases and even new bond issues. But tapping a secured facility – and immediately using it up – speaks for itself. It also points to Jaguar’s difficulty tapping capital markets: Getting unsecured funding depends on a company’s liquidity position. Funding is only going to get tighter. A $500 million bond matures in November this year while another $500 million matures in March 2020. The first quarter is seasonally tighter when it comes to cash, to boot.
A cash boost in one quarter doesn’t do much for the looming operational and financial issues Jaguar faces over the next year. Bondholders should hope the company has better news at its investor day next week.

179,2019-06-06,Tata Motors,"Tata plans to make inroads into small towns, rural pockets and even villages where not a single car has been sold so farTata Motors is also re-aligning its digital strategy due to the growing influence of digital medium

Tata Motors Ltd has started work on its Turnaround 2.0 plan for passenger vehicles, focused on making deeper forays into India’s hinterland and a more than doubling of its retail network.
The plans involve making inroads into smaller towns, rural pockets and even villages where not a single car has been sold so far. Tata Motors is also re-aligning its digital strategy due to the growing influence of digital medium in guiding decisions of potential buyers.
Mayank Pareek, president of the passenger vehicle business at Tata Motors, said Turnaround 2.0 plan for passenger vehicles involves working on both product and geographic footprints. “Good products are essential but not sufficient for winning a market like India,"" he said.
Rural markets comprise 35% of total passenger vehicle sales at Tata Motors, India’s fourth-largest carmaker.
The company. which is developing vehicles based on the Omega and Alfa platforms, has devised an aggressive strategy to grow its pan-India retail footprint starting with Tier I and II cities.
Tata Motors has a network of 865 outlets, which according to Pareek, covers only 60% of the available domestic market. “We plan to increase our reach through 2,000 outlets in the next three years while the existing network needs to improve its efficiency at sales,"" he said.
Pareek, who is known for driving Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s retail expansion in his previous stint, split the domestic market into about 651,000 villages, more than 3,800 tehsils and over 650 districts.
“Converting one buyer from each of those villages per year is the plan. We are specifically targeting members who have the ability to pay, like a shopkeeper, who is also a local banker, lends live credit, has his own stock of goods, is one of the most informed residents and also knows about the financial capabilities of his fellow residents in the village,"" explained Pareek, who claims to have travelled to 600 of the 650 districts in his 30 years of working in this sector.
Under its rural matrix, the company is identifying potential car buyers using factors such as a farmer with at least five acres of land ownership or a household owning a tractor.
“There are no proven business models to succeed in a rural market. We meet the regional rural banks to understand the financial capabilities of a specific region,"" he said.
“A granite polisher of Hosur is hardly affected by a bad monsoon. He mines granite, cuts it and sells it. Identifying such microsegments is tough. We are working on 500 such microsegments,"" he said.
Tata Motors is opening new emerging market outlets, which it calls e-outlets, to cater to new belts, including villages where no car has been sold till now.
“I have asked my team to sell one car per village in about 50,000 such villages every year. We will figure out how to work out the finance for them. So, we will have a huge command area concept,"" Pareek said.
For the urban and semi-urban belts, the company is planning a digital push to tap into large base of smartphone users. It is also working on virtual showrooms.
“Our data says that a customer visiting a store already knows more about the market than the salesman selling the car. The bulk of this research is done online. He is just visiting the showroom to smell the rubber and test-drive the vehicle,"" said Pareek, who disclosed plans to set up small digital showrooms in public places such as shopping malls.
Tata Motors is working with group companies and other partners to drive its digitization strategy. Digital enquiry conversion to final sales has increased from 0.5% from 18 months ago to 6.5% in March 2019, according to Pareek.
“Our customer (store) walk-in conversion rate is 17%. Our digital conversion rate will jump to 17-18% in 12-18 months. Digital enquiries are mostly coming from tier I and II cities. 14% of our sales are coming from digital medium,"" he revealed.
On the product side, he said that the company aims to serve 90% of all available segments in the next 3 years, against only 50-55% at present, on the back of incoming products, including premium hatchback Altroz. The company’s passenger vehicle division, which reported break-even at Ebitda level in FY19, plans to have 12-14 nameplates in its passenger vehicle portfolio in three years."

LONDON :
US automaker Ford is preparing to close its engine plant in south Wales in September 2020 in a ""hammer blow"" to more than 1,500 workers there, Britain's GMB union said on Thursday.
The move was to be confirmed at a meeting Thursday between company officials and union leaders, with a formal announcement from Ford expected later in the day, according to media reports.
""We're hugely shocked by today's announcement, it's a real hammer blow for the Welsh economy and the community in Bridgend,"" GMB regional organiser Jeff Beck said in a statement.
""Regardless of today's announcement GMB will continue to work with Ford, our sister unions and the Welsh government to find a solution to the issue and mitigate the effects of this devastating news."" Workers were being given the news at briefings inside the plant and are then expected to leave for the day.
Ford has operated the plant in Bridgend, just west of the Welsh capital Cardiff, for decades and it remains one of the region's major employers.
But the American auto giant announced last month it was cutting 7,000 jobs worldwide -- 10 per cent of its global salaried workforce -- as part of a reorganisation.
The news of Bridgend's pending closure is the latest blow to the British car industry.
Honda has announced plans to shut its plant in Swindon in central England in 2021, while fellow Japanese car-maker Nissan reversed a decision to build its new X-Trail vehicle at its Sunderland plant.
Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India's Tata Motors, is also shedding jobs in Britain as the industry a whole faces up to huge challenges, including the switch to electric vehicles.

177,2019-06-11,Tata Motors,"Sales of passenger vehicles and medium and heavy commercial vehicles contracted 20.6% and 19.7%, respectively, in May, higher than 17.1% and 13.6% in AprilMaruti Suzuki India, Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Skoda Auto and Honda Cars India have had to trim production

Tumbling auto sales in May reinforce the gloom surrounding auto firms. Data released by the Society for Indian Automobile Manufacturers Ltd on Tuesday showed a drop in domestic wholesales numbers across segments. This reinforces a weak demand sentiment in the market, even as it implies high inventory and weaker retail sales.
It looks like passenger vehicles (PV) and medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCVs) were worst hit. Sales in May contracted sharply by 20.6% and 19.7% from the year-ago period in these two segments, higher than 17.1% and 13.6% seen in the month of April. That’s not all. Over the past week, seven out of top ten PV firms have announced prodution cuts for the month of June. If some have called it a routine maintenance shutdown, others have stated their intent to align production with dealer inventory levels.
Media reports indicate that PV leaders such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd in the listed universe along with others such as Skoda Auto and Honda Cars India have had to trim production.
In M&HCVs, the fall was led by Tata Motors’ 38% decline, year on year, while Ashok Leyland sales saw a small single-digit contraction.
According to Arya Sen of Jefferies India Pvt Ltd, two-wheeler sales dropped too, but it was less painful than in the month of April.The delayed marriage season helped to improve motorcycle sales during this period.
Yet, there are concerns of production cuts in two-wheelers too, in the future months. Inventory is over 45 days for most companies. Some analysts reckon that the cost of ownership due to new technological compliances will hurt two-wheeler users the most, unless companies bear the burden of higher costs.
According to dealers, the trend has not improved so far in June. Another bad month will imply a weak June quarter performance by auto firms. As such, the Nifty auto index has been toeing the line of falling sales. It is down 25% in a year compared to the Nifty, which has risen by about 10%."
176,2019-06-12,Tata Motors,"What’s worrisome is that in May, sales fell across regions, unlike in earlier months where poor China sales had dragged overall performanceIf the slowdown in other markets continues, it may again raise concerns on Tata Motors’ financial performance in FY20

Jaguar Land Rover Ltd, the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors Ltd, is not out of the woods yet. The 12.2% sales decline in May makes it the twelfth consecutive month of falling sales for the luxury carmaker.
What’s worrisome is that in May, sales fell across regions, unlike in earlier months where poor China sales had dragged overall performance.
True, the magnitude of sales decline in China is moderating. At 26.4% year-on-year, the drop in China sales is lower than the 46.7% drop in April, and the steep decline of 51% in the March quarter. But trade tensions and weak domestic consumer demand continues to haunt the region.
Adding to Jaguar Land Rover’s cup full of woes is the U-turn in sales in the UK, North America and Europe in May, snapping the improving trend in these regions.
The company’s media release said that higher retail sales of the new models and the all-electric I-Pace were offset by lower sales of other models, primarily in China.
If the slowdown in other markets continues, it may again raise concerns on Tata Motors’ financial performance in FY20. Jaguar Land Rover seemed to be on a recovery path, especially after the March quarter results announcement, which were better than forecasts. Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin of 10.5% was better on a sequential basis by nearly 130 basis points. Of course, margin improvement was mainly due to cost-cutting measures, such as workforce reduction, and lower advertising and marketing expense.
In a note to clients, brokerage firm JM Financial Services Pvt. Ltd said that Jaguar Land Rover has guided for negative free cash flows in the June quarter due to seasonality and plant shutdown (over Brexit woes).
Against this backdrop, plummeting commercial vehicle and passenger vehicle sales on the home ground is an additional drag for Tata Motors’ consolidated performance.
On the whole, it is still raining bad news for Tata Motors. Analysts have steadily been trimming earnings forecasts over the last several quarters. Bloomberg’s estimate for FY20 earnings per share is down from  ₹40.60 on 1 April 2018, to  ₹17.40 on 11 June 2019.
While Tata Motors’ shares made a relief rally after the announcement of the March quarter results, they are likely to continue the long-drawn underperformance for some more quarters. The stock has fallen 43% from a year ago compared to the 10% rise in the benchmark Nifty 50 Index."

Asian stocks stuttered on Thursday, dogged by uncertainty over an intractable US-China trade dispute, while oil prices flirted with five-month lows due to higher US crude inventories and a bleak demand outlook.

Back home, India’s factory output picked up in April to hit a six-month high, while retail inflation accelerated at the fastest pace in seven months in May, but is still within the central bank’s tolerance level, leaving scope for more rate cuts. Data released by the National Statistical Office showed the index of industrial production (IIP) expanded at 3.4% in April from 0.3% a month ago, while retail inflation quickened to 3.05% in May from 2.99% in the previous month.

At 26.4% year-on-year, the drop in China sales is lower than the 46.7% drop in April, and the steep decline of 51% in the March quarter.
Meanwhile, crude oil tumbled 4% to its lowest settlements in nearly five months, pressured by another unexpected rise in US crude stockpiles and by a dimming outlook for global oil demand. Brent crude futures barely moved at $60.01 in early trade after a 3.7% slide on Wednesday to $59.97 a barrel, the international benchmark's lowest close since January 28.
US West Texas Intermediate crude futures firmed up slightly to $51.29 per barrel, compared to the previous day's close of 50.72 a barrel, its weakest settlement since January 14.
Data showed on Wednesday US consumer prices barely rose in May, with core annual inflation slowing to 2.0%, compared to a peak of 2.4% last July, adding to the growing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut in coming months. Investors will be looking to what Fed policymakers will say after its next policy meeting on 18-19 June with Fed Funds rate futures pricing in a 25-basis-point rate cut for the subsequent policy review on 30-31 July.
The 10-year US Treasuries yield dipped to 2.12%, a tad above Friday's 2.053%, its lowest level since September 2017 while the two-year yield fell to 1.887%.
Bond yields have plunged worldwide in the past several weeks as investors bet the Fed, and possibly other major central banks, will cut rates to cushion the potential economic damage from the US-China trade standoff.
Hopes that the leaders of the two countries will clinch a deal on the sideline of Group of 20 summit meeting in Osaka on 28-29 June have been fading as neither side has shown a willingness to compromise.
Major currencies saw limited moves, and traders say few were placing big bets ahead of key events later this month including the Fed's policy review and the G20 meeting. The euro slipped to $1.1293, stepping back from 2-2.5-month highs of $1.1348 touched on Friday. The dollar was little changed 108.47 yen.
The British pound is on the back foot after British lawmakers defeated an attempt led by the opposition Labour Party to try to block a no-deal Brexit by seizing control of the parliamentary agenda from the government. Sterling fetched $1.2693, not far from this week's low of $1.2653.

172,2019-06-19,Tata Motors,"For shares with differential voting rights to be issued in India, various laws need to be amended

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) recently issued a consultation paper on shares with differential voting rights (DVRs), inviting comments on the proposals in a report of the DVR Group formed by Sebi’s Primary Market Advisory Committee. With this, Sebi has enlivened the debate on the introduction of dual class shares in India.
DVR shares are a class of corporate shares with fractional, or superior voting rights, than ordinary equity shares. They are apt for companies whose owners do not want to dilute their control over their businesses by issuing ordinary equity shares. By issuing DVR shares with fractional voting rights, they can raise capital without the risk of a hostile takeover. Similarly, by issuing themselves DVR shares with superior voting rights, promoters can retain control even as the regular equity base expands.
Currently, as per Section 43(a)(ii) of the Companies Act, 2013, a limited-liability company may have equity share capital with differential rights on voting, or dividends, or otherwise. Further, Rule 4 of the Companies (Share Capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014, prescribes certain conditions, which need to be fulfilled to issue shares with differential rights. Further, Sebi’s listing obligations and disclosure requirement regulations, 2015, prohibit companies from issuing shares with superior voting rights. DVR shares have not been an attractive method of raising capital in India. Only a few companies, such as Pantaloons and Tata Motors, have issued DVR shares so far. The consultation paper, however, recommends that both fractional rights (FRs) and superior rights (SRs) be allowed.
The key recommendations of the DVR Group on FR shares are as follows:
1. On the first-time issue of FR shares, the companies whose shares have been listed and traded for one year shall be permitted to issue FR shares by way of: A rights issue, a bonus issue pro rata to all equity shareholders, and a follow-on public offer (FPO).
2. On the subsequent issue of FR shares, a company that has already listed FR shares shall be eligible to make a rights or bonus issue of FR shares of the same class.
3.On Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP), or a preferential issue, a company whose FR shares have been listed for at least one year shall be eligible to do a preferential issue or QIP of FR shares of the same class.
4. The face value of FR shares shall be the same as ordinary equity shares.
5. The FR shares shall not exceed a voting ratio of 1:10. The company can have only one class of FR shares with ratio ranging from 1:2 to 1:10.
6. Additional dividends can be paid per FR share compared to dividends on ordinary equity shares.
7. FR shares can be extinguished only through a buy-back or reduction of capital.
The key recommendations on SR shares by companies whose equity shares are proposed to be listed are as follows:
1. Such shares can be issued only to promoters of an unlisted company. An unlisted company where promoters hold SR shares shall be permitted to hold an Initial Public Offer (IPO) of only ordinary equity shares provided the SR shares are held by the promoters for more than one year prior to the filing of a draft order document with Sebi.
2. Once the ordinary equity shares are listed, the company will not be allowed to issue SR shares to any person.
3. All SR shares shall remain under a perpetual lock-in after the IPO.
4. The face value of SR shares shall be same as that of ordinary equity shares.
5. No third-party interest, such as lien, etc., will be allowed to be created over SR shares.
6. The company will be allowed to issue only one class of SR shares with the voting ratio ranging from 2:1 to 10:1.
7. Post IPO, SR shares shall be eligible for the same dividend and other rights as ordinary equity shares, except for superior voting rights.
8. Post listing, the voting rights with the promoters through the SR shares and ordinary equity shares shall not exceed 75% of the total voting rights.
9. Post IPO, SR shares will be treated as ordinary equity shares in terms of voting rights in the specified circumstances.
10. SR shares shall get converted into ordinary equity shares on the fifth anniversary of the listing of the firm’s ordinary shares. The validity is, however, extendable by another 5 years with the approval of shareholders by way of a special resolution in a general meeting.
Apart from the above, the paper lists amendments to be made in various laws, such as the Companies Act, Takeover Code, and Sebi (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, in order to bring DVR shares into effect.
With India becoming a hub of tech startups, we could adopt the norms that prevail overseas, especially in the US, where Facebook, Google etc. have introduced shares of different classes to raise capital. It would give Indian promoters of fast-growth businesses an option to raise capital without diluting control over their enterprises. Hence, Sebi’s effort is worthy of appreciation.
However, with numerous amendments required in law, it appears that there is still a long way to go before the above discussed model is actually available to companies in India. It will be interesting to watch Sebi push through these amendments with various regulators.

171,2019-06-20,Tata Motors,"Moody's today downgraded Tata Motors' credit rating by a notch on the floundering performance of its British subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR)The corporate family rating and the company's senior unsecured instruments rating have also been downgraded to 'Ba3' from 'Ba2', with a negative outlook

Mumbai: Moody’s Investor Service has downgraded Tata Motors Limited’s (TML) corporate family ratings (CFR) and the company’s senior unsecured instruments rating to Ba3 from Ba2. The downgrade, according to the rating agency, is led by weak performance of TML’s 100% subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR).
""The downgrade reflects the sustained deterioration in TML's credit profile, with weaker than anticipated credit metrics — led by the weak performance of JLR and our expectation that it will take longer than we had previously expected for the company's free cash flows to return to positive territory,"" says Kaustubh Chaubal, a Moody's Vice President and Senior Credit Officer.
According to Chaubal, the negative outlook on TML's ratings reflects the execution risks related to the timely turnaround of JLR's operations, primarily in China, amid subdued global environment, driven by rising competition, no-deal Brexit scenario, possibility of US tariffs and the ongoing weakness in diesel car sales in Europe and the UK. Furthermore, adoption of electric and hybrid vehicle technologies along with other disrupting trends such as connectivity, shared mobility and autonomous cars in the automotive industry demands continued investments thereby putting JLR’s free cash flow under pressure. Notably, with annual revenues of  ₹223,514 crore in FY19, JLR accounted for about 75% of Tata Motors consolidated revenues.
In line with that, Moody’s has also downgraded the CFR of JLR to B1 from Ba3 and the probability of default rating (PDR) to B1-PD from Ba3-PD. Concurrently, the rating agency has also downgraded the instrument ratings on the bonds to B1 from Ba3, keeping its outlook negative.
""The downgrade reflects Moody's expectation that leverage will remain elevated and free cash flow negative for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 as JLR seeks to turn around performance in China, executes its restructuring program and continues to invest in its future model line-up including electrification"", said Tobias Wagner, vice-president and Senior Analyst at Moody's. JLR had reported investment of GBP 3.8 billion in R&D, product development and expanding manufacturing footprint during the last fiscal.
“JLR accounted for 63% of consolidated debt for Tata Motors, based on Moody's adjustments. Given these large contributions, the weakening credit metrics at JLR have a direct and immediate impact on the group's consolidated results and weigh on TML's credit profile,"" the credit rating agency said.
Meanwhile, the demand slowdown in India, tightening liquidity, overcapacity and a shrinking dealer network has also impacted Tata Motor’s downgrade. The company had reported 15% growth in its wholesales (including exports) to 732,428 units in FY19 driven by new product launches, which along with cost rationalization, powered TML’s passenger vehicle (PV) division achieve EBIDTA breakeven during the last fiscal.
For FY20, Moody’s expects revival in auto demand on the back of stable government at the center, likely normal monsoon, stable fuel prices and anticipated pre-buying ahead of implementation of the BSVI emission norms from 1 April 2020.
JLR’s sales were down 12% to 42,370 units in May and 10% to 240,471 units during January – May period. Meanwhile, Tata Motors Group global wholesales in May 2019, including JLR, were at 82,374 units, down 23% year-on-year. Going forward, TML’s management, under JLR’s turnaround plan, aims to improve cash flow by about GBP 2.5 billion on the back of reducing capex (GBP 1 billion), inventory correction and working capital improvement (GBP 0.5 billion) and improving profitability (GBP 1 billion) by end FY20."

Mumbai: Indian equity markets are likely to be volatile ahead of Futures and Options (F&O) expiry of June series next week while global cues are mixed. Investors may also be cautious ahead of the GST Council meet late today.
Asian stocks struggled on Friday to track Wall Street's exuberance about a possible US rate cut next month as anxiety over the Sino-US trade negotiations clouded the investor mood in the region. Also tempering appetite in Asia were fresh worries about Middle East tensions, after Iran shot down a US military drone, raising fears of a military confrontation between Tehran and Washington and pushing the crude oil price higher.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.1%. The index was up 4% on the week, during which it brushed its highest level since 8 May. Japan's Nikkei was flat, capped by the yen's big surge.
The S&P 500 hit a record high on Thursday after this week's US Federal Reserve meeting boosted expectations that the central bank will cut interest rates as soon as next month to keep the US-China trade war from stalling economic growth. The Fed signaled easing after the conclusion of its policy setting meeting on Wednesday, saying it was ready to battle growing global and domestic economic risks.
Investors have pinned hopes on the United States and China reaching some sort of compromise at the sidelines of the G20 summit in Japan on 28-29 June.
In the domestic market, after rising over 100% on Thursday, shares of Jet Airways will be in focus today. The Mumbai bench of the NCLT admitted the debt-laden air carrier on Thursday for bankruptcy proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The tribunal, which will hear the case next on 5 July, ordered the insolvency resolution professional (IRP) to complete the IBC process in three months, even though the law allows six months, saying “the matter is of national importance"".
Shares of Tata Motors are likely to be in negative terrain as Moody’s has downgraded the auto major's corporate family ratings (CFR) and the company’s senior unsecured instruments rating to Ba3 from Ba2. The downgrade, according to the rating agency, is led by weak performance of TML’s 100% subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR).
In the currency markets, the prospect of US interest rates being lowered put the dollar squarely on the defensive. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies struggled near a two-week low of 96.567 brushed the previous day. The index has fallen roughly 1% this week.
The greenback has fallen 1.1% versus the yen this week and traded near a six-month low of 107.21 yen. The euro was steady at $1.1295 after popping up to an eight-day high of $1.1317 in the previous session. The single currency was headed for a weekly gain of 0.75%.
With the Fed expected to ease policy soon, and with other central banks such as the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan seen following in their wake, government bonds were on a bullish footing. The benchmark 10-year US. Treasury yield surged in price and its yield fell below 2% for the first time in 2-1/2 years on Thursday. It last stood at 2.016%.
The German 10-year bund yield touched a record low of minus 0.329% this week while Japan's 10-year yield fell to a near three-year trough of minus 0.185% overnight.
Crude oil rose to three-week highs after Iran shot down a US military drone, raising fears of about fresh conflict in the Middle East. US crude oil futures were up 0.58% at $57.40 per barrel after rallying more than 5% the previous day.

169,2019-06-23,Tata Motors,"The downgrade of Tata Motors stems from the floundering fortunes of its cash cow Jaguar Land RoverNote that JLR, which has been Tata Motors’ cash cow, is caught in a quagmire in China

International rating agency Moody’s Investors Service had a double whammy in store for Tata Motors Ltd. It has downgraded its ratings for both the parent company and its subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover Ltd (JLR). What’s more, this is the third downgrade for JLR and second for Tata Motors in less than a year.
Moody’s downgraded JLR’s corporate family rating from Ba3 to B1 and, that of the parent from Ba3 to Ba2. Indeed, the negative shift in the rating agency’s stance is not surprising, given that both JLR’s car sales in global markets and the stand-alone entity’s commercial vehicle sales are precariously poised. Indeed, as the chart alongside shows, Tata Motors’ equity shares had captured the decline in the company’s fortunes far earlier.
Note that JLR, which has been Tata Motors’ cash cow, is caught in a quagmire in China. The first downgrade from Moody’s in July 2018 was after sales in China suddenly hit the skids in June. This happened after many rounds of upgrades in earlier years.
Though the decline in China has now eased, the tide turned unfavourable in May, with sales declining in other markets such as the US, the UK and Europe.
As a result, the overall 13.5% year-on-year sales decline in May dampened investor sentiment, after a brief recovery that followed the better-than-expected March quarter results.
JLR’s downgrade reflects the rating agency’s expectation that debt/Ebitda or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Moody’s adjusted numbers) is likely to hold above five times for fiscal years 2020 and 2021, while free cash flow is likely to be materially negative. In addition, the need to invest in hybrid and electric vehicles would pile up pressure on profitability and cash flows. Besides, risks to sales growth would arise from a potential “no-deal Brexit"" or from US tariffs.
Meanwhile, the downgrade of Tata Motors stems primarily from the floundering fortunes of JLR, which is its 100% subsidiary, accounting for most of its consolidated revenue, profit and debt.
“However, the last few months have seen India’s auto sector face challenges from slowing sales due to over-capacity, tightening liquidity and a shrinking dealer network,"" says Moody’s in the rating rationale.
The Street has already factored in these pain points. Brokerage firms have, over the last several months, steadily downgraded their FY20 and FY21 earnings forecasts, citing similar reasons.
A Nomura Research report dated 6 June says that high investments will keep free cash flows negative until FY21, even as JLR’s Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margins will be 3-4% in the short term (FY20-FY21). Also, Tata Motors’ stand-alone business is seeing a downtrend in medium and heavy commercial vehicles.
As pointed out earlier, Moody’s downgrade only affirms these concerns."

London: Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc has this month approached European investors via a bank for a potential new bond financing, according to people familiar with the matter.
Assessing appetite for a high-yield offering marks a shift from earlier in the year when Britain’s biggest automaker said that market conditions weren’t right for it to borrow from the bond market. Since then JLR has delivered its first profit in four quarters and the yield on its 4.5% euro notes due 2026 has narrowed to 6.8% from a record high of 9.4% in February, Bloomberg data show.
“We’ve always regularly monitored the capital market and issued bonds when market conditions were considered appropriate, and therefore continue to monitor the market on an ongoing basis,"" a JLR spokeswoman said in emailed comments on Wednesday.
The maker of the Land Rover Discovery SUV has £1.08 billion-equivalent ($1.38 billion) of maturing bonds over the next two years, including two $500 million bonds due in November 2019 and March 2020. Last week Moody’s Investors Service cut its rating on the company to B1 from Ba3, citing elevated leverage and negative free cash flow.
As of March, JLR had £3.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet and access to a fully undrawn £1.9 billion revolving credit facility due July 2022 with no financial covenants, according to Moody’s.
Funding options this financial year include the utilization of a new $700 million receivable financing facility and potential new financing such as export credit agency funding, certain finance leases and new bond issues, JLR’s spokeswoman said."

NEW DELHI :
Completing 10 years of operations in India, Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover is looking to accelerate its business in the country, building on the foundation laid in the last one decade, a top company official said Friday.
The company, which assembles six out of the 11 models that it sells in India, is open to more local manufacturing depending on the market growth of the luxury vehicles here in the country.
""The brands (both Jaguar and Land Rover) are strongly established in India now. That is helping us in making it aspirational brands. It has helped us in our journey in a big way,"" Jaguar Land Rover India President and Managing Director Rohit Suri told PTI.
Reiterating the company's strong performance, he claimed, ""One out of every four luxury SUVs sold (in the segments JLR is present) in India is ours.""
With over seven million followers on various social media platforms, he said JLR has been successful in connecting with a large population of people who aspire to own the brand one day.
Suri further said,""We started with almost 200 cars in the first year in 2009-10. We are in the range of almost 4,000 odd cars (annually) now, which in itself is quite an achievement.""
When asked about the outlook for future and the next milestone target, he said, ""We would like to double the pace but it can only happen when the overall market grows and the segment size grows.""
JLR's product portfolio in India ranges from the Jaguar XE sedan with starting price of  ₹40.61 lakh and going all the way up to the Range Rover priced at  ₹1.82 crore onwards.
Currently, it is locally manufacturing six vehicles at its facility in Pune. These are Jaguar XE, Jaguar XF, Jaguar F-PACE under the Jaguar portfolio and the Range Rover Evoque, Range Rover Velar and Discovery Sport under the Land Rover portfolio.
Asked if the company would consider increasing the number of locally manufactured models, Suri said,""This can grow provided the market grows. We are not assembling the higher-end models as volumes don't justify local manufacturing. We will be keenly looking forward to government support to expand this segment.""
To mark the completion of 10 years of operations in India, Suri said JLR has loaned a specially prepared Land Rover Discovery Sport to Rapid Response, an NGO that specialises in disaster management and relief, for disaster related relief work across India.
He said Land Rover vehicles, such as Discovery Sport, are renowned for their capability in tackling difficult terrains and situations caused by floods and other such catastrophic events and it will help Rapid Response in their efforts to help victims of such natural calamities in India.

164,2019-07-02,Tata Motors,"There were no exports of Nano in January-June period tooIn June last year, the company produced just one unit of the Nano and sold three units in domestic market

NEW DELHI :
Tata Motors has not produced its small car Nano since January this year, and not sold a single unit since February this year, according to regulatory filings by the company.
The company, however, said it has not taken a formal decision on stopping production of the entry-level car, which was once dubbed as the 'people's car' saying it continues to sell the car as per demand.
As per the filings by Tata Motors, the last time it produced Nano was in December 2018 when it rolled out 82 units from Sanand plant.
Since then, from January to June there was no production of Nano.
In terms of sales it was only in February, during January-June period, this year that Tata Motors sold one unit of the small car.
When asked if the company has finally decided to discontinue Nano, a Tata Motors spokesperson said no such decision has been taken yet.
""We are selling as per demand,"" the spokesperson said.
There were no exports of Nano in January-June period too.
In the past, Tata Motors has hinted that Nano production would be stopped from April 2020 as it has no plans to invest further on Ratan Tata's dream car to meet strict emission norm under BS-VI and upcoming new safety regulations.
In June last year, the company produced just one unit of the Nano and sold three units in domestic market.
After that, the company continued to produce Nano at Sanand plant based on market demand and has insisted that it hasn't taken a decision on the future of Nano.
Nano, which was unveiled in January 2008 at the Auto Expo with much expectations of being the people's car, could not live up to the billing. The car was launched in the market in March 2009 with an initial price of close to  ₹1 lakh for the basic model despite cost escalations, with Ratan Tata insisting that ""a promise is a promise""."
163,2019-07-05,Tata Motors,"CEO Ralf Speth says the future of mobility is electric and, the JLR is committed to make next generation of zero-emission vehicles in the UKJLR, which built 30% of the UK's 1.5 million cars last year, will make a range of electrified vehicles at its Castle Bromwich plant in central England

London: Jaguar Land Rover is making a multi-million pound investment to build electric vehicles in Britain, in a major boost for the UK government and a sector hit by the slump in diesel sales and Brexit uncertainty.
Britain's biggest car company, which built 30% of the UK's 1.5 million cars last year, will make a range of electrified vehicles at its Castle Bromwich plant in central England, beginning with its luxury saloon, the XJ.
""The future of mobility is electric and, as a visionary British company, we are committed to making our next generation of zero-emission vehicles in the UK,"" Chief Executive Ralf Speth said on Friday.
The announcement gives a boost to Britain's automotive sector hit this year by Honda and Ford's plans to close factories.
Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has highlighted the dangers of a no-deal Brexit and the need to maintain frictionless trade with the European Union, echoing warnings from the industry that just-in-time production could be hit by customs delays and additional bureaucracy.
But it has signed a deal with workers at the Castle Bromwich factory to go from a five-day to a four-day working week with the same amount of hours which should allow the plant to operate more efficiently.
Three of JLR's four European car plants are in Britain, giving it limited capacity elsewhere on the continent.
The other, in Slovakia, only opened last year and is still being ramped up with other models allocated there.
""We are making this investment because the ongoing Brexit uncertainty has left us with no choice, we had to act, for our employees and our business,"" JLR said.
""We are committed to the UK as our home and will fight to stay here but we need the right deal.""
Both candidates to replace Prime Minister Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, have both said they are prepared to take Britain out of the EU on 31 October without a deal, although it is not their preferred option.
Brexiteers have argued that the EU’s biggest economy Germany, which exports hundreds of thousands of cars to Britain ever year, would do its utmost to protect that trade
Friday's announcement comes after a turbulent few months for Jaguar which announced around 4,500 job cuts earlier in January and posted a 3.66 billion pound ($4.5 billion) loss in 2018/19.
The carmaker is undergoing a turnaround designed to offer an electrified option to all of its new models from 2020 as it seeks to move away from its reliance on diesel vehicles which are being increasingly shunned by buyers.
Jaguar also called on the government to bring giga-scale battery production to the country so that Britain is not left behind in the rush to produce low and zero-emissions vehicles and technology.
Britain's business minister Greg Clark said the government was doing all it can to meet that goal.
""We are determined to realise that ambition,"" he said."
162,2019-07-07,Tata Motors,"Sops in the budget will narrow the gap in ownership cost of EVs vis-à-vis petrol-, diesel-powered carsThe nudge comes at a time when many vehicle makers are set to hit the market with electric vehicles

Concessions in the Union Budget 2019 to push electric vehicles (EVs) to the fast lane were a bolt from the blue. Neither the industry nor analysts expected a battery of concessions to make EV ownership more viable.
On the contrary, the industry was hoping for incentives such as a lower goods and services tax (GST) rate or direct tax benefits that would boost consumer demand for sectors such as automobiles. The sector, particularly, has been languishing, with sales plummeting for almost a year.
The proposal to lower the GST rate for EVs from 12% to 5% and reduce customs duties on components reinforces the government’s commitment to move ahead on cleaner mobility.
A substantially higher tax exemption on loans incentivizes EV purchases as well.
These steps would help narrow the ownership gap between EVs and vehicles with ICE (internal combustion engine), according to Shailesh Chandra, president (electric mobility business and corporate strategy) at Tata Motors Ltd.
A good thing is that this nudge from the government comes at a time when many original equipment manufacturers across cars and two-wheelers such as Tata Motors, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hero MotoCorp Ltd and Bajaj Auto Ltd are set to hit the market with EVs.
The moot question is, whether the current budgetary incentives will steer customers towards buying EVs?
Analysts are not convinced. Yes, the GST cut, along with the customs-duty waiver on components, will bring down EV prices substantially, given that these cost at least 40-50% more than those of ICE vehicles.
However, even with the incentives on loans, analysts reckon that it would take EV owners twice the time to break-even on ownership costs compared to ICE vehicle owners. In other words, the cost of ownership is high even in entry-level segments.
According to Prayesh Jain, executive vice president at Yes Securities Ltd, “While the measures would narrow the cost difference between electric and internal combustion engine vehicles, the key impediment is the lack of charging infrastructure and availability of products with an adequate charging range at affordable prices. We still believe that the EV story in India is for the longer term.""
Besides, short-term woes have been mounting for auto firms. Volumes have contracted in double digits due to a plethora of issues that are still plaguing the sector.
Ebitda margin for most firms are likely to have declined by a steep 150-300 basis points in spite of softer commodity prices compared to the year-ago period. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
A report by Motilal Oswal Services Ltd forecasts a drop in the Ebitda margin for the fourth consecutive quarter for auto companies, leading the brokerage firm to cut FY20/FY21 earnings estimates of most companies it covers.
Thus, while the move to put EVs on the fast track is good, getting too excited about it will be a case of putting the cart before the horse."
161,2019-07-10,Tata Motors,"CLSA’s recent report said the firm’s warranty expenses and provisions ratio were at a nine-year high in FY19JLR’s June quarter sales has brought a flicker of hope for investors

Tata Motors Ltd’s shares fell 4% on Wednesday, reacting to foreign brokerage CLSA’s call to “sell"" the stock as cost concerns continued in a weak demand environment. However, a spark of hope with news of improved Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) sales in some regions saw the stock recover slightly.
JLR, the British subsidiary that contributes 75% of the consolidated revenue, largely drives sentiment for the stock. CLSA’s recent report said that warranty expenses and provisions ratio were at a nine-year high in FY19.
Consolidated warranty expenses, which are mainly reflective of JLR’s costs, rose significantly in FY19. They stood at 3.9% as a percentage of consolidated revenue, higher than earlier years. This has raised concerns over and above the existing problems of high fixed assets vis-à-vis sales, negative free cash flows and high automotive debt.
Rising warranty expenses have also raised questions about product quality. “In addition to industry issues of lower growth and higher incentives, there are company specific issues such as dealer training and profitability, as well as perceptions around quality,"" said a Deutsche Bank research report dated 7 June.
News reports had earlier said JLR had several product recalls in China because of product defects in 2017, leading to major concerns about product quality. “Management acknowledged that since JLR is a relatively young brand in China, a lot of structural issues were ignored when the market was booming between 2011 and 2015,"" said the Deutsche Bank report. Meanwhile, rising inventory in the stand-alone entity because of plummeting commercial vehicle sales has fuelled Tata Motors’ problems.
That said, JLR’s June quarter sales has brought a flicker of hope for investors. June quarter sales were 11.6% lower than the year-ago period, but the media release on Wednesday highlighted that while China sales fell year-on-year in June, they were up 23.1% compared to May. In the UK, sales set a new record for June despite industry sales being down 4.9%.
A report by Maybank Kim Eng Securities India Pvt. Ltd, conceded that the firm is facing multiple headwinds but is optimistic about the road ahead. “At JLR, the weakness in China is abating and we expect volume expansion to be supported by the success of the new Evoque, Range Rover/Sport, Discovery and Defender models now also available as plug-in hybrids.""
For FY20, Tata Motors has guided to an Ebit margin of 1-3% led by significant cost savings at JLR, a turnaround in its China business and continued profitable growth in India. Ebit stands for earnings before interest and tax.
Both the company and the stock have been battered by these strong headwinds. While the Nifty index gained 5.04% in a year, Tata Motors’ shares have plunged 44.9%. It remains to be seen if the recent recovery in sales is a blip or whether it will be sustainable."
160,2019-07-17,Tata Motors,"Commercial vehicles among the worst placed in auto slowdownThis is worrisome given that there was a drop in inventory in two-wheelers and passenger vehicles

Ashok Leyland Ltd announced this week a nine-day shutdown at its Pantnagar plant due to “weak demand and outlook for the industry."" Coming after a six-day shutdown in June, it reflects the ill fortune of the medium and heavy commercial vehicle (trucks) industry.
The second largest truck maker is not battling the slowdown alone. A spokesperson of commercial vehicles market leader Tata Motors Ltd said in response to a query from Mint, “The overall CV industry demand has softened. Production plans at our manufacturing locations are as per our plan and aligned to the market demand. Few days of the month are also being utilized for planned maintenance activities.""
Meanwhile, data on new vehicle registrations released on Tuesday by the Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA) shows that CVs were the worst hit by the slowdown in the auto sector. In June, while overall vehicle registrations dipped 5.4% year-on-year (yoy), registrations of CVs fell by a huge 19.3%.
Dealer inventory, too, rose from 45-50 days in May to 60-65 days in June. This is worrisome given that there was a drop in inventory in two-wheelers and passenger vehicles.
In this backdrop, a recovery is unlikely soon. As Jefferies India Pvt Ltd says in a note, “In MHCVs, the down-cycle started in 3QFY18 and is in its third quarter. Historically, MHCV down-cycles have averaged seven quarters with a range of 4-11 quarters.""
Another barometer of economic health, truck rentals, have been sliding since November. This is notwithstanding the rise in diesel prices, which would normally have been passed on fully. Besides, analysts believe that the transition to BS-VI norms, wh\ich is expected to increase vehicle prices by 10-15%, will play its part in delaying the demand revival in CVs. Recent data, in fact, shows that growth is slowing down even in the light CVs segment, which had hitherto bucked the trend.
These concerns are mirrored in the 25% drop in Ashok Leyland’s stock price since end-October last year, which is double the rate at which the Nifty auto index fell.
Note that Tata Motors stock has performed relatively better because its financials hinge on Jaguar Land Rover Ltd’s performance.
In sum, the odds are stacked heavily against a near term recovery for the commercial vehicles segment."

MUMBAI :
Tata Chemicals Ltd plans to set up a factory to make lithium-ion cells, said two persons directly aware of the matter, as it seeks to capitalize on the emerging electric vehicle (EV) industry in India.
The Tata group company, which recently demerged its fast-moving consumer goods business, also plans to undertake research and development on lithium-ion technology to develop suitable applications for the domestic market, especially the EV industry, said the two persons cited above, requesting anonymity.
According to the people mentioned above, Tata Chemicals will play a key role in the long-term plan of sister company Tata Motors Ltd to devise an EV ecosystem in India. They said Tata Chemicals has already acquired the land in Dholera town of Gujarat’s Ahmedabad district for the factory.
Details such as the investment towards the new factory and operational timelines could not be ascertained immediately.
“This (lithium-ion cell manufacturing) is a sector that we are exploring very actively,"" said a spokesperson for Tata Chemicals. The spokesperson however declined to comment on the proposed plant.
According to Tata Chemicals’ FY19 annual report, “the company intends to set up operations in li-ion batteries, battery actives and li-recycling, to cater to the growing EV revolution in India at the appropriate time"".
The factory is expected to augment Tata Motors’ ambitions to build a sustainable EV ecosystem. The Mumbai-based automaker, which has set up a dedicated EV business unit, is also working closely with other group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Tata AutoComp Systems and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) in this field.
In a 12 July interview, Shailesh Chandra, president, electric mobility business and corporate strategy, Tata Motors, said the intent of teaming up with group companies is to bank upon the specific individual strengths without losing focus on the core domain, ensuring faster time-to-market for the new generation EVs and building an ecosystem, which can support wider technology adoption in the domestic market.
“We are talking to Tata Chemicals on lithium-ion cell manufacturing, working with Tata Power on providing us with EV charging infrastructure. We have to localize EV parts and that’s where Tata AutoComp is helping us,"" Chandra said at the time.
Tata Motors is also working with Tata Motors Finance and Tata Capital to devise financing solutions, including vehicle leasing for the planned EV ecosystem. “We have this whole ecosystem of Tata companies working together to see if we can make it (EV ecosystem) work,"" Chandra said.
For the EV business, Tata Motors is working on identifying micro-markets such as the fleet segment across select cities to roll out its electric cars. It has supplied electric versions of its Tigor compact sedan to Mumbai’s Aaron Travels and Bengaluru’s Janani Tours. It is also in talks with Tata Power to build EV charging infrastructure across those select cities.
On the product side, it is capitalizing on the company’s Alpha and Omega passenger vehicle platforms. While the two modular platforms will spawn 12-14 vehicle models in three years, Tata Motors said both are also EV-ready. “These are electrification ready platforms and can accommodate higher range batteries into them,"" said Chandra, adding the company is also using the expertise of JLR in developing EVs.
Tata Motors is also leveraging TCS’ capabilities in developing BMS (battery management system) for EVs. “We have TCS helping us on BMS because they have been working on it with global manufacturers,"" Chandra had said."

For most part of the week, the India VIX was down. And this complacency coincided with the slew of unimpressive macro-economic data.

But as the week ended, the market started coming to terms with poor macro data, mixed earnings and subdued global cues. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman not providing any relief to foreign portfolio investors on the proposed surcharge also soured sentiment.
As a result, the Nifty shed 1.15% in this week and India VIX rose 4.31%. That said, on a calendar year-to-date basis, the India VIX is down 21.78%.
In the week ahead, the market's mood will depend largely on earnings performance of index heavy weights such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd, ICICI Bank, Tata Motors and Larsen & Toubro. Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Auto are some other blue-chips that will announce their June quarter earnings in the coming week. In the wake of ongoing consumption slowdown, commentary by consumer-focused companies on demand will be closely watched by investors.
Apart from earnings, progress of monsoon will also be closely tracked.
Globally, besides the US-China trade negotiations, expectations of deeper interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve are among the key cues. Investors will also monitor situation in the Middle East, after President Trump said a US Navy ship destroyed an Iranian drone in a defensive action in the Strait of Hormuz.
It should be noted that Nifty futures and options contract for the July series expires in the coming week. And the aforementioned factors are likely to keep volatility in Indian equities high."

155,2019-07-24,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors' downgrade follows a similar action taken on Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) on 16 July wherein the British carmaker, too, was given BB- rating with a negative outlookTata Motors' heavy reliance on JLR has been a long-standing concern for investors

MUMBAI :
Fitch Ratings has downgraded the Long Term Issuer Default Rating of Tata Motors Ltd (TML) to “BB-"" from “BB"". The ratings agency has also removed the automaker’s previous Rating Watch Negative (RWN) status, given to it on 6 February, as the outlook has turned negative on the concerns around TML’s profitability and free cash flow over the next 2-3 years.
TML’s downgrade follows a similar action on Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc on 16 July wherein the British carmaker too was given the BB- rating with a negative outlook.
Although Fitch noted that TML is likely to invest to consolidate its long-term competitiveness, it said it has revised the estimates due to increased business risks for the automaker’s India operations as well as for its JLR unit.
“This will result in sustained deterioration in TML’s financial profile, including its leverage,"" said Fitch in its report, which has rated TML on a consolidated basis including 100% of JLR.
TML’s heavy reliance on JLR has been a long-standing worry for investors. JLR contributed about 75% of TML’s consolidated revenue in FY19, thus dragging the parent’s profitability and free cash generation.
JLR, which is heavily impacted by the slowdown in demand for luxury passenger cars and sport-utility vehicles in China, already stands at the risk of stringent emission regulations in Europe and other global markets. Diesel variants contribute a sizable amount to JLR’s sales in Europe. On the electric vehicle front, JLR plans to offer EV variants for all of its existing models by 2020. However, Fitch report points out that any unexpected delays in the introduction of EVs could dampen JLR’s sales performance.
“In particular, JLR’s large investments to keep up with trends in emission regulations, alternative drive trains, automation and shared mobility, have magnified the underlying risk to TML’s cash flows and leverage,"" according to Fitch.
Meanwhile, for TML, the domestic market continues to be a key concern amid slowing sales of passenger as well as commercial vehicles. TML’s cumulative sales for the domestic market for Q1FY20 fell 20% at 131,879 units from 164,579 units a year earlier.
TML’s group global wholesales, which includes sales of JLR vehicles, fell 5% in June to 95,503 units. Last month, TML indicated a bigger concern for its commercial vehicle business as it recorded a 12% decline at 38,846 vehicles, including Tata Daewoo range on the group wholesales. Global wholesales of all passenger vehicles in June 2019 were at 56,657 units, up 1% YoY.
“We expect India’s auto sales volumes to stabilize gradually with the re-election of the government in May 2019, but prolonged weakness in sales would exert further pressure on leverage,"" Fitch said.
It is important to, however, note that TML’s standalone credit profile (SCP) rating is ‘B+’, which reflects its smaller scale and limited diversification when compared to its global peers. Fitch expects TML’s financial profile to remain weak on the back of expanding product range and production capabilities in a tough market scenario, incoming BS VI emission norms, price increases and other factors."

The broader NSE Nifty too shed 19.15 points or 0.17 per cent to settle at 11,252.15. During the day, the index hit a low of 11,239.35 and a high of 11,361.40.
Tata Motors was the biggest loser in the Sensex pack, cracking 4.56%, ahead of its quarterly results. Bajaj Finance, RIL, Yes Bank, NTPC and Tata Steel were among other top losers. 
On the other hand, gains in Vedanta, Sun Pharma, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, PowerGrid, TCS, Tech Mahindra and Infosys helped support the index.

150,2019-07-25,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors’ stand-alone business reported a net loss in the June quarterJaguar Land Rover reported losses at the Ebit level, which also came as a surprise

Things seem to be going from bad to worse for Tata Motors Ltd. Plunging sales across global markets, mounting losses, increasing capital expenses and heavy debt, along with a series of rating downgrades, have doused investor hopes of an improvement in FY20. While its subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover Ltd’s woes are well known, the fact that the stand-alone business reported net loss in the June quarter came as a double-whammy.
The company’s net consolidated loss of  ₹3,679.7 crore doubled from the year-ago period, and was twice the amount estimated by the Street. It was largely the cascading effect of negative operating leverage, as overall sales volumes dropped 21% year-on-year (yoy). Net revenue fell by 7.7% to  ₹61,467.3 crore, which beat estimates. Rising costs in a declining and highly competitive auto market dragged Ebitda margin down by 130 bps to 6.2% on a consolidated basis.
The pertinent question now is what lies ahead for the company.
Mitul Shah, vice-president research, Reliance Securities Ltd, said: “The results were highly disappointing. Earnings downgrade will continue, as in addition to the company’s woes, we expect tough business environment for the luxury car industry in global markets to continue for the next 1-1.5 years.""
To be sure, there are several concerns before investors and analysts. JLR’s June quarter sales break-up is still not very encouraging, even though the management reiterated that things are improving. In China, JLR’s sales dropped 29% y-o-y, steeper than the industry drop of 14%. The same is true for Europe and some other overseas markets. Recent analysts’ reports brought up issues of higher warranty costs, which imply product quality issues came back to haunt the company.
Even so, JLR’s loss before interest and tax, amounting to 2.5% of revenues, came as a surprise. The guidance of 3-4% Ebit margin for FY20 looks like a distant dream in that backdrop.
Another concern is the deepening auto slowdown in the domestic market. Heavy commercial vehicle sales dropped 30% y-o-y, even as overall sales of stand-alone operations fell by 22%. Again, stiff competition and poor scale of operations dragged Ebit margins down by 330 basis points (bps) to 0.8%. At this juncture, a recovery looks distant and the industry has pinned hopes on lower taxes and a policy announcement on vehicle scrappage to improve sales.
That is not all. The biggest concern was Tata Motors’ mounting net automotive debt, which was up at  ₹46,500 crore at the end of the quarter. Recently, Fitch Ratings had downgraded the company’s debt, which isn’t surprising given the performance. Analysts reckon that all these challenges will increase the cost of borrowing for Tata Motors, which could impact cash flows and profits in the final run."

Indian equity investors are likely to be on the sidelines on Thursday in the absence of any major trigger amid widespread pessimism. Asian shares were cautious on Thursday, shrugging off a tech-fuelled rally on Wall Street, while the euro hovered near two-month lows as soft economic data bolstered expectations of rate cuts in Europe.
Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.5% to nearly three-month high while Australia’s benchmark index hit a new 12-year top on Wednesday. South Korea’s KOSPI was the only index in the red as leading chipmakers shed recent gains amid trade tensions between Seoul and Tokyo. That left the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan broadly unchanged.
On Wall Street, tech companies led the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to record highs on Wednesday after Texas Instruments Inc hinted the slowdown in semiconductor demand would not be as long as feared.
Stock investors have generally been encouraged in recent days by hopes of some headway in trade negotiations between the United States and China, and expectations the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy soon.
Cementing such expectations, a series of purchasing manager index (PMI) readings in the US and Europe on Wednesday were weaker than expected.
Back home, shares of IndiGo are likely to be in focus as Rahul Bhatia, one of the two founders of InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, will not accept a dilution of his shareholder rights unless there is a compelling offer from his estranged partner Rakesh Gangwal, according to a Mint Report.
Credit rating agency Icra Ltd on Wednesday downgraded ratings on Yes Bank’s  ₹32,911.7 crore bond programme, citing an increase in stressed assets and lack of debt resolutions. The rating on bonds aggregating  ₹22,111.7 crore were downgraded by one notch, while that on  ₹10,800 crore of additional tier I (AT-I) bonds were downgraded by two notches.
Major companies which are expected to announce June quarter earnings on Thursday are Tata Motors, Bajaj Finance, Bank of Baroda, Ambuja Cements, Biocon, Bajaj Finserv, Tata Coffee, AU Small Finance Bank and South Indian Bank.
Market attention on Thursday will be squarely on the ECB rate decision after PMI data showed euro zone manufacturing contracted for the sixth straight month. That dragged the single currency to $1.1125, a level not seen since late-May. It was last at $1.1136.
In the US, manufacturing activity slowed to a 10-year low in early July with production volumes and purchases falling.
The dollar index, tracking the greenback against six major currencies, nudged lower to 97.683. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was a touch higher at 108.20.
The weak global backdrop saw bond prices racing with US 10-year yields off 3.3 basis points at 2.05%.
Sterling was last traded at $1.2484, after it fell for several sessions as market participants feared the looming possibility of a no-deal Brexit under Britain’s new prime minister, Boris Johnson.
In commodities, US crude added 12 cents to $56 per barrel while Brent crude climbed 4 cents to $63.20. Spot gold slipped a tad to $1,424.62 an ounce, just short of last week’s peak of $1,452.60.

153,2019-07-25,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors is expected to post a decline in consolidated revenue for Q1FY20 due to weak demand in the domestic market and a slowdown in China that has hit JLR global performanceJLR recently reported total sales of 128,615 units for Q1FY20, which was down 11.6% year-on-year

India’s largest commercial vehicle (CV) and fourth largest passenger vehicle (PV) manufacturer Tata Motors is expected to post a decline in its consolidated revenue for Q1FY20 due to weak demand in the domestic market and a slowdown in China that has hit Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) global performance.
On the domestic front, Tata Motors’ total PV sales stood at 42,034 units, down 29% year-on-year in April-June. Sales of CVs, the backbone of the company’s domestic business, reported a decline of 15% year-on-year to 89,845 units during the last quarter.
Meanwhile, JLR reported total sales of 128,615 units for Q1FY20, which was down 11.6% YoY.
According to Motilal Oswal Securities, Tata Motors’ consolidated revenue in April-June is estimated to decline 15% YoY and about 35% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), resulting in net loss of about  ₹11.8 billion against net loss of  ₹19 billion in Q1FY19 and a net profit of  ₹21.4 billion in Q4FY19.
The brokerage firm also expects JLR’s (including China joint venture) net realization to decline 1.6% YoY (+0.3% QoQ). It has estimated Tata Motors’ Q1FY20 EBIDTA margin at 7.4% compared with 7.6% in Q1FY19 and 9.3% in Q4FY19. JLR’s Q1FY20 EBIDTA margin is also estimated at 7.4% as against 6.2% in Q1FY19 and 9.8% in Q4FY19.
Edelweiss Securities has suggested that JLR’s China sales remains a key concern amidst its elevated capex in a weak demand environment. JLR’s sales in China, its biggest global market, declined more than 34% YoY in FY19, with the British carmaker facing headwinds in Europe as well. A number of internal factors including high fixed cost structures, dealer network profitability and high investments leading to cash outflows have hit some key financial metrics.
However, the company appears to be taking critical steps to revive its financial viability which include meeting pre-determined cost reduction targets, optimizing material and other development expenses (for example, alliance with BMW on development of electric vehicle technologies), launching new products among others.
Back home, Tata Motors has lined up at least 3-5 product launches including new variants, which improves the outlook for its sales performance over the coming quarters. Edelweiss report points out that strong focus on cost reduction via consolidating platforms and supplier base, and creating a flat organisational structure should cushion cash outflows.

151,2019-07-26,Tata Motors,"Total consolidated revenue fell 8% y-o-y and 29% sequentially to  ₹60,830 croreCV, PV biz posts Q1FY20 revenue of  ₹14,309 crore, down from  ₹17,290 crore a year earlier

NEW DELHI :
Tata Motors Ltd (TML) has nearly doubled its consolidated net loss in the June quarter weighed down by woes at its Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) unit and a slowdown in the automobile industry in India.
The Mumbai-based automaker posted a net loss of  ₹3,680 crore in the three months ended 30 June, compared with a year-earlier loss of  ₹1,863 crore.
Consolidated revenue from operations fell 8% year-on-year (y-o-y) and 29% sequentially to  ₹60,830 crore.
TML’s commercial vehicle (CV) and passenger vehicle (PV) businesses put together reflect a bigger decline in segment-specific revenues when compared with that of JLR. The CV and PV businesses posted Q1FY20 revenue of  ₹14,309 crore, declining from  ₹17,290 crore a year earlier. In comparison, JLR’s Q1FY20 revenue fell to  ₹45,661 crore from Q1FY19 revenue of  ₹48,215 crore.
This shows that the British carmaker has been able to narrow the losses it has been accumulating for some time, as a result of continued cost-cutting steps such as savings from employee exits, material costs, lower capex, and tightening of working capital needs.
“Q1FY20 was the worst in terms of market demand as the slowdown turned out to be more than what was anticipated. The first quarter saw stress in liquidity and financing for CVs and PVs. However, this should ease out now,"" said P.B. Balaji, chief financial officer, Tata Motors. The demand environment in the China market, the single-biggest for JLR where the carmaker had reported a sharp drop of 34% y-o-y in sales in FY19, is turning stable as the company continued to make interventions, Balaji said.
“We have been correcting inventory, working on dealer profitability and focusing on retail growth on the back of new product launches. All these fundamental interventions made by us is resulting in turning the China business stable,"" Balaji said.JLR is slated to introduce the Discovery Sport in China next month, and the Defender, which is expected to be rolled out in September. JLR reported total sales of 128,615 units for Q1FY20, 11.6% lower from the year earlier.
On the domestic front, the total PV sales of Tata Motors declined 29% y-o-y to 42,034 units in the June quarter. Sale of CVs, the backbone of the domestic business, reported a decline of 15% y-o-y to 89,845 units last quarter. This translated into a more than 20% y-o-y decline in the company’s CV revenue to  ₹11,079 crore.
Revenue from the PV business dropped 6% in the quarter to  ₹3,188 crore. This clearly reflects that the slowdown in CV sales is a bigger worry for the company than PVs, which are faring relatively better on the back of its new SUVs such as Harrier and Nexon.
Weak consumer sentiments, liquidity stress, and the implementation of axle load norms has particularly impacted sales of medium and heavy CVs in the domestic market.
“The Ebitda for PVs is at 1.2% despite a decline of 7% in retail and 30% in wholesale numbers. This only reflects that our Turnaround 2.0 strategy is bearing fruit. Besides tightly controlling the inventory, we have also simplified the supply chain as we will focus on retail over wholesale,"" said Balaji, who estimates 3-4% Ebitda margins for Tata Motors and JLR over the next 2 years. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Balaji expects the current liquidity squeeze in India to improve in the coming quarters on the back of government intervention. The government in the 2019 budget has provided credit guarantee to state-run banks to buy high-quality loans from non-banking financial companies."

""We see all of this as a big opportunity. I am also happy to say that TCS will continue to expand in the state,"" he said.
Chandrasekaran said, ""I remember that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath got very worked up, when there was a news item that TCS is exiting Lucknow, and we made a commitment to him saying that we will not leave the state, or leave the city of Lucknow and that we are already present in the state with 10,000 people.

MUMBAI :
Hit hard by the continuing volume slowdown and mounting losses at its British arm JLR, Tata Motors is looking for partnerships in China to lessen the financial burden on group's bottomline, chairman  said on Monday.
Addressing the shareholders at the AGM here, Chandra however, pointed out that the automobile sector is such that a company cannot shut the cash tap as the very of this business demands continuous investment in product and technology development.
Chandra also said, more than the final outcome of the Brexit, it's the continuing uncertainty that is hurting JLR in its home market of England and continental Europe, which is the largest source market for the millions of parts that JLR procures annually.
""The only way to handle the ongoing crisis and the continuing need for large capex is additional investment through partnerships, because we want to spread the investment, which cannot be shut either.
""There are many discussions from tactical to strategic for such partnerships. Opportunities are coming and we keep evaluating them and as long as it is in the interest of Tata Motors. We will forge such partnerships so that we are able to address the capex issue,"" Chandra told the shareholders.
It can be noted that the woes at JLR, which used to be the group cash-cow for years, the bottomline of Tata Motors has been sinking for the past three successive quarters.
While it made history by booking the largest ever loss by any domestic company for the December 2018 quarter with a mammoth  ₹26,961 crore net loss due to an impairment charges on JLR, last week it reported a net loss of  ₹3,679 crore for the June quarter as against  ₹1,862 crore loss in March 2019.
Stressing on the need to remain continuously invested, he said, like any other auto company, JLR also has to invest in future technologies of hybrid and electric. We also have to invest in the future models and also in areas like shared mobility. That's very important to stay alive in this ecosystem. All this means there is a need for capex if you want to be future ready, he said.
He said JLR has seen its volume plunge around 50% in China, which was its biggest market till the general economic slowdown hit the world's largest auto market since the past two years.
But there are some silverlining in China as ""for the first time in 12 months, we are seeing a positive volume growth in China in July after a recovery in June. But we need to wait for a couple of more months to see whether there's a trend.""
He said during the past 12-18 months, JLR has cut down capex from around 4.5 billion pounds to 3.9 billion pounds. And we are working towards cutting down further, but we can't take a very drastic cut.
On the Brexit, which has felled two prime ministers- David Cameroon and Theresa May, he said ""more than the impact of Brexit, it is the uncertainty of its potential impact, and this is much higher on JLR than any other company.
""The real concern is if Brexit were to happen with or without a deal, what will be the impact on our supply chain. We import millions of components from other parts of the world, particularly Europe. In the situation of Brexit, there's a possibility of a supply chain breakdown which essentially means production cannot happen, inventories are to be maintained."
145,2019-07-31,Tata Motors,"A sharp fall in the Nifty 50’s earnings is not helping ease valuationsThe problem is that the correction has not helped lower valuations in any way

The downward spiral in the Indian stock market could get more acute if the earnings cycle does not turn soon.
A sharp fall in the Nifty 50’s earnings is not helping ease valuations. In fact, valuations have expanded since January 2019.
The Nifty 50’s earnings per share (EPS) hovered about  ₹415 in January 2019, as per data from the National Stock Exchange Ltd. The EPS has since shrunk to  ₹405 if one looks at the trailing 12-months numbers on the NSE website.
The problem is that the correction has not helped lower valuations in any way. On the contrary, the price-earnings (PE) multiple has remained elevated. In fact, since January 2019 the Nifty 50’s PE increased from 26 times earnings to about 27.6 times currently.
That means that stock prices still remain elevated, and the Nifty’s current valuations is not much comforting.
After all, a correction in the market essentially should reflect in lower valuations. If the earnings are falling, the market’s valuations could continue to look stiff and overvalued despite a correction.
To top it, the bigger risk for investors is the lack of earnings triggers in the coming quarters. The slowdown in vital sectors of the economy is likely to drag down the Nifty’s earnings even further. Analysts have already begun downgrading the Nifty’s earnings in the current year.
“Consensus Nifty FY20/21 EPS is currently forecasting a growth of 23%/18% with nominal GDP growth assumption of 10% - which indicates high risk of meaningful earnings downgrade (correlation between Nominal GDP and Nifty EPS is at 0.65; significant divergence exists for FY20-22),"" said analysts at PhillipCapital (India) Pvt. Ltd in a note to clients.
As such, scores of companies reported poor first quarter results which include the likes of Tata Motors Ltd, Yes Bank Ltd, Maruti Suzuki Ltd among others.
Many critical sectors face a sluggish demand condition. “We are expecting growth to taper in favoured sectors like consumer discretionary, infrastructure (roads), and chemicals (reflecting broader economic weakness) along with negativity persisting in automobiles, pharmaceuticals, FMCG, and metal,"" said PhillipCapital in the note.
As things stand, if the demand conditions don’t begin to improve starting next quarter, earnings downgrades could even escalate from the present levels.
In fact, analysts at Antique Stock Broking Ltd which downgraded Nifty earnings by 2.6% for FY 20 said in a client note that “Further earnings downgrade of 2-3% can’t be ruled out owing to overall economic slowdown.""
That does not bode well for the markets. After all, both a price and an earnings correction can be a lethal combination, one that can crush investor sentiment."

Mumbai: Automobile manufacturers in the country slashed production by 11% in April-June period this fiscal over the year-ago period amid the industry facing the worst slowdown with sales declining month after month, said a rating agency's report on Wednesday.
Vehicle sales across all categories declined by 12.35% to 60,85,406 units in the April-June period against 69,42,742 units in the same period of last year.
Domestic automobile industry's sales volume fell 12% in June 2019 over the same month last year on weak consumer sentiments owing to the slowing economy amid delays in the onset of monsoons.
""The auto industry undertook a production cut of 11% in the June quarter over the year-ago period on account of production cut in passenger and commercial vehicles as well as two-wheeler segment, which stood at around 12%, 14% and 10% year-on-year, respectively,"" rating agency India Ratings and Research said in its report.
The production cut in the PV segment was as higher as 15% y-o-y while in the utility vehicles (UVs) segment it stood at 2% y-o-y, it said.
According to the rating agency, the market leader Maruti Suzuki slashed production by 15% following the slowdown in the industry to reduce inventory at the dealer level.
The average inventory for PVs declined to 30-35 days in June from 35-40 days in May, the report said, adding contrary to industry-wide production cuts, Hyundai Motor increased production by 3% over April-June 2019.
In the commercial vehicle segment, the top two players Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra curtailed production by 12% and 25% respectively, due to high existing inventory levels with the average inventory for CVs increased to 55-60 days in June from 45-50 days in May, it said.
In the two-wheeler segment, Hero MotoCorp cut production by 11% during the period while rival Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India took a substantial cut of 23% year-on-year over April-June.
The 2W inventory at dealer level increased to 60-65 days in June , up from 55-60 days in May, the report said adding the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations has requested the auto industry to bring down dealer inventory of 21 days by September.
Therefore further production cuts are likely to continue in July as well, given the existing high inventory levels, it added.
PV sales volume declined 18% YoY in June driven by weak buying sentiment leading to the postponement of purchases.
CV sales volume declined 12% YoY in the previous month, owing to decreased industry demand on account of tight liquidity conditions, especially amongst non-banking finance companies, revised axle load norms, and delayed purchases owing to weak customer sentiments, as per the rating agency.
The two-wheelers sale also fell 12% YoY in June on increased insurance costs, higher interest rates and weak rural demand amid delayed monsoon, the report said."

140,2019-08-04,Tata Motors,"With no immediate signs of recovery, FADA feared that the job cuts may continue with more showrooms being shut in the near future and sought immediate government interventionAbout two lakh jobs have been cut across the dealerships in India: FADA President Ashish Harsharaj Kale

New Delhi: Around two lakh jobs have been cut across automobile dealerships in India in the last three months as vehicle retailers take the last resort of cutting manpower to tide over the impact of the unprecedented sales slump, according to industry body FADA.
With no immediate signs of recovery, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) feared that the job cuts may continue with more showrooms being shut in the near future and sought immediate government intervention such as reduction of GST to provide relief to the auto industry.
""The majority of job cuts have happened in the last three months...It started around May and continued through June and July,"" FADA President Ashish Harsharaj Kale told PTI.
He further said, ""Right now most of the cuts which have happened are in front-end sales jobs but if this (slowdown) continues, then even the technical jobs will be affected because if we are selling less then we will also service less, so it is a cycle.""
When asked how many jobs have been cut across the dealerships in India, he said, ""Close to about two lakh.""
""It is a guesstimate that our members have already cut 7-8% of the jobs in most of the dealerships as the degrowth has been very high,"" he added.

Around 2.5 million people were employed directly through around 26,000 automobile showrooms operated by 15,000 dealers. Another 2.5 million are indirectly employed in the dealership ecosystem, he added.
The two lakh jobs cuts in the last three months are over and above the 32,000 people who lost employment when 286 showrooms were closed across 271 cities in the 18-month period ended April this year, he added.
Stating that more dealerships have closed in the past three months, Kale said, ""We are collating the figures again...In a few cases some (dealers) have gone for closure of outlets, not the main outlets but those which were put up anticipating some geographic reach.""
Elaborating reasons for taking the drastic step of cutting jobs, he said the 'margin of error' in the business in the past few years has really gone down with cost almost doubling in the last three to four years.
""The margin that we earn overall as a business has not gone up. Therefore, if we go into a degrowth situation we get into cash loss. So to avoid that, dealers have been cutting down on costs other than manpower...Till March this year none of the dealers went for any manpower correction because we thought this was a temporary slowdown and it will soon recover,"" he said.
However, he said, ""The way the first quarter has panned out despite good election results and the Budget, the degrowth continued. It is clear now that a proper slowdown has hit us. Now dealers have resorted to cutting manpower.""
Terming manpower as 'the most precious resource of dealers', Kale said,""That is the last thing we try to cut down. When the slowdown started we first decided that we should go for stock reduction. Most of OEMs have supported us. While cutting other variable expenses that we can, we did not touch manpower till March and almost mid-April.""
Ruing the loss of jobs, he said, ""It is the last resort because it is difficult to get those manpower. We invest a lot on training them because it is a peculiar industry, whether it is a technical or a field job.""
As per Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) figures, vehicle wholesale across all categories declined by 12.35% to 60,85,406 units in April-June against 69,42,742 units in same period of last year.
On the other hand, as per data based on registrations collated by FADA, automobile retail sales in the April-June period declined by 6% to 51,16,718 units in the first quarter of this fiscal as against 54,42,317 units in the year-ago period.
Passenger vehicles (PV) segment has been the worst hit with sales continuing to decline for almost a year now. In July, market leader Maruti Suzuki reported a 36.3% drop in its domestic PV wholesales, while Hyundai saw a dip of 10%.
M&M sales were down 16%, Tata Motors' PV sales fell 31% while that of Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL) also came down 48.67% during the month.
Seeking immediate government intervention, Kale said, ""We are hoping, from whatever we are hear that the government has taken note of the serious situation that is going on in the overall economy, specifically with the auto sector. We are hoping for some support for the auto sector in the next few days or week or two."" He said the auto industry has already put out a request for GST cut.
""It is not a permanent demand. We know GST is such a huge developmental agenda for the government, but at the same time (it is needed for) reviving the auto industry. We (auto industry) are almost 8% of the GDP and 49% of manufacturing GDP,"" Kale said.
He said while the revival of monsoon holds out hope, resolution of liquidity crisis, specially with the NBFCs, will go along way in helping the auto industry recover from one of the worst sales slumps in its history.

139,2019-08-04,Tata Motors,"Shadow banks, or NBFCs have long funded vast chunk of auto salesDealer inventories hit 55-60 day levels, up from 45 days - FADA

MUMBAI:
Sudhir Gharpure and his sales team sat chatting at a big Maruti Suzuki dealership on the outskirts of Mumbai some two hours after its doors were opened on a recent Saturday morning - not a single customer was in sight.
""There used to be close to 15-20 bookings each day, but now we're down to 3-5 on good days,"" said Gharpure, the general manager at the dealership.
Gharpure's experience is not an isolated one. Across India dealerships are being pushed out of business and the Indian auto sector is going through its biggest slump in nearly two decades. Passenger vehicle sales fell for eight straight months until June, and in May sales dropped 20.55% - the sharpest recorded fall in 18 years.
Preliminary data indicates passenger vehicle sales may have plunged as much as 30 percent in July. The slump in India, along with a simultaneous slide in Chinese auto sales, is a blow for automakers wrestling with higher costs driven by more stringent emission norms and a push to develop electric cars.
Unlike in China, where the plunge in cars sales has been caused largely by new emissions rules, India has seen a mix of factors that have combined to erode demand for automobiles.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 2016 ban on high-value bank notes, higher tax rates under a new goods and services tax regime, a boom of ride-sharing firms such as Uber and Ola, and a weak rural economy have all played a role.
But many dealers and automakers agree it is a deepening liquidity crunch among India's shadow banks that has been the biggest single factor in an auto sales collapse, which some fear may lead to more than a million job losses.
Non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), or shadow banks, have dramatically slashed lending following the collapse of one of the biggest, IL&FS, in late 2018.
IL&FS, or Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd, was a behemoth in shadow banking and its defaults and unravelling, amid fraud allegations, have dried up funding for rivals and led to a surge in their borrowing costs.
Non-bank or shadow banking firms generate credit outside traditional lenders, by means such as collective investment vehicles, broker-dealers or funds that invest in bonds and money markets.
In India, NBFCs have in recent years helped fund nearly 55-60% of commercial vehicles both new and used, 30% of passenger cars and nearly 65% of the two-wheelers in the country, according to rating agency ICRA.
To aggravate matters, the stress in the autos market has also prompted banks to begin trimming their exposure to the sector.
""The car doesn't sell, it's the finance that sells,"" said R. Vijayaraghavan, a senior marketing consultant at the same Mumbai dealership. ""Today the finance is not selling, so the cars are not selling.""
Problems amplified
Some 286 dealerships have shut down in the last 18 months across India as rising costs for inventory management have made businesses unviable, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA), a lobby group of auto dealers.
""The slowdown in the (NBFC) sector has dragged down vehicle sales growth,"" said A.M. Karthik, financial sector head at ICRA. ""Now the auto slowdown is becoming more visible as the liquidity squeeze continues.""
Automakers including Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors , and Mahindra & Mahindra are feeling the heat and have either cut production or temporarily closed plants to correct mounting stocks.
According to FADA data, passenger vehicle inventories now stand at 50-60 days up from around 45 days earlier, while those of two-wheelers are even higher at 80-90 days. For commercial vehicles, inventory levels range between 45 and 50 days.
""We are asking dealers to maintain an inventory of 21 days, which is almost half of the current levels,"" said Ashish Kale, president of FADA.
At least four dealers from different brands said, however, there was little scope to reduce inventories as automakers were pushing them to buy stock despite there being no demand even with heavy discounting and other sops on offer.
While 70-75% of car sales were previously financed in-house by NBFC or bank agents sitting at a dealership, that has fallen to about 50%, say dealers, as buyers struggle to qualify under more stringent lending norms put in place by lenders that are under pressure to shore up their books.
Moreover, as many NBFCs typically lent to less creditworthy clients, banks are reticent to rush in to fill the void, as they themselves struggle to cope with an existing pile of about $150 billion in bad loans.
""The banking sector is certainly one of the factors that has affected the growth of the industry,"" said R.C. Bhargava, chair of Maruti Suzuki, noting interest rates for car buyers have gone up in the last 12 months despite the central bank cutting rates.
Early recovery unlikely
With the autos sector employing more than 35 million people directly and indirectly, and contributing more than 7% to India's GDP and accounting for 49% of its manufacturing GDP, the fallout from the autos slump is huge and presents a big challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government as it begins its second term.
The entire supply chain, from vehicle manufacturers to component makers, are bleeding amid the slump.
""I've been making my payments for the last 30 years and the lenders know me,"" said Adarsh Gupta, the director of finance at Autolite (India), a component manufacturing firm. ""But even a two-day delay has people crying that I will default.
""I too want to pay, but because of the fall in cashflows I'm facing short-term issues and because of that it's difficult to get more financing. This is the vicious cycle we are in.""
Still, automakers are hopeful of a recovery in the months ahead, helped by the September-December festive season that traditionally sees a surge in consumer spending.
""One can only wish that things improve sooner rather than later. With festive demand starting to seep through, we should start seeing a gradual improvement in sales,"" said P.B. Balaji, group CFO at Tata Motors.
Analysts are more sceptical though, and say without vehicle financing becoming cheaper and easier the chances for that are low. With no silver lining in sight, analysts fear bad debts could mount in the auto sector, forcing banks to further reduce their exposure.
""We see market prices and sales coming down so there may be issues,"" said a top official at the Indian Banks' Association. ""We could see a spillover in terms of bad loans for the overall sector, but we are going to wait and watch.""
Dealers said they were hopeful of tiding over the current downturn as the broader growth story for India remains intact, but there could be a lot more pain before a recovery kicks in.
""The future is going to be multi-brand car showrooms,"" said marketing consultant Vijayaraghavan. ""That is the only way for dealerships to survive going forward as overhead costs need to be shared.""

138,2019-08-05,Tata Motors,"Vendors are either temporarily shutting plants or adjusting output by reducing daily shifts in factoriesThe current 15-20% cut in production has led to a crisis-like situation in the auto ancillary industry

MUMBAI :
Auto parts makers in India have been hit hard by automobile companies cutting production to trim inventory amid weak demand.
The vendors are being forced to follow the path of the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) by either temporarily shutting plants or adjusting output by reducing the number of daily shifts in their factories.
Automakers such as Maruti Suzuki Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M), Ashok Leyland Ltd and Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India Ltd have temporarily closed plants in the past few months. Initial reports for July suggest that the passenger car sales have slipped by over 29% making it the worst month in the past 2 decades.
Mint reached out to more than a dozen auto parts makers and learnt that while production cuts are resulting in mounting fixed costs and loss of jobs for contractual shop floor workers, smaller businesses are beginning to default on loans.
On 20 July, Bosch Ltd, one of the largest auto parts makers in India, said it has suspended operations at its Gangaikondan plant in Tamil Nadu for five days starting 23 July to ‘avoid unnecessary buildup of inventory’. Later, it suspended operations at its Naganathapura unit in Karnataka for two days (27 and 29 July) followed by single-day shutdowns at Jaipur (27 July) and Bidadi (29 July).
Bosch is not alone. Other key tier one vendors such as Exide Industries, Continental Automotive Components (India), ZF, Brose India Automotive Systems, Schaeffler India, Brembo Brakes India, Kalyani Maxion Wheels, Varroc Group, Eaton, IAC India have adjusted their respective production schedules to align their inventory as per the revised forecasts by the car companies.
A spokesperson at Exide said capacity is usually diverted to the aftermarket segment during low demand from automakers. “So, in the short run, this works to our advantage because aftermarket offers us better margin. However, if the demand slump continues for a very long time, then there is cause for concern,"" he stated.
Kalyani Maxion Wheels shut its truck wheel manufacturing plant for five days while the car wheel facility was closed for three days, one person at the company said. Meanwhile, Brose, a German supplier of window regulators and door modules for cars, trimmed its daily production schedule from three shifts to a single shift.
“Facilities are being shut on weekends; few shifts are being suspended impacting a large proportion of contractual workers, which comprise about 50% of all manpower employed by the auto industry. Few smaller enterprises are even beginning to default on loans raised from the financial institutions due to this economic slowdown,"" said a senior industry official, who declined to be named.
Jignesh Raval, MD, Sintercom India Ltd, maker of sintered parts for engines and transmissions, said, “The offtake continues to be low from our customers. This has forced us to cut our production to two shifts to control our inventory. If we don’t see further improvements, we will have to consider a block closure for a week in August.""
The current 15-20% cut in vehicle production has led to a crisis-like situation in the auto ancillary industry and if the trend continues, an estimated one million people could be laid off, Ram Venkataramani, president, Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA) said recently.
Prashanth Doreswamy, market head, Continental India, a powertrain and chassis parts supplier, said various factors have contributed to the downturn. “We are closely monitoring our production and process costs. We are continuing to optimize them. Hiring is being looked at carefully,"" he said.
However, he said the company, which invested in two greenfield plants recently, is keeping its expansion plans on track.
Suresh K.V., head of ZF Region India, said his company is also impacted by the overall weak automobile demand. “We are carefully monitoring the situation such as inventory levels on a daily basis and balance our labour capacities between the different production lines,"" he said.
Vinodkumar Ramachandran, partner and head, Automotive and Industrial Manufacturing, KPMG in India sees vendors increasing their focus on agility and optimization of resources on weekly basis to manage costs. “They are focused on lowering their breakeven levels by converting fixed cost to variable cost and deploying technologies and automation to lower their enabling function costs,"" he added."
135,2019-08-08,Tata Motors,"The company is halting its vehicle production activities to align its inventory according to the current market demand across both plants, including the JLR unit in PuneIt manufactures passenger cars and commercial vehicles at the Pune plant. The Jamshedpur unit rolls out commercial vehicles

India’a largest commercial vehicle and leading carmaker, Tata Motors Ltd (TML), has internally announced a block closure for three days starting today, 8 August, at its production plants in Pimpri (Pune) and Jamshedpur. Mint also learns that Tata Motors’ luxury car unit, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), is also observing the block closure for three days starting today, in an attempt to cut down the volumes of locally assembled models.
The company is halting its vehicle production activities to align its inventory according to the current market demand across both plants, including the JLR unit in Pune.
Other strategic departments such as the electronics division and the engineering research centre (ERC Pune) remain open during the period, signalling the quantum of ongoing work in the product development domains for BSVI emission norms and electric vehicles.
“As indicated earlier, external environment remains challenging, leading to demand contraction. We have aligned our production to actual demand and adjusted the number of shifts and contractual manpower,"" a Tata Motors spokesperson said.
The company manufactures passenger cars and commercial vehicles at its Pune plant. The Jamshedpur plant rolls out commercial vehicles.
These block closures come on the sidelines of sharply declining wholesale dispatches, which were down more than 31% year-on-year in July for the entire passenger car segment. This was the steepest decline in wholesale figures recorded in the last 20 years. On the other hand, the commercial vehicle industry saw a decline of 10.4% Y-o-Y for the last month. According to preliminary sales reports, Tata Motors led the average industry decline with sharper cuts of 39% Y-o-Y and 36% Y-o-Y for the passenger car and commercial vehicle segments, respectively, in July. 
JLR’s domestic sales for July remain unavailable.
Santosh Dalvi, who represents Tata Motors’ Permanent Employees Union (Pune), said there was no threat to the jobs of permanent employees due to the shutdown. “The permanent employees sign yearly agreements with the company, which also gives job security during such times when a shutdowns happens,"" he added. The employee agreement takes into account 18 block closures in one year.
“Eighteen days of no production in a single year is a regular norm when the plant is used for maintenance activities. At present, the three-day block closure will be used for upgrading the assembly lines, preparing for BSVI and similar jobs. Many departments are going to be operational,"" he said.
Dalvi, however, refused to comment on job losses faced by contractual workers due to the shutdown.
Earlier, Dilip Pawar, a union leader who represents the Vishwa Kalyan Kamgar Sanghatana in Pune, told Mint that the ongoing slowdown has “directly resulted in massive production cuts at the manufacturing units in and around Pune"".
“While we don’t have accurate number of job losses at the moment, I estimate that more than 10,000 daily wage workers have become unemployed over the past months as plants that were running three shifts a day are now operating only a single shift,"" he said. He suggested that while most of the job cuts were made by vehicle manufacturers such as Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and Volkswagen India in the Pune-Chakan automotive belt, all the retrenched workers were temporary and full-time employees have not been fired so far."

The unprecedented slowdown in India’s automobile industry has severely hit automakers with Nissan Motor Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. bearing the maximum brunt of shuttered retail outlets.
Car market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) and Renault also witnessed several dealership outlets close amid a sharp fall in demand.
Japan’s Nissan had the most shutdowns with 44 dealer outlets closing in the 18-months through April 2019, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (Fada). Nissan has been witnessing lower sales of its namesake as well as Datsun brand of vehicles in India.
Hyundai closed 39 dealerships during the period as overall customer orders fell despite robust demand for its recently introduced Venue compact sport-utility vehicle model.
Growing economic uncertainties, rise in insurance costs and an ongoing credit crunch has crimped automobile demand. Rural sentiments have been hit by irregular rainfall this year. Passenger vehicle sales have fallen for the ninth month in a row in July. With banks tightening credit norms for dealers, many have been starved of funds, forcing them to pull down the shutters.
Fada, which represents about 15,000 dealerships and 26,000 outlets across India, said a total of 286 dealership outlets downed their shutters in the 18 month-period.
The closure of retail outlets along with manpower downsizing across the 26,000 outlets has resulted in losses of about 200,000 direct and indirect jobs during the May to July period, adding to the 32,000 people who lost their jobs in the prior 18-months ended April, said Ashish Harsharaj Kale, president, Fada. He said the 26,000 dealer outlets employ about 2.5 million people.
“The dealerships are beginning to reduce manpower costs, which is the last resort among other cost cutting measures for us. While the vehicle manufacturers are now helping us control inventory, June and July were the worst months for trade. Our initial estimates suggest that about 7-8% of manpower reduction has taken place in the last three months,"" he said. Nissan contested that only 25 outlets have seen closures in the past 18 months.
“While we have had 25 outlets closures in the last one and a half year, at present, we have over 270 touchpoints across 220 cities and will continue to strengthen our presence across the country,"" said a spokesperson for Nissan India.
Hyundai did not respond to queries until press time.
Meanwhile, Tata Motors and M&M saw closures of 27 and 24 dealership outlets respectively, including both passenger and commercial vehicle retail outlets. Renault, Honda and Ford had 21, 19 and 17 dealership outlets close down, respectively, in the same period, according to Fada. Only 13 dealerships outlets of Maruti Suzuki closed down, which has the biggest retail network among domestic automakers.
S.N. Barman, vice president, sales and marketing, Tata Motors (TML) said, “During these 19 months, we have severed our relationship with 22 dealer principals. This was primarily done due to non-compliance with TML business objectives, customer interests and market coverage.""
Barman said TML has appointed more than 59 new dealer principals who opened 93 outlets. In an e-mailed response, an M&M spokesperson said, “In the past 18 months we have had a few dealer closures across the country and this is nothing unusual.""
Maruti Suzuki, Renault and Honda did not respond to emailed queries."

The luxury hotel chain controlled by the Tata Group is looking to sell some assets and avoid owning new properties in an effort to further pare debt, as it braces for a slump in consumer spending.
Indian Hotels Co, Tata’s listed firm that operates the Taj brand, plans to dispose of certain budget inns in the nation’s non-metro areas and lease them back for a fee, Puneet Chhatwal, managing director and chief executive officer said in an interview.
“We are moving our focus to more management contracts rather than constructing hotels of our own,"" Chhatwal said. “We have no plans to put our legacy and flagship properties under sale and lease back.""
The Mumbai-based company’s measures to cut costs and liabilities come at a time growth in Asia’s third-biggest economy has cooled to a five-year low, while a lingering shadow-bank crisis damps discretionary spending. The nation’s biggest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, reported the worst sales drop since 2012 in July. Besides the slowdown, the grounding of Jet Airways India Ltd has also hit Indian Hotels, forcing it to write-off some dues.
The chain, which operates New York’s The Pierre and St. James Court in the UK, has been reducing debt in the past few years by selling assets including apartments purchased for Tata Group’s executives. Consolidated net debt stood at  ₹2,000 crore ($282 million) at the end of March, down from as high as  ₹3,100 crore two years earlier, according to the hospitality firm.
Indian Hotels is focusing on an “asset light model"" besides keeping costs under check and shedding non-core assets, Amit Agarwal, analyst at Nirmal Bang Securities Pvt. said over phone. All 12 brokerages, whose data Bloomberg compiles for this firm, have a buy rating on the stock.
The efforts to pare borrowings at the hotel chain are also part of a wider drive at India’s biggest conglomerate. Tata Motors Ltd, the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, has said it is looking at options for the struggling British luxury brands. Tata Steel Ltd is in the midst of a revamp of its European operations.
The hotel operator aims to reduce ownership of properties to 50% by 2022, from 70% at present, Chhatwal said. The sale and lease-back plans include as many as six hotels at the group’s Ginger budget brand and a similar number held by joint ventures and associate companies, he said.
Indian Hotels, currently operates 151 hotels, including the Taj Mahal Palace that became the target of terrorists during the Mumbai siege in 2008.

131,2019-08-15,Tata Motors,"Jaguar XJ50 is one of the few vehicles that has 360° surround cameras that allow the driver to see all around the car while drivingThe XJ50 also has the All Surface Progress Control (ASPC) technology from Jaguar, which is meant to aid the driver in different terrains

New Delhi: As far as luxury sedans go, the Jaguar XJ50 represents the cream of the crop. It belongs among the best as far as luxury, drive quality and other elements are concerned and also comes with a rich history and heritage of its own. But as much as the XJ50 is about luxury, there’s quite a bit of technology going into this vehicle.
To begin with, it’s one of the few vehicles that has 360° surround cameras that allow the driver to see all around the car while driving. This helps you watch the rear, front and sides of the car when you’re parking in tight spaces, driving on crowded streets and more. The car will of course alert you when pedestrians or other cars are nearby, but an extra eye on the road does help.
In fact, if the 360° cameras don’t help you park, the XJ50 also has park assist for both parallel and perpendicular parking. Engaging this mode allows the driver to simply control the pedals while the car steers itself into a tight parking space. It’s useful when you’re parking in designated spaces, but the car will usually find it difficult to adapt to the more makeshift parking spaces we often find in India.
The XJ50 also has the All Surface Progress Control (ASPC) technology from Jaguar, which is meant to aid the driver in different terrains. The company describes this as a “low speed cruise control"" and it focuses on traction control. The driver can set the speed between 3.6kmph and 30kmph and focus on steering, while the car manages traction control, based on the terrain one is driving on. It’s meant to make the drive simpler when you’re on slippery or undulating surfaces. That said, while the Jaguar XJ50 does not have self-drive features like Volvo or Mercedes, the infotainment system ensures you can stay connected when you’re in the vehicle, making it in some sense a partly-connected car.
Jaguar uses the Touch Pro infotainment system that you may have seen in a Range Rover. It has a 10-inch touchscreen on the dash, which is how you interact with this system. You can also use Jaguar’s In Control apps for real-time traffic information, satellite views and more. The infotainment system will connect to your phone through Bluetooth, or you can use the USB ports to enable Apple Carplay and Android Auto. That means you can get Google Maps on the screen if you need to, and other functions of your phone are also easier to use when you’re driving.
The car also has rear seat infotainment, with screens on the backs of the front seats. Since this is also meant to be a chauffeur-driven car, the rear infotainment system will let the passenger control their entertainment as they are driven to their destination.
For audio, Jaguar has a partnership with Meridian Audio making the in-car music experience better than ordinary. The XJ50 has 18 speakers fitted on the sides, front and rear, along with two sub-woofers and it sounds quite great inside. Volvo’s Bowers and Wilkins system sounds crisper, but the Meridian system here leaves almost nothing to complain about either. It sounds very similar to Mercedes’ Burmester audio system.
The Jaguar XJ50 is obviously meant to be luxurious first, so the emphasis is on comfort and drive. But even so, Jaguar hasn’t really skimped out on technology, fitting enough things inside to make it a modern and connected vehicle."
130,2019-08-16,Tata Motors,"Truck sales, a leading indicator of economic growth, are the worst-hit across automotive categoriesWhile discounts averaged 10% on retail prices earlier, they have now increased to 15-20% or, up to  ₹8 lakh, in Kerala

Mumbai: Sluggish sales and mounting stocks of unsold medium and heavy duty trucks—the result of the downturn in the wider economy—are prompting manufacturers to offer heavy discounts to push sales.
Information obtained from industry heads and large commercial vehicle dealers reveals that medium and heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) sales have plunged in July from a year earlier across India even as inventory levels touch 60 days and beyond in the some regions, as opposed to the norm of two-three weeks.
Truck sales, a leading indicator of economic growth, are the worst-hit across automotive categories. Discounts go up to  ₹8 lakh on a 40-49 tonne truck as the two largest commercial vehicle (CV) manufacturers, Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland, slug it out amid shrinking sales.
Meanwhile, smaller rivals such as Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles Ltd and Daimler India Commercial Vehicles Pvt. Ltd claim that heavy discounting by the two leading truck makers has impacted their retail sales as well.
These discounts are fixed by the truck makers based on the region-specific freight movements and demand-supply of carrying capacity, six large CV dealers, who dominate their respective home states told Mint. The discount rates vary by region, customer order size, availability of finance and the level of unsold inventory.
Dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers only after making complete payment via financing. The dealers who spoke to Mint preferred not to be named as discounting is largely subjective and customer-centric.
Rajasthan, one of the most price-sensitive markets in India, has reported a more than 50% drop in MHCV sales in the past few months.
“Rajasthan is a high tonnage market with more demand for 40-49 tonne trucks. However, currently the freight movements of steel, cement, building materials and other goods are down, hitting trucks and tractor-trailers the most,"" a Jaipur-based truck dealer said, stressing that all manufacturers are now resorting to discounts.
A 49-tonne Ashok Leyland truck with a price tag of  ₹32 lakh is on offer for  ₹25.5 lakh by another dealer, who operates several showrooms of Ashok Leyland in Rajasthan. “Until three months ago, the same truck was retailed for  ₹27 lakh. I lost one of my oldest customers, who is a large fleet operator, to Tata Motors as they were offering a better discount on a similar product,"" said this dealer principal.
“The discounts are based on what the competition is offering. These are approved by the manufacturers and, in turn, based on the sale price, the purchase price of the dealer is calculated. The manufacturers decide the final discounted prices. The dealer principals can at most work on better margins from them. However, the margins for Ashok Leyland dealers are squeezed by 40%,"" the dealer added.
Another large CV dealer, who operates multiple dealership outlets and workshops for Tata Motors across Kerala, said: “MHCV retails have dropped by 40-50% and stock inventory is good for up to 60 days. We have a flood-like situation again this year and the market does not look good for another two months. The bookings in the first two weeks of August this year are down 50%."" Typically, truck inventory should not be for more than two weeks as dealers pay hefty interests on loans raised for acquiring stock. He suggested that while discounting averaged 10% on retail prices earlier, it has now increased to 15-20% or, up to  ₹8 lakh, on MHCVs in Kerala.
Another Kerala-based Tata Motors CV dealer, who sells about 800 units every month, said an upfront discount of  ₹5 lakh is available on a 49-tonne truck, including the Signa 4923.S tractor cab ( ₹35 lakh) and 4923 Signa 16-wheeler truck ( ₹40.52 lakh).
Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland did not respond to emailed queries sent last week. Addressing an investor query on 3 August, Gopal Mahadevan, chief financial officer and whole-time director of Ashok Leyland Ltd, said, “It is not that we will let a large customer just walk away because of price.""
“The HCV segment sits on a record inventory of around 60 days currently. The average discounts fall in the range of  ₹3.5-4.5 lakh per vehicle across the truck segment,"" said Mitul Shah, an analyst at Reliance Securities. “There is high probability of more discounting to continue in MHCVs, given that challenging economic conditions persist.""
“The heavy discounts seen have not left us unaffected,"" said Rajaram Krishnamurthy, vice president of domestic sales, product management and network at Daimler India Commercial Vehicles.
Vinod Aggarwal, managing director and CEO of Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles, recently said the CV discounting trend had impacted his company’s sales. Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland and Daimler India paused production for several days in the past."
129,2019-08-19,Tata Motors,"Sales fell 6% on uncertain economic conditions, high insurance costs and a cash crunchAbout 1.65 million automobiles were sold in the domestic market last month, showed Fada data

New Delhi: Retail sales of automobiles across the country fell by 6% year on year to 1654535 units in July, as consumption demand continues to remain subdued due to the overall slowdown in the economy and lack of credit availability, data released by Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations on Monday showed. Passenger vehicle manufacturers resorted to massive reduction in production to adjust wholesales with the retail demand in the domestic market.
According to the data, barring three-wheelers, registrations of vehicles across segments witnessed decline in single and double digits but the rate of decline was much lower than the fall in wholesale dispatches.
In the passenger vehicle segment, showroom sales declined by 11% year on year to 243183 units as customers stayed away from the showrooms due to lack improvement in availability of credit or finance options, higher cost of ownership and overall slowdown in the economy. In the corresponding period retail sales stood at 274772 units.
The difference in the rate of decline in wholesales and retail volumes in the July were quite significant.
Wholesale dispatches of passenger vehicles during the month fell 31% year on year to 200,790 vehicles last month from 290,931 units a year agonising, showed data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). It was the worst sales performance since a 35% decline in December 2000.
This was also the ninth straight drop in monthly wholesale passenger vehicle sales. Sales have fallen in 12 of the 13 months since July 2018, underscoring the sharp slowdown in demand in the world’s fourth-largest automobile market.
In July, dispatches of passenger cars plunged 36% to 122,956 units, while utility vehicles recorded a 15% drop to 67,070 units. Vans suffered a 46% decline to 10,804 units.
According to Ashish Kale, president, FADA, the lobby group would urge OEM’s to regulate the inventory at the earliest by reducing wholesale supplies. With the current weakness in overall demand, especially, in the commercial vehicle segment, the current inventory is a worry for the dealers at a time when the transition to BS 6 now being just six months away.
“Liquidity currently seems to be surplus in the banking system and with the strong focus of the RBI and finance ministry, should continue to be so. The recent rate cut by the RBI is an indication of its policy of monetary easing and is a big positive. The need now is in transmission of the surplus liquidity and rate cuts in lending at retail levels to spur growth, as banks and NBFC’s still continue to have a cautious approach,"" added Kale
In the commercial vehicle segment, sales from showroom declined by 14% to 23118 units as lack of credit from Non-Banking Financial Companies and increase in freight carrying capacity of trucks have impacted sales significantly. The top two commercial vehicle manufacturers - Tata Motors Ltd and Ashok Leyland Ltd - announced shutdowns in their respective manufacturing capacities to match the falling retail demand during the month.
In the two wheeler segment the increase in insurance premiums and sharp contraction in demand in the rural areas led to a 5% year on year decline sales 1332384 units.
Weak domestic economic activity and escalating global trade tensions led the Reserve Bank of India to cut India’s growth projection for 2019-20 to 6.9% last week from its June forecast of 7%. A liquidity crunch caused by a shadow banking crisis since late 2018 has exacerbated the woes of the auto industry. Severe floods in key states such as Maharashtra, Kerala and Karnataka before the onset of Onam and Ganesh Chaturthi are also impacting the fortunes of the automobile industry.
According to FADA, average inventory of passenger vehicles with dealers in July got reduced to 25-30 days from 30-35 days in the month before. Same for the commercial vehicles continued to remain in the range of 55-60 days as retail sales didn’t improve. In the two-wheeler segment as well, inventory with dealers remained around 60-65 days like the month before as manufacturers continued to push inventory. The lobby group of automobile dealers has been urging manufacturers to maintain inventory of 21 days with dealers."

127,2019-08-25,Tata Motors,"The planned fundraise of up to $1.5 billion failed to garner sufficient interest from potential lendersTata Motors was in talks with several foreign banks since the start of this year to avail the syndicated loan facility

Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd has indefinitely deferred a planned fundraise of up to $1.5 billion in foreign currency loans after failing to garner sufficient interest from potential lenders, two people directly aware of the development said, requesting anonymity.
The funds were to be raised by a Singapore-based entity of Tata Motors to refinance existing loans of Tata Motors as well as its wholly-owned unit, UK-based Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc (JLR), said the people cited above.
Tata Motors was in talks with several foreign banks since the start of this year to avail the syndicated loan facility, the people said. “The loan was to be raised by August this year,"" said the first person cited above.
“Tata Motors has now decided to pursue fundraise options with domestic lenders,"" the person said.
In June, Moody’s Investor Service downgraded Tata Motors’ corporate family rating and senior unsecured instruments rating to Ba3 from Ba2. The downgrade was led by the weak performance of JLR, according to Moody’s. On 19 August, CARE Ratings downgraded Tata Motors’ long-term credit rating amid JLR’s financial woes. CARE said it has downgraded the rating on the long-term bank facilities of Tata Motors to “AA-/Negative"" from “AA/Stable"".
“Typically, a downward revision in credit ratings results in cost of funding going up by several basis points. However, many of Tata Motors’ existing foreign lenders are now looking to down-sell some of the facilities, though they are yet to be able to do so,"" the second person said. “Unless they are able to sell the existing loans, the lenders may not be able to take more exposure to Tata Motors.""
“Tata Motors group has a strong balance sheet,"" a company spokesperson said. “As of last financial year-end, our net worth was  ₹60,000 crore. Our automotive business has a net debt of  ₹28,700 crore and we generate an Ebitda of  ₹27,000 crore, giving us a comfortable net auto debt to Ebitda ratio of 1.05.""
“Our debt has maturities that are well spread out over the next seven years and we have well-diversified sources of funding,"" the spokesperson said. “Operationally, in Q1FY20, JLR has reduced its cash outflows by almost £1 billion compared to the previous year and we expect this trend to continue in the coming months too. We tap markets regularly for our funding needs depending on prevailing market conditions.""
The Indian automotive sector is in the midst of an unprecedented slowdown, with passenger vehicle sales falling the most in nearly two decades in the June quarter. This underscores subdued consumer sentiment, a slowdown in economic activity, farm distress and a liquidity squeeze.
Tata Motors’ problems have been compounded by the weakening performance of JLR, which has been its cash cow. JLR was first downgraded by Moody’s in July 2018 after sales in China suddenly dropped in June. The decline in China has since eased, but demand turned negative, with sales declining in other key markets such as the US, UK and Europe. As a result, JLR has witnessed an overall 13.5% year-on-year sales decline in May, Mint reported on 23 June."

This is expected to reverse the foreign institutional investors (FII) fund outflow from Indian equities.
On Friday, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman also announced a slew of measures to stoke demand, including a rejig of the government's spending programme by front-loading it, addressing supply-side bottlenecks and easing bank credit rules, even as she promised to end “tax terrorism"" that has left India Inc. jittery.
Among global markets, Asian shares sank on Monday as the latest salvo in the Sino-US trade war shook confidence across the world economy and sent investors steaming to the safe harbour of sovereign bonds and gold, while slugging emerging market currencies.
Yields on benchmark 10-year Treasury debt dropped to their lowest since mid-2016, while gold hit its highest since April 2013 as risk was shunned.
There was some relief that China fixed the yuan’s midpoint at a relatively steady 7.0570 per dollar when it had been trading as weak as 7.1850 offshore, countering concerns Beijing would let the currency slide to keep exports competitive.
The MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 2.0% and Australia 1.5%. Japan’s Nikkei lost 2.3%, while Shanghai blue-chips fell 1.2%. Wall Street nose-dived on Friday when US President Donald Trump announced a 5% additional duty on $550 billion in targeted Chinese goods, hours after China unveiled retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion worth of US products.
At the G7 meeting in France over the weekend, Trump caused some confusion by indicating he may have had second thoughts on the tariffs. But the White House said on Sunday that Trump wished he had raised tariffs on Chinese goods even higher last week. He also signalled he did not plan to follow through with a demand that US firms close operations in China. Trump is now set to hold a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron later on Monday.
The latest broadside overshadowed a pledge by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to “act as appropriate"" to keep the US economy healthy, although he stopped short of committing to rapid-fire rate cuts. The markets clearly believe, however, the Fed will have to act aggressively and are fully priced for at least a quarter-point cut in September and more than 110 basis points of easing by the end of 2020.
Back home, Tata Motors Ltd has indefinitely deferred a planned fundraise of up to $1.5 billion in foreign currency loans after failing to garner sufficient interest from potential lenders, according to a Mint report.
Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail Ltd is likely to launch its “new commerce"" venture around Diwali, according to another Mint report. New commerce is Reliance Retail’s offline-to-online initiative, which will link producers, traders, small merchants, brands and consumers through technology.
Meanwhile, the drop in yields caused the yen to touch 104.47, but the currency pared losses as the session wore on and was last at 105.21. The next major chart point is a low around 104.10, briefly touched during the “flash-crash"" of early January.
The euro was firm at $1.1143, having climbed 0.6% on Friday, although restrained somewhat by speculation the European Central Bank will also have to ease aggressively next month. The dollar fared better elsewhere, making inroads on most emerging market currencies. The Turkish lira briefly tumbled as far as 6.4700 per dollar.
Spot gold received a boost from the slide in yields, rising 1.1% to $1,544.23 per ounce and touching its highest since April 2013.
Oil prices went the other way on worries the tariff dispute would crimp world demand. Brent crude futures slid 68 cents to $58.66, while US crude lost 79 cents to $53.38 a barrel.

124,2019-08-27,Tata Motors,"The RBI has approved a record  ₹1.76 lakh crore payout to the governmentThe rupee and bond market also cheered the higher-than-expected RBI payout

Favourable domestic cues along with higher global markets helped Indian stock market benchmarks Sensex and Nifty rise for the third straight day. The Sensex ended 147 points higher at 37,641 while Nifty settled 0.43% higher at 11,105, driven by gains in banking, auto and energy stocks. Some selling in IT stocks capped gains. The Reserve Bank of India on Monday approved a record  ₹1.76 lakh crore payout to the government, boosting the Centre's coffers at a time when it is under pressure to provide a stimulus to the economy. The rupee and bond markets also cheered the higher RBI payout.
The market breath was also strong with BSE midcap and smallcap indices rising 0.53% and 1.6% respectively.
Among the Sensex stocks, Tata Motors surged 9% while Tata Steel, NTPC, IndusInd Bank, Vedanta and M&M gained between 2% and 4%. Frontline IT stocks were under pressure today with Infosys, Tech Mahindra and TCS declining between 1.5% and 2.5%.
""The recent announcement made by the finance minister and the outcome of RBI board meet are definitely positive for the Indian markets. This is likely to lift domestic sentiments in the near term. Going forward, the market participants would keep a close watch on currency movement and upcoming Q1FY20 GDP data. Globally, trade tensions between US-China is likely to induce volatility into the Indian markets. Hence, it would be prudent to stick with quality names while investing or trading,"" said Ajit Mishra,  vice president for research at Religare Broking.
The RBI's transfer of  ₹1.76 lakh crore to the government included  ₹1.23 lakh crore as dividend and  ₹52,640 crore from its surplus capital. The dividend payment includes  ₹28,000 crore already transferred to the government as interim dividend in February.
This  ₹1.76 lakh crore payout is much higher than the government’s budget estimate of  ₹90,000 crore as dividend from the RBI this year. The RBI pays dividends to the government every year, based on the profits from its investments and printing of notes and coins.
The record transfer of dividend and surplus capital will ease the fiscal pressure of the government, say economists.
The rupee today strengthened to 71.60 today as compared to its previous close of 72.02. 
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last week announced various steps to spur growth including upfront capital infusion of  ₹70,000 crore in state-run lenders.
Moody’s Investors Service's vice president for Sovereign Risk Group, William Foster, said: ""We expect the measures to provide some support to investor and business sentiment, and the acceleration of the capitalization of public sector banks to help improve the provision of credit and transmission of monetary policy easing. However, we also expect domestic and external headwinds to persist over the course of the year, resulting in 6.4% real GDP growth in the fiscal year ending in March 2020, before growth picks up to 6.8% next year.""
Global markets were mostly higher today as investors turned cautiously optimistic about the prospects of a breakthrough in the US-China trade war. US President Donald Trump on Monday flagged the possibility of a trade deal with China and said he believed Beijing was sincere in its desire to reach an agreement. (With Agency Inputs)"
125,2019-08-27,Tata Motors,"In an interview, Tata Motors’ Shailesh Chandra talks about developing cost-effective electric mobility solutions for mass adoption in India

Shailesh Chandra, president – electric mobility and corporate strategy, Tata Motors Ltd spoke to Mint recently on developing cost-effective electric mobility solutions for mass adoption in India, banking on shared mobility and exploring new skateboard concepts, which are used by the likes of Tesla, General Motors and Audi, for developing futuristic EVs. Excerpts from the interview:
While the first generation electric Tigor cars supplied to the EESL failed to meet the claimed performance, what has Tata Motors learnt from its products?
We have learnt a couple of things. First things first, the product was made completely to meet the tender requirements. We followed whatever requirements the tender specified and the product that we made just met with those specifications. I won’t comment whether that was right or wrong.
I’d rather say it was right because we always make products per the market evolution with cost structures under consideration.
If I had to give anything better than those products, I could have only given a higher (running) range. However, the existing (EV) prices are already high. It is ultimately about optimization of vehicle’s running range and price. It directly impacts the total cost of ownership (TCO). If someone wants a range of 400-500 kms per charge from an EV simply because that’s the range an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle offers currently, I believe it is an overkill. If I have to choose between the two, I will choose the price and optimize the running range because that’s how you can make it mainstream.
What according to you is the sweet spot for an ideal EV running range in India?
It is between 200 km – 250 km for every single (battery) charge. If you give anything above that, it will not help in terms optimizing the whole equation. I believe a 220 km running range overcomes the range anxiety and with the right charging infrastructure, it should work well for the market.
What is the price range that you think a typical electric car buyer will accept?
I will go with a few studies that say a customer will be ready to pay not more than 20% - 25% over the typical ICE car of same model variant.
What is the EV product roadmap you are looking at in the mid-term?
There are four fundamental pillars on which we are working to set up an EV market: product choices, micro-markets, charging infrastructure and ecosystem enabler such as e-vehicle financing.
As far as choices are concerned, the number of products required for fleet applications from body style perspectives is very limited. You have to create different set of range conditions to meet different requirements of different categories of the fleet. For example, for a cab aggregator, the cab needs to run through the day and not lose out on time on charging the battery.
Meanwhile, for an employee transport category, we will have to see the used cases. It gives a window during the day to charge the vehicles.
In the personal segment, I think the performance and connected car features will be the two pillars that will build the foundation for EVs. You will start seeing products from early next year including the Altroz EV. The upcoming products will address the existing challenges such as the running range and the price points. We plan to bring aspirational, high-performance products with accessible price points.
With such products, the incentives that the government is offering and the charging infrastructure, on which we are working with Tata Power, I think we will be able to solve all the barriers that exist today in the mass adoption of EVs in India.
So, there will be a new electric car (Nexon EV) before the launch of Altroz EV. I will not talk about specific products but anything that is made on alpha architecture that we make in the PV can be made as an electric vehicle. So, we will be agile enough to bring all potential models as electrics in the future.
If alpha and omega vehicle architectures are EV-ready modular platforms, then can all the 14 nameplates on both put together be had as EV portfolio too?
Technically, yes. But that will largely depend upon the specific segments where an electric car will make sense, given the current price matrix. For example, I would not want to position an electric car in the small car segment because of price constraints. But theoretically, we can do what you say.
How do you see the potential of skateboard concepts for adoption of EVs in the shared mobility space?
I see promise in the skateboard concept(s) but it requires a major investment. We have been evaluating that and we have also been discussing this with some aggregators in terms of what would make sense in shared mobility. We have also been discussing some concepts with a few startups in this space.
However, we have not firmed up any specific plan on this front. We are aware of the merits, we have studied the concepts that have come up in this space and we believe that you would need some special solutions for the shared mobility space.
Once we will complete this evaluation, we will see the merit of this idea vis-à-vis the existing solutions in the field because everything will translate down to the overall economics.
So I would not like to jump to a conclusion but see a very strong merit in what you are saying. There will be a case of investment at the right time.
How are your suppliers developing the competencies for EV parts?
Parts localization will be followed with competency development. We will move to manufacturing from there and then gradually the capabilities will develop.
Tata AutoComp Systems will be entering this space. We are still exploring on how to invest in systems and sub-systems. We have a clear plan of working on localizing EV parts with Tata AutoComp and other suppliers who have worked on them globally."
123,2019-08-30,Tata Motors,"'Next year we will manufacture close to 1.25 million differentials in India for EVs', said Sunjay Kapur'We plan to achieve $1 billion by 2024', said Sona Comstar chairman 

Taking charge of the merged entity Sona Comstar as chairman, Sunjay Kapur spoke to Mint about the intent of bringing Sona BLW Precision Forging Ltd and Comstar Automotive Technologies Ltd together with help of the world’s largest private equity firm Blackstone, mid-term goals and joint technology roadmap for future growth. Excerpts from the interview:
What is the intent behind bringing Sona and Comstar together?
Given the speed with which technology disruptions are happening within the automotive industry, the focus behind this new entity is to remain relevant, for example for electric vehicles. We (Sona BLW Precision Forgings Ltd) have gone from being a bevel gear manufacturer to a differential (gear) manufacturer.
At Sona BLW, we are assembling the entire differential unit. We command 12% market share globally in this space. We own the technology (bevel gear manufacturing). So we are sitting on a strong business which is almost debt free.
We have now forayed into the EV space. Next year we will manufacture close to 1.25 million differentials in India for EVs, predominantly for the passenger cars. 95% of these would be for the export markets.
In the past we have also supplied electric axles to the three-wheeler industry wherein until now we have been buying the motor from a third party. However, with Comstar, which makes world’s lightest starter motors for ICE and hybrid engines, our endeavour is to develop our own motor so that we can build our own axle entirely in-house and see how to scale up that product.
Comstar was a Visteon spinoff wherein majority of their supply would go to Ford (Motor Company). 85-90% of their business comes from exports. Fortunately, we have only one common customer, which is Tata Motors. This gives us an opportunity to penetrate into each other’s customer portfolio.
So with bevel gears, we are present in passenger cars, CVs and off-highway vehicles including farm and construction equipment. With Comstar’s starter motors, we will consolidate in the passenger car segment.
What is Sona Comstar’s mid-term target?
Combined, we are a $510 million entity today. We plan to achieve $1 billion by 2024. This is going to be organic as well as inorganic. We will keep looking out for other companies that we can acquire in the Indian market space. We would like to continue growing our India footprint.
From Blackstone’s perspective, I think this is a good automotive platform. They had bought Comstar last year. When they came to Sona BLW, we merged the two entities so that we can create Sona Comstar, which becomes the platform that will continue to grow and expand in this space from a manufacturing perspective.
Have you identified what areas will you look at to make new acquisitions?
We haven’t identified technology areas as yet for making new acquisitions. That said, we may not look at acquiring an engine component manufacturer. However, we may look at unique technologies, electric vehicles and we will look at the Indian market with respect to further enhancing our manufacturing footprint.
How has the addition of Comstar added to the overall valuation of the existing business?
So JM Financial exited very recently and that’s when Blackstone came in. I would say that we have grown from $400 million to $510 million with the addition of Comstar. The revenue growth at Sona BLW has remained consistent over years. Over a period of time we have grown to become $400 million. With the addition of Comstar, it is another $100-110 million, so that’s where our revenues are coming from.
How much stake do you have in Sona Comstar?
Our stake in Comstar is 35%, while Blackstone holds 65%.
How much has Blackstone invested in Sona Comstar?
We are a private firm and we are keeping that information confidential.
What the Sona Comstar joint technology roadmap entails?
We are thinking of developing electric drive units (EDU) in the future. Today, we are already making differentials for the electric cars. We are developing products for supply to EV makers in Germany as well. We will supply bevel gears and other planetary gears to EV manufacturers."

New Delhi: Major automobile manufacturers including Maruti Suzuki India, Hyundai, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors and Honda on Sunday reported a high double-digit decline in their sales in August as the Indian auto sector continued to reel under one of the worst slowdowns in its history.
While Maruti reported a 33 per cent drop in August sales at 1,06,413 units, sale of passenger vehicles by Tata Motors fell 58 per cent during the month under review.
Similarly, Honda Cars India and Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) sales dropped 51 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively.
Commenting on the sales performance, Tata Motors President Passenger Vehicles Business Unit Mayank Pareek said the market continued to be challenging, but the company has focused on improving its retail sales, which saw an uptick of 42 per cent.
The country's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India reported a 32.7 per cent decline in sales at 1,06,413 units in August.
Domestic sales declined by 34.3 per cent at 97,061 units last month as against 1,47,700 units in August 2018, it added.
Sales of compact segment, including models such as Swift, Celerio, Ignis, Baleno and Dzire, fell 23.9 per cent at 54,274 units as against 71,364 cars in August last year.
Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) total sales dipped to 36,085 units in August as against 48,324 units in the corresponding month last year.

Similarly, Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL) domestic sales dropped to 8,291 units in August as against 17,020 units in the same month last year.
""The auto sector continues to witness high de-growth due to poor consumer sentiment,"" HCIL Senior Vice President and Director, Sales and Marketing, Rajesh Goel said in a statement.
This is despite the high discounts prevailing in the market which makes it the best time to buy cars, he added.
Hyundai Motor India domestic sales contracted by 16.58 per cent to 38,205 units.
Toyota Kirloskar Motor too reported a decline in total sales at 11,544 units in August.
Sales in the domestic market stood at 10,701 units as compared to 14,100 units in August 2018, down 24 per cent.
TKM Deputy Managing Director N Raja said, ""The consumer sentiment continues to be muted in the month of August, with customers deferring their purchase of vehicles. Severe floods across states has also hurt the demand in the industry. Unfavourable exchange rate is not helping our cost.""
He, however, said the recent measures announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to boost the auto sector with cheaper car loans, improving liquidity through credit expansion to public sector banks, deferring of one-time registration fees, higher depreciation for all vehicles and lifting ban on purchase of new vehicles in government departments are likely to spur some demand which is a much needed relief.

120,2019-09-04,Tata Motors,"The move will help the commercial vehicle maker further consolidate its position in the LCV segmentWith this, Ashok Leyland plans to take on segment leaders Mahindra and Mahindra’s (M&M) Bolero pickup trucks and Tata Motors’ Ace family

NEW DELHI :
India’s third-largest commercial vehicle maker, Ashok Leyland, plans to develop a range of light commercial vehicles (LCVs) in the sub-5 tonne category. The move will help the company further consolidate its position in the LCV segment, while reducing its dependency on medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCVs).
MHCVs, a segment that has been affected the most by the ongoing demand slowdown, contributed about 70% of Ashok Leyland’s total annual vehicle sales last year.
N. Saravanan, chief technology officer, Ashok Leyland, said in an interview: “We do have an LCV platform that we are developing, but it’s too soon to disclose that. At some point in the near future, we will have an entire range of LCVs going all the way up to 5 tonnes. We are looking at extending the LCV platform to a slightly higher range."" The company’s only product in the sub-5 tonne category is Dost and Dost Plus.
With this, Ashok Leyland plans to take on segment leaders Mahindra and Mahindra’s (M&M) Bolero pickup trucks and Tata Motors’ Ace family.
Ashok Leyland’s Dost LCV, which is positioned in the goods carrier category with a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of 2-3.5 tonnes, sold 49,467 units in FY2019, up 24% year-on-year (y-o-y). Meanwhile, the Bolero powered M&M’s sales to 176,203 units in FY19. In the sub-2 tonne category, Tata Motors reported sales of 156,409 units of the Ace LCV last fiscal year.
Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) data shows that the CV maker has recorded growth in the LCV segment despite the ongoing demand slump. In the April-July period, it recorded 9% y-o-y growth to 16,754 units, against 15% decline to 31,350 units in the wholesale volumes of its MHCVs due to the slowdown in freight movement.
Meanwhile, the flagship company of Hinduja Group on Tuesday said it has become the first CV maker in India to get BS-VI compliance certification from Pune-based Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) for its complete range of heavy-duty trucks (16 tonnes and above). Affiliated to the ministry of heavy industries and public enterprises, ARAI is an autonomous body offering research and homologation services for all vehicle types.
The company’s heavy-duty trucks, or MHCV range cater to mining and construction, haulage and tractor-trailer applications. “All intermediate commercial vehicles (ICVs), including buses, will be BS-VI compliant in the next few weeks as the process of homologation is underway,"" Saravanan said.
He added that the roll out strategy of the all-new, BS-VI compliant CVs will depend upon the availability of BS-VI grade fuel (diesel). “We are closely working with the oil companies. As soon as we see the availability of BS-VI grade fuel in key corridors, we will start rolling out these trucks.""
Saravanan, however, refused to divulge whether BS-VI compliant MHCVs will be priced higher. Ashok Leyland has developed an all-new modular vehicle platform for 16 tonne and above trucks, including tippers, mining trucks and haulage vehicles. Under the platform, known as the MBP programme, the transition to BS-VI emission norms will be carried out and existing MHCV platforms will be discontinued from April 2020. “The model allows you to mix and match the various component systems in a seamless manner. The idea is to meet customer requirements, which is primarily having customized variants for various applications, without building up too much of inventory of various parts,"" Saravanan said."
119,2019-09-05,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors’ ordinary shares now trade at a record premium of 120% over its DVRsExperts point out that a large premium arises when investors foresee a change in management

A rose by any other name would smell just as sweet, goes the Shakespearean saying. Likewise, if the value of a stock is the sum of the present value of its future cash flows, how should it matter to investors whether the equity shares they purchase are called ordinary shares or shares with differential voting rights (DVRs).
But apparently, in the case of Tata Motors Ltd, it matters a lot. The company’s ordinary shares now trade at a record premium of about 120% over its DVRs. The ordinary shares, which trade at  ₹109.50 apiece, offer one vote for every share held in the company, and the DVRs, which trade at  ₹49.95 apiece, offer one vote for every 10 shares held.
Watch video: Why Tata Motors looks increasingly like a takeover target
Researchers say that the difference between voting and non/lower voting shares is almost entirely explained by the possibility of a change in the company’s management or ownership. “The difference between voting and non-voting shares should go to zero if there is no chance of changing management/control,"" says corporate finance expert, Aswath Damodaran of New York University, in a paper titled The Value of Control.
In a paper that sought to assess the economic value of voting rights, Haim Levy of the Hebrew University said, “An individual investor would have a motive to hold the stock with superior voting rights, if he or she expected that a future struggle for control will yield significant capital gains."" Else, they might as well buy the shares with lower voting rights at less than half the price for the same amount of economic ownership.
With investors willing to pay as much as 2.2 times more for Tata Motors shares with voting rights, it certainly begs the question whether they are pricing in a greater probability of a takeover in the future. After all, any acquirer seeking control of the company would only be interested in shares with greater voting rights.
The government of Singapore, a large shareholder in Tata Motors, has more or less shunned the DVRs while increasing its ownership in the company since end-2017, despite the huge bargain available there. Less than two years ago, it held 41% of its stake in Tata Motors in the form of DVRs; this has come down to 26% as of June 2019, with its holding of ordinary shares more than doubling.
The fact that Tata Motors’ market capitalization has fallen more than 80% in the past three years makes the possibility of a takeover even more likely. A 51% stake in the company now costs about $2.4 billion, compared to more than $13 billion three years ago.
Damodaran of NY University adds that investors ascribe a higher premium to voting shares when a firm is performing badly, especially when it is because of poor management decisions. The bet clearly is that a change in management in such cases will derive great value.
Tata Motors’ problems are many, and some of them, attributable to poor management, have been chronicled in these pages.
Whether or not Tata Motors’ DVR discount points to the possibility of an impending takeover—it may well be an inexplicable anomaly of the markets that refuses to correct—it’s fair to say that investors have decisively voted for a change in the way the company is managed."

Mumbai: Incessant rains and a watchful mode for fresh government stimulus kept stock markets non-committal on Tuesday. Benchmark index, S&P BSE Sensex, fell 0.22% or 80.32 points to close at 36,644.42, after rising as much as 0.5% earlier in the day. The NSE Nifty 50 Index closed almost flat.
Among sectors, the Nifty Realty index slipped the most, by nearly 2%. On the contrary, auto stocks gained the most. Among Nifty stocks, Tata Motors, Coal India, ONGC, BPCL and Yes Bank were gainers, while HDFC, ICICI Bank, Indiabulls Housing, TCS and Kotak Mahindra Bank were among the losers.
Sensex has lost 9.1% from this year’s peak recorded in June, as the pace of economic growth has slowed to its lowest in six years. Investor confidence remains fragile even after a slew of government measures, which includes merging 10 state-run banks into four large universal banks and easing of foreign investment rules and reversing a surcharge for overseas funds.
Nitin Gadkari, road transport and highway minister, today said the government will consider a GST cut to help the automobile sector. The government has reduced taxes on electric vehicles and it plans to do the same for hybrid vehicles, he added. Among auto stocks, Tata Motors gained 8% after its British arm Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) said it plans to launch 30 new or revamped vehicles in China in the next two years.
In the currency market, rupee strengthened for the second day in a row against US dollar on Thursday, tracking emerging-market peers, as a US-China decision to hold trade parleys in October boosted risk appetite. It opened at 71.85 to a dollar, up 0.29% from its Wednesday's close of 72.12.
The 10-year bond yield inched up to 6.58%, up from its Wednesday's close of 6.55%, with the security closing at 104.71 on Thursday from previous close of 104.89. Markets are apprehensive that the government may miss the fiscal deficit target of 3.3% of GDP for the current financial year. Bond yields and prices move in opposite direction.
Global benchmark Brent crude oil futures fell 1.31% to $60.60 per barrel on Thursday in line with a weak trend in overseas markets and US crude inventories rose unexpectedly, as position-taking commenced on hopes of a resolution to the US-China trade row. West Texas Intermediate was down 0.18% to $56.16.
International benchmark spot gold prices jumped to a fresh six-year high, or the highest since April 2013, yesterday due to jitters about the state of the global economy. Spot gold prices have risen more than 20% so far this year, though it fell 0.68% on Thursday to $1,542/oz."

NEW DELHI :
Indian automobile industry growth story is about to collapse due to ongoing slump triggered by a variety of factors, including low consumer sentiment and non-availability of liquidity, Tata Motors CEO and Managing Director Guenter Butschek said on Thursday.
Speaking at the annual convention of Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), Butschek, however, said he was cautiously optimistic about a recovery from the current situation on the back of measures announced by the government.
""Let's actually take it in a very dramatic way and let's conclude, the Indian Automotive Growth story is about to collapse,"" he said.
Later on clarifying his statement on the sidelines, he said, ""I have seen the statistics published by the entire automotive industry in the first quarter, then the continuing statistics provided on wholesale in the month of July, August. I didn't say it has collapsed, it's about to"".
Low economic activity leading to subdued demand, triggered by the liquidity crisis and the increase of the axle load regulations for commercial vehicles and uncertainty in the minds of consumers have severely hurt the sector, he added.
Stating that automobile manufacturers are taking steps to overcome the challenge by adjusting production to demand, Butschek said, ""Block closure has become the word of the year"".
Welcoming the recent steps taken by the government, Butschek hoped for things to turn around, although the road ahead is still challenging.
""I am cautiously optimistic that the worst is behind us,"" he said, however, added that there were lot of uncertainties related to BS-VI emission norms transition and how it could impact overall demand.
He said the recent slew of measures announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will help the auto industry.
Yet, he said, ""in order to get out of the current crisis and not miss the festive season, we require clarity from the government, here and now, on GST and scrappage policy"".

116,2019-09-06,Tata Motors,"Pay attention to quality as industry prepares for a transition to BS-VI emission norms, say automakersMaruti CEO urges tier-I suppliers to help small scale firms in manufacturing value chain

Mumbai: Maruti Suzuki and Tata Motors have urged auto component suppliers to build capabilities by investing in research and development (R&D) and ensure zero defect products. Addressing suppliers at the 59th annual session organized by the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (Acma) in Delhi on Friday, vehicle manufacturers asked suppliers to pay greater attention to quality, as the auto industry prepares for a transition to new safety measures and BS-VI emission norms.
“Please develop your capabilities. It is time now for India to manufacture zero defect products. Quality deserves a much greater attention from the top managements at the suppliers,"" Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director and CEO, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, said. He emphasized the need for “maintaining consistent quality benchmarks"" while addressing a gathering of about 900 delegates from the auto industry, largely component suppliers.
Ayukawa said developing supplier capabilities was the next big challenge. “You will remember the hand holding that you got from the vehicle manufacturers. Please carry the same process in the same spirit with your suppliers."" He urged tier-I suppliers to guide the medium and small scale companies in the automotive manufacturing value chain.
Maruti Suzuki had issued a recall of its WagonR hatchbacks last month to correct a defect in the fuel hose unit that had impacted over 40,000 units manufactured between 15 November 2018 and 12 August 2019.
A voluntary recall is an added cost for the company as well as for the parts makers involved.
Guenter Butschek, managing director, Tata Motors, said: “The millennial customers have faster turnaround expectations and zero tolerance for (poor) quality. The bar has been raised."" He stressed that suppliers must identify gaps and pain points and address them. “Take this ongoing crisis as a fitness project. We need to work on bringing innovations to the market by being inclusive. We must also quickly align to the changing market dynamics and technology at play,"" he said. “Preparation for ACES (autonomous, connectivity, electric and shared mobility) will lead the industry forward."" Butschek said the auto ancillary units have to drive supply chain efficiencies via Industry 4.0. “The buck doesn’t stop at the tier-I suppliers,"" he said, highlighting the need for medium- and small-scale suppliers to chip in and enhance efficiency and quality.
Rohit Saboo, president and CEO, National Engineering Industries Ltd, a leading supplier of bearings to automakers, said Industry 4.0 helps suppliers in predicting failures and reducing downtime of machines, besides driving efficiency, and reducing losses and turnaround time.
Ayukawa also stressed the need to skill people as automakers were looking at rolling out world class vehicles in India. “A root cause analysis of the defects shows that more than half of the defects are due to human error. This means we are underestimating the importance of training and skilling our people.""
Ayukawa urged suppliers to develop in-house research and development capabilities. He said Maruti Suzuki cars have about 90% localized content, given that some key electronics components are still imported.
“But we want to make in India. If anybody can make key electronic components in India with quality and reliability, it will help not only your company but the entire Indian automobile industry,"" he added."

113,2019-09-09,Tata Motors,"Highway construction can act as a powerful economic stimulus

India’s plunging auto sales are making investors nervous. Their bigger worry should be the vanishing new roads.
The country’s top six automakers reported a 29% decline in August sales. A 45% slump in commercial vehicle sales by Tata Motors Ltd., the No. 1 Indian truck maker, added to the gloom. With GDP growth facing its longest slump since 2012, India is in a quasi-recession, Teresa John, an economist at Nirmal Bang Equities Pvt. in Mumbai, said in a report this week.
The bond market seems to agree. A five-year swap, which allows investors to lock in a fixed interest rate by promising to pay a floating overnight rate, has dived to its lowest since the 2008-09 global financial crisis. The swap, a proxy for how traders view short-term rates will behave in the future, is signalling expectations of very deep cuts in the policy rate. 
While those cuts would push up bond prices, a 5%-plus drop in the rupee so far this year will undercut the dollar value of capital gains for global investors. New money may be dissuaded by low initial yields plus the risk that the rupee could fall more.
A contrast with Indonesia may be helpful. Like its bigger neighboring economy, Indonesia, too, is hungry for capital that would create jobs for its teeming youth population.But while Indonesian government bonds have attracted $8 billion in foreign money this year, net inflows into Indian debt securities have been $4.5 billion. Indonesia’s economy will also slow because of the U.S.-China trade war. Still, Jakarta has the fiscal headroom to follow through on its intention of slashing corporate tax rates by 5 percentage points to 20%. If that’s not enough to spur business activity, President Joko Widodo can also channel fresh investment into a brand new capital city. 
That brings us to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pro-growth spending ambitions. A $70 billion plan to build a 35,000-kilometer (22,000-mile) road network is under way. Highways can act as a powerful stimulus by creating new construction jobs, spawning fresh orders for excavators, graders and rollers, and putting spending money in the hands of people whose land is getting acquired.
Trouble is, India doesn’t have fiscal resources. Even involving the private sector to share 60% of the cost of new roads – against a guaranteed annuity for 15 years – is getting tricky. After shouldering the burden of the remaining 40% cost, the highway authority’s debt has risen to 1.8 trillion rupees from 240 billion rupees five years ago. The agency has to slow down. Realistically, it can award between 3,100 km and 3,500 km annually over the next four years, according to SBICAP Securities, a big drop from the record 7,400 km of contracts it gave out in the year ended in March 2018.
In the absence of more spending in an area with a high fiscal multiplier, deeper interest rate cuts may be needed to arrest plunging GDP growth. That overburdening of monetary policy is something investors will take into account.
More crucially, monetizing existing roads could generate the much-needed upfront funds to build more new ones. But a 3-km stretch sold to investors for 30 years garners resources to build only 1 km of new highways. That’s partly because the previous government came up with a law to ensure landowners get 34 million rupees per hectare as compensation, versus just 7 million rupees in 2013. All very noble (and extremely populist), but where’s this money going? Why can’t Modi’s all-pervasive goods and services tax pull some of it back for the exchequer to ease the financial constraints on infrastructure?
Investors can keep asking, but a government that has only recently admitted to a widespread slowdown won’t accept that its GST is fatally flawed. Some tax cuts for the auto industry may cheer the equity markets. But for bond investors, what matters is not only how much more the private sector can spend out of any tax relief, but also how much less the government will get, and therefore what its borrowing will be.
Let equity markets worry about cars. Bond investors have their eyes on the road."
110,2019-09-10,Tata Motors,"A mix of robotics, AI and IoT is making the Indian factory smarter. How  will  the  shop floor look 10 years from now?While India may have missed the manufacturing bus of the 1980s and 1990s, the bus has now become more advanced. And the edge lies in industrial IoT,  robotics,  AI  and 3D  printing

Bengaluru: Three years ago, TAL Manufacturing Solutions Ltd, a unit of Tata Motors Ltd, showcased a robot called BRABO at the “Make in India"" week in Mumbai. Short for “Bravo Robot"", BRABO was touted by the company as the first “Made in India"" industrial robot, and is designed to lift loads of up to 10 kilograms.
Mahindra and Mahindra LTd already has a “robotic weld line"" at its factory in Nashik, which now caters to many of its products including the Marazzo and the XUV300. Tata Motors, too, uses robots in its Pune factory, while Godrej and Welspun run their shop floors with the help of an Intelligent Plant Framework, which enables tracking of machinery and productivity on the floor in real time.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd has numerous robots employed at its Manesar and Gurugram car factories, with more than 2,000 robots working at the weld shop in its Manesar facility alone. Manjushree Technopack Ltd’s Bidadi (in Bengaluru) manufacturing plant also has more than a dozen of its packaging machines connected to a network, providing monthly updates on maintenance issues.
Automation, of course, is no stranger to shop floors. Many factories all over the world and India have been using computer numerical control (CNC) machines for years. These machines allow operators to feed a program of instructions directly into a mini-computer via a small board, similar to a traditional keyboard. After loading the required tools in the machine, the rest is done automatically by the CNC machines, which use these instructions to control machinery such as the grinder, milling machine, and lathe. But next-gen automation is likely to be vastly different on one score: it will either make humans redundant or vastly alter the necessary skill set that is required to hold on to one’s spot on the shop floor. A human-machine interface, or HMI, may eventually make the good old CNC machine voice-activated, for example, allowing an operator to just speak instructions.
These oncoming changes will leave long-lasting impacts on India’s labour force, particularly in some sectors—automotive, textile, and banking and financial services, apart from information technology—which have become far more attuned to global shifts due to the nature of modern supply chains. The “smart factory"" will, in all likelihood, change the popular conception of what a shop floor looks like.
An army of robots
The number of robots in use worldwide multiplied threefold over the past two decades to 2.25 million, according to a June 2019 report by Oxford Economics. Trends suggest the global stock of robots will multiply even faster in the next 20 years, reaching as many as 20 million by 2030—with 14 million in China alone, the report adds.
India is way behind at the moment. But things can change very quickly. The automotive industry, which is currently racked by a slowdown, is a great example. In the face of stagnation, firms that had begun to ramp up their robot density (robots per 10,000 workers) in the mid-2000s have now merely chosen not to rehire a bulk of the short-term, rotational, low-skilled contract workforce. According to a 22 January 2019 report by the International Federation of Robotics, India’s automotive sector was the main customer for industrial robots, accounting for as much as 62% of the total supply.
“On average, each newly installed robot displaces 1.6 manufacturing workers,"" the report says. Despite these rapid changes, industry players like Harshvendra Soin, chief people officer at Tech Mahindra, say: “We believe the future will be more human than we think."" However, some factories are now beginning to acquire the capability for “lights out"" production—meaning, they can operate without the presence of human workers. In fact, Japanese robotics firm FANUC, which is considered to be the poster boy for such factories, has been operating a “lights out"" factory with robots since 2001.
Unique quandary
India is in a unique quandary. While the country needs to find jobs for its booming population, the globally competitive opportunities are almost entirely in smart manufacturing, most of which require less human hands per unit of output. “The conventional ways of doing incremental business will no longer suffice. India needs to push its people to adopt disruptive ways of doing business,"" said Ashutosh Sharma, secretary, Department of Science and Technology at the 4th Confederation of Indian Industries Smart Manufacturing Summit, held on 26 October 2018 in Delhi.
While India may have missed the manufacturing bus of the 1980s and 90s, which powered China’s growth, the bus has now become more advanced. And the competitive edge lies in artificial intelligence (AI), industrial Internet of Things (IoT), wearables, robotics and additive manufacturing (better known as 3D printing), which are all set to fundamentally transform global production.
In any case, automation on the shop floor is now being taken to new levels. Machines develop faults like parts getting worn out or equipment not getting calibrated properly. An operator could, thus, waste a lot of time trying to locate the origin of the problem. It’s here that automation is being combined with AI and IoT on the shop floor to resolve such issues.
AI, for instance, can be integrated with CNC machines to enable self-diagnosis. Thus, when a fault develops, it will be detected and the software will try and solve the problem. Apart from using the data that is collected thus for diagnostics, a more advanced AI system could analyze that data and alter the settings of the machine to optimize a prototype being manufactured.
According to a 10 May blog by Craig Lyjak, EY Global Smart Factory leader, the smart factory is no longer a futuristic vision. It is the heart of the broader Industry 4.0, or the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which refers to the gradual combination of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices with digital technologies. The most prominent of these technologies, according to Lyjak, include computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software, cloud computing, IoT, advanced sensor technologies, 3D printing, industrial robotics, data analytics, AI and machine learning (ML), and enhanced machine-to-machine (M2M) communications.
These technologies are already showing impressive results both globally and in India. In 2016, The Times of India reported that the country’s first “self-aware"" factory was being set up in Bengaluru at the Indian Institute of Science’s Centre for Product Design and Manufacturing with seed funding from the Boeing Co. The factory is enabling data to be continuously collected and monitored, from both sensor-fitted machines and digitally connected wearables in order to provide real-time insights about every movement and process taking place on the factory floor. The factory remains a “work in progress"".
On its part, German auto-component maker Bosch’s Bidadi plant has cobots, or collaborative robots, working alongside humans. GE’s Chakan (in Pune) factory’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is linked to the manufacturing execution system (MES). Equipment efficiency is monitored in real time to decide production schedules like availability of forks or lifts, raw material trucks, workers and machines while sensors (read IoT) send warnings on possible breakdowns.
Digital factories
While the Indian automobile industry is unquestionably at the vanguard of the oncoming change, other companies are not entirely untouched. Mondelez India describes its Sri City (in Andhra Pradesh) unit as an “integrated digital factory"", one which can pack 6,300 chocolate bars a minute, while Jaipur Watch Co. has added a new collection of stainless steel watches that were 3D printed.
Lyjak cites the example of Microsoft Dynamics’ integration with smart factory processes and technologies as a case in point. Microsoft Dynamics’ Remote Assist application, for instance, combines Microsoft HoloLens (a self-contained, holographic computer) with mixed reality, video calling, annotations, and file sharing to enable experts to remotely troubleshoot complex problems and help technicians. This saves time, reduces travel costs and improves operational efficiency on the shop floor.
Further, AI is used to optimize the multi-robot fulfilment system in Amazon warehouses. The average cost for a spot welding robot, according to the report, is projected to decrease by 22% by 2025, and robots-as-a-service models are beginning to appear.
Although bringing AI onto the shop floor would require a massive capital investment, the return on investment (ROI) is higher, according to SaaSnic Technologies. AI and ML, for instance, can test numerous demand forecasting models with precision, while automatically adjusting to different variables such as new product introductions, supply chain disruptions or sudden changes in demand. Using AI systems, every single part of a product can be tracked from when it’s first manufactured to when it is assembled and shipped to the customer.
Walmart, for instance, cut its physical inventory from one month to 24 hours by using drones that fly through the warehouse, scan products, and check for misplaced items. Using algorithms that learn from experience to optimize logistics, BMW tracks a part from the point it was manufactured to when the vehicle is sold—from all of its assembly facilities across the world. In finance operations, AI can close operations and automate monthly, quarterly and year-end processes. Using ML, bots can learn from human inputs to make better judgments and adapt to the behaviour patterns of accounting professionals.
The future office
Smart robots also assist shop floor operations indirectly by increasing employee satisfaction and appealing to a millennial mindset. A couple of months ago, for instance, Indian IT services provider Tech Mahindra introduced a Human Resource (HR) humanoid at its Noida Special Economic Zone Campus in Uttar Pradesh. Christened K2, this was the second HR humanoid (a robot that resembles a human) from the Mahindra Group company—the first was launched at its Hyderabad campus in May.
K2 can address HR-related employee queries and even handle personal requests for actions like providing payslips, tax forms, etc. With the help of AI, K2 can start a conversation without any need for wake-up commands. It can even converse with differently-abled employees by responding to queries with a text display along with speech. Tech Mahindra now plans to deploy the next humanoid at its Pune campus.
Despite the immense potential benefits of enhancing ERP systems with AI, there are risks with regard to sharing of sensitive data and regulations that need to be considered, such as the European Union general data protection regulation (GDPR), besides the loss of jobs to automation and robots. That said, the benefits may outweigh the risks if governments devise sensible privacy regulations, and revamp labour policies to factor in the impact of these new technologies on the workforce.
As an example, Tech Mahindra, which has already implemented an AI-based facial recognition (which typically raises privacy invasion concerns) system to register the attendance of employees, claims it has “drastically reduced the time spent by an associate in updating the timesheet"". The company also has Talex—an AI-driven marketplace of talent that maps skills of the existing talent pool.
But the increasingly common use of AI and robotics in the Indian context may lie inside the e-commerce package. Gurugram-based AI-powered robotics firm GreyOrange’s Butler, for example, is an autonomous robot that uses goods-to-person technology for inventory storage and order picking. It populates the many warehouses that have come up across the country in order to fuel the e-commerce boom. Butler runs on a software platform that uses AI algorithms and ML, which optimize path planning, maximize storage, and accelerate order fulfilment.
The final piece of the puzzle is the ability to hire these intelligent machines on contract, like workers. As a precursor for what may become commonplace soon, US-based Hirebotics allows firms to hire cloud-connected robots. The hourly wage starts at $15 per hour and they can work a minimum of 80 hours a week—and, they neither tire nor need bathroom breaks. Of course, companies have to give Hirebotics a 30-day written notice if they fire any robot. What these robot work contracts show is this: the future is already here."

112,2019-09-10,Tata Motors,"The new Land Rover Defender will sell for £35,000 plus sales tax, less than some analysts expected, while a longer wheelbase model starts at £45,000The Defender retains many traditional design elements and claims industry-leading off-road capabilities, with modern twists like a plug-in electric option

London: One of the hottest launches at the Frankfurt auto show wasn’t a million-dollar supercar or mass-market bestseller but an updated version of a boxy, no-frills favorite of farmers, explorers and the military.
The new Land Rover Defender, which traces its heritage back almost to World War II, was unveiled Tuesday, three years after stricter emissions and safety standards consigned the go-anywhere original to the history books.
The new car’s most difficult mission might be satisfying die-hard Land Rover purists while meeting modern technical requirements that have found their way into rivals including the Mercedes-Benz G Wagon. The Defender retains many traditional design elements and claims industry-leading off-road capabilities, but with modern twists like a plug-in electric option, retractable sun roof and an infotainment system all a world away from its analog predecessor.
The unveiling comes at a tough time for Jaguar Land Rover as Britain’s biggest automaker struggles with fallout from the Brexit vote, weak sales in China and slumping UK demand following a clampdown on diesel vehicles. The Defender will sell for £35,000 ($43,000) plus sales tax, less than some analysts expected, while a longer wheelbase model starts at £45,000.
‘Great move’
Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, director of the University of Duisburg-Essen’s Center for Automotive Research, said the Defender is the Land Rover equivalent of Porsche AG’s iconic 911, but that JLR must still make a car for the modern age rather than being bound by its history.
“It’s a great move for them to have brought it back,"" he said. “Fans of the old Defender may be disappointed, but Land Rover needs to look to the future, and not get caught up with getting stuck in the past.""
JLR Chief Executive Officer Ralf Speth said at the launch that the company has done just that, with the new Defender’s environmental credentials making it very much a 21st century car.
“Four years ago I had to make the difficult decision to stop the old production of the iconic defender,"" he said. “Today is a very special day for us all at Land Rover. Today we give the Defender back.""
The bigger version of car will carry seven people and seeks to address the old models wide-ranging markets with accessory packs dubbed Explorer, Adventure, Country and Urban.
JLR has accumulated 1.5 million test kilometers for the Defender and recently completed what it called a “real-world"" trial in Kenya that saw the SUV negotiate a variety of obstacles and pull heavily loaded trailers while tracking lions in the Borana game reserve.
The original Defender — so simple it was originally sketched in beach sand — attracted early customers including Winston Churchill and Queen Elizabeth II, who drives the model on her country estates. It has also shuttled soldiers in the Korean War, carried Red Cross volunteers to successive global crises and helped generations of UK sheep farmers rescue their flocks from snow drifts.
The model stayed remarkably unchanged over 67 years of production until tougher carbon-dioxide emission standards and pedestrian safety concerns eventually made an overhaul unavoidable. Of the more than 2 million built, around 70% are thought to survive today.
JLR — now owned by India’s Tata Motors Ltd. — said in January it would cut 10% of workers globally, though the Defender won’t immediately safeguard UK assembly jobs. While developed in Gaydon, England, the model will be produced at Land Rover’s lower-cost plant in Slovakia."

108,2019-09-12,Tata Motors,"It is too early to hope for a turnaround, amid continued turbulence in the automobile industry, globallyWeak sales and capacity utilization have been translating into negative operating leverage; thus, profit margins are expected to remain under pressure

Tata Motors Ltd’s shares have rebounded 27% from their 52-week low of  ₹106 on 4 September. What explains the rally in the past week?
Analysts point to improving sales in China as the key trigger for investor optimism. Subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover Ltd’s (JLR’s) August retail sales were up 17% year-on-year, adding to a 4% increase in July. Two months of sunshine, after about two years of gloom and falling sales since June 2018, is good news. After all, China accounts for about one-fifth of the global sales of JLR.
But two months of sales improvement, that too in one region, is a bit much to cheer about. It is also too early to hope for a turnaround, amid continued turbulence in the industry, globally. A couple of days ago, Bloomberg reported that Chinese auto sales dropped for the 14th time in 15 months.
Sales in other regions, including the UK, North America and Europe, that were improving over the last few months, turned south. Total retail sales of JLR in August contracted by 6.7% year-on-year, while year-till-date sales were down 8%. Meanwhile, the uncertainty around Brexit continues, even as demand in Europe and North America is lacklustre.
On top of this, performance of the domestic business has deteriorated further, with medium and heavy commercial vehicle sales plunging 52% in August. Most industry experts say that even with government intervention, the sector is unlikely to recover for at least 12-18 months.
Weak sales and capacity utilization have been translating into negative operating leverage. As a result, profit margins are expected to remain under pressure.
JLR, whose Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margins stood at a negative 5.5% in the June quarter, is worse off. In fact, analysts are still doubtful of the company achieving the management guidance of 3-4% Ebit margin for FY20, given the high losses in Q1.
Meanwhile, Tata Motors’ biggest concern—mounting net automotive debt of  ₹46,500 crore at the end of Q1—is unlikely to ebb soon. The rating downgrades of its debt instruments reiterate the same in their rationale.
An Edelweiss Securities Ltd report following the June quarter results sums up the multiple headwinds for Tata Motors: “JLR profitability is affected by the slowdown in China. Brexit uncertainty could further add pressure. The outlook for India business is also hazy both on margin and volumes. That said, strong focus on cost control and cash flows is encouraging.""
Needless to say, cost-control measures can only go so far in propping up profits. Only sustained improvement in sales across various markets will help turn the tide for Tata Motors."

Mumbai: Tata Motors on Thursday announced it has developed an all-new powertrain technology—Ziptron—that will power all its electric cars going ahead. The first electric car with this indigenously developed technology will be launched in Q4FY20.
Reiterating his thoughts on coexistence of internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric vehicles in the future, Tata Motors MD & CEO Guenter Butschek said, ""we have designed Ziptron in-house utilising our global engineering network. The all-new powertrain technology is rigorously tested across 1 million kms. We aim to accelerate faster adoption of EVs and support government's vision.""
The Ziptron technology comprises an efficient permanent magnet AC motor along with a dust and water proof lithium-ion battery system, which meets the IP67 standards.
Speaking on the sidelines of the announcement, Shailesh Chandra, head for EV division at Tata Motors said the company plans to offer eight years warranty on the electric motor and the battery system going forward, and that the new powertrain system will address the anxiety of car buyers over range. The company said future EVs with Ziptron technology will have a range of up to 250kms."

Homegrown carmaker Tata Motors is shifting its focus for electric cars from niche segments such as corporate fleets and taxis to personal segment as it plans to address key barriers such as range anxiety, safety, durability and others that kept buyers away from adopting electric vehicles (EVs).
Speaking to media on Thursday Shailesh Chandra, president – electric mobility business and corporate strategy, Tata Motors Ltd said, “If you just focus on fleet there is a danger that the personal car users would start associating an electric car as a taxi. That would be very bad for the adoption of electric vehicles.""
Adding further Chandra said, “The fleet segment is just 10% of the total passenger car market while 90% is the personal segment. Vehicle electrification cannot be driven by not addressing the 90% pie. You have to address that.""
Tata Motors on Thursday announced the development of an all-new modular powertrain platform called Ziptron that will power its electric cars for personal segment in the future. The company said that the new platform comprises a permanent magnet AC motor connected with a dust and water proof lithium ion battery system, the two most critical components of any electric vehicle powertrain.
Chandra said that the modular powertrain platform will be capable of providing long running range of up to 250 kms per charge along with the fast charging capability.
“We plan to offer a warranty of 8 years on both, the electric motor as well as the battery,"" Chandra said clarifying that Ziptron will power models for the personal segment only.
The senior company official had in the recent past told Mint that a 220-250km running range will overcome the range anxiety amongst the potential EV buyers in India. “If you give anything above that, it will not help in terms optimizing the whole equation,"" he had said referring to the performance and cost parameters.
Tata Motor’s modular EV powertrain platform may feature different combinations of the electric motors and the battery systems depending upon the model requirements and its sub-segment positioning. Chandra said that the components and the platform selected are world class and they clear all the fundamental barriers that include running range, power, durability, safety and lack of charging infrastructure for EVs.
“Most of the electric cars that were available in the personal segment in the past did not address these barriers. The 90% pie in the passenger car market needs to be addressed with the right attributes and I clearly see a market for this,"" he said.
Speaking on accelerating EV adoption in India, Guenter Butschek, MD & CEO, Tata Motors said, “The government has done very well with what the phased manufacturing program (PMP) under Fame 2 scheme along with GST cut to 5% (for EVs) provides us. It addresses the major elements in one go and it is by far an inclusive package the government has generously provided the automotive industry. The beneficiaries of these initiatives will be all of us.""
The second phase of government’s faster adoption and manufacturing of hybrid and electric vehicles (or Fame 2) involves an outlay of Rs10,000 crore over FY2019-20, 21 and FY22. That includes incentives for electric buses, three- and four-wheelers to be used for commercial applications along with funds sanctioned for setting up EV charging stations.
Butschek said government’s PMP under Fame 2 will bring a lot of localization of EV components, which will have a positive cost impact.
Stressing on the adoption of electric cars in the personal segment, Butschek said that the sales pitch of EVs in the future will be based on the customer needs and used cases. “We have to make sure that we don’t fall in the global trap. We actually need to get what really matters,"" he warned referring to carmakers selling expensive global products in India.
“Why should we carry an extensive battery pack that can theoretically give you 450km of range if you need only 150km,"" Butschek said questioning the unaffordability of such an electric car.
In July earlier this year, Hyundai Motor India Ltd had launched its electric sports utility vehicle Kona Electric with a price tag of more than Rs25 lakh (without GST concessions). Hyundai claims that Kona Electric’s 39kWh lithium-ion polymer battery can provide a running range of upto 450 kms per charge in standard conditions.

95,2019-10-02,Tata Motors,"EESL plans to deploy the balance 1,500 EVs to cab firms such as Meru, Ola and Blu Smart on dry leaseEESL has cut its sourcing to less than a third of the 10,000 sedans it earlier tendered

NEW DELHI :
India’s largest electric vehicle (EV) procurement programme could come to a halt amid the economic slowdown, with state-run Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) planning to curb its sourcing to less than a third of the 10,000 sedans it originally tendered due to lack of demand.
EESL gave out a sourcing contract in September 2017 to Tata Motors Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. While 1,500 such EVs have been sourced so far, EESL now plans to limit the final order to around 3,000 vehicles by March 2020.
While 40% of the vehicles were supposed to have been supplied by M&M, the rest were to come from Tata Motors.
Only 500 sedans have been supplied by Tata Motors. M&M has delivered 1,000 units.
The change in EESL’s plan comes amid the worst slump in passenger vehicle sales in nearly two decades.
“I don’t think this EV procurement plan will continue going forward and maybe after March 2020, EESL will close the tender. In the tender it was mentioned that while 10,000 units was the overall allocation, vendors will only manufacture after a demand for the same was raised,"" said a person aware of EESL’s strategy, requesting anonymity.
These EVs were to replace petrol and diesel cars used by the government and its agencies, which together have a fleet of around half-a-million cars, a third them leased.
“EESL couldn’t aggregate the demand successfully. Andhra Pradesh was the biggest problem. The moment the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government changed, everything went for a toss. They had signed for a delivery of 10,000 electric vehicles and EESL has even deployed 500-600 vehicles there,"" said the person cited above.
After the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy-led YSRCP government assumed charge on 30 May, it has been revisiting the decisions taken by the previous government, including a move to revise clean energy power purchase agreements (PPAs).
The EV procurement plan has had its share of problems. Mint reported in June 2018 about senior government officials refusing to use EVs made by M&M and Tata, citing poor performance and low mileage.
Queries emailed to the spokesperson of M&M on Tuesday evening weren’t immediately answered. A Tata Motors spokesperson said: “We do not comment on speculations."" An external spokesperson for EESL declined to comment.
The development comes even as the Narendra Modi government prioritizes a shift to electric mobility in view of India’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint by a third from 2005 levels. India aims to achieve this target by 2030. Besides, the transition to EVs is expected to reduce India’s oil import bill and generate new avenues of employment. 
The government wants to see six million electric and hybrid vehicles on Indian roads by 2020 under the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020.
Going forward, EESL plans to deploy the balance 1,500 EVs to cab firms such as Meru, Ola and Blu Smart, among others, on dry lease (i.e without a driver). “EESL will supply them the vehicles and also provide then with charging infrastructure. They can procure these vehicles from somewhere else but they don’t have the charging infrastructure which EESL has. 
EESL will install 300 charging stations in Delhi and now we have around 60. All over India we will set up more than 1,000 charging stations,"" said the person cited above.
The shift in EESL’s plans comes against the backdrop of differing voices within the National Democratic Alliance government on India’s ambitious plan for a transition to electric mobility. While this year’s Union Budget provided an impetus to EVs, transport minister Nitin Gadkari is of the view that the government will neither set a specific deadline for automakers to switch to EVs, nor ban production of petrol and diesel vehicles.
EESL' playbook was to prove that a EV programme can work in India. It has proved that,"" said the person cited in the story."
94,2019-10-03,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors said that the electric Nexon is expected to be priced between in the range of  ₹15–17 lakhThe firm currently produces and sells only an electric variant of its Tigor model to corporate fleet and taxi segments

Mumbai: Tata Motors Ltd will tap its popular Nexon compact sport utility vehicle (SUV) to enter the personal electric vehicle (EV) market in India in the March quarter.
The vehicle will feature Tata Motors’ in-house developed modular electric powertrain platform called Ziptron, which will power all its future electric cars targeted at the personal segment.
Tata Motors said in a statement on Thursday that the electric Nexon would be priced at  ₹15-17 lakh. This will make the vehicle much cheaper than Hyundai Motor India Ltd’s Kona electric compact SUV, which has a dealership price of about  ₹23.71 lakh. MG Motor India Ltd, a unit of China’s SAIC Motor Corp., plans to start selling its first electric vehicle eZS by the end of December.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is expected to unveil the electric Wagon R, its first electric vehicle, in 2020.
Hyundai is also developing affordable electric vehicles for the Indian market.
This comes amid a push by the government towards eco-friendly vehicles to cut rampant pollution and reduce costly oil imports.
A bevy of steps by the Modi administration, such as lowering corporate taxes on new manufacturing units, tax rebates on interest payments on loans for electric vehicles and customs duty exemption on lithium-ion cells, were aimed at accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles in India by making them more affordable.
Tata Motors’ decision to opt for the Nexon as its first EV for the personal vehicle market underscores its strategy to piggyback on the booming compact SUV segment.
Nexon was the second-largest selling car for Tata Motors in the last fiscal year, fetching an average sale of 4,500 units per month.
Also, unlike the intensely competitive small car segment where margins are the lowest, the compact SUV segment offers more elbow room on pricing a vehicle.
“I would not want to position an electric car in the small car segment because of price constraints,"" Shailesh Chandra, president, electric mobility business and corporate strategy, Tata Motors, had said in a recent interview.
The Nexon will target a range of about 300km per charge along with fast-charging capability, besides an eight-year warranty on the electric motor and battery—the two most critical components of any electric powertrain.
Analysts said the popularity of Nexon and its high safety ratings make the vehicle an attractive option for the EV foray.
“Also, Nexon has been awarded a 5-star adult safety rating by Global NCAP, which makes it a better proposition in terms of safety and premium quotient. Secondly, foraying with an electric Nexon is a calculated opportunity. Acceptance for an expensive hatchback is less than that for a compact SUV in the domestic market,"" said Gaurav Vangaal, country lead, light vehicle production forecasting, IHS Markit.
On 19 September, Tata Motors declared a shift in its EV strategy with a focus on the personal segment. The company currently produces and sells only an electric variant of its Tigor model to corporate fleet and taxi segments.
An auto analyst said, on the condition of anonymity, that Tata Motors aims to be the first to bring a locally-made electric car, offering superior value for money than existing electric vehicles.
“An electric Nexon from Tata Motors would be a showcase of its capabilities. Although per unit profitability is lower for electric cars as compared to the internal combustion engine models globally, rolling out electric cars will have no meaningful impact on the company’s already stressed financials in the near term,"" the analyst said.
Tata Motors’ all-new modular powertrain platform aims to address fundamental barriers such as running range per charge, safety, durability and others that largely kept buyers away from adopting electric vehicles."
93,2019-10-04,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors gained 6% on Thursday after its UK unit JLR reported a 5% rise in US September salesZee shares recovered from Tuesday’s double-digit fall, ending up nearly 8% on Thursday

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may remain in focus today:
Yes Bank: Shares of the bank surged 34% after managing director Ravneet Gill, at a conference call early on Thursday, assured investors and other stakeholders of the bank’s strong financial and liquidity position. The management of the bank said they were fully confident of recoveries from NPAs, improvement in deposits, and saw no stress building up on the asset-quality front.
HDIL: The Economic Offenders Wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police has arrested the company’s promoters — Sarang and Rakesh Wadhawan—for non-cooperation with officials in Punjab and Maharashtra (PMC) Bank case probe. More than two-thirds of the bank’s total loan book has exposure to HDIL. EOW has also attached property worth  ₹3,500 crore in the PMC Bank case.
IndusInd Bank: Shares of the private lender extended losses for the fourth straight session on Thursday due to concerns surrounding exposure to stressed sectors. The bank’s clarification that its exposure to a large housing finance company (HFC) was fully/strongly collateralised with no overdue failed to boost investor sentiment. The stock recovered marginally, ending down at 3%.
Piramal Enterprises: Shares of the company ended down 7% on Thursday due to concerns over exposure to stressed sectors, mainly real estate. Piramal Enterprises Ltd’s exposure to real-estate developer Lodha Group, which has been unable to meet its financial requirements amid a slowing economy, also weighed on the stock.
BPCL: The government has announced that it will entirely divest its stake in the company through strategic sale, which has improved investor sentiment. It also proposed selling its stake in Shipping Corp, THDC and North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd (NEEPCO). However, ratings agency Moody’s Investor Service called privatisation of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd “a credit negative"".
Zee Entertainment: Shares recovered from Tuesday’s double-digit fall, ending up nearly 8% on Thursday. The stock has been under pressure amid rising concerns over the company’s viability to meet financial requirements, despite the management’s assurance that the company was firm on its financial position.
Tata Motors: The auto company gained 6% on Thursday after its UK unit Jaguar Land Rover reported a 5% rise in US September sales. The increase in US sales offset a possible fall in share prices following 50% year-on-year decline in September domestic sales at 32,376 units. Tata had sold 64,598 vehicles in the same month last year.
Vedanta: Metal index was among the top losers in Thursday’s trade. According to latest data, growth in India's manufacturing sector remained weak in September and forward-looking indicators in a private business survey showed that the country's slowing economy may not start recovering anytime soon. This along with worries over global growth dragged down sentiment. The stock ended down 5%.
Hindalco: Weakness in domestic demand combined with global economic growth concerns weighed on metal stocks. Shares of the company ended more than 4% lower. A possible delay in revival of industrial and manufacturing activity may continue to put pressure on the sectoral index.
Indiabulls Housing Finance: Shares were under pressure due to worries over its proposed merger with Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) not going through, after Reserve Bank of India (RBI) placed the bank under prompt corrective action list on Saturday. In another setback, the Delhi High Court accepted a public interest litigation against Indiabulls for alleged financial irregularities."
92,2019-10-06,Tata Motors,"Consumers care about EVs, the excitement is there but that stops the moment we tell them the price, FADA vice president Vinkesh Gulati saidThere is a lack of charging infrastructure, a reluctance by banks to finance purchases and an unwillingness among govt departments to use EVs as directed

NEW DELHI :
Hyundai Motor Co. launched India’s first electric SUV this summer with a quirky TV commercial urging millennials to “Drive Into the Future."" A few months later, the automaker finds itself on a lonesome road.
In a nation of about 150 million drivers, only 130 Kona SUVs were sold to dealers through August. That slow pace is emblematic of the difficulties carmakers face in establishing an electric foothold in the fourth-biggest auto market, even with committed government support.
The Kona sells for about $35,000 while the average Indian earns about $2,000 a year — and the best-selling gas guzzler costs $4,000. Yet Kona’s sticker price only kicks off the conversation about why EVs aren’t gaining traction in India —there’s also a lack of charging infrastructure, a reluctance by banks to finance purchases and an unwillingness among government departments to use EVs as directed.
Barely more than 8,000 EVs were sold locally during the past six years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. China sells more than that in two days, according to BloombergNEF projections.
“The affordability of electric cars in India is just not there,"" said R.C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., maker of the sales leader Alto. “I don’t think the government or the car companies expect that in the next two to three years there will be any real buying of electric vehicles.""
The segment still isn’t making meaningful strides more than four years after the government started promoting cleaner vehicles for one of the world’s most-polluted countries. In February, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration committed to spending $1.4 billion on subsidies, infrastructure and publicity.
The potential of India’s EV market can’t be ignored. There are only 27 cars for every 1,000 Indians, compared with 570 for the same number of Germans, giving global automakers an opportunity to challenge the dominance of Maruti –- the unit of Japan’s Suzuki Motor Corp. that sells every other car on local roads.
Maruti’s not introducing its first EV until next year. Tata Motors Ltd. and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. build some base-level electric cars, yet they have a limited range or are exclusively for government use. The Kona gives Hyundai a first-mover advantage in a market where EVs may comprise 28% of new vehicle sales by 2040, according to BNEF.
Not only Hyundai sees opportunity in Asia’s third-largest economy. MG Motor, the iconic British carmaker owned by China’s SAIC Motor Corp., and Japan’s Nissan Motor Co. see EVs as a way to expand in the country.
“Somebody has to take the leadership, and it will trickle down,"" said Rajeev Chaba, managing director of MG Motor India, which plans to launch an electric SUV by December.
The process of scaling up will be slow, and MG Motors would be satisfied selling 100 cars a month initially.
“We have to start somewhere,"" Chaba said.
Right now, though, consumers pass over electric cars for bigger, longer-range and cheaper gas guzzlers, said Vinkesh Gulati, vice president of the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations, which represents more than 80% of automobile dealers in India.
More than half of the passenger vehicles sold in India last year cost $8,000 or less, according to BNEF. Electric cars won’t achieve price parity with gasoline-powered cars until the early 2030s, BNEF said.
“Consumers care about EVs, the excitement is there,"" Gulati said. “But that stops the moment we tell them the price.""
Yet even for those who can afford the Kona, plugging in is problematic. Nidhi Maheshwary, a 40-year-old finance professional working near New Delhi, wanted to buy an EV to show her children an example of environmental responsibility.
So when Hyundai launched the Kona, Maheshwary ordered one. Sounds easy, but it didn’t turn out that way.
Almost immediately, she got into a spat with neighbors about charging the SUV in her apartment building’s basement lot. The residents’ society said it posed a fire risk -– even though Hyundai engineers and the fire department said it was safe.
So Maheshwary charges the car at her office while weighing potential recourse against those neighbors. Hyundai offers two small chargers with the Kona, although it can take as many as 19 hours to fill up the vehicle.
India had an estimated 650 charging stations for cars and SUVs in 2018, according to BNEF. China, the largest market for EVs, has about 456,000 charging points, official data shows.
India’s sparse charging infrastructure stems from locals’ chicken-and-egg approach to the issue.
At a conference in New Delhi last month, government officials and EV-component makers debated whether to create adequate charging infrastructure to promote sales or whether to wait until there are enough EVs on the roads before building it out.
“We are pretty sure that people are going to like our EV, but we would have our challenges like infrastructure,"" Chaba said. “But we have our plans to handle that.""
Those include first requiring that the buyer can install a charger at home, he said.
But there’s another factor besides income that makes it difficult to pay for one of these cars. The unaffordability of EVs also stems from the unavailability of financing, said Pranavant P., a partner at Deloitte India focusing on the future of mobility.
Until there’s an established secondary market for EVs, banks and other institutions are hesitant to extend purchasing loans, he said. A majority of Indian vehicle sales are financed by lenders.
The government, both federal and local, will have to offer help for EVs to be adopted in the mass market, said Puneet Anand, group head of marketing at Hyundai Motor India. Modi’s budget in July included incentives such as reduced taxes, income tax benefits and import duty exemptions for certain EV parts.
The first beneficiaries will be the ubiquitous scooters and motorcycles -- with subsidies meaning to support sales of 1 million two-wheelers, compared with 55,000 electric cars.
Yet the government still needs to practice what it’s preaching. Energy Efficiency Services Ltd., a joint venture of state-run companies responsible for replacing state vehicles with EVs, awarded its first tender in September 2017 for 10,000 cars.
But as of July, agencies had accepted only 1,000 of them. Now EESL is offering the vehicles to taxi companies.
None of that helps Devdas Nair, a 34-year-old advertising professional in New Delhi looking for new wheels. He wants to try an EV and says he’d pay somewhat more to help the environment and for future savings. Yet for him right now, it’s too much of a gamble.
“I was excited about the Kona, but the price tag is just too much,"" he said. “We don’t even know how the charging infrastructure is going to be in India. That makes me rethink -- actually not think about it at all."

89,2019-10-08,Tata Motors,"In its current form, Tata Nano will not meet the new safety regulations and BS-VI emission normsTata Motors has sold only one unit of Nano car in 2019

NEW DELHI :
Tata Motors has not produced a single unit of its entry-level car Nano in the first nine months of 2019 but sold just one unit in February in the domestic market although it is yet to officially announce that the model has been discontinued.
The company has so far been maintaining that no decision has been made yet on the future of the Nano saying production planning of a car is a ""conscious management of demand, system inventory and planned efficiencies"".
It has, however, admitted that in its current form the Nano will not meet the new safety regulations and BS-VI emission norms.
As per regulatory filings by the company, there was no production and sales of the Nano in the domestic market in September this year making it the ninth consecutive month that Tata Motors has not produced the small car.
After selling just one unit in February this year, the company has also not sold a single unit of the Nano in the rest of the months of the year so far, according to the filings.
Nano, which was unveiled in January 2008 at the Auto Expo with much expectations of being the people's car, could not live up to the billing. Its sales have been dwindling over the years.
In the January-September period 2018, Tata Motors had produced a total of 297 units and sold 299 units of the Nano in the domestic market, according to the filings.
On the issue of discontinuing the Nano, Tata Motors has insisted that ""Decisions on product life cycle is a holistic view taken after considering the market developments, regulations and emerging competitive landscape. Any such decisions are announced as and when it's taken"".
Company officials had, however, hinted that production and sales of the Nano would stop from April 2020 as Tata Motors has no plans to invest further on Ratan Tata’s dream car to meet strict emission norm under Bharat Stage-VI and other safety regulations.
The Nano was launched in the market in March 2009 with an initial price of close to  ₹1 lakh for the basic model despite cost escalations, with Tata insisting that ""a promise is a promise"".
However, from the beginning, Nano courted trouble. It was originally planned to be rolled out from Tata Motors' proposed plant at Singur in West Bengal, where it faced intense political and farmer protests against land acquisition. The company had to shift its production to a new plant at Sanand in Gujarat.
Instances of the car catching fire initially after it was launched didn't help its cause either.
Tata had admitted that the company made the mistake of promoting the Nano as 'the cheapest car'.
It become a loss-making model for Tata Motors with ex-Tata Sons chairman Mistry, who was abruptly removed from the post, even went on to claim that the Nano ""consistently lost value, peaking at  ₹1,000 crore"".
Mistry also termed the Nano as one of the ""legacy hotspots"" and there was ""no line of sight to profitability for the Nano, any turnaround strategy"".
He had also claimed that Tata Motors did not stop producing the car due to ""emotional reasons"".

87,2019-10-09,Tata Motors,"Some of the biggest commercial vehicle makers remain hopeful of advance purchases of BS-IV M&HCVs in the second half of FY20The CV makers had earlier projected advance buying of BS-IV vehicles to trigger an expected price rise under the BS-VI regime which will kick off from 1 April 2020

Commercial vehicle makers in India have mixed views on a potential spurt in sales of Bharat Stage IV medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCVs) in the remainder of this fiscal year ahead of the implementation of more stringent emission norms.
Some of the biggest commercial vehicle makers—Tata Motors Ltd, Ashok Leyland, Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles Ltd and Scania—remain hopeful of advance purchases of BS-IV M&HCVs in the second half of FY20.
Daimler India and the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (Fada) whose members include commercial vehicle dealers aren’t so optimistic.
Mint spoke to about a dozen stakeholders in the CV industry to ascertain their views on the commercial vehicle industry, which stands divided at the moment on the anticipated pre-buying of specifically medium and heavy trucks.
The CV makers had earlier projected advance buying of BS-IV vehicles to trigger an expected price rise under the BS-VI regime which will kick off from 1 April 2020. This, they hoped, would bring in much-needed relief for the industry, experiencing its worst sales slump in two decades.
However, key dealer partners, battling an abnormal build up of M&HCV stocks, don’t expect pre-buying of these trucks anytime soon.
Liquidation of existing inventory of BS-IV trucks by the 31 March deadline is also posing a stiff challenge for the dealers even as they continue to burn cash in the form of interest payments on loans to fund their unsold stocks.
BS-VI compliant M&HCVs are expected to cost 8-10% more than the existing BS-IV models.
In its retail and inventory data from July to August, Fada reported CV inventory build-up of up to 60 days. CV sales are estimated to have fallen about 24% year-on-year during the fiscal first half to 352,331 units. M&HCV sales plunged more than 60% in the September quarter on factory shutdowns, according to data issued by the companies.
Ashish Harsharaj Kale, president, Fada said while good monsoons will definitely drive pre-buying in the light commercial vehicle segment (LCVs), the real problem lies in the M&HCV space. “The pre-buy in M&HCVs will primarily depend upon the price differential (between BS-IV and BS-VI models). While pre-buying of tipper trucks would depend upon new projects awarded to the contractors, I don’t know if any pre-buying will happen in the 16-tonne and above multi-axle or haulage truck segment,"" said Kale, adding pre-buying may only happen if the subdued market demand picks up in November and December.
Also, unlike cars and two-wheelers, the festive season does not impact the M&HCV segment, Kale said.
“A truck operator will buy a new truck only if he sees guaranteed business or will have a new contract for 6-12 months of next fiscal,"" said Shamsher Dewan, vice president, Icra Ltd. Dewan estimates the M&HCV segment to comprise multi-axle or haulage trucks (45-50%), tipper trucks (25-30%) and tractor-trailers (25%). Of these, while construction activity drives demand for tipper trucks, freight movement impacts the haulage trucks, which was also affected by axle load norms introduced in July last year.
Under the new axle load norms, the government raised the permissible gross vehicle weight of over 16 tonne heavy trucks by about 12-25%, creating excess carrying capacity for fleet operators.
Vinod Aggarwal, managing director and chief executive, Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles, said he expects pre-buying on productivity push by large fleet operators as new trucks offer more carrying capacity besides better ergonomics. “Why would fleet operators who see business in H1FY21 not buy more affordable BS-IV trucks in Q4FY20?"" he asked."

Siblings Susanne Klatten and Stefan Quandt own almost half of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG.
The billionaires are descendants of Guenther Quandt, who built a German industrial empire by, among other things, supplying weapons to the Nazis during World War II. In the years since, the family has established stakes in both Daimler-Benz AG and BMW.
Today, Klatten is Germany’s second-richest person, worth $18.6 billion, with interests in chemicals and carbon production, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Quandt, who owns part of a logistics company and a homeopathic medicine company, has a net worth of $15.5 billion. Both are members of BMW’s supervisory board, making them the richest related pair deriving wealth from the automotive industry.
All told, the 25 richest families in the world now control almost $1.4 trillion in wealth, up 24% from last year. Our list of the 20 wealthiest people who have made fortunes in the automotive sector includes some household names: Tesla’s Elon Musk is worth $23.1 billion; Larry Ellison, with $58.5 billion in total wealth, owns a stake in Tesla that’s worth more than $730 million.
Others are less prominent but no less successful: Pallonji Mistry, chairman of Shapoorji Pallonji Group, owns much of Tata Sons and is worth $20.3 billion; Li Shu Fu, the chairman of Volvo and Geely, is worth $10.6 billion.
The Method
The methodology behind wealth analysis can be challenging. In fortunes backed by decades of accumulated assets and dividends, the true extent of an individual’s or family’s holdings is often obscured. Most in this tax bracket are not thrilled to have their names, assets, shares, and interests published by a global news organization. Automotive wealth also tends to be a family affair. While individual members of these dynasties may not make the list, a clan’s overall wealth may be vast. (See: the Ford, Porsche, and Pieech families.) So we followed the same criteria applied to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index.
In order to keep it (relatively) simple, we have omitted those whose wealth comes from oil. Take the House of Saud, for instance. The family is worth an estimated $100 billion, a figure based on the cumulative payouts the country’s royals have received over the past five decades from the executive office of the king. That number doesn’t even include the planned initial public offering of its crown jewel, oil giant Saudi Aramco. It will be offered with an anticipated valuation of $2 trillion.
Maybe we’ll come up with a special list for members of the House of Saud. In the meantime, here are the year’s richest people in cars.*

84,2019-10-12,Tata Motors,"MG Motor India has delivered little more than 6,000 units since the Hector’s launch in the last week of JuneIt currently has more than 30,000 pending bookings for the Hector SUV

Grappling with challenges around its supply chain and production ramp up of its first car in the domestic market, the Hector, a sports utility vehicle (SUV), MG Motor India Pvt Ltd said that it is still evaluating the start of production of its BS VI compliant SUV.
Speaking to Mint on the sidelines of the opening of its first flagship showroom in South Mumbai on October 10, Gaurav Gupta, chief commercial officer, MG Motor India said, “We do have customer bookings to cater to and we are continuously reviewing our manufacturing plans. We are still evaluating the production schedules for BSVI compliant Hector as we are yet to take a decision on that.""
The company said for now it is working to streamline its supply chain to be able to start off the second shift at its Halol-based manufacturing unit from November. “The priority is to keep the increasing wait list for customers in check,"" said Gupta.
The SAIC Motor Corp Ltd-owned carmaker claims that its current order book has more than 30,000 pending bookings for the Hector SUV. It has delivered little more than 6,000 units since the Hector’s launch in the last week of June.
Gupta said the second shift would grow the carmaker’s monthly manufacturing capacity from 2,500 units to up to 3,500 units. Although MG Motor says that the average waiting period is 3-4 months, the company-claimed numbers suggest otherwise.
The carmaker, which claims to be working to localize the Hector up to 75%, has been struggling to procure critical components that are imported from its global suppliers. Although MG Motor remains tightlipped on the matter, sources have suggested that the suppliers could not ramp up parts supplies in tandem with the initial booking numbers conveyed by the carmaker, thereby leading to serious supply chain issues.
“We have been talking to the suppliers in the backend because they have to increase their supplies. Some of our suppliers are global as some of them are based in Europe. Even as they expand their operations, this has to be supported with hiring of new workforce on ground for training. Once we got that clarity and assurance that we will be able to expand on time, we reopened bookings again,"" clarified Gupta.
Meanwhile, several carmakers have started preparing for the production of BS VI compliant models. Maruti Suzuki is leading the pack with eight BS VI compliant models already retailing at its showrooms. Other carmakers including Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors have already drawn their respective production schedules for BS VI compliant cars and SUVs.
Gaurav Vangaal, country lead, light vehicle production forecasting, IHS Markit said, “MG Motor India should launch the BS VI compliant Hector by February next year as they are in the best position right now with ample bookings at hand and good demand for the Hector SUV. Most carmakers are moving to BS VI from Dec-Jan period and some of them have already moved lion’s share of their portfolio to BS VI. MG Motor will have to start rolling out BS VI models not later than February.""
MG Motor India also plans to unveil its first electric car eZS in India in December later this year and start retails from January 2020. The MG eZS, a compact SUV, will be imported via completely knocked down (CKD) route and will be assembled at its Halol plant."

NEW DELHI :
Passenger vehicle (PV) exports increased by over 4% in the first half of the current fiscal, with Hyundai Motor India leading the segment with dispatches of over 103,000 units to various geographies like Africa and Latin America, as per the latest data by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam).
PV exports stood at 365,282 units in April-September period of the current fiscal, as compared with 349,951 units in the same period of 2018-19.
Car shipments saw a 5.61% increase at 286,495 units, while utility vehicle exports saw a marginal rise at 77,397 units during the April-September period, the data showed.
However, vans witnessed a 27.57% decline in exports at 1,390 units during the period under review as compared with 1,919 units in the same period in the last fiscal year.
Hyundai Motor India led the segment, followed by Ford India Pvt. Ltd and Maruti Suzuki India Ltd at second and third positions respectively.
The South Korean automaker exported 103,300 units to overseas markets during the April-September period, up 19.26% from same period last fiscal.
“Our global experience over the years helps us cater to the needs of 91 varied markets with different products,"" said S.S.Kim, chief executive officer and managing director of Hyundai Motor India.
The company’s models like Grand i10 and i20 are popular in Africa and Latin America, while Creta and Verna find a lot of takers in African, Latin American and Middle East countries.
Ford India’s foreign dispatches stood at 71,850 units during the April-September period, down 6.6% from the year-ago period.
On the other hand, domestic car market leader Maruti Suzuki India exported 52,603 units across global markets, down 4.09% from the same period last year.
Consumer offers on cars during the festive season have reached a peak and it will go down going forward, as keeping discounts at such high levels is unsustainable, a senior Maruti Suzuki India official said.
The company, which is offering cash discounts and extended warranties on various models, witnessed its sales jump by 18-20% last month as compared with July and August.
“We clearly tried to revive the market but we cannot have high level of promotions all the time, these are not sustainable. So, going forward there will be decline in terms of offers,"" Shashank Srivastava, Maruti Suzuki India executive director for marketing and sales said.
The company also expects current month to be better in terms of sales as compared with the same period last year.
“These are probably the green shoots and if we look at first week of October—which was Navratra period—then bookings and retails have been better than last year as far as Navratra period goes,"" Srivastava said.
General Motors India Pvt. Ltd, which has ceased selling vehicles in the domestic market, shipped out 40,096 units during the period between April and September.
Volkswagen India Pvt. Ltd exported 37,908 units in April-September period, followed by Nissan Motor India Pvt. Ltd which dispatched 33,897 units. Home grown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd exported 7,280 units, while Renault India Pvt. Ltd shipped out 6,885 units during the period.

New Delhi: Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus Tata Sons, will invest an undisclosed amount in Tork Motors, the Pune-based electric motorcycle startup said on Monday. While Tork has been readying for the launch of its first product, the T6X, Mint has learnt that the startup, for some time now, has been on a lookout to raise funds in excess of  ₹250 crore to fund its operations.
In the past, Kapil Shelke-led Tork Motors raised funds from Bharat Forge and Bhavish Aggarwal, founder, Ola Cabs. Bharat Forge, one of the leading auto component manufacturers, had invested  ₹34 crore and holds an equity stake of almost 49%. According to Tork Motors, collaboration with Bharat Forge has assisted the startup with engineering, plant designing, manufacturing and supply chain capabilities.
The startup said that its first product, T6X electric motorcycle, is powered by a lithium ion battery capable of providing a range of 100km in a single charge and can be charged up to 80% in an hour. Sources aware of the development at Tork Motors suggest that the startup has decided to go ahead with a 3.5kWh battery on the T6X wherein the battery unit will be dust and water proof. The T6X has been under development for over past 4 years.
“Tork is aiming at retails of 5,000 units in the first year starting off from Pune city. In its second year of sales, they plan to expand to Bangalore and ramp up their annual retails to up to 20,000 units,"" said a source who did not wished to be named. He added that the T6X is pegged to cost around  ₹1.5 lakh once it is launched and will compete with premium 125cc-200cc motorcycles.
“We have recently opened up our first fast-charging station in Pune. Our flagship product is ready and we plan to launch it soon. The T6X is a completely indigenized electric motorcycle,"" Shelke, founder and CEO, told this publication. He refused to disclose the amount he plans to raise from Ratan Tata, citing the non-disclosure agreement. “The formal procedures are underway,"" he told Mint today.
Commenting on the investment in e-bike startup, Tata said, “In the last few years, there has been a sea change in the attitude towards electric vehicles. This industry is changing rapidly and I place good value on the sound logic and the approach that the team at Tork Motors has taken.""
“I am glad that Mr Tata’s office representative visited the (Tork’s) factory, understood the concept, evaluated the product and had ridden the (electric) motorcycle. Post this, Mr Tata took an informed decision,"" Shelke said in a press note issued today."
81,2019-10-16,Tata Motors,"JLR has waned to such an extent that it had to launch a $3.2 bn savings plan and slash jobs worldwideThe chairman of Tata Sons says he wants operational control of JLR

New York/New Delhi: Tata Sons Ltd, the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, said it is open to finding partners for the automaker, but isn’t planning on selling the embattled unit.
“We’re not going to sell,"" said Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, the holding company in an expansive business empire that includes Tata Motors Ltd. “Auto is a core business for us. From revenue terms, auto is our largest company.""
Tata Motors bought the maker of the Jaguar XE sedan and Land Rover Discovery sport utility vehicle from Ford Motor Co. in 2008. After turning into a cash cow with booming sales in countries like Russia and China, JLR waned to such an extent that it has had to launch a $3.2 billion savings programme and slash thousands of jobs worldwide.
Losses at Tata’s automotive business have mounted with a slump in India’s car market, as well as trouble overseas, including an economic slowdown in China, where auto sales are sliding, and uncertainty over Brexit. JLR is closing its UK factories for a week in November to guard against disruption to supply chains from a possible no-deal Brexit.
Chandrasekaran said China sales have “collapsed"" with a 50% drop last year, though 2019 is showing some improvement. Some problems were self-inflicted, including vehicle quality and dealer issues, he said, noting that the auto industry is “going through difficult times"".
“Getting the right portfolio, which one we invest in for electric vehicles, and how do we cut cost"" are issues that need to be resolved, he said.
In an interview with Bloomberg Television earlier on Tuesday, Chandrasekaran said dealing with tariffs is the “new normal"" for the global auto industry and that negotiations around Britain’s exit from the European Union have taken too long. “Sometimes it’s better to have clarity than a desirable result,"" he said. “Nations are getting more protective.""
The troubles of JLR are bogging down the Tata group as a whole, with Tata Motors writing down its investment in the British brands earlier this year by $3.9 billion. The salt-to-software conglomerate is among India’s most indebted, and the slump in the auto market is hitting both Tata Motors and Tata Steel. Analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein last month described JLR as “severely challenged"" and said Tata Motors should look at BMW AG as a buyer because the German company is “awash with cash"". Tata has previously denied reports it is looking at strategic options for JLR, including a possible stake sale.
While the company would “always look for partnerships"", it doesn’t want deals where “we just sell a stake and we have no say"", Chandrasekaran said in New York on Tuesday. “We are not financial investors, Tata group, we run companies. I’m not a Blackstone, I’m not a KKR.""
JLR’s capital expenditure has outpaced operating cash flow over the past two years, but Chandrasekaran said his target is to reverse that trend by 2021. “Once we do that, then people will believe what I’m saying: I’m not running away.""

Hours before a summit of all 28 EU national leaders, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker tweeted: ""We have one! It's a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions.""
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that the two sides had struck a ""great new deal"" and urged UK lawmakers to ratify it in a special session on Saturday.
Immediately complicating matters was Johnson's Northern Irish government allies which didn't waste a minute to say they could not back the outline deal because of provisions for the Irish border.
Johnson needs all the support he can get to push any deal past a deeply divided Parliament and will surely temper jubilation at the EU summit. The UK parliament already rejected a previous deal three times.
Technical negotiators struggled longest to finetune customs and sales tax regulations that will have to manage trade in goods between the Northern Ireland and Ireland — where the UK and the EU share their only land border.
After months of gloom over the stalled Brexit process, European leaders have sounded upbeat this week. French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday that ""I want to believe that a deal is being finalized,"" while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said negotiations were ""in the final stretch.""
They were proven right on Thursday.
Upon the news, the pound hit a five-month high upon the US dollar.
Johnson — who took office in July vowing Britain would finally leave the EU on Oct. 31, come what may — likened Brexit to climbing Mount Everest.
He will have to climb some more to get the Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party on board. DUP leader Arlene Foster and the party's parliamentary chief Nigel Dodds said they ""could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues,"" referring to a say the Northern Irish authorities might have in future developments.
The party said the position was unchanged after the announcement of the provisional deal.
Both the customs and consent arrangements are key to guaranteeing an open border between the UK's Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland — the main obstacle to a Brexit deal."

77,2019-10-17,Tata Motors,"Stocks of Bajaj Auto, Eicher Motors, Tata Steel, Tata Motors and Motherson Sumi will be impacted by the Brexit deal

The announcement of a new Brexit deal agreed between the UK and European Union (EU) came in just before the Indian equity markets closed on Thursday. Global and domestic investors cheered the news of Britain’s departure from the EU, with benchmark Indian indices rallying to end near one-month high.
While the Sensex surged 453 points to close above the 39,000 mark at the fag end of today’s session, Nifty 50 settled 1% higher at 11,586, the highest levels for both the indices since 24 September.
Shares of Indian companies that have business exposure to the UK and Europe--Tata Motors Ltd, Eicher Motors Ltd, Bajaj Auto Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd, Bharat Forge, Mastek Ltd, Tata Elxsi Ltd and Motherson Sumi Systems Ltd--boomed in the last 30 minutes of today’s trade.
Here is a list of five major Indian stocks impacted by the Brexit deal:
Tata Motors: Shares of the auto company surged nearly 10% today as looming uncertainty around no-deal Brexit ended. Tata Motors-owned luxury carmaker brand Jaguar Land Rover had decided to suspend all manufacturing operations in the UK for a week starting 4 November. The Coventry-based company contributes almost three quarters to the consolidated revenue of Tata Motors.
Motherson Sumi: The auto-component maker has operations across Europe and is a supplier of electrical and wiring systems for automotives. Motherson Sumi is the flagship company of the $11.5 billion Samvardhana Motherson Group. Shares of the company closed up 9% as a fresh Brexit deal indicated smooth exit of Britain from the EU.
Tata Steel: The Indian steelmaker is one of Europe's leading steel producers, with steelmaking in the Netherlands and the UK, and manufacturing plants across Europe. Automotive, constructive and packaging are the key UK markets for Tata Steel. The company supplies almost 50% of UK carmakers’ steel requirements. Shares of the company ended up more than 2%.
Eicher Motors: The stock of the company rose nearly 7% after the Brexit deal announcement. The US, UK and Europe are major markets for sales of motorcycles under Eicher Motors’ brand Royal Enfield. The company has a technical centre in the UK that leads research and development of motorcycles for international markets. Royal Enfield has a technology development centre located in Chennai.
Bajaj Auto: The auto company had announced a partnership with UK-based Triumph Motorcycles in August 2017 to capture the mid-weight motorcycles market in India. Bajaj Auto also exports two and three wheelers to the Europe and a no-deal Brexit would have likely caused disruptions in the supply chain. The stock of the two-wheeler manufacturer settled 3% higher."
74,2019-10-18,Tata Motors,"The news brings a huge relief for investors when investors were fearful of a “no-deal Brexit”Tata Motors’ has hit a hard patch in both domestic and international markets

Mumbai: The Brexit deal euphoria that ignited Tata Motors Ltd’s stock on Thursday seems to have ebbed. Shares of the global auto giant eased by 2% on Friday, shedding a part of the 13% gain clocked the previous day.
To be sure, the news brings a huge relief for investors when investors were fearful of a “no-deal Brexit"". A “no-deal Brexit"" would imply uncertainty on customs duties when goods are moved between the United Kingdom and countries in the European Union (EU). It would have put Jaguar Land Rover Ltd., the 100% subsidiary of Tata Motors at a disadvantage on vehicles exported from UK to EU nations.
After all, about a fifth of JLR’s sales accrues from European markets. Meanwhile, there is pessimism on global auto markets, both on consumption and excess capacity.
A Brexit deal therefore, puts the uncertainty to rest. Some analysts reckon that it negates the risk of 10-12% duty that was anticipated on finished goods exported from UK. Duties would have made JLR vehicles more competitive when exported to European nations. As such, the cost of production in the UK is among the highest, globally.
According to Jigar Shah, ceo of Maybank Kim Eng. Securities India Pvt. Ltd, “Duties on goods shipped between the two regions may still be imposed. But a Brexit deal would mean that the rules of trade would be set, leaving no uncertainty."" Meanwhile, set terms of trade would alleviate fears of administrative issues between the two regions, while conducting trade.
Yet, it may not be time to cheer still. The details of the deal and its impact also on currency movements would determine profitability of JLR’s operations in UK.
That apart, Tata Motors’ has hit a hard patch in both domestic and international markets. JLR’s China sales have improved for three months in a row after about 15 months of sharp decline. This may pull up overall sales of JLR during Q2FY20, although the developed markets are still facing a slowdown in passenger car sales.
In domestic markets, Q2FY20 commercial vehicle sales have seen the worst contraction in a decade. A weak growth in gross domestic product and the transition to BS-VI norms that will hike truck prices are likely to keep CV sales in the downcycle for few more quarters.
As a result of weak fundamentals, analysts have pencilled a consolidated net loss in excess of  ₹1,000 crore for the quarter. This will weigh on the stock's performance. Also, investors must brace for some volatility on Monday as the weekend may unveil details on the Brexit deal."

MUMBAI :
The Indian markets may react to British Parliament's vote to delay a decision on Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal next week.
Besides, the way ahead will depend on the portfolio investments, which have been strong during the last 5 sessions.
On Thursday, the Sensex crossed the 39,000 mark with a 453 point gain after news of a Brexit deal between the UK and the EU. Tata Motors jumped 9.82% on the BSE.
""The Indian markets had rallied late last week on hopes of an early Brexit resolution. The latest development can reverse that optimism to some extent. However, doubts prevail about how smoothly the whole process will get completed,"" said Deepak Jasani of HDFC Securities.
""The negative impact of this development could be limited. But companies that were supposed to benefit the most from an early Brexit resolution and which had rallied sharply on Friday may see a larger negative impact,"" Jasani added.
Besides, the investors will await corporate results from Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bajaj Auto, HCL Technologies, Hero MotoCorp, Larsen & Toubro, ITC, Maruti Suzuki and State Bank of India.
Buying was seen in all the sessions of this week. Nifty index ended with gains on all the five trading sessions of the week. The Nifty ended with gains of 3.16% week on week.

72,2019-10-21,Tata Motors,"Preference for Kona is despite its price being almost double that of Tata Motors’ Tigor and M&M’s Verito EVs'Kona’s battery size is almost three times that of Tigor and Verito; running cost is just 40 paisa/km,' says EESL MD Saurabh Kumar

New Delhi: The Union government has placed initial orders with Hyundai Motor Co. for the Kona electric compact sport-utility vehicle.
This comes as the government’s largest electric vehicle (EV) procurement programme, run by state-owned Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL), faces bottlenecks because of issues such as vehicle quality and a lack of demand, according to several government officials.
Power and new and renewable energy minister Raj Kumar Singh, and NTPC chairman and managing director Gurdeep Singh have started using the Kona, which went on sale in July. Top officials at policy think tank NITI Aayog too are keen to use the vehicle.
The preference for the Kona is despite the vehicle’s price tag of  ₹23.71 lakh post government subsidies, which is about double that of Tata Motors Ltd’s Tigor and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd’s e-Verito electric sedans.
The Kona can travel up to 452km on a single charge and has a 39.2 kilowatt hour (kWh) advanced lithium polymer battery. The Tigor and e-Verito have less than 20kWh batteries.
“Kona’s battery size is almost three times that of these other cars (Tigor and e-Verito). The running cost is just 40 paisa/km. It’s a brilliant car in terms of comfort and this is the beauty of EVs anyway,"" said EESL MD Saurabh Kumar.
Only 500 Tigors have been supplied by Tata Motors to EESL so far, while M&M has delivered 1,000 e-Veritos. This was in response to the two companies receiving orders from EESL in September 2017 for 10,000 cars. While 60% of the sedans were to be supplied by Tata Motors, the rest were to come from M&M.
EESL now plans to limit the final order to around 3,000 cars by March 2020 amid an economic slowdown.
Mint reported on 27 June, 2018 that senior government officials were refusing to use EVs made by M&M and Tata Motors, citing poor performance and low mileage.
The problems with the Tigor included issues related to AC cooling, pick-up, sudden battery discharge and inability to charge. These were resolved after a delay, according to EESL.
Miffed with the quality of Tigor cars, EESL in a 10 April 2018 note to the automaker reviewed by Mint said: “It has been observed that Tata Motors is not taking any sincere steps to resolve these issues, causing delay and leading to customer dissatisfaction.""
“The performance of Tata Motors is found to be below par and EESL will not accept delivery of any new vehicle till all the issues with the existing cars have been rectified,"" it said.
Tata Motors has denied that there are quality issues with the EVs. A company spokesperson said in an emailed response: “After getting the LoA (letter of award) from EESL, we have completed the phase 1 deliveries in line with the technical specifications of the tender.""
Queries emailed to spokespersons of EESL, M&M, power ministry and Hyundai Motor India Ltd remained unanswered till press time."

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Friday:
Bharti Airtel: The stock closed more than 3% higher on Thursday, having slumped 6% after the Supreme Court upheld the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) provided by the department of telecommunications (DoT). This came as a major blow for telecom companies as they will now have to pay  ₹92,000 crore in past dues at a time of rising debt and shrinking revenues.
Vodafone Idea: The stock crashed 23% on Thursday due to concerns over the telecom operator shutting down as investors anticipated that it will not be able to meet its payment obligations under the DoT’s definition of AGR. Vodafone Idea Ltd alone has to pay a massive  ₹28,308 crore as the SC ruled in favour of the government.

SBI: The largest public-sector bank will announce its September quarter earnings later today. Shares were under pressure on Thursday after the SC rejected telecom operators’ definition of AGR.

68,2019-10-25,Tata Motors,"JLR typically accounts for more than 70% of Tata Motors' revenuesThe unit reported retail sales of 128,953 units for the quarter ended September, down 0.7% year-on-year

Tata Motors Ltd (TML) is expected to report a subdued performance for the September quarter largely because of flat retail sales clocked by Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) globally. This comes amid a tough quarter for its India business as well across commercial and passenger vehicles.
JLR, which typically accounts for more than 70% of TML’s revenues, reported retail sales of 128,953 units for the quarter ended September, down 0.7% year-on-year. The performance could have been worse but for a recovery in China, its biggest market, where retail sales grew 24.3% year-on-year.
JLR said retails sales were also slightly up (+0.9%) in Europe, which along with China recovery, covered up for lower sales in the US (-1.0%), UK (-5.1%) and in other overseas markets (-19.2%).
ICICI Securities expects JLR to post revenue of GBP 5.5 billion, down about 2% on year, with adjusted EBIDTA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margin of 7.4% (down 170 bps YoY). ""On operational basis, we expect JLR to report a loss of GBP 79 million,"" the report said.
JLR’s flat retail sales, in the backdrop of sharp drops in the past quarters, were clearly driven by the year-on-year growth in Land Rover sales, which stood at 91,630 units in the past quarter, up 4.2%. Jaguar, on the other hand, reported sales of 37,323 units during Q2, down 11% on year.
The company said the Evoque compact sports utility vehicle (SUV) model drove demand for the Land Rover portfolio. The retail sales of the Range Rover Evoque grew 54.6% on year as the all-new model went on sale in the China market. JLR had also disclosed that the Land Rover numbers were driven by strong demand for the Range Rover Sport (+17.5%) and the Jaguar I-Pace (sales of 3,666 units, up by 2,593 units YoY).
Tata Motors’ standalone results are expected to take a bigger hit for the quarter ending September due to continued demand slump for commercial and passenger vehicles in the domestic market. At 94,454 units, TML’s domestic vehicle sales fell a sharp 46% on year, with medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCVs) being the worst hit due to axle load norms, low freight volumes and freight rates. The CV business, TML’s backbone in India, is also expected to remain subdued on heavy discounting during the past quarter.
The exports business was hit as well on subdued orders from global markets. TML reported a steep 33% year-on-year decline in its quarterly exports, which stood at 10,577 units.
ICICI Securities expects TML's standalone business to see a 44% on year decline in topline, while EBIDTA margin is expected to fall 407 bps to 4.4%.
Motilal Oswal Securities estimates TML's consolidated revenue to decline 12.3% YoY, resulting in a net loss of  ₹14.8 billion (against  ₹5.6 billion loss in Q2FY19 and loss of  ₹36 billion in Q1FY20). The brokerage expects JLR's net realisation to increase 3.2% YoY, and on a standalone business, it estimates EBIDTA margin to decline to 2.2%, and a net loss of  ₹6.1 billion (against  ₹1.9 billion net profit in Q2FY19)."

Jaguar Land Rover owner Tata Motors today reported a smaller-than-expected loss in the second quarter, as sales of the luxury car picked up in China, amid slowing demand for passenger and commercial vehicles in the home market.
Net loss for the three months ended September 30 narrowed to  ₹217 crore from  ₹1,049 crore a year ago. Revenue fell 9% to  ₹65,432 crore.

Tata Motors Ltd (TML) has reported a consolidated net loss of  ₹217 crore in Q2FY20 on increased tax expenses and accumulated losses from joint ventures, primarily the Cherry Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Company Ltd, its JV unit in China.
The company has reported accumulated losses of  ₹363 crore in Q2FY20 as against a profit of  ₹86 crore under the same head in Q2FY19. On year-on-year basis, the company has managed to narrow down its losses, which stood at  ₹1,049 crore in Q2FY19 on high quarterly expenditures.
TML has reported operational revenues of  ₹65,432 crore in Q2FY20 as against  ₹71,981 crore from the year-ago period. The 9% YoY decline in revenues were on account of subdued performance across Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and its domestic business. JLR accounted for about 81% of Tata Motors’ operational revenues in the September quarter.
The British luxury carmaker had earlier reported retail sales of 128,953 units for the quarter ended September, down 0.7% YoY. The performance could have been worse but for a recovery in China, its biggest market, where retail sales grew 24.3% year-on-year.
Giving clarity to Mint on the JLR business, PB Balaji, group CFO, TML said that although the locally manufactured JLR models (under JV with Chery) continue to report losses, the imported car business has seen strong demand, thereby turning around the overall retails.
JLR’s retail sales were also slightly up (+0.9%) in Europe, which along with China recovery, covered up for lower sales in the US (-1.0%), UK (-5.1%) and in other overseas markets (-19.2%).
Commercial and passenger vehicles contributed  ₹8,713 crore and  ₹2,056 crore respectively to TML’s consolidated revenues.

Tata Motors has also announced that its board of directors has approved a preferential allotment of ordinary shares and warrants to Tata Sons for an amount of  ₹6,500 crore, subject to shareholder approval.
Balaji said that the equity infusion from the promoters, Tata Sons, will help TML to largely reduce its debts. Meanwhile, TML’s board has also approved an external commercial borrowing of up to  ₹3,500 crore aimed at refinancing the existing debts.
Balaji said that TML’s total (automotive) debt stands at around  ₹50,000 crore, wherein the standalone debt is about  ₹20,000 crore.
The CFO added that the company has seen growing retail sales month-on-month on account of the ongoing festive season in the domestic market."

The board also approved raising  ₹3,500 crore via external commercial borrowing, which will be used to refinance its existing debt.
P.B. Balaji, group chief financial officer of Tata Motors, said its total debt stands at around  ₹50,000 crore, of which  ₹20,000 crore is in its stand-alone business.
“The equity infusion from the promoters will help Tata Motors to largely reduce its absolute debt levels. The fundraise will help Tata Motors’ stand-alone business, where the balance sheet has debt issues. Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR’s) balance sheet, however, is strong, and is in no need of capital infusion currently,"" said Balaji.
Meanwhile, Tata Motors reported a consolidated net loss of  ₹217 crore in the September quarter on higher tax expenses and accumulated losses from joint ventures, primarily from the Cherry JLR Automotive Co. Ltd, its joint venture unit in China.
Tata Motors’ joint venture units reported accumulated loss of  ₹363 crore in Q2 as against a profit of  ₹86 crore in the year-ago period. On a year-on-year basis, the company managed to narrow down its quarterly loss, which stood at  ₹1,049 crore in Q2FY19 .
Tata Motors reported an operating revenue of  ₹65,432 crore in Q2 FY20, as against  ₹71,981 crore in the year-ago period. The 9% year-on-year (y-o-y) fall in revenue was on account of subdued performance across JLR and its domestic business.
At  ₹53,066 crore, JLR accounted for about 81% of Tata Motors’ operational revenue in Q2. The luxury carmaker had earlier reported retail sales of 128,953 units in Q2, down 0.7% y-o-y. The performance could have been worse, but for a recovery in China, its biggest market, where retail sales grew 24.3% y-o-y.
Balaji said that although the locally manufactured JLR models (under a JV with Chery) continued to report losses, the imported car business saw strong demand, thereby turning around the overall retail sales in China.
JLR’s retail sales were also slightly up (+0.9%) in Europe, which along with the China recovery covered up for lower sales in the US (-1.0%), UK (-5.1%) and in other overseas markets (-19.2%).
Balaji said JLR’s Project Charge, a cost-saving programme, achieved a saving of £2.2 billion out of a targeted £2.5 billion.
“We are looking at a Project Charge plus programme now, wherein we are looking to save costs further in subsequent quarters,"" he added.
JLR dealers’ profitability and inventory in China were also on track, he added.
Earlier this month, Tata Sons chairman N. Chandrasekaran had dismissed reports that Tata Motors was looking to sell JLR, although he had added that the company was open to the idea of a suitable partner to collaborate amid the ongoing demand slump and technological disruptions across the automotive industry.

Samvat 2076 started on a strong note today. Key stock market indices ended higher in the special one-hour Muhurat trading session on the occasion of Diwali. The Sensex gained 192 points to settle at 39,250 while the broader Nifty ended 0.40% higher at  ₹11,628. Tata Motors surged 18% after the automaker posted a smaller-than-expected loss in the second quarter as a pick up in sales of its luxury car in China helped it ride out weak vehicles sales in India, its home market.
Reliance Industries or RIL shares today hit a new high of  ₹1,445.

61,2019-10-28,Tata Motors,"Jaguar Land Rover’s 13.8% Ebitda margin came from a better sales mix and reduction in costsTata Motors’ stand-alone performance however is still ailing from the commercial vehicle slowdown

MUMBAI :
Tata Motors shares soared 18% to  ₹150 in Sunday’s Diwali ‘Muhurat’ trade. The jump in the stock was in response to the company’s strong September quarter (Q2FY20) performance, as a result of which, US-listed shares of the Indian carmaker had surged 13.2% on Friday.
What gives?
Two factors inspire confidence that prospects of the global auto company may be improving.
First, Tata Motors’  ₹583 crore profit before tax, at the consolidated level, as opposed to Bloomberg’s consensus estimate of a  ₹1,600 crore loss for the quarter and compared with a loss in the year-ago quarter took the market by surprise. Improved operating performance and the impact of a better product mix on sales at its UK-subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover Ltd (JLR), that has been a drag for last several quarters, also buoyed sentiment.
Second, the preferential share issue to promoter Tata Sons Ltd at  ₹150 a share was at a significant premium to the market price -  ₹126 on Friday – and will boost the stock in the near term.
More importantly, analysts appear convinced that JLR’s 13.8% earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) as a percentage to its sales was not a flash in the pan. Ebitda margin was not only 480 basis points (bps) higher year-on-year but was among the best in 16 quarters and a big leap from the June quarter margin that slipped to 4.2%.
The 480 basis points (bps) margin gain is the result of continuous improvement in retail sales in China. Trimming of work force, optimizing marketing costs, along with lower commodity cost aided profitability. Even the FY20 cost saving target of 2.5 million British pounds has almost been achieved.
According to Mitul Shah, vice-president-research, Reliance Securities Ltd, who is positive on JLR’s prospects explains, “JLR should be able to maintain double-digit margins with better volumes and falling commodity cost. The management expects raw material cost to go down further in 2HFY20, as negotiation with vendors is under process.""
As for the  ₹6,500 crore infusion by promoters, it would reduce leverage of the firm, hence improve the debt to equity ratio.
All this, however, is not to say that there are no concerns.
Developed markets of US, UK and Europe have shown a moderation in growth rates. In the analysts’ call, JLR indicated a UK-plant shutdown for about a week ahead of Brexit, which is a looming risk to business prospects of JLR and Tata Motors as a whole.
Further, the pain in its standalone business has continued. Sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles have remained under pressure given the demand slowdown, which analysts forecast will last another few quarters. The revenue drop in excess of 40% both in commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles dragged standalone Ebitda margin down to 3.8% from 11.4% a year ago.
But the good thing is that the company has cut its product stock worth  ₹3,500 crore, bringing down inventory to realistic levels. Therefore, Tata Motors’ consolidated Ebitda margin of 12.4% on the back of a bounceback in JLR’s performance looks sustainable, calling for a re-rating in valuation following sustainable earnings growth.
As a report by Antique Stock Broking Ltd’s puts it, “achieving the guided 3-4% earnings before interest and tax margin FY20/21 is within visible range now and  ₹6,500 crore fund infusion by promoters at 150/share through shares and convertibles provides needed funding cushion."""
60,2019-10-28,Tata Motors,"In the Passenger Vehicle segment, market leader Maruti Suzuki India took a production cut of about 21%Domestic automobile industry's sales continued their downward trend in September with a 22% year-on-year decline

Mumbai (Maharashtra): Automobile retail sales are likely to pick up with an improvement in consumer sentiment during the ongoing festive season due to recent liquidity easing measures announced by the government and on back of favourable monsoons, according to India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra).
Consequently, inventory build-up at the dealer level in anticipation of increased demand during this period is likely to lead to increased wholesale billing by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) during October, it said.
""However, with existing high dealer inventory levels, production cuts by OEMs are likely to continue in the near-term,"" said Ind-Ra in the credit news digest on India's auto sector.
The report highlights trends in sub-segments of auto sector including passenger vehicles (PVs), commercial vehicles (CVs) and two-wheelers (2Ws) with a focus on sales volumes growth, market share movement, change in commodity prices and recent rating actions.
Domestic automobile industry's sales continued their downward trend in September with a 22% year-on-year decline on weak consumer sentiments owing to the slowing economy. Inventory at dealer level remained high, leading to most OEMs continuing to implement production cuts.
Over April to September, overall auto industry undertook a production cut of 13% year-on-year with 16%, 27% and 13% production cuts in PV, CV and 2W segments respectively.
In the PV segment, market leader Maruti Suzuki India took a production cut of about 21%. The average inventory for PVs increased marginally in September to 30 to 35 days from 25 to 30 days in August.
The average inventory for CVs decreased marginally in September to 50 to 55 days from 55 to 60 days in August. But the average inventory for 2W remained high at 60 to 65 days.
PV sales volume declined 24% on account of a 33% drop in the sales volume of cars. Cars sales volume continue to decline on weak consumer sentiments amid a slowdown in urban and rural household consumption, a rise in the cost of ownership and the growing preference of shared mobility over buying a car.
CV sales volume declined 39% in September owing to decreased industry demand on account of tight liquidity conditions amid slowed economic activity. 2W sales fell 22 per cent on weak rural and semi-urban demand.
In the PV segment, Maruti's market share dropped by around 3% to 49% in September on lower sales volumes, while Hyundai Motor India gained 2% market share. Tata Motors Ltd's CV market share dropped by around 5 per cent to 41% while Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd gained 8% market share.
2W market leader Hero MotoCorp Ltd's market share increased by around 1% to 36% in September, said Ind-Ra in the news digest.

Bharti Infratel: Shares fell for the second consecutive session and traded down more than 5% as the company’s merger with Indus Tower has been delayed by two more months to 24 December due to lack of a key government approval.

Mumbai: India’s benchmark equity index Sensex opened marginally higher on Friday, staying above the crucial 40,000 mark for the third straight day. Investors await auto sales numbers and macro data due next week. The market will also eye global cues ahead of the release of US jobs data amid fresh concern over US-China trade deal.

Fifteen of the 26 Nifty companies that have reported earnings so far this season have surpassed analyst estimates, two have matched, while eight have missed projections, according to Bloomberg data.
""We believe in-line September quarter earnings so far and positive outlook by key auto and banking players have lifted the investor sentiment.

51,2019-11-01,Tata Motors,"Top automaker becomes first to report growth amid economic downturnMaruti's October sales were driven by compact cars, UVs and LCVs, with entry-level variants continuing to witness a decline

Mumbai: Domestic wholesales at India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, rose 4.5% in October from the year earlier, the company said on Friday as it became the first automobile manufacturer in the country to report growth amid an economic downturn.
Maruti Suzuki’s despatches to dealers stood at 144,277 units in October compared to 138,100 units in the same month last year. Its despatches of passenger vehicles rose 2.3% to 139,121, growing for the first time since March. In September, the car maker had reported a 27% fall in despatches.
This is the first instance in FY20 where the carmaker has reported positive year-on-year (y-o-y) growth, partly triggered by a surge in festive demand and partly on account of a low base from last year.
It was the only carmaker to report wholesale growth on Friday, driven by increased despatches of its compact cars, utility vehicles and its light commercial vehicles, even as its entry-level, or the most affordable category, continued to report a y-o-y decline. Maruti Suzuki sells WagonR, Celerio, Swift, Swift Dzire, Baleno and Ignis models in its compact portfolio. Its UVs comprise Vitara Brezza, S-Cross, Ertiga and the recently launched XL6.
Maruti Suzuki has also supplied 2,727 units of its compact hatchback Baleno to Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd, which sells a rebadged version as Glanza.
“The retail sales were far better than the wholesales and the company delivered close to 48,000 cars on Dhanteras alone. This was the highest single-day deliveries in the past 3-4 years,"" Shashank Srivastava, head, sales and marketing, Maruti Suzuki, said in an interview.
Srivastava added that festive retail sales this year saw double-digit growth over last year. “The newly launched S-Presso model has now accumulated more than 20,000 bookings, averaging about 750-800 units per day,"" he added.
While Maruti Suzuki plans to roll back its discounting initiatives November onwards, Srivastava said certain promotional schemes will continue in order to attract customers to retail showrooms.
Monthly wholesale figures reported by other carmakers on Friday were more muted than Maruti Suzuki’s.
The country’s second-largest carmaker, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, reported total domestic passenger vehicle wholesales of 50,010 units, down 4% y-o-y.
Gaurav Vangaal, country lead, light vehicle production forecasting, IHS Markit, said: “Retail sales are directly linked with the festive demand even as wholesales continue to post y-o-y decline on inventory correction measures by the carmakers. The retail uptick is a clear result of pent up demand for cars as buyers were delaying their purchases on several factors.""
Vangaal suggested that Maruti Suzuki’s early move to cut production and correct its inventory across dealerships resulted in it registering positive wholesales for October.
Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) reported passenger vehicle wholesales of 18,460 units, down 23% y-o-y. However, Veejay Ram Nakra, chief of sales and marketing, automotive division, M&M, said retail volumes exceeded wholesales by almost 40% last month. “Our billing numbers are in line with what we had planned for the month, since the objective was to significantly correct our channel inventory,"" he added.
Retail sales in October were highest ever for any month for M&M, said managing director Pawan Goenka. “I hope the retail momentum in October is an indicator of sentiment turning positive,"" he tweeted.
Stressing on the importance of reporting retail figures, Anand Mahindra, chairman, Mahindra Group, said: “The industry really needs to switch to reporting retail and not wholesale volumes. There are some strong signs of life in the market. And pipeline stocks have been slashed by controlling billings to dealers. Very appropriate stock levels now.""
At 13,169 units, Tata Motors’ passenger vehicle wholesales were down 28% y-o-y. In a statement, Mayank Pareek, president, passenger vehicles business unit, said that retail sales were 36% more than wholesales, and the company has reduced its network stock by 38%.
“In October 2019, retail registration of passenger vehicles is estimated to have increased by 11-16% over a low base, as 24 Sept-8 Oct 2018 was Shradh and had resulted in lower sales last year,"" said Hetal Gandhi, director, Crisil Research."

Benchmark indices were largely flat with Sensex at 40,196.64 points, and Nifty at 11,907.85 points.
Equity markets were higher for the seventh consecutive session boosted by continued buying interest from foreign investors.

Foreign investors have bought over $1.56 billion in the last three sessions in domestic equities. In the year so far, the Sensex has risen 11%, while foreign investors have bought nearly $10.22 billion in Indian equities.

Moody’s Investors Service on Tuesday allotted Ba3 rating to the proposed senior unsecured notes to be issued by Tata Motors Ltd (TML) with a negative outlook.
“The proposed notes rank pari passu with TML's existing senior unsecured notes and are therefore rated at the same level as these notes and TML's Ba3 corporate family rating (CFR),"" the credit ratings agency said in a statement.
Earlier on 25 October, while announcing its Q2FY20 results, TML had said it will make a preferential allotment of equity shares and convertible warrants to Tata Sons for a $914 million ( ₹6,500 crore) equity injection, of which $548 million will be paid immediately, and the balance over a period of 18 months. Fundraise from Tata Sons would result in the promoters’ shareholding in TML to increase to 46.4% from the current 38.4%.
TML’s board had also approved raising  ₹3,500 crore via external commercial borrowing for refinancing its existing debts.
The equity infusion from Tata Sons (the promoters) will help Tata Motors largely reduce its absolute debt levels. The fundraise will help Tata Motors’ standalone business where the balance sheet has debt issues, P.B. Balaji, group chief financial officer at TML had said.
The Ba3 ratings reflect TML's leading position in the domestic commercial vehicle segment, its 100% ownership of Jaguar Land Rover, Kaustubh Chaubal, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody’s said.
“The ownership by Tata Sons, which results in a one-notch uplift, reflecting our expectation of continued parental support, when needed,"" he said.
Chaubal views TML’s preferential allotment of equity to its promoters as a credit positive as the vehicle manufacturer plans to apply the proceeds towards reducing its debt.
""The equity injection also reflects Tata Sons' continued support, and will somewhat reduce the pressure on TML's balance sheet stemming from the weak operating performance of its India business, even as JLR delivers some improvement,"" he added.
Meanwhile, JLR’s Project Charge, a cost-saving programme, has already achieved a saving of GBP2.2 billion out of a targeted GBP2.5 billion. In addition, Moody’s said, JLR has also achieved GBP1.5 billion of its GBP1.7 billion target on capital expenditure and working capital improvements as of September 2019.
Looking ahead, Moody's expects JLR's adjusted debt/EBITDA to improve to 6.0x over the next 12 months from 10.6x in March 2019.
On the domestic front, TML continues to feel the heat on the back of economic slowdown, weak liquidity, low freight volumes and rural incomes. Moody’s had issued Baa2 negative rating to TML’s domestic CV and passenger vehicles (PV) business in India.
Tata Motors’ PV and CV sales volumes have declined 41% and 30% in H1 FY20 respectively."

Tata Motors Ltd (TML) on Wednesday inaugurated a new facility for advance power systems at its Engineering Research Center (ERC) in Pune. The new unit will play a key role in engineering, testing and development of powertrain solutions to prepare for several new technology requirements such as BS-VI emission norms, real driving emissions, CAFÉ II (corporate average fuel economy) norms, hybrid and electrification of vehicles, the company said.
The company said all the new powertrain development would be carried out at the unit at ERC, thereby bringing in synergies across commercial, passenger and electric vehicle business verticals.
“This facility will act as a hub to develop class-leading powertrain solutions for our vast product portfolio across ICE (internal combustion engines) and electric,"" Guenter Butschek, chief executive officer and managing director, TML said.

MUMBAI :
Tata Motors Ltd will raise $300 million through unsecured offshore debt financing, the company said in a filing to the stock exchanges late Wednesday.
The bonds will bear a coupon rate of 5.875% and will mature in 2025, the company said.
Earlier on Tuesday, global rating agency Moody’s Investors Service allotted a Ba3 rating to the proposed senior unsecured notes to be issued by Tata Motors, with a negative outlook.
Last month, the automaker had said the parent group through Tata Sons will infuse $914 million (  ₹6,500 crore) equity into the company, of which $548 million will be paid immediately, and the balance over a period of 18 months.
Moody's views Tata Motors preferential allotment of equity to its promoters as a credit positive as the vehicle manufacturer plans to apply the proceeds towards reducing its debt.
""The equity injection also reflects Tata Sons' continued support, and will somewhat reduce the pressure on TML's balance sheet stemming from the weak operating performance of its India business, even as JLR delivers some improvement,"" the agency said in a press statement.
Moody's also noted the cost savings at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) through Project Charge, a cost-saving programme, that has already achieved a saving of GBP2.2 billion out of a targeted GBP2.5 billion. In addition, Moody’s said, JLR has also achieved GBP1.5 billion of its GBP1.7 billion target on capital expenditure and working capital improvements as of September 2019.
Looking ahead, Moody's expects JLR's adjusted debt/EBITDA to improve to 6.0x over the next 12 months from 10.6x in March 2019.
On the domestic front, however, Tata Motors continues to feel the heat on the back of economic slowdown, weak liquidity, low freight volumes and rural incomes.
Tata Motors’ passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles sales volumes have declined 41% and 30% in H1 FY20 respectively."

38,2019-11-20,Tata Motors,"Moody's assigned a B1 instrument rating to JLR's new expected 500 million euro senior unsecured notes due for payment 2024 Moody's said the company's strong performance in the second quarter was supported by a rebound in retail volumes in China

Mumbai: Moody’s Investor Service on Wednesday assigned a B1 instrument rating to Tata Motors Ltd-owned Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc’s (JLR) new unsecured notes worth 500 million euros that are due for payment in 2024.
“The new notes rank pari passu with the existing unsecured financial indebtedness of the company, which continues to represent the vast majority of the company's debt capital structure. The notes are unsecured but benefit from guarantees of the principal operating subsidiaries,"" the ratings agency said in a statement today.
Earlier, JLR’s parent Tata Motors Ltd (TML) had reported loss of  ₹217 crore for the September 2019 quarter, narrowing down the same from  ₹1,049 crore year-on-year (YoY) on JLR’s recovery in China, which is British luxury carmaker’s largest market globally.
TML’s consolidated financial statements reported JLR’s Q2 revenues at  ₹53,066 crore as against  ₹51,951 crore for the year-ago period, thereby recording a 2% YoY growth. It’s EBIDTA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin stood at 13.8% (against 9% in Q2FY19), which the company said was amongst the highest in the last 16 quarters. JLR accounted for about 81% of Tata Motors’ operational revenues in Q2FY20.
JLR’s Q2FY20 retail sales stood at 128,953 units, down 0.7% YoY. Mint had last month reported that JLR’s performance could have been worse but for a recovery in China, where its retail sales grew 24.3% YoY. Meanwhile, its retails in Europe remained flat at 0.9%, followed by declining numbers in the USA (-1.0%), UK (-5.1%) and in other overseas markets (-19.2%).
“As a result, Moody's-adjusted debt / EBITDA has reduced for the first time in several quarters to 8.9x on a last twelve months basis, down from 10.6x as of fiscal year-end March 2019,"" the statement said.
While the rating agency views management’s efforts of turning around JLR’s business in China as a big positive, it continues to remain cautious on the carmaker’s performance in FY20 and FY21 on weak market conditions and continued R&D investments in new technologies such as electrification.
However, Moody’s positively views the sizeable reduction in negative free cash flow to –GBP64 million in Q2FY20 as against –GBP623 million in Q2FY19.
“JLR may also pursue additional funding options that may lead to further increases in debt,"" Moody’s said in a statement today.
On 25 October, TML had said that its board had approved raising  ₹3,500 crore via external commercial borrowing for refinancing its existing debts. This was in addition to the equity injection of  ₹6,500 crore from Tata Sons in return of the preferential allotment of equity shares and convertible warrants to its promoters.
In its filing to the stock exchange last week, TML said that it plans to raise $300 million through unsecured offshore debt financing where the bonds will bear a coupon rate of 5.875% and will mature in 2025. On 12 November, Moody’s had allotted Ba3 rating to the proposed senior unsecured notes to be issued by Tata Motors Ltd (TML) with a negative outlook."
36,2019-11-21,Tata Motors,"JLR chief Ralf Speth says the automaker feels the pressure"" from demands to slash carbon emissions and develop electric vehiclesSpeth also says JLR is ‘always open’ to discussions of technology alliances and component sharing with other companies

LOS ANGELES :
Luxury automaker Jaguar Land Rover's chief executive told Reuters he is open to more alliances to lower the costs of developing technology, but is not looking for a full-blown corporate merger.
""We feel the pressure"" from demands to slash carbon emissions and develop electric vehicles, Jaguar Land Rover chief Ralf Speth said in an interview on the sidelines of the Los Angeles auto show.
But to the question of whether the company and its parent, Tata Motors Ltd. are seeking a merger for Jaguar Land Rover, Speth said: ""The answer is no. We can really survive on our own.""
The British luxury sedan and SUV maker is ""always open"" to discussions of technology alliances and component sharing with other companies, Speth said.
Earlier this year, the maker of Jaguar sedans and Land Rover SUVs agreed with German luxury automaker BMW AG to develop electric car parts jointly.
Jaguar Land Rover currently sells an electric Jaguar I-Pace sport utility vehicle, and has said the next generation of its top-of-the line XJ sedan will be all-electric. The company has not said when it will launch the new XJ.
""There's no question in our mind that electric is the drive train of the future,"" Eberhardt said. ""But from a customer adoption point of view it takes longer than anticipated.""
Jaguar Land Rover has a product lineup, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles, which could meet tighter European CO2 emissions limits which begin taking effect next year, but compliance will depend on the mix of vehicles customers buy, Speth said.
""In Europe, the mix (of vehicles) is encouraging, but not at the moment at the level we can say we are compliant right at the beginning,"" he said. ""But there is time to go. We are cautiously optimistic.""
A lack of public electric vehicle re-charging infrastructure remains a challenge in selling electric vehicles in the U.S. and Europe, Eberhardt and Speth said.
Jaguar Land Rover was unprofitable through the first half of its fiscal year ended September 30, hit by Brexit-related production shutdowns and weaker demand in China. But Speth said the second half of the year should be better than the first.
Demand in the Chinese market is volatile, though Jaguar Land Rover sales have seen ""double-digit growth"" in recent months, Speth said. But that growth has been from a low volume. Speth said he receives data on the Chinese market daily.
Speth and JLR North America chief Joe Eberhardt were at the Los Angeles Auto Show for the North American launch of the Land Rover Defender, a modern reincarnation of sport utility vehicles identified with African safari adventures and British country estates."

31,2019-11-27,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors’ employee cost as a percentage of net sales in the Sep quarter rose to 10.7% from 5.9% a year earlierThe scheme will be offered to employees of different departments, across its businesses of passenger and commercial vehicles

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI :
Tata Motors Ltd is working on a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS), said four people aware of the matter, as India’s largest vehicle maker bears the brunt of a prolonged slowdown in the domestic market.
The scheme will be offered to employees of different departments, across its businesses of passenger and commercial vehicles, said one of the four people cited above, requesting anonymity.
“This year, Tata Motors’ employee cost-cutting plans are more aggressive than the previous times. Besides removing surplus staff at JLR in recent months, the company is now seeking voluntary retirements from more than 1,600 people across all locations and hierarchies,"" said the person.
Tata’s move would follow other vehicle makers such as Hero MotoCorp Ltd, Ashok Leyland Ltd and Toyota Kirloskar Motors Pvt. Ltd that have introduced similar schemes this fiscal. Tata’s woes have been compounded by stringent emission norms that are set to kick in from April as well as possessing one of the largest workforce in the industry.
The company’s employee cost as a percentage of net sales during the September quarter swelled to 10.7% from 5.9% in the year earlier. During the quarter, Tata Motors’ stand-alone net sales fell 44% from a year earlier, while it plunged to a net loss of  ₹1,281.97 crore from a year-earlier profit of  ₹109.14 crore.
In comparison, employee cost as a percentage of net sales at the country’s largest passenger vehicle manufacturer, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, stood at 4.9%, compared to 3.5% in the year-ago period.
Tata Motors has been trying to reduce its employee cost over the last few years and in 2017 had launched a similar offer, but most of the permanent employees stayed away from the severance package.
Responding to emailed queries, a spokesperson for Tata Motors said, “At the moment, there is no such plan.""
Fortunes of Tata Motors’ India operations have been dwindling over the last few quarters. In the September quarter, sales of heavy and medium commercial vehicles fell 59%, while overall sales for the company in the segment declined 41.2%. After the introduction of Bharat Stage VI (BS VI) norms, demand of heavy and medium commercial vehicles is likely to shrink further, posing more challenges in the next fiscal.
The second person cited earlier said permanent employees across departments will be considered for VRS, but the focus will be on reducing the number of employees on the engineering side of operations. Contracts of some senior employees, retained as consultants post retirement, may not get renewed, said the person.
“On the engineering side, the employee count is quite heavy compared to other automakers. Given the challenges ahead, the company will not be able to run efficiently with such a high employee cost,"" added the person.
An analyst at a brokerage firm said demand projection for the next few quarters is not buoyant with BS VI norms set for introduction, while there will be greater automation in the manufacturing process. Hence, this step by the company makes sense, added the analyst.
“Headcount rationalization across the board had led them to even look at the research and development (R&D) teams, including the engineering research centre in Pune, which is the hotbed of all R&D activities for the company,"" said the third person.
A host of new regulations for the automobile industry will be introduced in the country in the next few years till 2023 that will make vehicles across categories costly and is expected to have an adverse impact on demand. In October, India adopted new safety norms for vehicles and in April, the new emission norms will come into effect. From 2022, the second and stricter phase of corporate average fuel efficiency norms will be implemented and in 2023, real-time driving emission test will be introduced."

Tata Motors Ltd (TML) has posted a year-on-year decline of 25% on its total domestic wholesales for November, which stood at 38,057 units, the company said in a statement issued on Sunday.
TML’s November 2018 volumes stood at 50,470 units across passenger and commercial vehicles. Wholesale volumes represent vehicles dispatched from the factories to the respective dealerships across India and overseas.

MHCVs continue to worry Tata Motors with more than 45 days of current inventory despite huge discounts on offer for several months now. The demand for MHCVs sharply declined on the slowdown in the economic activities across the country along with the excess load carrying capacity created by the axle load norms introduced last year.
Meanwhile, the small commercial vehicles (SCVs) and pick up segment continues to remain strong and contain y-o-y volume loss for the company. TML reported dispatches of 15,787 units in the SCV and pick up segment, which was down 3% y-o-y.
However, Girish Wagh, President, Commercial Vehicles Business Unit, Tata Motors Ltd, said that the retail sales were higher than the wholesales by about 10%.
“As we move closer towards BS-VI transition, focus continues to be gradual stock reduction. MHCV sales grew by 23.6% over previous month, as enquiries continue to increase gradually, with fleet owners realizing the economic benefits of replacement of their older vehicles,"" he said.
“Overall system stocks being at a multi-quarter low, coupled with increasing enquiries for replacement demand, will help firm-up volumes and realizations in next few months.""
On the front of passenger cars, Tata Motors reported wholesales of 10,400 units, down 39% y-o-y from 16,982 units from the year-ago period. When compared to October, the company saw a drop of 21% month-on-month.
“After an encouraging festival period, in November, industry declined sharply,"" said Mayank Pareek, President, Passenger Vehicles Business Unit, TML.
However, Pareek said that the retail sales of passenger cars were 15% more than the wholesale volumes. “This has helped us to reduce the network stock by 35% in this fiscal,"" he added.
The senior company official said while TML is ready for the transition to BS-VI emission norms from next financial year, it is preparing for new model launches that include electric variant of Nexon compact sports utility vehicle (SUV), Altroz premium hatchback and Gravitas SUV.
“These, along with the demand for the limited number of remaining BS-IV diesel vehicles, coupled with an expected gradual improvement in consumer sentiment should help step change our growth trajectory in the coming months,"" Pareek added."

Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) on Tuesday launched its first Bharat Stage VI compliant passenger car, the XUV300.
The Mahindra XUV300 will come with an upgraded BS VI-compliant 1.2 liter turbo petrol engine, priced at a premium of  ₹20,000 over its BS IV-compliant base variant. The company said the BS VI-compliant car will have a starting price of  ₹8.30 lakhs (for base W4 variant) compared with  ₹8.10 lakh for the BS IV variant (base W4 model).
The new emission norm-compliant XUV300 can cost as much as  ₹11.99 lakhs for its top-end W8 dual tone variant, the company said in a statement today.
Meanwhile, XUV300’s diesel variants will continue to sell in its old avatar as the company plans to roll out BS VI-compliant diesel variants closer to the availability of the BSVI grade fuel across India. The stringent emission norms will be effective 1 April, 2020, for all vehicle categories ranging from two-wheelers to heavy commercial trucks.

Gaurav Vangaal, country lead, light vehicle forecasting, IHS Markit said, “It will be interesting to see how M&M would price the BSVI diesel variant of the XUV300 going ahead as several Indian vehicle manufacturers had earlier cited substantial pricing difference between the BSVI petrol and diesel variants of the same model.

JAISALMER :
Tata Motors on Wednesday said it will increase prices of its passenger vehicles from January, primarily in order to offset impact of upgrading its portfolio to conform to BSVI emission norms.
The company currently sells products ranging from hatchback Tiago to SUV Harrier, priced between  ₹4.39 lakh and  ₹16.85 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).
""With BSVI products coming in, prices will increase from January,"" Tata Motors President (Passenger Vehicles Business Unit) Mayank Pareek told PTI in an interview here.
He declined to quantify the increase in prices but said the hike next month would be on a higher side as compared to earlier price revisions taken by the company.
""We are working on the calculations...normally if any change happens the prices go up by  ₹10,000-15,000. Now there are two things happening, one is BSVI and there is also pressure from rise in commodity prices,"" Pareek said.
BSVI emission norms in India are slated to kick in from April 1, 2020.
On Tuesday, Maruti Suzuki India announced to increase prices of its models from January to offset rising input costs.
Other automakers like Toyota, Mahindra & Mahindra and Mercedes-Benz are also contemplating a similar move.
Hyundai Motor India and Honda Cars India, however, said they will not increase vehicle prices in January, but their products will see price hike when BSVI compliant models are introduced in the market.

22,2019-12-05,Tata Motors,"The actual price increase in the price of the vehicles on the ground is usually quite negligible, said a Maruti Suzuki dealerCompetitors like Hyundai Motor India, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and others are also likely to follow suit

India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki announced this week that it would increase prices of its vehicles in January, a practice that has almost become ritualistic for other car manufacturers as well. But analysts and industry watchers say that the annual exercise is a tactic aimed at enticing customers to buy before the year-end and clear piled up inventories before the start of the next year, when the value would typically suffer from a sharp depreciation.
The actual price increase in the price of the vehicles on the ground is usually quite negligible, a leading Maruti Suzuki dealer said.
“Next year prices will increase anyway if companies will launch vehicles complying with the BS 6 norm then there will be some increase. Otherwise, for Maruti the increase will not be substantial considering the market situation,"" added the dealer mentioned above.
Maruti has not disclosed from which date prices will increase for its offerings next year.
“Over the past year, the cost of company's vehicles has been impacted adversely due to increase in various input costs. Hence, it has become imperative for the company to pass on some impact of the above additional cost to customers through a price increase across various models in January 2020. This price increase shall vary for different models,"" Maruti said in a press statement.
Competitors like Hyundai Motor India, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and others are also likely to follow suit.
Over the years, this practice has led consumers to believe that December is the best month for buying vehicles because of wide-ranging discounts offered to customers, not to mention price increases touted for January.
According to Mitul Shah, analyst, Reliance Securities, December is usually a good month for retail sales and this year manufacturers will increase their offers to reduce inventory..
Amid slowing sales, this year automobile manufacturers almost went overboard in offering discounts to attract customers during the festive season that started from September-october. Maruti Suzuki offered almost  ₹1 lakh discount on their diesel vehicles like Vitara Brezza to get rid of the BS 4 vehicle inventory.
“In the early 2000s, companies used to take the same strategy before the budget and now it is in December. The price hikes in January are usually negligible unless someone is graduating to BS6 which is not a factor in Maruti’s case,"" added a former Maruti executive. “Hence, they didn’t mention the date of implementation and the quantum of discounts. It’s a ploy to attract as many customers as possible during the month,"" added a former executive of the company."
21,2019-12-05,Tata Motors,"Last month, Moody’s Investors Service allotted Ba3 rating to the proposed senior unsecured notes to be issued by Tata Motors with a negative outlookTata Motors has approved allotment of 20,16,23,407 ordinary shares at a price of  ₹150 each

The allotment committee authorized by the board of directors at Tata Motors Ltd (TML)’s has approved allotment of ordinary shares and warrants on preferential basis to Tata Sons Pvt Ltd in a meeting held on Thursday evening, the company said in a stock exchange filing.
Tata Motors has approved allotment of 20,16,23,407 ordinary shares at a price of  ₹150 each and 23,13,33,871 warrants at a price of  ₹150 per warrant on preferential basis to its promoters, Tata Sons, it said in the regulatory filing today. Each warrant will carry a right to subscribe to one ordinary share per warrant.
“Pursuant to allotment of the ordinary shares, the paid-up share capital of the company stands increased from  ₹67,91,702,130 to  ₹71,94,948,944,"" TML document stated.
Earlier at a meeting held on October 25, 2019, TML’s board had approved issue of ordinary shares and warrants aggregating  ₹6,500 crore to Tata Sons wherein the fundraise was done to bail the carmaker from its unsustainable net debt levels and also to continue funding the capital intensive projects.
“The equity infusion from the promoters will help Tata Motors to largely reduce its absolute debt levels. This fundraise will help Tata Motors’ stand-alone business, where the balance sheet has debt issues,"" P B Balaji, group chief financial officer had told Mint on October 25.
While Tata Sons’ shareholding in Tata Motors stood at 35.30% as on September 30 (pre-preferential allotment), it would rise to 39.52% post allotment of ordinary shares and 43.73% post exercise of warrants into the ordinary shares.
In order to continue re-financing its operations (including that of its subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc), the board had also approved raising of additional funds up to  ₹3,500 crore through external commercial borrowings (fixed rate senior unsecured notes), listed, unsecured, rated, non-convertible debentures or any other form of borrowing.
Last month, Moody’s Investors Service allotted Ba3 rating to the proposed senior unsecured notes to be issued by Tata Motors with a negative outlook. The credit rating agency views continued support from Tata Sons as a credit positive for the vehicle manufacturer’s stressed balance sheet.
The company had managed to narrow down its quarterly losses on a year-on-year basis for Q2FY20. It reported consolidated net loss of  ₹217 crore in Q2FY20 as against  ₹1,049 crore in Q2FY19. Although the domestic business continued to play a dampener thereby hurting its commercial and passenger vehicle verticals, TML attributed the correction to JLR’s improving global sales, primarily in China. This was despite the JLR’s local joint venture in China, Cherry Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Company Ltd continuing to accumulate losses month-on-month.
Meanwhile, Tata Motors domestic wholesales for April – November 2019 stood at 303,542 units, down 32% YoY."
20,2019-12-06,Tata Motors,"Tata Motors’ CV sales will continue to contract in the near term. This has a lower bearing on consolidated resultsWhile the management’s arduous efforts to steer JLR back on track is reassuring for investors, it may be prudent to stay cautious in the near term

Jaguar Land Rover Ltd’s (JLR’s) rising sales have rekindled investor interest in parent Tata Motors Ltd’s stock. The stock has zoomed 37% in the past three months after touching a 52-week low of  ₹106 on 4 September.
JLR’s outlook seems brighter now than a year ago. Between June and October, its wholesale monthly numbers increased on a low base of the year-ago period. Retail sales in China and North America, which account for about 45% of the firm’s total sales, have increased steadily over the last four months.
Another positive is that the firm’s mounting inventory in China is now at its lowest level since 2017. “JLR’s focus on improving dealer profitability and brand-led pull strategy in China has helped outperform its peers since July,"" said a Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd report. In the US, new launches have helped rev-up sales, up about 6% year-on-year in November.
Analysts reckon that the improving contribution of Land Rover on the back of new launches will give a leg-up to the company’s operating profitability.
That said, pain continues in a few markets. JLR’s UK and Europe sales are still declining. Brexit’s uncertainty continues to be an overhang. “JLR is the only luxury car manufacturer to have a facility in the UK. A hard Brexit will have a huge negative impact,"" said Bharat Gianani, analyst at Sharekhan Ltd.
Analysts said the outlook in Europe until 2020 is at best stagnant as consumers fret over a recession, while the industry battles tough emission and regulatory norms.
However, one cannot ignore JLR’s progress in cost, quality and time-to-market. The firm cut capital expenditures and contained working capital. This led to Q2 FY20 witnessing  ₹583 crore in profit before tax, which stumped investors as they were expecting a loss.
“Yet, lower JLR profitability over the years and continued requirement for higher capex (to invest in new products and new technologies, especially electric vehicles) will see negative free cash flows till FY21,"" added Gianani.
On home ground, Tata Motors’ commercial vehicle (CV) sales will continue to contract in the near term, although it has a lower bearing on consolidated results.
Therefore, while the management’s arduous efforts to steer JLR back on track is reassuring for investors, it may be prudent to stay cautious in the near term."

India’s auto sector has been reeling under the pressure of slow demand and fast approaching April 2020 deadline of migrating to BS VI-emission norm compliant vehicles.
Domestic automobile sales have been on a precipitous decline since the September quarter of 2018-19 due to an overall slowdown in consumption and liquidity crisis at financial institutions after the collapse of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd.
According to a PTI report, the auto component industry's turnover witnessed its worst ever decline in the first half of the current fiscal leading to a job loss of around 1 lakh temporary workers till July this year. The turnover of the industry dropped to  ₹1.79 lakh crore during April-September, down 10.1% from the year-ago period, Automotive Component Manufacturers Association (ACMA) said. The industry body said the slowdown has also resulted in an investment loss of up to $2 billion during the period."

NEW DELHI :
Auto major Tata Motors plans to add 100 sales outlets for passenger vehicles by the end of the current fiscal as it aims to enhance its reach in the country, a senior company official said.
The company, which has around 860 sales outlets spread across the country, has already added up around 100 outlets in the current financial year till now.
""We are expanding sales network. Basically, we are getting into new locations. Idea is that per dealer sales should go up. Dealers are excited with our product range and they are willing to expand their territories by opening new outlets,"" Tata Motors President (Passenger Vehicles Business Unit) Mayank Pareek told PTI.
There was a plan to add 200 new sales outlets this fiscal, he added.
""Of this 100 has already been added this fiscal, and in rest of the months we will add another 100 showrooms,"" Pareek said.

The company has also developed a lot of concepts, the idea being that in the next 4-5 years, it should be able to cover 90 per cent of the market, he added.
""Even with Altroz, the company would just be able to cover around 60 per cent of the market,"" Pareek said.

Lithium Urban Technologies Pvt. Ltd is set to acquire electric buses and sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) to expand its fleet and enter new segments, said the co-founder and chief executive of the electric vehicle fleet operator.
The company plans to add 20 electric buses from China’s BYD and 100 units of the ZS long-range electric SUV from MG Motor India, Sanjay Krishan said in an interview on 3 December. MG Motor India will be introducing the ZS in January, which, the company claims, can run up to 340km on a single charge.
“We are looking at an initial lot of 20 electric buses of 7 and 9m categories from BYD. We plan to roll out our e-bus services from mid-January 2020 starting from Pune, Bengaluru and Delhi, respectively,"" said Krishnan.
Bengaluru-based Lithium Urban is a B2B transportation service provider with a fleet of 1,000 EVs. Currently, EVs from Tata Motors Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd comprise the bulk of its fleet.
“The long-range electric SUVs would be deployed for inter-city corporate transportation services or for senior company officials across clients. We are considering routes such as Mumbai-Pune, Delhi-Jaipur, Delhi-Agra and others,"" he said.
The company, along with Tata Motors, recently announced the induction of 500 electric cars—400 units of electric Tigor and 100 units of electric Nexon compact SUV. The electric Nexon is yet to be launched.
“When we started, there was only one EV available in the market, the two-door Mahindra e2O. However, we now have electric four-door hatchbacks, sedans and SUVs. While initially EVs did 80km on a single charge, we deployed them for intra-city applications. Now that we can do 200-300km on a single charge, I can deploy such cars for inter-city applications,"" said Krishnan, elaborating on the plans to deploy electric SUVs from Tata and MG Motor India.
As part of its segment expansion strategy, Lithium Urban plans to enter the freight segment with sub-one ton EVs to be used for last-mile deliveries. It's also weighing an entry into the public transportation system through a public-private partnership model.
“For the battery-powered freight carrier, we are working only with Tata Motors currently. For electric buses, we are working with BYD as well as Tata. It’s a question of who has the best electric vehicle,"" said Krishnan.
On the EV charging infrastructure side, Lithium Urban has partnered with a company operating in the renewable energy domain and has incorporated a joint venture to set up EV charging hubs from early next year. It already has a network of over 1,200 charging points across seven cities for its existing fleets. Krishnan did not offer details on the partner and the joint venture.
“We will set up 8-10 charging hubs with the facility to charge e-buses and electric cars. It would be able to charge 25 electric cars and 5 e-buses concurrently,"" he said. “The electrical load per such hub would be at least one megawatt and all of that would be powered through solar energy."" It plans to launch its first EV charging hub in Gurugram next month.
To fund its expansion plans, Lithium, which runs on 100% vehicle ownership model, is looking at a Series B funding round of up to $50 million."

MUMBAI :
The stocks of Tata Motors Ltd and Motherson Sumi Systems Ltd have been most impacted by the noise around the UK’s Brexit deal. Therefore, the rally in both these stocks on the back of Boris Johnson’s landslide victory is not surprising, as it brings certainty to sealing the Brexit deal.
However, it would be prudent for investors not to put the cart before the horse. CNN International said: “After the Brexit deal is passed and ratified in January, the UK moves into an even more expansive and complicated negotiation period, setting out just how closely aligned it will stay to the EU on issues like the environment, competition, workers’ rights and trade.""
The actual impact will be known after the December 2020 deadline, when the UK formally exits the European Union.
In any case, industry experts and analysts are hopeful that the new government will strive to protect the auto industry, which comprises a significant part of UK’s manufacturing output.
Tata Motors, which owns Jaguar Land Rover Ltd (JLR), is the only Indian auto firm with a manufacturing facility for luxury cars in the UK. Motherson Sumi has several facilities in Europe, which could be affected by Brexit indirectly as it supplies components to global auto original equipment manufacturers.
But near-term impacts could arise from currency fluctuations. The stronger pound versus the rupee may give a leg up to reported earnings per share. However, JLR’s revenue from exports to the US will be negatively impacted with a stronger pound.
Meanwhile, Tata Motors and Motherson Sumi shares outperformed the benchmark Nifty Auto index in the last couple of weeks. Tata Motors’ stock has rallied 62% from its 52-week low on 4 September. News of lower inventory in China and better sales in North America fired the stock. A Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd report highlighted that a turnaround was in sight for the company. “JLR has endured a turbulent operating environment over the last two years, led by a troika of adverse macro, product mix and market mix. Some of these challenges, particularly on product/market mix, are likely to ease"" it said.
Better auto sales in North American markets will help Motherson, considering that it will improve demand for its components.
The turmoil in the global auto market due to widespread political and macroeconomic uncertainty took a toll on earnings of both firms. Consolidated operating margins fell from double to single digits over several quarters. While JLR is likely to post negative free cash flow till FY21, Motherson’s positives of turnaround in its subsidiaries may be a mask for its debt overhang.
True, a Brexit deal done is to be cheered. But it is unlikely to merit a revision in earnings or valuations of these firms, at least for the near term."
12,2019-12-15,Tata Motors,"The company is now in the midst of new product launches over the next few months and there is also the transition to BS-VI normsThe automobile major currently employs about 83,000 persons

New Delhi: Tata Motors is not looking to reduce workforce due to the ongoing slowdown in the domestic market, as it expects things to get better amid a wave of new products lined up for the launch over the next few months, a top company official has said.
According to its website, the automobile major currently employs about 83,000 persons with presence across commercial and passenger vehicles.
""We do not have such kind of plan,"" Tata Motors Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Guenter Butschek said when asked if the company was looking at rationalising its workforce owing to a prolonged downturn in the domestic automobile industry.
He added that if the company would have liked to take such a step then it would have taken it already.
""We are now for 12 months in crisis. If I would have liked to pull the trigger, I would have done it earlier,"" Butschek said.
The company is now in the midst of new product launches that include Altroz, Nexon EV and Gravitas SUV over the next few months and there is also the transition to BS-VI norms, he added.
""I am convinced that whatever the economy is going to do, we are well-positioned in order to outperform the market...since the entire product range is set on a different cost base, our baseline profitability is significantly better then any given point of time before. So, I am pretty positive at this time,"" Butschek said.
He added that the company is taking all necessary steps in the commercial vehicle (CV) space, which continues to be its backbone in terms of revenues, to beat the current situation.
Butschek added that the company continues to do well in the CV space and that gives the company a great level of confidence.
""We have right kind of products, our dealer network is firing and at the moment we think that we can actually surf the wave,"" he noted.
The company has all kinds of mechanisms in place including cost optimisation and quality control measures, to get to the next level, Butschek said.
""There is no need at this point in time (for workforce rationalisation) because I need the capacity anyway back on the floor the time market is going to increase,"" he added.
He, however, admitted that he has never seen such a kind of volatility in the market in his over 30 years of career so far.
""We need to carefully watch, need to stay flexible and agile and gain a better understanding...whatever we currently see is much more structural in nature then just cyclical...this combination makes the future unpredictable,"" Butschek said.
During the July-September quarter, Tata Motors' standalone net sales witnessed a drop of 44% from a year earlier, while it plunged to a net loss of  ₹1,281.97 crore from a year-earlier profit of  ₹109.14 crore.
Elaborating on the passenger vehicle business, he said the company is bullish on the future prospects as it gears up to drive first vehicle based on its all-new Alfa platform next month.
The company is set to make a foray into the premium compact hatchback segment with Altroz in January.
The auto major aims to curtail development cost for new models as the new architecture could be underpinned in all kinds of body styles, including MPS, sedans and sports utility vehicles (SUVs).
With Alfa platform coming and Omega architecture already in play (Harrier), the company expects to build in economies of scale and achieve commonality in products, thus reducing overheads in research and development in the coming years.
""It is the beginning of a larger journey for us with much greater play as 12 top heads could be developed on these two architectures,"" Butschek said.
The company earlier used to have a total of six platforms earlier with no common elements in between, he added.
""It means we are now set to get into a powerplay of new product launches in the years to come. We are going to spread our wings over new segments in a shorter period of time in order to spread market cover which is not even 60 per cent of the total market,"" Butschek said.
The company is getting into a differentiated play addressing various segments, sub-segments and at the same time getting into 90 per cent of the market in a couple of years, he added.
""This combination (Alfa, Omega) is a unique recipe, we have commonality, we build scale while at the same time also actually get a larger addressable market. What is the result? A profitable growth and in the end, it is going to cash accreditive business,"" Butschek said.

The growth in CV industry is related to the country's economy, he added.
""The government has launched various initiatives...all these factors are going to give us a positive outlook in the second half of the next fiscal,"" he said.
While the transition to BS-VI in passenger vehicles (PV) is on track, the company is going to be slow in introducing upgraded CVs in the market due to low demand, he added.
""For PVs the transition is going to happen in the next few weeks, in CV segment situation is slightly different not because we are running late but due to a different market situation,"" Butschek said.
In CV segment, the company is ""not actively"" going to switch to BS-VI before April 1, 2020, he added.
""Our read of the market is there will not be too much of a demand ..our BS-VI play starts on April 1, prior to that it is BS-IV products,""Butschek noted.
As per SIAM data, CV sales declined by 14.98% to 61,907 units in November as compared with the year-ago period.
During April-November, CV sales have declined by 22.12% to 5,04,080 units as against 6,47,278 units in same period of 2018-19.
In domestic market, the company reported a 29% fall in CV sales to 2,17,130 units in the current financial year as compared with 3,05,395 units in April-November period of 2018-19.
Butschek said the company has embarked upon a ""mission zero"" to see that no BS-IV vehicle is left after April 1, 2020.
""By the end of this fiscal, Tata Motors is not going to have a BS IV vehicle left, neither any material which was initially ordered to manufacture BS-IV vehicles..weekly meeting now has become a daily affair,"" Butschek said.

10,2019-12-17,Tata Motors,"To reduce debt, the firm is exploring direct investment, joint venture for passenger vehicles businessThe carmaker is already looking for tie-ups for JLR and has forged one with BMW for electric powertrains

New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd, India’s largest vehicle maker, is in initial talks with a couple of Chinese automobile companies for a tie-up for its passenger vehicles business, three people aware of the development said.
These companies may either invest directly in Tata Motors or form a joint venture, the people said, requesting anonymity. Mint could not independently verify the names of the two companies. The collaboration could include joint development of technologies related to electric mobility, sharing of manufacturing capacities, development of engines and platforms and other aspects of the business, they said.
“The Chinese have invested in German, Swedish and French automakers and wisely. I’m sure they will see value in Tata Motors,"" said Avik Chattopadhyay, founder of Expereal, a brand consulting firm. “It also gives a strategic investor the opportunity to provide ground-up electric mobility technology at the entry level.""
The move could help Tata Motors significantly reduce its debt for its India business that stood at  ₹23,365.49 crore as of 30 September, according to Bloomberg. Its consolidated debt, including that of its UK unit Jaguar Land Rover, stood at  ₹95,465.08 crore.
Vehicle makers are increasingly seeking partnerships to invest in futuristic technologies to cope with stringent emission, fuel efficiency and safety standards. India recently adopted new safety norms for vehicles and new emission norms will come into effect from April. In a couple of years, vehicles will also have to meet a second and stricter phase of corporate average fuel efficiency (CAFE) norms and in another three years, real-time driving emission test will be introduced.
A spokeswoman for Tata Motors said the company does “not comment on market rumours"".
According to one of the three people cited earlier, Tata Motors has been actively looking for collaborations as the company, like other manufacturers, is looking to slash costs to sustain profitability.
“It’s prudent to look for partnerships in the passenger vehicle business, where losses are likely to increase due to stringent regulations, which are likely to dampen demand,"" the person said. “Competition will also intensify due to new entrants like Kia Motors and MG Motor in the future.""
Earlier this year, Mahindra and Mahindra, the country’s third-largest vehicle maker, formed a joint venture with the Indian unit of US carmaker Ford Motor Co. to develop and manufacture combustion engine and electric vehicles.
In 2017, Japanese manufacturers Toyota Motor Corp. and Suzuki Motor Corp. said they would jointly develop electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries and combustion engine vehicles for the Indian market. They also bought minority stakes in each other this year to consolidate the partnership.
Tata Motors appears a lucrative target for Chinese companies looking to establish a base in India as the company has excess capacity, which could be easily utilized to ramp up operations.
With China’s economy showing sluggishness despite the recent easing of trade tensions with the US, Chinese vehicle makers are keen to enter the Indian market.
In August 2017, Tata Motors ended talks with Germany’s Volkswagen AG for a collaboration in the passenger vehicle space in India.
MG Motor India, owned by China’s biggest vehicle manufacturer, SAIC Motor Corp., has already launched its first product, Hector, in 2019. Great Wall Motors Co. Ltd, China’s largest utility vehicle manufacturer, is scouting for land and is in talks with General Motors to buy its manufacturing plant in Maharashtra. Changan Automobile Co. Ltd is also scouting for land in the country to start operations.
Another reason for Tata Motors’ move could be that it may find it tough to maintain an edge in both the commercial and passenger vehicles. “Given the investment required in upgrading to BS-VI norms, second phase of CAFE norms and investment in electric vehicles, the pressure on the balance sheet would be significant,"" the second person cited earlier said. “The company will have to pile on more debt, which is not sustainable in the future.""
In passenger vehicles, the company’s market share in the eight months to 30 November shrank to 4.59% from 6.19% a year ago, following a 39% drop in sales to 86,412 units.
The Mumbai-based vehicle maker is already looking for partnerships for Jaguar Land Rover and has forged one with German competitor BMW for developing next generation electric powertrains."
8,2019-12-19,Tata Motors,"NCLAT also ordered that Cyrus Mistry be restored as executive chairman of Tata SonsIn a surprise move on 24 October 2016, Mistry was removed as chairman of Tata Sons

Shares of Tata group companies traded mixed on Thursday following an appeals court holding illegal the appointment of N Chandrasekaran as chairman Tata Sons. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Wednesday also ordered that Cyrus Mistry be restored as executive chairman of Tata Sons in lieu of Chandrasekaran although the implementation of this has been suspended for four weeks.
The company has the option to challenge the ruling in the Supreme Court.
While shares of Tata Motors and Tata Consultancy Services rose 1% each today, Tata Metaliks was up 0.7%, Nelco Ltd advanced 0.4%, Voltas, Tata Chemicals and Tata Investment Corp were 0.08-0.2% higher. On the other hand, Tata Steel Ltd fell 0.9%, Rallies India 0.6%, Titan Co Ltd was down 0.5%, Tata Power Co 0.5%, Tata Global Beverages ltd 0.3%, Trent Ltd 0.2%, Tata Elxsi 0.3%, Tata Coffee Ltd 0.3%.
According to a Mint report, with the appellate tribunal ruling in favour of ousted Mistry, the odds have changed dramatically for the diversified conglomerate. This is likely to show in weakened investor confidence and potentially higher cost of capital until there is clarity on the final outcome of the ongoing legal tussle.
The order casts uncertainty over Chandrasekaran’s plans to simplify the group’s structure, revive growth, cut costs and invest in future growth areas.
In a surprise move on 24 October 2016, Mistry was removed as chairman of Tata Sons and later also ousted as a director from the holding company's board."

MUMBAI :
Auto major Tata Motors on Thursday unveiled its first electric SUV Nexon EV that will be commercially launched within weeks.
The SUV, built on its most popular SUV Nexon, is the first electric vehicle (EV) powered by Ziptron technology and offers ""a range not less than 300 km per charge"" and can accelerate to 100 kmph in just 9.9 seconds.
Bookings for the car will start from Friday, the company said, without revealing the price or delivery date.
On pricing, the company said it will be around 20% more than the AMT version of Nexon and thus will come between  ₹15-17 lakh and will be 'launched within weeks'.
The SUV comes with as many as 35 connected features, including tow away and intrusion alerts.
The new EV comes in three variants and offers an eight-year warranty or 1,60,000 km on the battery and the motor, which is the highest in the industry.
The Nexon is the first EV coming on the Ziptron technology. This is a high performance, connected vehicle that is suited to address the aspirations of customers and break all barriers for EV adoption, Tata Motors CEO and MD Guenter Butschek said while unveiling the EV.
Shailesh Chandra, president of electric mobility unit at Tata Motors, said the battery can be charged 80% in under 60 minutes under the fast charging mode.
The battery pack will offer a range which will be higher than 300 km on a fully-charged battery and can be charged even on a 15 ampere plug point, he added."
6,2019-12-19,Tata Motors,"The bookings for Nexon EV will open from December 20 and the commercial launch is scheduled for January 2020The Nexon EV is the first car from the stable of Tata Motors that is powered by its in-house developed modular electric powertrain platform called Ziptron

Tata Motors Limited (TML) unveiled electric variant of its popular Nexon compact sports utility vehicle (SUV) in Mumbai earlier today.
The bookings for Nexon EV, which targets the personal segment, will open from December 20 and the commercial launch is scheduled for January 2020, the company said today.
The Nexon EV is the first car from the stable of Tata Motors that is powered by its in-house developed modular electric powertrain platform called Ziptron. The said powertrain that includes lithium ion battery and electric motor, is said to deliver more than 300 kms of running range in a single charge, thus addressing the customers’ range anxiety of driving electric vehicles (EVs).
Although the retail price will be announced next month, the company has given an indicative range of  ₹15 – 17 lakh for the electric car, making it to be the most affordable long-range passenger car available in the market today. Other recently introduced long-range EVs include MG Motor’s ZS (340 km on single charge) and Hyundai Motor India’s Kona Electric, which claims a range of 452 km on a single charge. While MG’s electric SUV is expected to be priced in excess of  ₹20 lakh, the Hyundai Kona comes with a price tag of over  ₹23 lakh.
Once launched next month, the Tata Nexon EV will be available in three variants and will also offer a warranty of 8 years or 160,000 km (whichever is earlier) on battery and electric motor. Notably, even Hyundai offers a similar warranty on its Kona Electric SUV.
“We are not going pan-India with the retails of Nexon EV. We have identified 22 micro markets and cities with 48 outlets supporting it. These markets will be our focus to begin with,"" Shailesh Chandra, president – electric mobility and corporate strategy, Tata Motors Ltd told Mint underlining that the chosen dealerships will have a store-in-store concept to promote EVs for personal segment.
The company will also be experimenting with some new retail formats with its Nexon EV such as its consumer electronics store Croma, where it plans to install 6 X 8 digital showroom for the electric car.
“All the technology geeks visiting consumer electronics stores such as Croma and others are also natural buyers of electric vehicles. So we have selected about 2-3 Croma stores in the initial phase in select cities so that we implement this idea and later expand it,"" said Chandra.
Tata Motors is also open to coming up with new standalone outlets for EVs in the future once it has a broad portfolio of electric cars for personal segment and as the demand picks up."
5,2019-12-19,Tata Motors,"Any decision by majority investors will now have to be taken in the interest of all stakeholders, say analysts

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI :
An appeals court order reinstating Cyrus Mistry as Tata Sons Ltd chairman may have caused uncertainty about the management of the holding company of Tata group, but market experts say the net impact is likely to be positive for group companies.
Shares of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd and Tata Global Beverages Ltd—the key units of Tata Sons—gained on Thursday on BSE. TCS rose 2.83% to close at  ₹2,229.05, Tata Steel gained 0.45% to close at  ₹446.75, Tata Motors advanced 2.49% to  ₹179.15, Tata Global gained 0.51% to ₹313.95 while Indian Hotels lost 2.20% to  ₹142 per share.
The market sees the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s (NCLAT) order as positive for Tata firms as it amounts to saying that Tata Sons will be a deemed public company. This means there will be greater accountability ensuring that any decision by the majority shareholders will have to be taken in the interest of all stakeholders, including minority shareholders such as the Shapoorji Pallonji group, said lawyers and analysts.
“Once a company is public, all shareholders get more freedom in terms of exercising their rights by virtue of their stakes in the firm. There are better disclosures to all classes of shareholders and the company’s promoters are unlikely to take decisions detrimental to minority shareholders in a public company,"" said a fund manager at a large asset management firm, who declined to be named.
With Tata Sons being the holding company, the order is bound to have a ripple effect on governance of all group companies. The order on Mistry’s chairmanship will however take effect only in four weeks, which is the time granted if the Tata group wants to appeal the decision.
An executive in a Tata group company, who did not want to be named, said Tata Sons is likely to soon move the Supreme Court to get a stay on the judgement to make sure the order does not take effect.
The NCLAT also ruled Mistry can take over as director on three Tata group firms forthwith. These are TCS, Tata Industries and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd.
However, Siddharth Mahajan, partner at Athena Legal, said as directors owe a “fiduciary duty"" towards the company and shareholders, they cannot do anything against their interests and “hence any significant disruption in day-to-day functions is unlikely.""
Also, as per Securities and Exchange Board of India’s listing norms, any change in the board of any listed firm due to any event can be effected only after informing the stock exchanges. So far, no Tata company has informed the exchanges about reinstating Mistry on their boards.
Mahajan, however, said the order “no doubt creates uncertainty for Tata group as many key decisions would have to be kept on hold unless there is clarity on position of chairman""."

Mumbai: Picking up momentum on its electric vehicle fleet business, Tata Motors Ltd (TML) has bagged an order to supply 500 units of its electric Tigor sedans from a Delhi-based mobility service provider called Prakriti E-Mobility Pvt Ltd, the company said in a statement today.
This is the second instance where the company has announced the sizable order for its electric cars, all meant to be deployed for commercial applications. Last month, TML had announced that it bagged order to supply 500 electric cars including 400 units of its Tigor EV and 100 units of electric Nexon to Bangalore-based commercial EV fleet provider Lithium Urban Technologies.
The vehicle manufacturer will supply 160 electric Tigor cars in the first batch early January where the electric vehicle specific taxi service provider would deploy the fleet on its app-based platform called ‘EVERA’ in Delhi NCR. Incorporated in December 2019, Prakriti is co-founded by Nimish Trivedi, Vikas Bansal and Rajeev Tiwari.

“The induction of Tigor EVs will not only help the company achieve their business goals but also accomplish their objective of offering eco-friendly mobility solutions,"" said Shailesh Chandra, president – electric mobility business and corporate strategy, Tata Motors Ltd.
All Tigor EVs in both these orders would comprise the extended range electric sedan that was launched in October 2019.

1,2019-12-29,Tata Motors,"The proposed policy is seen as a bid by the govt to prop up demand for automobilesThe proposed policy will seek to take polluting commercial vehicles off the roads

New Delhi/Mumbai: India’s vehicle scrappage policy, which is awaiting its final clearance from the Union cabinet, would focus on eliminating the fleet of old polluting commercial vehicles plying on the country’s roads, said a senior government official.
“The policy has been finalized and we are waiting for the cabinet’s approval, which is expected soon,"" said a second government official. Both the officials declined to be named.
The second official said the proposed policy would seek to revive the ailing commercial vehicle industry — a key barometer of economic activity and freight movement. “The idea is to take old, polluting ones off the roads as they are major contributors towards pollution.""
The policy would entail a manifold increase in the renewal of registration fees of vehicles older than 15 years to discourage the use of older polluting vehicles, including passenger vehicles, the official said.
The proposed policy is seen as an attempt by the government to boost automobile demand, which has been hit by weak consumer demand amid a slowdown in the broader economy. This economic slowdown has forced several companies to temporarily shut factories, lay off contract workers and offer hefty discounts to clear inventory.
In August, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed several steps to revive the automobile sector, including the scrappage policy, aimed at increasing production levels and capacity utilization at factories.
The medium and heavy commercial vehicle segment is the worst-hit following the creation of extra load-carrying capacity of trucks last year with the introduction of axle load norms. This was followed by a general slowdown in key sectors such as real estate, infrastructure, mining and others. According to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), wholesales or factory dispatches of medium and heavy-duty trucks fell over 41% year-on-year during April-November. During the same period, the commercial vehicle industry posted a 22% decline in sales.
Meanwhile, truck makers have resorted to offering heavy discounts to clear their inventory of Bharat Stage IV (BS IV)-compliant vehicles. Mint had earlier reported that the two largest commercial vehicle makers, Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland, have been offering heavy discounts of up to  ₹8 lakh on 40-49 tonne trucks even as smaller companies toil for customers.
“While the automotive industry is still waiting for the vehicle scrappage policy, the draft guidelines on AVSF (authorized vehicle scrappage facility) by MoRTH (ministry of road transport and highways) are a welcome move to reduce in-use emissions and drive fleet modernization in India,"" said a spokesperson for Tata Motors. “The guidelines outline clear direction for setting up authorized vehicle scrappage facilities, which will ensure environment-friendly recycling and disposal of vehicles and hazardous materials.""
The spokesperson said while guidelines for setting up of scrapping facilities will encourage replacement of older vehicles, they may also have to define tangible incentives for customers and regulatory norms for enforcing the disposal of older vehicles.
“In light of this, we will have to assess the impact of released guidelines in the current form on new vehicle demand. To achieve the end objective, there is a need to address the criteria to define end-of-life vehicles, incentives for customers and dismantlers, and a mechanism to ensure adherence,"" added the Tata Motors spokesperson.
The success of the policy would, however, hinge on the incentives it would carry for buyers and manufacturers, a senior executive at a commercial vehicle maker said on condition of anonymity. The executive outlined the incentives as road tax exemption, reduction in the goods and services tax paid on new vehicle purchases, incentives on tradable scrap certificates and low interest rates/easy financing schemes on commercial vehicle purchases. Companies “cannot offer incentives beyond the discounts that are already at an all-time high"", said the executive.
The second government official said that after lengthy discussions the Centre said it would not offer any incentives in the new policy, but that states would forgo road tax to vehicle buyers against presentation of scrap certificates. “Incentives, if any, will have to be offered by the OEMs (original equipment manufacturers),"" the official said. “The only form of incentive will be exemption from road tax (a state subject). Besides, there could be some discounts on purchase on a new vehicle upon showing the scrapping certificate.""
Stressing the reasons why the government should offer incentives to promote scrapping, Siam deputy director general Sugato Sen said, “Scrappage of old vehicles is expected to generate demand for new ones, thereby leading to additional sales for the auto industry as well as additional revenue for the government.""
Siam has recommended that dealers acquire old vehicles from owners and send them to designated scrapyards, which would buy these and issue tradable scrap certificates. The auto industry lobby has suggested a 15% cut in vehicle scrapping value for dealers in the value chain to not only retain their business interest, but also capitalize on their vast network."
