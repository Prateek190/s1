440,2018-01-01,Infosys,"As Infosys CEO Salil Parekh will work with company's non-executive chairman and co-founder Nandan Nilekani

New Delhi: Salil Parekh is all set to take charge as Infosys chief executive officer (CEO) on Tuesday as the over $10 billion company looks to bring back the focus on revenue growth and business strategy under the new leadership. 
New Delhi: Salil Parekh is all set to take charge as Infosys chief executive officer (CEO) on Tuesday as the over $10 billion company looks to bring back the focus on revenue growth and business strategy under the new leadership.
Infosys, which spent most part of 2017 handling the public standoff between its high-profile promoters and the past leadership, will also announce its third quarter financials on 12 January. Industry watchers say Parekh’s skills in handling multi-cultural work environment, combined with his strong grip on technology and sales, makes him the perfect choice for leading Infosys during this period of transition.
Parekh, 53, is described as a soft-spoken yet determined man by those who know him. He was chosen from over two dozen candidates in a search that lasted about three months and covered a wide canvas of names within Infosys as well as alumni and external aspirants. 
The former Capgemini executive’s experience in building the IT firm’s operations in India and its acquisition of iGate (in 2015) will also be an added advantage for him, they added. This is the second time—after Vishal Sikka—that the company has roped in an external candidate for the CEO role in its over three decade history. 
Sikka left Infosys abruptly in August last year, after a prolonged standoff with promoters including the iconic N.R. Narayana Murthy over allegations of corporate governance lapses and hefty severance packages of former executives. 
Parekh will work with non-executive chairman and co- founder Nandan Nilekani, who was brought in to steady the ship after the resignation of Sikka and other board members, including the then chairman R. Seshasayee. 
Interestingly, Parekh’s appointment has received a thumbs up from Murthy, who was vocal in his criticism of Sikka and the previous Infosys management. Besides bringing stability, Parekh will also have to focus on hiring people who are strong in digital technologies and global sales as the IT industry, as also Infosys, is in midst of transformation. 
The road-map that Parekh sets on would be keenly watched, not just by investors but the industry as a whole as Infosys reboots to bring back its lost glory."
439,2018-01-02,Infosys,"Salil Parekh's role will be challenging considering that Infosys is trying to put behind the almost year-long public standoff between Infosys' high-profile promoters and the past leadership

New Delhi/Bengaluru: Salil Parekh took charge as managing director and chief executive of IT major Infosys on Tuesday and said he is excited to lead the company at a time when technology is changing at a fast and disruptive pace.  
New Delhi/Bengaluru: Salil Parekh took charge as managing director and chief executive of IT major Infosys on Tuesday and said he is excited to lead the company at a time when technology is changing at a fast and disruptive pace. 
On his first day at the corner-office, Parekh met some employees and toured the sprawling Infosys campus. He was even seen posing for a selfie with a few of them. In a video address to employees, Parekh is said to have emphasised that each worker has a role to play in this “world of continuous technology disruption"" and that they will have to be ready for the future, geared with necessary skills. 
Parekh stated that he had met a few Infoscions and hoped that they can work together to accelerate the company’s transformation. Infosys, on its Twitter account, shared some pictures of the first day at work for Parekh. In one of the pictures, he is seen posing against a backdrop with the familiar blue Infosys logo and a message that read “Welcome to Infosys, Salil"". 
In another photograph, the former Capgemini executive is seen interacting with some employees. A group of six also managed to get a selfie with the new CEO. For Parekh, who has come on board for a tenure of five years, top priorities would include bringing back focus on revenue growth and business strategy. 
His role will also be challenging considering that Infosys is trying to put behind the almost year-long public standoff between Infosys’ high-profile promoters and the past leadership. Some of the big tasks for Parekh will include driving growth amid increasing scrutiny in key markets like the US, retaining talent and skilling manpower on new-age technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
Investors and market watchers will keenly wait for Parekh to spell out his strategy to spur growth for Infosys, which is slated to announce its third quarter financials on 12 January."
438,2018-01-03,Infosys,"Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani should complete the board restructuring quickly, including replacing Ravi Venkatesan and Roopa Kudva, thereby providing a clean slate for CEO Salil Parekh, says former CFO V. Balakrishnan

Hyderabad: As Salil Parekh took charge as CEO at Infosys, a former top company official has sought restructuring of the Board by replacing ex-co-chairman Ravi Venkatesan and ex-Audit Committee Chairperson Roopa Kudva. 
Hyderabad: As Salil Parekh took charge as CEO at Infosys, a former top company official has sought restructuring of the Board by replacing ex-co-chairman Ravi Venkatesan and ex-Audit Committee Chairperson Roopa Kudva.
“Nandan (Nilekani, the company’s Chairman) should also complete the board restructuring quickly including replacing the earlier co-chairman and audit committee chairman thereby providing a clean slate board for him (Parekh) to peform to his full capability without any distractions,"" former CFO, V Balakrishnan said. 
Last month also, he had sought the discontinuance of Venkatesan and Kudva after Infosys filed a settlement plea with the SEBI on alleged corporate governance lapses relating to severance payment to its former CFO Rajiv Bansal. 
“...It is all the more important to restructure the board and fill it with people of high integrity and stature,"" Balakrishnan had said. On opportunities and challenges for Parekh, Balakrishnan said on Wednesday he had a great opportunity to transform Infosys as he comes with a great pedigree and right background. 
“His background as a services man with global consulting expertise fits him well for the job. He should make sure that he does not commit the same mistakes of the past management and stick to the core value systems which Infosys is known for which includes ‘under promise and over deliver’,"" he said. 
The obvious challenge for Parekh is the changing technologies and commoditisation of traditional services which is an overall industry issue anyway, Balakrishnan said."
437,2018-01-05,Infosys,"Infosys's new CEO Salil Parekh has been given a Rs9.75 crore joining bonus and stands to make Rs17.3 crore for the first year

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd’s new chief executive officer (CEO) Salil Parekh has been given a Rs9.75 crore joining bonus and could earn up to Rs17.3 crore in the first year. His earnings could possibly double to Rs35.25 crore in the year ended March 2021, provided the former Capgemini executive steers the company well.  
Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd’s new chief executive officer (CEO) Salil Parekh has been given a Rs9.75 crore joining bonus and could earn up to Rs17.3 crore in the first year. His earnings could possibly double to Rs35.25 crore in the year ended March 2021, provided the former Capgemini executive steers the company well. 
Parekh, who took over on 2 January for a period of five years, could earn up to Rs16.25 crore in cash every year, which includes a fixed salary of Rs6.5 crore and a variable pay of up to Rs9.75 crore, according to filings made by the company on Wednesday.
There are two additional components as well: an annual grant of Rs3.25 crore in stocks, a third of which will be vested every year over the next three years, and an annual performance equity grant of Rs13 crore which will be paid depending upon Infosys’s performance. 
This means that if Parekh leads Infosys up to the board’s expectations, he can earn up to Rs17.3 crore in the first year ended March 2019, Rs19.25 crore in the year ended March 2020, and up to Rs35.25 crore in the year ended March 2021. 
This is because Parekh will be eligible for his annual performance equity grant of Rs13 crore a year only after completing three years (at the end of March 2021), making many believe that Infosys wants its CEO to stay and deliver, consistently, for a few years. 
Parekh will also be paid a one-time Rs9.75 crore in stocks, which people believe is similar to a joining bonus made to executives by companies.
“A One-time equity Grant of RSUs covering shares have a Value equal to Rupees Nine Seventy Five Lakhs (Rs 9,75,00,000). The One-time equity Grant shall vest in two (2) instalments as follows: (x) fifty percent (50%) of the Shares subject to the One-time Equity Grant shall vest of the first anniversary of the Grant Date; and (y) the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the Shares subject to the One-time equity Grant shall vest on the second anniversary of the Grant Date,"" said an Infosys filing with the BSE.
Still, Parekh has received an annual pay package that is much lower than what was paid out to his predecessor Vishal Sikka and lower than his peers at rival firms Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, although higher than his counterpart at Wipro.
Infosys’s decision to pay out a relatively moderate annual compensation package to Parekh comes months after the company’s founder N.R. Narayana Murthy lambasted Infosys’s decision to hand out high pay packages to top executives, including to former CEO Vishal Sikka and chief operating officer U.B. Pravin Rao.
Parekh’s salary is lower than what Infosys paid Sikka—who earned roughly Rs48 crore (over $7 million) in his first year at Infosys and the promised about Rs70 crore (over $11 million) after the board of Infosys raised his salary in his second year.
According to at least three people familiar with the details of Parekh’s compensation at Capgemini, this is a significant step-up for the 53-year-old, who made roughly up to $3 million at the Paris-based IT giant.
Wipro CEO Abidali Neemuchwala’s salary for 2016-17 was $2.09 million, including $800,000 in base pay, $150,244 in commission and other payouts of $1.13 million. At TCS, Tata Sons chairman N. Chandrasekaran earned Rs30.15 crore in compensation in 2016-17.
Chandrasekaran’s compensation included Rs2.44 crore in base pay, Rs25 crore in commission and Rs2.7 crore in allowances, and was paid out from April 2016 to February 2017. After February 2017, Chandrasekaran took over as chairman of Tata Sons.
Chandrasekaran’s successor Rajesh Gopinathan earned Rs6.22 crore from April 2016 to 21 February 2017, when he served as CEO. His compensation remained unchanged from February to March 2017 when he was CEO of TCS.
Cognizant, which follows a calendar-year reporting cycle, paid $12 million to CEO Francisco D’Souza in 2016."

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd on Tuesday said it has signed an agreement with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), resulting in an effective tax rate of about 100 basis points lower going forward.  
Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd on Tuesday said it has signed an agreement with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), resulting in an effective tax rate of about 100 basis points lower going forward. 
The Advanced Pricing Agreement (APA), now concluded following discussions initiated in 2015, is expected to result in reversal of tax provisions of about $225 million made in the previous periods and boost the company’s consolidated basic earnings per share by about $0.10 for quarter ended 31 December, the Bengaluru-based company said in a statement.
APA is an agreement between a taxpayer and the tax authority defining an appropriate methodology for computing taxable income.
The agreement covers financial years from 2011 to 2021 and the company expects to payout about $233 million over the next few quarters due to difference between taxes payable as per APA and the actual amount paid in the prior periods.
The APA will enhance predictability of company’s tax obligations in respect to US operations, Infosys added. Reuters"

What is it? The maximum amount that Idea Cellular will raise by selling up to 326.6 million shares on a preferential basis to firms owned by its parent Aditya Birla Group, as per a plan approved by its board members on Thursday.
Why is it important? This comes ahead of the telecom company’s merger with Vodafone India and will increase Aditya Birla Group’s stake in Idea to 47.2% from 42.4% currently. The fundraising seems to be to meet merger conditions, and not due to any cash crunch or breach of covenant, according to a recent report by JM Financial. The proceeds from this fundraising, along with the sale of the tower businesses by Idea and Vodafone India separately, is likely to strengthen the balance sheet of the merged entity.
Tell me more: The Idea board also set up a committee of directors to evaluate options to raise an additional equity of Rs3,500 crore, including a further preferential issue, qualified institutional placement and rights issue.
Rs80,000 crore
What is it? The size of a plan put forth by the Indian government to recapitalise state-run banks by March as part of a two-year programme, for which it sought approval of Parliament on Thursday.
Why is it important? The Lok Sabha gave its green signal to the plan, which seeks to help public sector banks tackle their bad loan problems and revive credit growth. State-run banks account for two-thirds of India’s banking assets, but account for about 90% of bad loans, according to Credit Suisse Group. Last October, the government announced a plan to infuse Rs2,11,000 crore of capital in 21 banks, including Rs1,35,000 crore via recapitalisation bonds and Rs58,000 crore via stake sales by public sector banks.
Tell me more: According to Moody’s Investors Service, the average common equity tier I ratio of rated state-run banks was 8.7%, as of September 2017, compared to 12.2% for rated private sector banks. That gap is set to narrow with the government’s Rs2,11,000 crore plan.
Rs500
What is it? The price for which one can allegedly gain access to all details submitted by all individuals to the UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India), including name, photograph, phone number, address and email ID, according to a report by The Tribune.
Why is it important? If true, it is a major security breach of the world’s biggest biometric database that leaves a billion people at risk of identity theft. However, the UIDAI rubbished the report and said crucial data is secure, and said this appears to be an instance of misuse. It added that it has initiated legal proceedings, including filing an FIR against the persons involved in this case. The Tribune, in response, has countered UIDAI’s claims and has said that the government agency has admitted to misuse of data.
Tell me more: A year ago, the government said more than 111 crore people have an Aadhaar number, which covers over 99% of the country’s adult population.
Rs17.3 crore 
What is it? The likely compensation of Salil Parekh, Infosys’s new chief, in his first year ending March 2019, if he meets performance expectations. This can increase to Rs19.25 crore in the second year and Rs35.25 crore in the third year.
Why is it important? Parekh, who took over as CEO on 2 January on a five-year term, will draw a considerably lower package than his predecessor Vishal Sikka, who earned Rs48.7 crore in his first year. During Sikka’s tenure, Infosys co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy had slammed the company’s board for approving salary hikes to the company’s COO and CEO that were significantly above the standard increase for an average employee.
Tell me more: Parekh’s annual compensation includes Rs6.5 crore as fixed salary and up to Rs9.75 crore as variable portion. On top of that, there are some equity grants. Parekh’s salary is also lower than his peers at Cognizant and TCS, but more than what he made in his previous role at Capgemini.

What is it? The number of test series that India has won in South Africa out of the six they have played since 1992-93. India has lost five series and drawn one.
Why is it important? That’s the kind of history this Indian cricket team will be looking to reverse when it commences its tour of South Africa on Friday, with the first test match at Cape Town. India last toured South Africa in 2013-14. They go into this match without a warm-up game, opting out of one, and instead choosing practice sessions they could control.
Tell me more: India come into the series with a momentum of its own. In 2017, they won all the four test series they played in, losing only one of 11 test matches in the process.

435,2018-01-09,Infosys,"Infosys ex-CFO Balakrishnan says the CEO compensation should be reasonable enough to attract top talent while at the same time be comparable with peer group companies

Bengaluru: Former Infosys chief financial officer V.Balakrishnanon Saturday praised the company’s co-founder Nandan Nilekani for correcting the ‘wrongdoings’ committed by previous board, by fixing a reasonable salary for the incumbent CEO. 
Bengaluru: Former Infosys chief financial officer V.Balakrishnanon Saturday praised the company’s co-founder Nandan Nilekani for correcting the ‘wrongdoings’ committed by previous board, by fixing a reasonable salary for the incumbent CEO.
“I think the board under Nandan has done the right thing to correct the previous wrongdoings. The salary structure for the current chief executive officer Salil Parekh looks reasonable with a large part tied to variable salary with greater focus on long-term retention,"" he told PTI in Bengaluru.
Balakrishnan said it is important for the board to clearly articulate the performance metrics for the vesting of variable salaries to senior management.
“The metrics should have clear focus on increasing shareholders’ value by achieving superior growth. If the board wants to exercise any discretion it should be explained to the shareholders with proper reasoning,"" he said.
Infosys has fixed Parekh’s salary at Rs6.5 crores with an eligibility for variable pay of Rs9.75 crores at the end of the 2018-2019 fiscal year. 
Elaborating on the ‘wrongdoings’ by the previous board, Balakrishnan said, “unfortunately, it never clearly understood the culture or value systems followed by Infosys under its founders, which resulted in excessive senior management salaries and a huge disconnect with rest of the organisation."" “The former CEO’s (Vishal Sikka) salary was increased substantially without clear reason while the rest of the organisation had to contend with meager salary hikes and reduced variable compensation,"" he added.
The $20 billion target by 2020 was loosely used to justify the pay increase to the CEO that lacked conviction, Balakrishnan alleged. 
Recalling N.R. Narayana Murthy’s views, he said excess in capitalism will make the acceptance of capitalism difficult to a large sections of the society.
“The CEO compensation should be reasonable enough to attract top talent while at the same time be comparable with peer group companies,"" the company’s former CFO said.
“It should also reflect the realities within the organization otherwise selling it internally will be difficult,"" he added. 
Balakrishnan also said when the founders ran the company, the senior management salaries were reasonable enough to attract top talent and were never considered excessive. Also, in difficult times, the leadership took the pain before it being passed on to rest of the organisation, he added.
“Leadership by example was practised both in substance and form,"" Balakrishnan said. 
He also said, “As a shareholder, I want the board to be restructured quickly with some members who were part of the earlier dispensation like the erstwhile co-chairman (Ravi Venkatesan) and audit committee chairman (Roopa Kudva) be replaced.""
An effective board is the need of the hour to establish proper checks and balances that was lacking in the earlier dispensation, Balakrishnan said."
433,2018-01-11,Infosys,"Most companies, save for Infosys, are expected to grow faster in 2018-19 than in the current fiscal year and in 2016-17, according to multiple IT executives

To say 2017 was a tumultuous year for India’s $154-billion information technology (IT) outsourcing industry will be an understatement. 
To say 2017 was a tumultuous year for India’s $154-billion information technology (IT) outsourcing industry will be an understatement.
It was specially tumultuous for Infosys Ltd, India’s second largest software services company, which saw the departure in the August of Vishal Sikka, its first non-founder chief executive officer (CEO), after three years in the job.
Sikka left after a protracted battle between the board and some founders over corporate governance issues, paving the way for the return of co-founder Nandan Nilekani as non-executive chairman.
Job layoffs rattled the sector as India’s five largest companies, along with Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., which together employ nearly one-third of the total information technology (IT) industry workforce of 3.9 million, saw a net reduction of 4,157 people in their headcount in April-September from the year-ago period.
These six companies had added 59,940 people in the first half of 2016-17.
US President Donald Trump’s protectionist measures made Indian companies hire more locals in their biggest market, dashing the hopes of young Indian engineers of getting their passports stamped with an American visa. 
Finally, IT companies continued to struggle for growth, primarily because of their inability to get more business from digital, the fuzzy word that clubs revenue from areas classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud computing and Internet of Things.
Digital accounts for less than one-fourth of an Indian IT firm’s revenue, considerably less than Accenture Plc., which claimed that 55% of business in the November quarter came from selling these new technology solutions.
Understandably, for the first time, Accenture will outpace Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys, Wipro Ltd and Nasdaq-listed Cognizant in revenue growth in 2017-18.
Five IT firms returned Rs43,770 crore to shareholders through share buybacks, cheering shareholders at a few companies. 
Wipro’s stock gained 32.2% in calendar year 2017, outpacing the BSE IT index’s 10.8% rise. 
One bright spot was the smooth change of guard at TCS.
Rajesh Gopinathan, who took over as CEO in February after his predecessor Natarajan Chandrasekaran was appointed chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, the group holding company, has until now steered the company ably. 
TCS has retained all senior executives and even business continued uninterrupted, reflecting in the company winning a $2.25 billion outsourcing contract over nine years, the largest ever bagged by an Indian company, from television ratings measurement company Nielsen. 
So what does 2018 holds for the industry? 
Most companies, save for Infosys, are expected to grow faster in 2018-19 than in the current fiscal year and in 2016-17, according to multiple executives across the largest IT companies.
Make no mistake: structural challenges remain as the rise of cloud computing, along with a push towards automation and artificial intelligence platforms, means companies now earn less for the same scope of work done in the past.
Still, strong economic growth in the US has made decision makers at the largest Fortune 1000 companies spend more on technology, which will translate into more business for outsourcing companies.
Even so, as more commoditized outsourcing projects continue to be awarded at lower prices, profitability of these companies will remain under stress.
One important cost lever available to companies is to keep a tab on employee costs, which account for over half of their total operating expenses.
For this reason, more layoffs should be expected in FY19.
Infosys, under CEO Salil Parekh, who took over on 2 January, will be in the spotlight. Infosys, after growing faster than TCS for two straight years, will end the current fiscal year behind its larger Mumbai-based rival.
In the year ahead, Infosys will surely expand its board after three members, including chairman R. Seshasayee, resigned in August.
Years of underperformance at Wipro means it runs the risk of losing the position of the country’s third largest IT company to HCL Technologies Ltd, which has grown at a faster clip in the recent past.
Agreed, Wipro boss Abidali Neemuchwala has committed to steering the company back to industry-matching growth numbers by March 2018. For now, Wipro, which does not provide an annual revenue forecast, is expected to grow at-best 5% in the current fiscal year.
HCL Technologies expects to end with 12.2% growth. This translates to a $268 million difference between the two companies when they start the financial year in April—a gap that will be closed if HCL improves upon Wipro’s growth by 3.42% in FY19. Not impossible, for sure. 
Finally, both by design and accident, six of the 10 largest IT companies, including TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies, Mindtree Ltd and Zensar Ltd, have appointed CEOs during the past 24 months (after January 2016). Sanjay Jalona took over as CEO of Larsen and Toubro Infotech Ltd, only 30 months back, in August 2015. This is the only time when so many companies in the industry have relatively new leaders at the helm around the same time. As decisions made by a CEO take 18-24 to come to fruition, 2018 marks a year when the performance of each of these companies (and their leaders) will be under scrutiny."

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd, India’s second largest software services exporter, on Friday reported a 38% sequential jump in third-quarter net profit, helped by a one-time gain, and maintained its full-year revenue forecast. The company also announced the departure of one of its three presidents, underscoring the challenge new CEO Salil Parekh confronts in retaining its senior-most leaders. 
Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd, India’s second largest software services exporter, on Friday reported a 38% sequential jump in third-quarter net profit, helped by a one-time gain, and maintained its full-year revenue forecast. The company also announced the departure of one of its three presidents, underscoring the challenge new CEO Salil Parekh confronts in retaining its senior-most leaders.
Infosys’s profit rose to $796 million in the quarter ended December, compared with $578 million in the September quarter, as the Bengaluru-based company booked a $225 million gain made on reversal of income tax expenses in the US. Stripped of this one-time gain, Infosys’s quarterly profit would have been down 1.2% sequentially to $571 million. Dollar revenue rose 1% to $2.75 billion from the preceding quarter.
Infosys’s operating margin improved 10 basis points sequentially to 24.3% from 24.2% in the July-September period. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Infosys retained its earlier growth outlook, expecting dollar revenue to expand in the range of 6.5-7.5% in the year to 31 March, or 5.5-6.5% in constant currency terms, which eliminate the effects of exchange-rate fluctuations. Infosys’s move to retain its growth outlook indicates that the company expects its revenue to decline by 0.61% in the fourth quarter in the worst-case scenario. Infosys needs sequential growth of 3.1% in the fourth quarter to end the full-year with 7.5% growth—the upper range of its revenue forecast.
Infosys was dealt a fresh blow with the exit of company veteran Rajesh Krishnamurthy, president, and head of energy, utilities, telecommunications and the Infosys consulting division. Krishnamurthy was overseeing well over $1 billion of the company’s annual revenue. His exit also highlights the challenge of senior-level attrition, an issue that has been a major headache for Infosys, with at least a dozen executives above the rank of senior vice-president leaving the company over the past 18 months."
429,2018-01-13,Infosys,"Infosys profit margins this year have more or less converged with that of TCS this year, compared to a difference of as much as 570 basis points about three years ago

Infosys Ltd reported 5.8% year-on-year growth in revenues in constant currency terms in the December quarter, slightly lower than the 6.2% growth reported by Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). Likewise, growth in operating profit at the companies wasn’t very different last quarter. In short, Infosys has done well in a period during which it functioned without an active chief executive officer (CEO). 
Infosys Ltd reported 5.8% year-on-year growth in revenues in constant currency terms in the December quarter, slightly lower than the 6.2% growth reported by Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). Likewise, growth in operating profit at the companies wasn’t very different last quarter. In short, Infosys has done well in a period during which it functioned without an active chief executive officer (CEO).
Of course, TCS has been growing at a sluggish pace (bit.ly/2CUp4AW) and hasn’t exactly set a high bar to beat. Still, the fact that Infosys delivered steady growth in a seasonally weak quarter, and in the midst of a leadership transition, is a heartening sign.
Besides, as the chart alongside points out, Infosys’s profit margins this year have more or less converged with that of TCS this year, compared to a difference of as much as 570 basis points about three years ago.
As a result of this catch-up, Infosys’s operating profit growth in the first three quarters is slightly ahead of its bigger rival. 
While Infosys shares have recovered all of their losses since Vishal Sikka’s exit (and then gained some more), they still trade at an 18% valuation discount to TCS shares based on the current year’s earnings estimates. Just before Sikka announced his resignation, the valuation discount was narrower at around 13%.
With Infosys delivering better profit growth, perhaps investors need to sit up and take notice. Interestingly, Infosys’s commentary on the key banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) vertical is far more optimistic than TCS’s. 
While the latter said it will be a couple of quarters before there is a meaningful recovery in the segment, Infosys said 2018 will be better compared to the previous year. A majority of its large deal wins are from the segment, and the company said on a call with analysts that regulatory spend and digital engagements are expected to drive growth in BFSI. 
“We expect discretionary spending to come back next fiscal; and things are not as hazy as a year ago,"" Infosys said in post-results comments.
In the December quarter, the BFSI segment’s revenues were flat sequentially, better than the 1.5% decline reported by TCS. From the looks of it, the client mix of the two companies is behind the difference in commentary. 
True, TCS has other engines firing away but as its third quarter results announcement showed, BFSI with its 33% contribution to revenues can pull down overall growth to a large extent. 
What’s more, analysts expect recent tax reforms in the US to have a negligible impact on Infosys, compared to being a headwind for TCS. 
Having said all this, investors may still be a tad cautious with Infosys, considering that its new CEO hasn’t yet clearly articulated his strategies and priorities.
But, based on how things stand currently in terms of growth rates, and given the difference in commentary, some of them may well start wondering about their higher allocations towards TCS in the past few months.
The writers do not hold positions in the companies mentioned above."

Bengaluru: Infosys’ new chief executive officer (CEO) Salil Parekh on Friday said he will lay out strategic priorities for the company by April, for which a review is underway.
In his first media interaction after taking charge as Infosys CEO and managing director on 2 January, Parekh on Friday said that his immediate priorities would include connecting with employees and clients to build a “roadmap for future"" that will be announced in April. 
Stressing that each of its clients is facing digital disruption, Parekh said that this creates an opportunity for the company. He said that building on strategy initiated by Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani, the company is conducting a review structured around four dimensions, namely, new market opportunities, client relationships, people, and service offering portfolio. 
“Over the next three months, I am meeting with several of our clients, employees, partners... working with our leadership team and the board to test the assumption and the approach and then build a comprehensive view along with four critical elements,"" he said.
Parekh added that the entire exercise would be concluded by April when he lays out the “strategic priorities"" for the company going forward. Parekh was brought on board after the abrupt resignation of Vishal Sikka, who had quit in August following public spat with co-founders led by N.R. Narayana Murthy. 
The founders had alleged corporate governance lapses and questioned the $200 million Panaya acquisition under previous management while also flagging the high severance pay to former employees. Under Parekh, Infosys is now attempting to bring the focus back on growth and business."
428,2018-01-17,Infosys,"Four biggest IT stocks listed on NSE Infosys, TCS, Wipro, HCL Technologies rose between 4.1% and 5.9% on Tuesday, although part of that could be due to weakness in rupee

A rising tide may lift all boats, but to expect higher IT spending to benefit all Indian IT companies is clearly taking things too far. Morgan Stanley said in a 15 January note that “an improving global macro could spur tech spending, which could re-rate stocks"". The four biggest IT stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange rose between 4.1% and 5.9%, although part of that could be due to the weakness in the rupee, after the trade deficit for December came in at a three-year high.  
A rising tide may lift all boats, but to expect higher IT spending to benefit all Indian IT companies is clearly taking things too far. Morgan Stanley said in a 15 January note that “an improving global macro could spur tech spending, which could re-rate stocks"". The four biggest IT stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange rose between 4.1% and 5.9%, although part of that could be due to the weakness in the rupee, after the trade deficit for December came in at a three-year high. 
Ironically, the biggest gainer was the Wipro Ltd stock, on which Morgan Stanley still has an underweight rating with a target price of Rs290. Wipro shares rose to Rs334 apiece on Tuesday. Investors are taking the rising tide argument far too literally.
For that matter, even Morgan Stanley’s thesis is predicated upon the assumption that a turnaround in global IT spending will result in better times for the Indian IT sector. 
This isn’t necessarily the case. In recent years, multinational firms such as Accenture Plc and some small companies such as EPAM Systems Inc. and Globant SA have done far better than Indian IT firms, with spending patterns shifting towards new technologies at the expense of traditional services. 
Data collated by ISG, the world’s largest third-party outsourcing deal adviser, shows that Indian IT companies have lagged by a huge margin in the Americas region, despite high growth in overall deal flow. Growth in total deal flow tracked by ISG rose as much as 37% in Americas in the second half of 2017. 
“While the deal flow momentum in Americas was positive, the perplexing factor remains that for the top-4 Indian IT companies, growth in Americas has decelerated to 5% y-o-y in 2QFY18 (versus its near-term peak of 14% y-o-y)"", analysts at Nomura Research wrote in a note to clients. Results of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd for the December quarter show that the weakness in growth continues—the former reported growth of less than 3% year-on-year in the Americas region. In short, the tide was rising in America, but it didn’t really lift Indian IT companies with it. 
A 2018 outlook report by ISG suggests this trend might continue in 2018. “Traditional sourcing will continue to face pricing pressure (as clients look to do more with less)... Traditional sourcing momentum remains slow... deal flow grew 3% y-y in 2017 (and is estimated to grow 4% in 2018),"" Nomura’s analysts said in the note citing the ISG report. What ISG classifies as traditional sourcing is the bread and butter segment for Indian IT companies. 
The other category of deals ISG tracks is classified as “as-a-service sourcing"", which includes Software as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service. This can be used as a rough proxy for digital spending, a segment where Indian IT companies have been lagging. Even here, ISG has indicated that deal flow is expected to fall to 20% in 2018, compared to 36% in the previous year."

426,2018-01-18,Infosys,"The troubles with recent Infosys acquisitions, including those of Panaya, Noah Consulting and Skava, underscore the M&A challenges faced by the IT firm

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd continues to struggle to realize the promised benefits from its three acquisitions. 
Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd continues to struggle to realize the promised benefits from its three acquisitions.
The firm has shut down Noah Consulting, the company it bought for $70 million in 2015, and transferred all the business to the parent company, valuing the firm at 40% lower than the original purchase price.
Meanwhile, a co-founder of Skava, a mobile commerce firm it bought for $120 million two years ago, has left the firm.
The developments underscore the merger and acquisition (M&A) challenges faced by the Bengaluru-based company.
Significantly, Infosys’s attempts to generate more business from the three firms it bought for $390 million, including $200 million paid to buy Israeli automation technology firm Panaya Ltd, will now test the resolve of Salil Parekh, who took over as CEO on 2 January. Parekh apprised analysts last week that M&A will be a “very strategic opportunity"" for India’s second largest information technology outsourcing company.
In October 2015, Infosys bought Noah Consulting with an eye on offering solutions in the data analytics space to its oil and gas clients to run their business better.
“… (O)n October 17, 2017 , the company entered into a business transfer agreement to transfer the business for a consideration of $41 million (approximately Rs266 crore) and the transfer was with effect from October 25, 2017… Subsequently in November 2017, Noah Consulting LLC has been liquidated,"" read a statement filed with stock exchanges when Infosys declared third quarter earnings last week.
Infosys maintains that it had always wanted to merge Noah Consulting with the parent, although in the more than two years since it acquired the company, Infosys had not publicly shared this plan. 
“The merger of Noah Consulting’s business into Infosys has been done in line with the integration plan envisaged at the time of Noah Consulting’s acquisition. Noah’s information management consulting services for the oil and gas industry are closely aligned to the solutions that we are taking to our clients in the industry, and we have been able to greatly enhance our depth of expertise and data management services leveraging the capabilities the company has brought into our fold,"" said a spokeswoman for the company.
On the question of Infosys valuing the firm at a lower price, the spokeswoman said: “It is incorrect to look at the value of the business in terms of just the statutory subsidiary standalone financials. The current valuation is for Noah as a standalone entity, while the business continues to generate synergies for the group. As a result there is no write-off in the financials of the company. The consideration paid for Noah Consulting was in the form of cash consideration and retention bonus (to ensure continuity of business)...""
Significantly, before liquidating Noah Consulting, Infosys had already reversed the entire promised $5 million in contingent money payable to the selling shareholders upon achievement of certain financial targets.
Sudha Varadarajan, chief technology officer and co-founder of Skava, left the firm last month, according to two executives familiar with the development. Varadarajan, along with her husband Arish Ali, founded Skava in 2002.
Mint could not ascertain the reason behind Varadarajan’s departure, although both the executives cited earlier said Infosys was struggling to scale up solutions offered by the mobile commerce start-up.
Infosys declined to offer a comment on Varadarajan’s departure, with a spokeswoman saying, “We do not comment on rumours and speculation. Skava continues to remain an integral part of Infosys’s portfolio of digital offerings.""
A few analysts found fault with Infosys for its inability to integrate the acquisitions well.
“Almost three years after acquiring Skava, Infosys’s share of the retail and CPG (consumer, packaged goods) vertical remains relatively flat, around 14% of total revenue. This trend highlights Infosys’s struggle to improve vertical performance by developing and customizing industry-specific platform IP (intellectual property),"" Bozhidar Hristov, an analyst at US-based research firm TBRI, said in a statement.
Of all the three acquisitions, Infosys’s decision to buy Panaya was the most controversial, with a few employees and some founders, including N.R. Narayana Murthy, questioning the rationale behind buying the Israeli firm. 
Infosys’s then chief financial officer, Rajiv Bansal, expressed his reservations and even walked out of a board meeting when board members were asked to approve a proposal to buy Panaya in February 2015. Later, Infosys’s decision to make an unexplained and generous severance payment to Bansal made a few executives, including Murthy, repeatedly raise the issue; then-CEO Vishal Sikka strongly denied all allegations of skulduggery and corporate greed but eventually called these charges “sickening"" and resigned on 18 August.
Since making its last acquisition in October 2015, Infosys has shied away from buying any company. The company has also not made any investment in any start-up from the company’s $500 million Infosys Innovation Fund since January last year.
Infosys CEO Parekh has sought time until April to outline the strategy ahead for the company.
Infosys will look at “M&A as a very strategic opportunity, but no decisions have been made"", Parekh told analysts on Friday, after the company reported a 1% sequential increase in dollar revenue in the October-December period.

Hyderabad: India’s start-ups will flourish if the regulatory environment becomes more friendly as all other things—funding, talent and ability to connect to global market—are in place, says a senior IT industry figure. 
V. Balakrishnan, the former chief financial officer of Infosys Ltd, told PTI that investors are now focusing on B2B start-ups than B2C. According to him, a lot of churning has happened in the start-up field in the last two years but there is lot of stability now, and funding has become much more focused with not all companies attracting money. 
B2C start-ups had funding challenges which have reduced of late with large players among them having raised money. “But B2B market is the focus now; most of the funds are focusing on B2B because capital requirement is low and I think exit is also happening in B2B. I think a lot more focus in the VC circles is on B2B companies now than B2C,"" he said. 
The biggest problem faced by start-ups is on regulatory and compliance front, Balakrishnan said, citing the income tax department’s notices to start-ups vis-a-vis the angel tax. “I think some of the regulatory changes have to be much more friendly for startup companies and compliance regulation should ease because you can’t expect a startup started by an entrepreneur who is 25-30 years (old) to comply with some 30 to 40 laws,"" he said. 
He said regulations and compliance have to be made simple and much more friendlier for start-ups. “The recent notice issued by Income Tax department to all startup companies on funding is not helping because you can’t expect a startup company which raised money to pay tax on the capital,"" Balakrishnan said. 
Regulation is a key challenge and there needs to be much more clarity. If that comes, the environment (for start-ups) will change for the better, he said. “Start-ups should have a different environment for regulatory compliance; you can’t expect a startup company to adhere to all matured company regulations,"" Balakrishnan said. 
“I think if the regulatory environment becomes much more easier, start-ups will flourish as all other things are there funding is there, talent is coming in, I think they are also able to connect to the global market,"" he said."

Davos: Indian IT companies TCS and Infosys have joined a global drive for tech reskilling of 1 million workers in the first ever such IT industry initiative. The initiative, whose founding partners also include Accenture, CA Technologies, Cisco, Cognizant, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Pegasystems, PwC, Salesforce and SAP, aims to bring competitive training content together on one platform to serve the greater good. 
The initiative will be targeting 1 million people for training and resource opportunities on the World Economic Forum SkillSET portal by January 2021. The IT Industry Skills Initiative was launched here by the World Economic Forum (WEF) to meet the global skills gap challenge and address job displacement arising from automation and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. 
The initiative was conceived by the Forum’s IT Governors community under the chairmanship of Chuck Robbins, the chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Cisco. 
“We need responsive solutions and coordination from all parts of society—governments, citizens and private industry alike—to re-envision an educational system based on lifelong learning that can fully prepare workers for the jobs of the future,"" said Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman, World Economic Forum. “This initiative is a clear example of industry leaders taking concerted, collective action to address a major social challenge at scale."" 
According to a World Economic Forum report on workforce reskilling, one in four adults reported a mismatch between the skills they have and the skills they need for their current job. Therefore, enabling and empowering workers to transform and update their skills is a key concern for businesses and societies across the globe. 
The coalition has created a free platform of online tools to streamline the process of reskilling adults. The initial iteration of the portal will be available in April 2018. The coalition, which continues to add members, will be working over the next few months to develop tools and processes intended to address many of the barriers that prevent adults from reskilling or successfully completing trainings. 
The initiative will initially target the US market, with plans to scale to other geographies and build industry and public-sector partnerships in 2018 and beyond. Under the chairmanship of Mike Gregoire, CEO, CA Technologies, the coalition will report on progress at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019. 
Cognizant CEO Francisco D’Souza said: “The workplace issue of the 21st century is a worldwide shortage of qualified technology talent driven by a massive skills gap, which we must address together on a global scale. “The pace of technological change has education systems struggling to keep up in delivering learning experiences that are relevant, immersive and readily available as workers seek to expand their skills."" 
He also said the future of talent development depends on new models, ways of thinking and initiatives like this one that engage individuals as lifelong learners and provide them with opportunities for continuous reinvention. 
Infosys CEO Salil Parikh said, “Our relevance, in an increasingly digital future, will depend on our ability to learn and evolve lifelong at the pace of technology. Democratising digital literacy is an essential first step to make technology a force for good that moves us all forward."" 
TCS chief Rajesh Gopinathan said with the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, enterprises are leveraging the combined effect of emerging technologies to transform their businesses. 
“Employees will also have to transform their skills and adopt newer ways of working to participate in today’s opportunities that are as enormous as in any of the previous generations. It is important for enterprises to make investments in reskilling and upskilling employees and prepare them for digital-age careers,"" he added."

All the water in the world cannot fill a bucket with a hole in it. The finance minister has to allocate funds to train experts in artificial intelligence (AI) while also providing for fifth graders. We need to fix the basics, as much as we need our moon shots. This juxtaposition is no longer surprising, it is the norm for India. Nevertheless, our ambition should not be tempered by our reality. As long as the road ahead is, we should appreciate we’ve already come quite far! 
All the water in the world cannot fill a bucket with a hole in it. The finance minister has to allocate funds to train experts in artificial intelligence (AI) while also providing for fifth graders. We need to fix the basics, as much as we need our moon shots. This juxtaposition is no longer surprising, it is the norm for India. Nevertheless, our ambition should not be tempered by our reality. As long as the road ahead is, we should appreciate we’ve already come quite far!
India has made remarkable progress with regard to financial inclusion. In the last three years, we have added more than 310 million accounts, owing to the adoption of electronic know-your-customer (eKYC), which enables a bank account to be opened in five minutes using Aadhaar. An average Indian can now transact between different bank accounts using any bank’s app in mere seconds because of the Unified Payment Interface (UPI)—a state-of-the-art payment platform developed by the National Payment Corp. of India. UPI does upwards of 150 million transactions a month, a number significantly higher than that of credit card transactions for the same period. We have only been able to achieve this because of a timely investment in the creation of digital infrastructure like the India Stack as a public good.
The finance minister’s opening remarks laid emphasis on this government’s focus on structural reforms. We cannot deal with our diverse and complex problems without focusing on fixing the basics and investing in infrastructure. But the definition of the word infrastructure needs to expand. In the digital age, infrastructure no longer means just roads, bridges and highways but also platforms, software development kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs). The government’s role isn’t to prescribe cookie-cutter solutions for all our problems from Delhi, but instead to enable grassroots innovators to co-create their own solutions, which fit their context.
This can be called the societal platform approach of solving India’s hard problems. Sarkar (government) alone cannot fix our problems, it can only help create the right conditions for samaaj (civil society), sarkar and bazaar (market players) to co-create context-aware solutions. I am glad to see this year’s budget underlining this approach. Announcements such as creating 500,000 Wi-Fi hotspots, which will provide broadband access to 50 million rural citizens, will pay off in ways we cannot even imagine today. Similarly, we will see tremendous benefits of the formalization of toll collection, through FasTag, an electronic platform using modern wireless technology, which can be applied to parking and congestion pricing as well.
The beauty of these platforms is that they are extendible. The second-order benefits take a lot less time to implement, and their benefits are felt much quicker. Now that we have basic financial inclusion, our ambition can move to financial resilience. For example, on the back of the financial access created by the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, the budget announced a more ambitious target of bringing all 600 million basic accounts within its fold and undertaking measures to provide services of micro insurance and unorganized sector pension schemes through these accounts.
The finance minister also announced his intent to use data from the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) to enable flow-based lending for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The technology spine of GST Network allows us to imagine a system where even small businesses can get a quick loan, online without paperwork, on the basis of their tax data, which is provided at the invoice level. The Trade Receivables e-discounting System (TReDS) will get a big boost as suppliers can instantly discount their invoices which have been accepted by the buyer on GSTN. The move to an e-assessment system rather than relying on person-to-person interaction is also a big win for MSMEs across the country. The creation of an Aadhaar-like unique identification number for enterprises will help spread the benefits of these online platforms to the micro-entrepreneur as well. We’re probably going to be able to achieve this rapidly, because all the building blocks are already in place.
We’re seeing the government adopt the same approach for education. Combining cyber and physical systems as mentioned in the budget, is the right way forward. The Department of Science & Technology will launch a mission on Cyber Physical Systems to support establishment of centres of excellence. They are also investing in creating digital infrastructure such as Diksha—the national teacher platform. Healthcare too needs structural reform and digital infrastructure, if we are to successfully roll out the National Health Protection Scheme—the world’s largest government-funded healthcare initiative that will cover a majority of our vulnerable population.
The system is not perfect, but we must appreciate how much progress has already been made. We are beginning to develop an approach that works for our complex, varied problems. A budget for a country as large and diverse as India cannot assume to know the answers to all the problems. Yesterday, we heard the finance minister address everything from Hawai Chappals to Hawai Jahaaz. But the unifying theme is that they are investing in our basic infrastructure, both physical and digital.

420,2018-02-21,Infosys,"After a two-decade career at Intel, most recently as managing director for South Asia, Debjani Ghosh will lead NASSCOM that represents global leaders in software outsourcing from TCS to Infosys

Debjani Ghosh, NASSCOM, Indian IT industry, Intel Corp, women workers, Indian software industry,  
Debjani Ghosh, NASSCOM, Indian IT industry, Intel Corp, women workers, Indian software industry, 
Bangalore: In a sign of the times, the organization that speaks for and champions India’s $167 billion IT services industry will soon get its first female head.
Intel Corp. veteran Debjani Ghosh takes over as president of the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) in April — three decades after its formation. After a two-decade career at the US chipmaker, most recently as managing director for South Asia, Ghosh will lead the trade body that represents global leaders in software outsourcing from Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. to Infosys Ltd.
Ghosh promises to advocate for women in a workplace that remains male-dominated. Her appointment underscores how the local industry is waking up to a gender imbalance that plagues the global technology sector, starting with its epicenter of Silicon Valley, and has resulted in harassment and discrimination at all levels.
Ghosh, also an angel investor in a number of startups, argued that changes in the executive suite and mindsets are needed for a level playing field. India’s IT services sector employs about four million skilled workers and nearly a third of those are women. But that imbalance becomes starker the higher up the rungs one goes: none of India’s largest IT services companies have ever been headed by a female. Part of the problem is talent drain, she said in an interview.
“Things have to change. We have to check talented, capable women dropping out,"" said Ghosh, who featured prominently during Nasscom’s annual conference, which is wrapping up on Wednesday in Hyderabad. “Leakages are the challenge and I want to focus on how to fix that.""
According to a 2017 Nasscom study called “Women and IT – Scorecard,"" technology companies face the significant problem of retaining women after maternity leave. For men and women starting their careers at the same age, women progress slower and men in senior positions are often younger than women at a similar level, the study found after surveying 55 companies.
“The pipeline is clearly not the problem since engineering colleges have seen gender parity in enrollments for years,"" Ghosh said during the three-day conference.
Ghosh takes up her role at a critical time for a sector that contributes about 8% of the country’s gross domestic product. She’ll represent an industry transforming itself from low-paid legacy work such as maintaining computer systems, and getting into newer technologies from the cloud to artificial intelligence. She’ll help Nasscom’s 2,400-plus members grapple with controversial issues such as hiring, which is flattening due to the onset of automation, and the likelihood of more layoffs. India’s IT sector is also grappling with the challenge of immigration barriers in its largest market, the US.
But in some ways, her very appointment is already regarded as a victory.
“The industry needs more role models,"" said Sangeeta Gupta, a senior vice president at Nasscom. “Debjani is a signal that the tide is turning."" Bloomberg"

New Delhi: Healthcare and life sciences companies are mostly using cybersecurity, big data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in a big way, a report by IT firm Infosys Ltd revealed.
The report titled, Digital Outlook for the Healthcare and Life Sciences Industry, highlighted how digital technologies deployed at organizations are improving existing operations, solving new problems and creating new opportunities. The research polled IT and business decision-makers in healthcare and life sciences industry as part of a global survey to discover the opportunities presented by new digital technologies.
According to the healthcare companies surveyed, investing in technologies for big data analytics for predicting risk and the onset of health problems (73%), Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems modernization (57%) and remote hospital-like care delivery (49%) are the most commonly reported trends for the next three years which will make a positive impact on their organization.
Meanwhile, life sciences respondents described improving cyber security (64%), using cloud-based technologies (54%), and fostering industry collaboration (47%) as the top trends.
“Healthcare providers plan to invest in digital technologies in the coming 12 months. EHR systems (68%) and big data analytics (61%) are currently receiving investments from most companies who consider them a trend in the coming three years,"" the report said.
“Life sciences organizations plan to invest in digital technologies in the coming 12 months, but not all investments are in the top trends: 76% of those who consider it a trend over the next three years were investing in technologies to improve cyber security for protection of patient and trial data,"" it said.

New Delhi: India’s second largest software services firm Infosys on Monday announced its intention to voluntarily delist its American Depositary Shares (ADS) from Euronext Paris and Euronext London exchanges. 
The ADS of the Bengaluru-based firm will continue to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). It said the primary reason for seeking the proposed delisting is the “low average daily trading volume of Infosys ADS on these exchanges, which is not commensurate with the related administrative requirements"". 
During the five-year period of the company’s listing on Euronext Paris and Euronext London, the average daily trading volume of the company’s ADS was significantly lower than its average daily trading volume on NYSE, Infosys said in a BSE filing. 
It began trading on these exchanges in February 2013. The proposed delisting is subject to approval from Euronext Paris SA and Euronext London Ltd, it added. There will be no change to the Infosys share/ADS count, capital structure and float, as a result of the proposed delisting from the above exchanges, it said. 
Infosys said subject to the approval, a sales facility will be provided by the company to the holders of ADS trading on the said exchanges. Those who opt for the sales facility will be able to sell their ADS on NYSE in accordance with Euronext Paris and Euronext London rules. 
ADS holders who do not opt for the sales facility can continue to keep their ADS and will be able to trade their ADS on NYSE. Until the completion of the proposed delisting, the ADS holders can continue to trade their ADS on the Euronext Paris and Euronext London exchanges, Infosys said."

Kolkata: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday arrested Kaustuv Ray and Shivaji Panja, directors of RP Infosystems Pvt. Ltd, which used to make computer hardware, for allegedly defrauding a consortium of lenders of at least Rs515 crore. 
Kolkata: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday arrested Kaustuv Ray and Shivaji Panja, directors of RP Infosystems Pvt. Ltd, which used to make computer hardware, for allegedly defrauding a consortium of lenders of at least Rs515 crore.
A spokesperson for the Central Bureau of Investigation confirmed the development, saying that after an initial probe, the investigating agency felt the need to detain them for further questioning.
The company was being investigated for years for allegedly drawing loans—from as many as 17 banks at one point—by allegedly furnishing “fabricated"" documents.
In December 2013, IDBI Bank Ltd had filed a complaint alleging diversion of funds by the maker of Chirag computers using fake documents.
It was at that time the leader of the lenders’ consortium.
The agency had conducted an investigation and has filed a chargesheet, but Canara Bank, one of the lenders to the company, had filed another complaint at the end of February, alleging that the Central Bureau of Investigation’s probe into the alleged fraud was restricted only to IDBI Bank’s exposure.
RP Info Systems has challenged the investigating agency’s chargesheet.
Canara Bank said in its complaint that it had provided Rs40 crore to RP Infosystems as a working capital loan, and that it had reported it as fraud to the Reserve Bank of India, or RBI, back in 2015.
However, it isn’t immediately clear why the bank didn’t seek a Central Bureau of Investigation probe into the alleged fraud until now.
RP Infosystems had overstated its inventory and had produced falsified invoices to obtain loans, Canara Bank has said in its recent complaint to the Central Bureau of Investigation. 
In fiscal year 2013-14, the RP Infosystems wrote off inventory valued at Rs397.62 crore and receivables valued at Rs499.30 crore, Canara Bank has said in its complaint.
Ray and Panja were not immediately available for comments.
Ray had said after Canara Bank filed its complaint last month that CBI had concluded its investigation into RP Infosystems and that the company had offered to repay its bank loans under a settlement scheme.
Canara Bank’s complaint shows 11 lenders, including the erstwhile leader of the lenders’ consortium IDBI Bank, had started proceedings to recover Rs651 crore in all. At one point, RP Infosystems had borrowed from 17 banks.
Ray and Panja have partitioned their business interests, which once included film, media, tea plantation and computer hardware."

New Delhi: Infosys, India’s second largest software services firm, on Friday said it will announce the financial results for the quarter ended March 2018 and fiscal 2017-18 on 13 April. 
The meeting of board of directors of the Bengaluru-based company will be held on 12 April 2018 and 13 April 2018 to consider the audited consolidated financial statements for the quarter and year ending 31 March 2018, Infosys said in a BSE filing. 
“The financial results would be finally approved by the Board of Directors on April 13, 2018,"" it added. Investors will also keenly wait for the annual revenue growth outlook for the 2018-19 fiscal from the company and its commentary on the demand environment for IT services. 
Infosys has guided for 5.5-6.5% growth in revenue in constant currency terms for the ongoing financial year. It is also expected that Infosys’ new CEO Salil Parekh could spell out the strategic roadmap for the company, for which a review was being undertaken. 
Parekh had said his immediate priorities were to connect with employees and clients to build a “roadmap for future"" that would be announced in April. The former Capgemini executive took over the role on 2 January 2018. The entire exercise, he had said, will end by April when he would lay out the “strategic priorities"" for the company going forward.

Kolkata: Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy on Wednesday said urban intellectuals did not buy the idea of demonetisation that the government implemented in 2016, but it did go down well with a majority of rural Indians.  
Kolkata: Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy on Wednesday said urban intellectuals did not buy the idea of demonetisation that the government implemented in 2016, but it did go down well with a majority of rural Indians. 
Murthy was speaking on the government’s demonetisation of high value banknotes in November 2016 at a session with students of Presidency University here.
“I am not an expert in economics but I saw that urban intellectuals did not buy the idea of demonetisation, but a vast majority of rural Indians seemed to have welcomed it,"" he said.
Murthy said he himself could not understand the logic behind the demonetisation move since he is not an expert on the subject. 
“Though I am not expert, but as a lay person I saw that when, for some reason, old 500 notes were demonetised, the government introduced new notes pretty quickly of the same denomination and even of higher  ₹ 2000 denomination. Only an expert can answer why this happened. I cannot understand... you should talk to experts,"" Murthy said. 
To another question, the Czar of the country’s IT industry said India had not focused on low-tech manufacturing unlike countries like Japan or China, since the 1950s. He said it is unfortunate that 75% children in the country go to school but drop out before they reach class 8. 
“Hence, when they reach the age of 22, they need job, but they are only fit for a job which is in low-tech manufacture. The economists should have thought of them right from 1950s,"" Murthy said. 
Stressing on the need to strike a balance between automation and human beings, he said, “We can take a decision...we will not follow automation up to certain level of our manufacture or services"". 
“We have to strike a balance, we have to be internationally competitive in products, services....we may slow down automation for domestic purposes,"" he said."

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd, under chairman Nandan Nilekani, appears to have drawn lessons from the ugly public spat with its first non-founder chief executive to draw a contract with current CEO Salil Parekh that leaves little scope for potential disagreements or legal trouble. 
Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd, under chairman Nandan Nilekani, appears to have drawn lessons from the ugly public spat with its first non-founder chief executive to draw a contract with current CEO Salil Parekh that leaves little scope for potential disagreements or legal trouble.
This development underlines the new board’s decision to keep at bay all potential conflicting issues raised in the past, including a few tetchy issues in former CEO Vishal Sikka’s employment contract .
“Obviously now, Infosys has learnt from their experiences with the first non-founder CEO Vishal Sikka and have structured a tighter and transparent employment contract with Salil Parekh,"" said Shriram Subramanian, managing director of proxy advisory firm InGovern Research Services.
Infosys declined to comment to emailed queries. 
The firm, however, has still not spelt out the metrics based on which Parekh will be paid his variable pay.
Four features stand out in Parekh’s 14-page employment contract, which has not been made public and was reviewed by Mint. 
First, Parekh is not assured of any minimum salary as part of his compensation structure. In contrast, Infosys had agreed to pay Sikka $10 million in annual compensation, irrespective of the firm’s performance. Parekh, in comparison, can earn as much as Rs17.3 crore, including fixed salary and variable pay, in the first full year. His earnings could possibly double to Rs35.25 crore in the year ended March 2021, provided he steers the company well. 
Second, a “Release of Claims"" condition ensures that Infosys does not have to pay more than the promised severance to Parekh, in case the board ends his tenure before 2023. Sikka’s contract did not have such a clause.
“The Release of Claims clause, although pretty common globally, is probably the first time an Indian firm has got it included as part of an employment contract,"" the head of an executive search firm said on condition of anonymity. 
Infosys pays considerably less in severance payment to Parekh than what it had committed to pay Sikka. Parekh stands to get half of his full-year fixed and variable pay, as against Infosys agreeing to pay two years of fixed and variable salary to Sikka. 
Third, Parekh cannot work with eight IT firms, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Accenture Plc and Parekh’s former employer, Capgemini SE for six months from the time he leaves Infosys.
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., Wipro Ltd, Tech Mahindra Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd are the five other companies. Sikka did not have a non-compete clause. 
Finally, Infosys has spelt out the process of arbitration, in case of any dispute with the CEO.
Both Infosys and Parekh have agreed to abide by a three-member arbitration panel’s decision and not to contest the panel’s verdict before any court. Sikka’s employment contract did not specify details of the arbitration process.
Clarity on arbitration should further assuage investor concerns as Infosys’s former chief financial officer Rajiv Bansal has challenged the firm’s decision to withhold from making the full Rs17.38 crore in promised severance pay.
Infosys after having paid Rs5 crore to Bansal stopped the remaining payments, with the firm declining to share the reason behind this decision. For now, it is not clear if Infosys or Bansal will accept the arbitration verdict and if either of the two warring sides will contest it in court."

Bengaluru/Washington: India’s largest information technology (IT) outsourcing companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd, have reduced their dependence on H-1B visas over the last three years, a US daily reported, reflecting these companies’ preparations to tackle the protectionist approach followed by the current US administration of President Donald Trump. 
Bengaluru/Washington: India’s largest information technology (IT) outsourcing companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd, have reduced their dependence on H-1B visas over the last three years, a US daily reported, reflecting these companies’ preparations to tackle the protectionist approach followed by the current US administration of President Donald Trump.
According to data analysed from 2015 to 2017 by San Francisco Chronicle, Wipro saw a 52.4% drop in number of visa applications filed by the company over the three-year period while TCS reported a 18.3% decline and Infosys saw 38.1% reduction. Wipro applied for only 5,812 visa applications for engineers to work in the US in 2017, while TCS applied for 13,537 and Infosys filed for 20,587 applications, according to data gathered from US Department of Labour by the US daily.
This decline in number of visa applications mirrors the commentary from each of the IT firms. Wipro, for example, claims that over 55 percent of the 13,000 people employed by the company in the US are local American citizens.
“Indian consulting firms, which have been accused of flooding the system with applications, have dramatically reduced their filings. Foreign nationals are exhibiting new reluctance to make the jump to a US company,"" the paper said as the process for filing H-1B visa application for the 2019 fiscal beginning 1 October, started on 2 April.
Still, since the decline in number of applications made by Indian IT firms was most in the last year, the paper noted that the Trump administration’s hard-line anti-immigration stance is taking its toll.
The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.
Envoy Global, a technology-oriented immigration services provider, reports that 26% of employers it surveyed have had to delay projects, and 22% of them have relocated work overseas as a result of the current uncertainties in the US immigration system, San Francisco Chronicle said.
The daily argued that study after study has shown that foreign-born workers are good for the US economy and good for US-born workers.
“When companies are allowed to hire the workers with the best skills for the job—regardless of where those workers happen to have been born—their increased competitiveness boosts all the industries around them,"" it said.
According to The Wall Street Journal, evidence suggests market demand for H-1B visas is ebbing. Daniel Culbertson, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, says “searches related to the H-1B visa, as a share of all searches on Indeed.com, have consistently declined through 2017 and into 2018. In February 2018, searches for H-1B as a share of all searches on our site are down nine percent from the 2017...This also marks the thirteenth consecutive month of year-over-year declines. The decreased interest in H-1B related work from job seekers is a trend, not a temporary shift in preferences,"" he added.
The Wall Street Journal said corporations continue to struggle with a paradoxical labour market where 548,000 tech jobs remain open while unemployment in the technology sector hovers below full employment levels.
“There are lots of jobs, but not enough workers to fill them,"" it said."

Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chairman of Infosys Ltd, is increasingly playing a less active executive role at India’s second largest IT outsourcing firm and has handed over responsibilities to new chief executive Salil Parekh and his top lieutenants, according to three people familiar with the developments.
Since returning to Infosys as non-executive chairman on 24 August, Nilekani for the most part of his stint operated like a “super CEO"", playing a hands-on executive role to steer the firm through one of its most tumultuous times in the wake of former CEO Vishal Sikka’s departure.
Up till December, Nilekani spent at least two or three days a week working out of Infosys’s corporate headquarters in Bengaluru, reviewing the performance of business unit heads, strategizing and regularly calling or meeting the company’s largest clients, which farm out hundreds of millions of dollars worth of business to Infosys every year. 
That has changed since Parekh took office on 2 January. Since then, Nilekani has gradually cut his visits to office to once or twice a fortnight, allowing the CEO freedom to focus on executive responsibilities—even though both Parekh and Nilekani remain in regular contact over the phone, the people cited earlier said, requesting anonymity. 
This move, according to one of the three executives cited above, has created a “clear delineation"" between the roles of the CEO and the non-executive chairman. Significantly, according to the CEO’s employment contract, Parekh, like his predecessor Sikka, can use the “Good Reason"" clause to terminate his employment agreement with Infosys, and still be eligible for severance payouts, if Infosys appoints an executive chairman.
Nilekani taking a step back easily counts as one of the most significant developments over the past three months at Infosys. To be sure, though, it does not mean that he plans to leave anytime soon and he continues to be active on board-level matters, according to the three people, who added that he will continue as chairman at least until March 2019. 
The people highlighted the three priorities on Nilekani’s agenda. First, to further reconstitute the current board and appoint new members; second, to find a long-term successor to head the board; and finally, to ensure harmony between all key stakeholders, including the promoters and the board. 
“For Nandan, it’s very important to ensure that the mistakes of the previous succession are not repeated. When Sikka took over as CEO in 2014 and all the founders left at one go, it left a huge vacuum on the board. Those gaps were never really filled and the company suffered as a result,"" said the first of the people cited earlier.
Nilekani declined to comment for this story, when Mint approached him for an interview. Infosys declined to comment as well.

Parekh, and his team of other senior management, will apprise analysts over the company’s strategy over half-a-day on 23 April in Mumbai, according to two executives familiar with the development.
“(The management) will give the headlines of the strategy on Friday and will spell the details only on 23rd when it holds the analyst day,"" said the first executive.
Rather than making significant changes, Infosys will make a few tweaks to its current “renew and new"" approach, as part of which the firm is looking to use newer technologies to run its current business better and also offer newer solutions using technologies such as artificial intelligence and automation tools, according to the second executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Infosys is also expected to update on its ongoing plans to hire more locals in the US, as part of previous CEO Vishal Sikka’s plan to hire 10,000 Americans by 2019, in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s protectionist policies.
“We believe that Infosys could save most of the key strategy messages for its Analyst Day on April 23,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 11 April. “Comments thus far suggest more tweaks to its existing strategy than substantial changes. Moreover, given our view of no major strategic shifts, we do not envision major changes in terms of FY2019 guidance. Absent any significant change in direction, we think the stock will likely be range-bound over the near term.""
However, analysts expect clarity on how the company is looking to fill in some of the top-level positions—which are vacant after a string of senior management exits over the past 12 months—as well as details on mergers and acquisitions and the $500-million Infosys Innovation Fund and the road map for the company’s products and platforms (Edgeverve) business. 
Significantly, in the past, when Infosys was run by its founders, the company used to host an analyst day annually—a practice that got diluted when the first non-founder CEO Sikka took over in 2014. 
During Sikka’s three years, the management had one such analyst day event in Pune in 2016.
With Nandan Nilekani now back as non-executive chairman, Infosys’s decision to host an analyst day appears to be a throwback to the past. “This (having an analyst day) has not been the convention with Indian firms but the goal appears to improve dialogue and transparency,"" said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm.

401,2018-04-14,Infosys,"Infosys lowered its operating margin band to 22-24% for FY19 after net profit declined 28.2% to $571 million in Q4 FY18 from $796 million in Q3 FY18

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd on Friday posted lukewarm Q4 results that were in line with Street expectations, but the company’s decision to lower its operating margin band to 22-24% for 2018-19 disappointed investors and suggested that India’s second largest software services exporter continued to struggle to get more yield from its traditional outsourcing business, where profitability is dwindling. 
Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd on Friday posted lukewarm Q4 results that were in line with Street expectations, but the company’s decision to lower its operating margin band to 22-24% for 2018-19 disappointed investors and suggested that India’s second largest software services exporter continued to struggle to get more yield from its traditional outsourcing business, where profitability is dwindling.
Worryingly for investors, both growth and profitability of Infosys in 2017-18 was lower than what it managed in 2016-17, underlining that earlier CEO Vishal Sikka’s resignation in August—after a year-long feud with founder N.R. Narayana Murthy—served as a distraction and hurt the company’s performance.
Besides profitability, the lower margin guidance for FY19 and the relatively soft revenue forecast did not go down well with investors on Friday. In pre-market trading on the Nasdaq, Infosys shares were trading down nearly 7% at $16.8 a share.
In the January-March period, Infosys reported a 1.8% sequential rise in dollar revenue to $2.8 billion, allowing it to end fiscal year 2017-18 with $10.94 billion in revenue, a 7.2% year-on-year growth, and 24.3% operating margin. In constant currency terms, Infosys managed a 5.8% growth, which was lower than industry body Nasscom’s estimate of 7.8% growth last year.
Infosys had reported a 7.4% dollar revenue growth (8.3% in constant currency terms) and a 24.7% operating margin in 2016-17.
In 2018-19, Infosys expects to grow 6-8% in constant currency terms and expects a 7-9% dollar revenue growth at an operating margin of 22-24%.
Net profit declined 28.2% to $571 million in the March quarter, from $796 million in October-December as the Bengaluru-based company booked a $225 million gain on reversal of income tax expenses in the US. 
A Bloomberg survey of 26 analysts had forecast Infosys to report revenue of $2.79 billion, or Rs18,116 crore, in the quarter. The analysts estimated the company to report a net profit of $569.89 million, or Rs3,702 crore, in the period.
The Infosys management put up a brave face.
“In Q4, we had strong revenue growth. I’m happy with our performance,"" said CEO Salil Parekh in a post-earnings conference. “In terms of our guidance (for 2018-19), given the external factors and the internal factors, we’ve come out with the (6-8% constant currency) guidance. It’s a fairly stable, good outlook for the market that we see today.""
Some analysts believe that Infosys’s decision to lower its profitability may not cheer the market in the short term but helps the company in the long run as it allows it to win more business when commoditized projects are increasingly seeing pricing pressure.
“The markets are likely to view the lower margin guidance band negatively, in our opinion, given the current expectations and the likely impact on FY19 earnings growth,"" Diviya Nagarajan, an analyst at UBS Securities, wrote in a note after the company declared its results. “We view this as a longer-term positive as it should allow the company to focus on revenue and market share.""
Infosys shares were up 0.58% at Rs1,169 on the BSE at the close of trading on a day when the benchmark Sensex gained 0.27% to end at 34,192.65. The results were reported after market hours."
400,2018-04-14,Infosys,"That Infosys has decided to let go of acquisitions of Panaya and Skava is the clearest sign yet of the firm heralding in the era of new CEO Salil Parekh

Bengaluru: Nearly nine months after the departure of former chief executive officer (CEO) Vishal Sikka, India’s second largest software exporter Infosys Ltd has eviscerated the last remaining pieces of the former SAP executive’s legacy at the company and decided to start on a clean slate—the clearest sign yet of the company’s road map under the stewardship of non-executive chairman Nandan Nilekani and new CEO Salil Parekh. 
Bengaluru: Nearly nine months after the departure of former chief executive officer (CEO) Vishal Sikka, India’s second largest software exporter Infosys Ltd has eviscerated the last remaining pieces of the former SAP executive’s legacy at the company and decided to start on a clean slate—the clearest sign yet of the company’s road map under the stewardship of non-executive chairman Nandan Nilekani and new CEO Salil Parekh.
On Friday, Infosys effectively conceded that the large acquisitions that it undertook under Sikka had failed to bear fruit, with the company deciding to jettison two companies—Skava and the controversial Panaya—through a proposed sale, which many analysts interpreted as a fire sale of sorts.
Infosys bought the companies on Sikka’s watch. It spent $320 million on the two. Now, less than two years later, it has decided to sell them. More tellingly, Infosys has written down $90 million—nearly half the amount it spent buying Panaya.
“As part of our strategic review, we put together a set of criteria for our entire portfolio. When we looked at Skava and Panaya, they did not meet that criteria. We then decided to take the actions that we’ve taken,"" said Parekh.
“Both Skava and Panaya put together, the revenues from them are not material for us,"" said chief financial officer M.D. Ranganath during a post-earnings address.
The latest moves also mark a culmination of an earlier statement from Nilekani, shortly after he returned as chairman last year, when he indicated that Infosys would return to the basics of good execution and use the US more as a “listening post"" for the future, rather than as the centre of all its operations.
“We see the Palo Alto office as a listening post to the latest developments in tech happening in Silicon Valley, in machine learning, AI, deep learning, virtual reality, automated reality, self-driving cars,"" Nilekani had said.
Again, since Sikka’s departure in August, almost all the former SAP executives who joined Infosys have left Infosys.
Infosys also undertook a reshuffle of sorts of its board, with the company deciding to name Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw as its lead independent director, which, according to one executive, suggests that Infosys is looking at Shaw to lead the board whenever Nilekani decides to leave the company.
Infosys also dissolved the three-member finance and investment committee at the board, which was made to oversee the investments and acquisitions by the firm during Sikka’s stint.
Despite the concession that its most recent acquisitions have failed to work out, a calm and confident Parekh indicated that he is not playing conservative, as Infosys surprised the market by announcing that it had agreed to buy WongDoody Holding Co. Inc., a US-based digital creative and consumer insights agency, for $75 million.
In more ways than one, Parekh and Nilekani have also reversed some of the earlier management’s decisions. Three years back, Sikka outlined his aspirational target to make Infosys a $20 billion company with 30% profitability by 2021. Infosys has now lowered its operating margin band for 2018-19 to 22-24%.
ALSO READ: Infosys results meet estimates but outlook worries investors
A positive fallout from this development is that Infosys can chase more business and grow revenue as commoditized outsourcing deals see intense pricing pressure, and at the same time, it has more money to give to its employees. 
For this reason, many analysts and observers said that, effectively, Infosys addressed all three constituencies of employees, shareholders and promoters.
Infosys is also set to return $2 billion to shareholders in dividends and share buyback in 2018-19.
Some of the concerns of Infosys founders, led by N.R.Narayana Murthy, have also been effectively addressed, with Infosys’s decision to sell both Panaya and Skava.
“Almost three years after acquiring Skava, Infosys’s share of the retail and CPG (consumer, packaged goods) vertical remains relatively flat, around 14% of total revenue. This trend highlights Infosys’s struggle to improve vertical performance by developing and customizing industry-specific platform IP (intellectual property),"" Bozhidar Hristov, an analyst at US-based research firm TBRI, said in a statement.
Of all its acquisitions, Infosys’s decision to buy Panaya was the most controversial, with a few employees and some founders, including N.R. Narayana Murthy, questioning the rationale behind buying the Israeli firm.
Infosys’s then chief financial officer, Rajiv Bansal, expressed his reservations and even walked out of a board meeting when board members were asked to approve a proposal to buy Panaya in February 2015. Later, Infosys’s decision to make an unexplained and generous severance payment to Bansal led to a few shareholders, including Murthy, repeatedly raising the issue. Sikka, then CEO, strongly denied all allegations of skulduggery and corporate greed but eventually called these charges “sickening"" and resigned on 18 August."
397,2018-04-14,Infosys,"A subdued FY19 outlook and Infosys's decision to sell Panaya and Skava have irked investors, even as the Q4 results upset the calm that came with CEO Salil Parekh's appointment

Infosys Ltd’s leadership transition was supposed to have gone smoothly. The company’s new board, led by Nandan Nilekani, had moved swiftly in calming investors’ various concerns about Vishal Sikka’s abrupt exit, and even found a replacement in quick time. 
Infosys Ltd’s leadership transition was supposed to have gone smoothly. The company’s new board, led by Nandan Nilekani, had moved swiftly in calming investors’ various concerns about Vishal Sikka’s abrupt exit, and even found a replacement in quick time.
Infosys’s Q4 results announcement and guidance for fiscal year 2018-19 (FY19) has upset the calm. The first jolt for investors was the company’s statement that it expects operating profit margin to decline from 24.3% in FY18 to between 22% and 24% in FY19. The new Infosys CEO Salil Parekh, evidently thinks that the company needs to increase investments to pursue growth. The second decision that irked investors was the firm’s plans to sell Panaya and Skava, companies that were acquired by Sikka to enhance the company’s digital capabilities.
Since digital services are still a high priority for Parekh, the decision to sell Panaya and Skava is intriguing. Perhaps, this is being done with a view to get rid of past baggage—there had been allegations that not all was what it seemed when these companies had been acquired. Whatever the reasons, the exit can hurt growth calculations, even if only marginally.
Investors are evidently worried. Infosys American Depository Receipts fell 8% in early trading in New York, although it must be noted ADR prices can be volatile.
Infosys said it expects revenues to grow 6-8% in FY16, a notch higher than the 5.8% it reported for FY18. “This would normally be seen as a conservative guidance; but given the low growth in recent quarters, we no longer see it as conservative,"" says an analyst at a multinational brokerage.
What’s more, while the company management had sounded gung-ho about demand from the mainstay banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector earlier this year, its comments were far more subdued this time around. It said on a call with analysts that demand within the BFSI was strong in certain pockets, but was offset by large banking clients in North America who were resorting to insourcing for some of their technology needs.
In the March quarter, revenues from the BFSI segment were more or less flat in constant currency terms, and growth in key geographies such as US and Europe was muted. Overall revenues grew just 0.6% sequentially.
Against this backdrop, it is clear Infosys shares had run far ahead of reality, with investors concluding that the company had moved past its messy leadership transition. Infosys shares had risen to almost Rs1,200, far ahead of levels ahead of Sikka’s exit. That conclusion is now in question."

395,2018-04-16,Infosys,"Core IT servicesbusiness seen falling apart as outsourcing firms Infosys, Wipro and TCS struggle to earn more from new solutions

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd lowering its profitability outlook for the current financial year is a sign of worry for all companies, according to analysts and industry executives, who say that the core services business is falling apart even as companies struggle to earn more from offering newer solutions. 
Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd lowering its profitability outlook for the current financial year is a sign of worry for all companies, according to analysts and industry executives, who say that the core services business is falling apart even as companies struggle to earn more from offering newer solutions.
 Despite a favourable rupee-dollar movement and companies adding fewer employees, India’s three largest information technology (IT) firms, including Infosys Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Wipro Ltd, have seen their profitability decline in the past five years.
Worryingly for investors, many believe that both TCS and Wipro could lower their profitability outlook for the current financial year.
TCS declares its earnings on 19 April, while Wipro reports its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on 25 April. 
“…(W)e do not think FY19 is a one-time event and represents a new normal,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 11 April. “Our read through is that margins will likely be under pressure for the IT services sector broadly, and is also evidenced by ACN’s (Accenture) margin performance/guidance in the February quarter.""
On Friday, Infosys, while declaring lukewarm full-year results, lowered its profitability outlook to 22-24% for 2018-19, as against 24-26% two years back.
Last month, Accenture Plc, while declaring its second-quarter earnings, reported an operating margin of 13.4%, narrowing 30 basis points from the year-ago period.
Three reasons explain this continued pressure on profitability.
Firstly, all IT outsourcing firms have seen an increase in wage bill on account of hiring locals in overseas markets, including the US and Europe.
Secondly, companies increasing the pace of acquiring companies focused on newer technologies means their overall profitability will remain challenged. A case in point is Wipro, which saw its operating margin fall by over 200 basis points after the company spent over $1 billion in buying five companies between April 2016 and December 2017.
Finally, intense pricing pressure on commoditized deals, which still account for over three-fourths of total revenues at these companies, is another reason. Digital, the fuzzy umbrella term, which each company uses to call revenue generated from areas generally classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud computing and Internet of Things, still brings less than one-fourth of overall business.
“It is an absolutely cut-throat environment out there… Despite all companies offering digital technologies, the fact remains that 75-80% of business is still traditional work. All rebids are seeing up to 20% discounts being offered by IT vendors. So, even if you add digital on top of this, traditional or overall business is hardly growing and so profitability will remain under pressure,"" said an Wipro executive on the condition of anonymity.
Still, executives at IT firms say that it will be foolhardy to write off the sector.
“There are not many industries that can claim of having 22-23% profitability. So why should IT outsourcing be an exception? But for sure, a new normal is being scripted when most companies will see at least a 200-300 basis points decline in profitability in the next two-three years,"" said an executive at TCS. 
Infosys’s operating margin dropped to 24.7% at the end of March 2018 as against 26.3% at the end of March 2013. 
This despite a 18% favourable movement in currency (INR/USD was 54.54 for the year ended March 2013 as against 64.46 in the year ended March 2018.
“We believe INFY (Infosys) will have a very difficult time growing its operating margins over the next few years, given increased onsite mix from digital penetration as well as limited incremental utilization expansion. We are forecasting FY2018 margins of 23.2%,"" BMO analyst Bachman wrote in his note."

MUMBAI :
Mumbai: The BSE Sensex managed to close in the positive zone for the eighth straight session on Monday by climbing some 113 points following a slew of positive economic data that revived overall investors’ sentiment despite mixed global cues. The flagship Sensex during the session swung both ways—nearly 408 points—on hectic selling and buying activity by participants.

Shares of Infosys ended 3% lower on Monday after losing 6% during the day as analysts remained worried about the IT major’s weakening margin outlook for financial year 2019. Infosys closed at Rs1,132.80, down 36.2 or 3.10% on the BSE.  
Shares of Infosys ended 3% lower on Monday after losing 6% during the day as analysts remained worried about the IT major’s weakening margin outlook for financial year 2019. Infosys closed at Rs1,132.80, down 36.2 or 3.10% on the BSE. 
According to Nomura, despite a margin beat in the March quarter, the bigger disappointment was that FY19 EBIT margin guidance was slashed by 100 basis points (bps) to 22-24%. The Japanese brokerage firm said the results and outlook indicate that FY19 is not likely to see a material acceleration, traditional levers are being exhausted and the company needs to realign onsite staffing in light of US immigration tightening, which will put pressure on margins. Nomura has a ‘reduce’ rating on the stock with target price 14% below consensus, on 5% lower earnings per share (EPS) estimates and higher pessimism on multiples to reflect higher uncertainty and possible growth and margin risks.
“We believe the $2 billion additional return of capital in FY19 will cushion an otherwise tepid earnings growth even as buyback cannot happen before December 2018. We believe street estimates are at risk, as they build in material growth acceleration and flat-to-improving margins,"" it said in a note on 16 April. 
Jefferies India Pvt Ltd agreed that the cut in margin guidance was the key disappointment even as Q4 performance and FY19 revenue growth guidance of 6-8% were in line with expectations. “We revise our estimates to build in 7.5-9% constant currency growth over FY19-21 and 23.5-23.8% EBIT margin. The stock is currently trading at 16.5/15 times FY19/20E price to earnings and at a 20% discount to TCS even as underperformance relative to it has narrowed, making risk-reward favourable in our view,"" it said in a note on 16 April. 
Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd said continued sluggishness in US BFS markets, modest FY18 growth of 5.8% in constant currency terms, soft Q4FY18 exit growth of 0.6%, weak deal total contract values (down 12%) and decline of 1.5% in top 10 clients in FY18 indicate that Infosys would achieve growth closer to the lower end of its guidance range of 6-8%. 
“Weak profitability guidance for investment in sales revamp, reskilling of employees and building of Digital capabilities suggest new CEO’s lower confidence in the current capabilities of the company,"" said Emkay in a note on 13 April. 
Emkay has a ‘reduce’ rating on the stock and believes that frequent leadership changes and conservative investments in future technologies have impacted the business momentum. 
According to Elara Securities (India) Pvt Ltd the decision to divest Panaya and Skava suggests that the commitment to platforms strategy, pursued under former CEO Vishal Sikka, is wavering and is concerned that this undermines the credibility of offering any platforms to clients in future. 
However, Infosys has the most ‘buy’ ratings among all technology major stocks such as TCS, Wipro and HCL Technologies. According to Bloomberg data, Infosys has 40 ‘buy’ ratings, 7 ‘hold’ and 6 ‘sell’. In contrast, TCS has 15 ‘buy’ ratings, Wipro has 7 and HCL Tech 32. TCS will announce its March quarter results on 19 April."
391,2018-04-18,Infosys,"New CEO Salil Parekh says Infosys has to sacrifice profit margins now by investing in advanced technology and skills in order to capture the opportunities of the ahead

Bengaluru: Salil Parekh didn’t get much time to settle in after taking over the helm of Infosys Ltd. 
Bengaluru: Salil Parekh didn’t get much time to settle in after taking over the helm of Infosys Ltd.
Since becoming chief executive officer in January, the 53-year-old has crisscrossed three continents to meet with customers and employees to get his hands around the challenges facing India’s iconic tech-services giant. He talked with 48 clients in his first three months—and he’s determined to see every single one face to face in the next two quarters.
He’s already making tough decisions. He says Infosys has to sacrifice profit margins now by investing in advanced technology and skills in order to capture the opportunities of the ahead. That includes pumping more money into technologies such as the Internet of Things, retraining employees, localizing its workforce in the US and building up the sales staff.
“To build the future Infosys, we have to make those investments now,"" says Parekh, perched on a couch in the office he clearly hasn’t used much. On his sparse desk are three photos of his family, a laptop and small statue of the elephant-head Ganesha, the god of new beginnings. “If we don’t do that now, the real concern is that we won’t be relevant to our clients in the future.""
It’s a message that may unsettle investors. On Monday, Infosys shares tumbled after the IT services giant said it expected operating margins to be 22% to 24%, lower than the previous year’s. The stock is trading at about the same level it did two years ago.
Parekh contends Infosys has a rare combination of skills and experience that will benefit the company in the years ahead. It’s been working with customers for decades and can use that understanding to help them navigate shifting technology trends, like cloud computing and artificial intelligence.
Infosys now reaps $2.8 billion in revenue from such digital services. But the potential market is $200 billion.
“We are best positioned to help clients navigate their journey into the future and take them to the next phase,"" says Parekh. “Our clients are pushing us because they know we have the capabilities.""
Parekh may also cut some big acquisitions, like he did in his previous job. He has already met with the M&A team and asked them to draw up a short list of possible targets that could help buttress its digital capabilities. He’s also on the lookout for “opportunistic things that we can do that will help accelerate our digital pace.""
In his first interview with international media, Parekh was engaging and a bit disarming. He explained he’s in the process of signing the lease on a house for his wife and youngest son to join him in Bengaluru from Mumbai, even as he sends another son off to college in the US.
“You miss them, you don’t stop thinking about them,"" he says, dressed in a blue shirt and striped tie, while his jacket is thrown over the back of a chair.
Through it all, his focus clearly is on urgent challenges at Infosys. Parekh is trying to get the company back to stable footing after the tumultuous tenure of his predecessor. Vishal Sikka arrived in 2014 as a well-respected executive from SAP SE, but quit in August after a clash with the company’s founders over strategy and compensation.
Parekh was a surprise choice as the new CEO. He was plucked from Capgemini SE over a field of sinternal candidates and former executives. He joined Capgemini in 2000 as part of an acquisition and then built its India business to the point it competed with Infosys and rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.
Parekh jokes about his management style—“What are my options? I’ll pick one""—but he quickly makes clear what he believes in is data.
“That’s the basis of all my decisions,"" he says, explaining he spends so much time talking to staff and customers because he doesn’t like “second-hand"" information. “I get into the details but I’m not a micro-manager.""
Infosys and TCS are pioneers in providing back-office support for the world’s largest corporations, but they’ve had to evolve to go beyond traditional low-margin, labour-intensive work. The country’s $167 billion IT services industry is investing in cloud computing and AI to jump-start growth, as clients from banking to retail turn to automation.
Spending on advanced technologies puts pressure on margins. Infosys and its peers are seeing hiring costs rise alongside immigration curbs by administration of Donald Trump. It also needs to install and train a vast workforce unaccustomed to digital services.
“Investments in digital capabilities through 2019 will likely delay margin expansion,"" said Anurag Rana, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.
Parekh says Infosys has to sharpen its recruiting in the US to better compete for top-notch employees. The company long depended on bringing in Indian staff on work visas, a practice on which the Trump Administration is cracking down.
Infosys has gotten more serious about hiring in the US In the fiscal year that ended in March, the company added 3,900 workers in the country, including 850 college graduates. It’s also building a 50-acre training centre in Indiana.
All that investment won’t get growth back to that of the boom years though. On Friday, Infosys forecast a 6 to 8% increase in revenue this year, a disappointment to many given the slide in margins.
Parekh says the forecast is simply realistic. He looked at what clients will do, the overall geography and how the business is doing internally—and can’t promise more.
For a photo shoot after the interview, Parekh is back to his most formal. He grabs his jacket, stops to exchange polite greetings with employees en route, and he walks into the verdant garden outside the C-suite offices. “Should I smile?,"" he says, squinting into the bright sunlight. “Oh, OK, no smile.""

390,2018-04-23,Infosys,"That TCS stock is trading at about 20 times FY20 estimates, compared to 13-17 times of Infosys and Wipro, is justifiable due to its relatively better results in the past

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) ended fiscal year 2018 (FY18) on a positive note, recording a sequential constant currency growth of 2% in the March quarter, higher than Street estimates of 1-1.5%. 
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) ended fiscal year 2018 (FY18) on a positive note, recording a sequential constant currency growth of 2% in the March quarter, higher than Street estimates of 1-1.5%.
The $100 million client segment has seen one addition and the other client buckets also saw noticeable additions. Cash conversion is strong. The contribution of digital business in the overall revenues continues to rise and operating margins have improved.
Further, the management is confident of carrying forward this positive momentum into FY19. It expects the margins to remain stable.
The company is seeing renewed traction in the UK and Europe. Industry-wise the management is confident about the retail business vertical gaining momentum in the rest of the fiscal year. Six industry verticals grew faster than the company average on a year-on-year scale.
The only business segment that is lagging is the banking and financial services (BFS) vertical, which generates almost one-third of TCS’s revenues. Commentary on this segment remains cautious.
In a post results conference, the management said it is incrementally turning confident about the BFS vertical, though revenues are yet to reflect this. Growth in this segment remained flat or expanded just 0.4% on a sequential basis in constant currency terms. More clarity is expected in the June quarterly results.
Traction in this segment may well be crucial for the earnings upgrades, a necessity for the next leg of growth in the stock.
After trailing the benchmark indices in 2017, TCS along with the other information technology stocks began gaining traction this year. As Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities points out, the gains are driven more by expansion in valuation multiples and sector rotation than a growth recovery, which was modest until now.
The TCS stock is trading at about 20 times FY20 estimates compared to Infosys Ltd’s and Wipro Ltd’s 13-17 times. The valuation premium is partly justifiable due to TCS’s relatively better performance in the past."
389,2018-04-23,Infosys,"TCS's stand brings back to focus the current conundrum of balancing growth and profit faced by India's IT industry, especially after Infosys lowered its profitability outlook in FY19 to improve growth

Mumbai/Bengaluru: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) believes that its half-a-century experience has made the management realize that sacrificing profitability is not enough to drive growth and contrary to popular belief, following this model can be counterproductive, as both margins and growth are intertwined. 
Mumbai/Bengaluru: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) believes that its half-a-century experience has made the management realize that sacrificing profitability is not enough to drive growth and contrary to popular belief, following this model can be counterproductive, as both margins and growth are intertwined.
Rather, India’s largest information technology (IT) services firm believes superior growth and profitability can be managed by having a stable senior management team, and managing operating costs deftly, which should more than offset expenses to build intellectual property (IP) software and tools needed by an IT firm’s customers.
“From our mentors, from Kohli (Faqir Chand Kohli) to Ramadorai (Subramaniam Ramadorai) and to Chandra (Natarajan Chandrasekaran), we have learnt that if we compromise margin to funnel growth, neither will happen,"" chief operating officer, N. Ganapathy Subramaniam said in an interview last week.
TCS’s comment is significant because it brings back to focus the current conundrum of balancing growth and profitability faced by India’s $167 billion information technology outsourcing industry, especially after the country’s second largest IT firm, Infosys Ltd, lowered its profitability outlook in the current financial year, as it hopes to improve growth.
“If you say, we drop margins because we want to invest in growth, our experience is that growth does not happen. Our experience is that you don’t compromise on either (margins or growth). We have a remarkable senior management team, and our ability to reskill our people on the agile framework, makes us confident that our Business 4.0 approach will help us set for the right growth and profitability,"" said Subramaniam. 
Earlier this month, Infosys said it expects operating margin to be between 22% and 24% and expects to grow its dollar revenue between 7-9% in 2018-19.
Infosys reported a 7.2% growth and an operating margin of 24.3% to end last year with $10.94 billion in revenue. TCS reported an 8.6% dollar revenue growth at an operating margin of 24.8% to end with $19.1 billion in revenue.
Infosys said the reason behind lowering of profitability is to plough back the savings to invest in digital technologies, the fuzzy umbrella term which each company uses to classify revenue generated from areas generally classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud computing and Internet of Things. Further, Infosys also expects savings to cover expenses related to hiring more locals in the US and to pay more to hire the brightest engineers.
TCS, which saw its operating margin narrow 90 basis points over the last year to 24.8%, remains confident that it will be able to retain its aspirational target of managing 26-28% operating margin in the current financial year.
“Are visa costs and other staffing costs increasing? Of course they are increasing for us (like for other IT firms) but our ability to balance these costs, like how to manage the staff costs, and at the same time, how we can increase our price points for digital services, is going to determine our margins overall,"" said Subramaniam.
“Remember, every single transaction or deal or project we undertake has to be in the right value,"" said Subramaniam.
Some analysts, for now, are not certain on the approach followed by either of the two companies.
“This shows that Infosys until now has not kept pace with investing in digital, say compared to TCS and other large companies, and now realises it needs to invest. But no easy answers for now and it remains to be seen who eventually succeeds,"" said the head of research at domestic brokerage, on the condition of anonymity."

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd needs to quickly win back the confidence of some of its largest foreign institutional investors (FII), who over the past 12 months have trimmed their holdings in India’s second largest information technology (IT) outsourcing company. 
Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd needs to quickly win back the confidence of some of its largest foreign institutional investors (FII), who over the past 12 months have trimmed their holdings in India’s second largest information technology (IT) outsourcing company.
At least three of the company’s long-standing foreign investors, including Oppenheimer Developing Market Fund, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and Government of Singapore, have pared their holdings, even as FII holding in Infosys dropped to 35.24% at the end of March 2018 as against 38.31% at the end of March 2017, according to the company’s shareholding pattern.
Oppenheimer Developing Market Fund, which in February last year backed earlier CEO Vishal Sikka in a feud with promoter N.R. Narayana Murthy, now holds less than 1% in the company, the lowest it has held in Infosys. Both Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Government of Singapore have cut their holding in Infosys, the lowest in more than a decade (see chart). 
FII holding in a company is an important barometer of a company’s performance and their decision to either buy or sell a stock often influences retail or small shareholders, according to equity analysts. 
FIIs reducing Infosys stake is in contrast with a surge in share price and market capitalization of larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. TCS shares have gained 40% in the period between 1 April 2017 and 20 April 2018 even as its market capitalization rose 33% to $98.53 billion. Infosys shareholders made a 16% return even as the company’s market capitalization increased 7.5% to $38.9 billion during this period. 
At Infosys, FII selling has come at a time when domestic mutual funds have increased their holding to 10.6% at the end of the latest quarter from 8.33% at the end of March last year. Still, Infosys shares have lagged TCS, and even BSE-IT and BSE Sensex have gained more than Infosys. 
Mint could not independently ascertain the reason behind these three FIIs cutting their holdings in Infosys, which since August has held at least half-a-dozen investor meetings in India, Singapore, Hong Kong and the US.
The latest such meeting was in Mumbai on Thursday, where Infosys chief executive officer Salil Parekh and chief financial officer M.D. Ranganath met investors.
A year-long feud at Infosys did distract the firm previously, impacting company’s revenue growth and profitability last year. Infosys managed to grow its dollar revenue by 7.2% at operating margin of 24.3% to end with $10.94 billion in 2017-18, lower than the 7.4% dollar revenue growth and a 24.7% operating margin reported in 2016-17. Both Sikka and non-executive chairman R. Seshasayee left Infosys in August last year, which according to two executives, is one reason behind some FIIs paring their holdings.

383,2018-04-24,Infosys,"Infosys' Salil Parekh said digital services such as cloud, big data and analytics are a massive opportunity

Mumbai: Infosys Ltd, India’s second-biggest IT firm, plans to renew its focus on digital services as it looks to boost growth amid shrinking profit margins in its legacy business and rising competition from local and international rivals. 
Mumbai: Infosys Ltd, India’s second-biggest IT firm, plans to renew its focus on digital services as it looks to boost growth amid shrinking profit margins in its legacy business and rising competition from local and international rivals.
Digital services—such as cloud, big data and analytics which accounted for more than a quarter of Infosys’ revenue in year to March 2018—are a massive opportunity, Chief Executive Salil Parekh said on Monday at the company’s first analyst meeting in nearly two years.
“The idea is—this is a huge market, how can we be more relevant for our clients’ future through this market,"" Parekh said.
India’s $154 billion software services industry, led by Tata Consultancy Services and No. 2 Infosys, is facing a margin squeeze in its legacy business such as routine infrastructure maintenance as clients increasingly demand more work for less money.
Digital services are the new, big long-term opportunity for most Indian IT firms as they help Western clients transform traditional businesses and prevent them from getting disrupted by tech-savvy and agile start-ups.
Infosys, earlier this month, reported a rise in profit and forecast healthy revenue growth for the year, but its outlook on profit margins failed to cheer investors.
On Monday, Parekh said Infosys had set a three-year roadmap. “The first year in fiscal 2019 to stabilize where we are, the second year to start to build momentum and (the) third year to start to accelerate where we can have more and more share of our clients’ relevance and that will obviously translate, overall, to a better Infosys,"" he said.

Bengaluru: In his first formal address to investors as CEO of Infosys Ltd, Salil S. Parekh pledged to stabilize and turn around the fortunes of India’s second largest information technology services company in three years. 
Bengaluru: In his first formal address to investors as CEO of Infosys Ltd, Salil S. Parekh pledged to stabilize and turn around the fortunes of India’s second largest information technology services company in three years.
On Monday, Parekh presented a three-year roadmap to restore Infosys’s former position as the bellwether of India’s $167 billion IT industry, promising to make the company “more relevant"" to its top customers, who farm out hundreds of millions of dollars of business to it every year. In recent years, Infosys has ceded the bellwether tag to rivals such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and US-based Cognizant Technology Solutions, which have consistently outpaced the Bengaluru-based firm in terms of new business generated per year.
“Internally, we’ve set a three-year roadmap where we want to do all these changes in a step-by-step way. The first year in fiscal 2019 will be to stabilize where we are. The second year, we will start to build momentum. And the third year, to start to accelerate where we can have more and more share of our clients’ relevance. And that will translate overall to a better Infosys,"" Parekh told a gathering of analysts and investors in Mumbai.
Parekh and his senior management declined to clarify whether the three-year journey implied that Infosys will only start posting industry-matching growth from the third year. Analysts present on the call interpreted it as an admission that the company needs to stabilize first for the next two years. 
“Over the last 12-24 months, there has been a lot of change… For this reason, we have said FY19 will be year of stabilization, and all the investments we have spoken about, we expect to see momentum on this from FY20,"" Parekh told analysts. 
Infosys also shared some of its priorities as part of Parekh’s four-pillar strategy to revive Infosys. These include looking at a few markets, such as Nordics in Europe, Canada and Latin America, and building a team of leaders to help the firm bag so-called “mega IT outsourcing deals"" (larger than $500 million).
The address to investors on Monday also marked the return of analyst day at Infosys, as Mint had reported on 13 April.
According to experts and analysts tracking Infosys, Parekh’s three-year plan for Infosys sounds similar to the one that co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy highlighted in 2013, shortly after the board of Infosys asked him to return to the company and restore its former glory. Murthy returned to the former sector bellwether after it posted several quarters of poor numbers, missed its own revenue and profit forecasts and then ultimately stopped issuing quarterly revenue forecasts.
However, while Infosys did end up posting industry-matching growth rates of 11.5% under Murthy’s watch in fiscal 2014, an encore seems unlikely with its current revenue growth forecast of 7-9%—effectively dashing any hopes of it matching arch-rival TCS’s double-digit revenue growth forecast for 2018-19.
Parekh’s statement also comes weeks after Infosys signalled its intentions to make a fresh start under the new CEO by effectively jettisoning the legacy of previous CEO Vishal Sikka and announcing the sale of Panaya and Skava—two of the company’s most expensive acquisitions in recent years.
“We will look selectively at programmatic inorganic moves and our M&A team has started to identify some opportunities. Those will map into the future we’re looking to build for our clients. For example, the acquisition we did last week—WONGDOODY. That’s the sort of acquisition that we will look to make across our portfolio,"" said Parekh."
387,2018-04-24,Infosys,"TCS stock now trades at 22.94 times one-year forward price-to-earnings while Infosys trades at 17.16 times of one-year PE

Mumbai/Bengaluru: Even as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) touched a $100 billion market cap milestone on Monday, more analysts are advising investors to sell its shares compared with Infosys Ltd. 
Mumbai/Bengaluru: Even as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) touched a $100 billion market cap milestone on Monday, more analysts are advising investors to sell its shares compared with Infosys Ltd.
According to Bloomberg, out of 50 analysts tracking TCS, eight have sell ratings while Infosys has six out of 52 analysts. TCS has 19 “buy"" and 23 “hold"" rating while Infosys has 37 “buy"" and six “hold"" ratings. 
Analysts are cautious about TCS’s steep valuations and pressure on profitability even though the company’s management has retained its aspirational profit margins guidance of 26-28% in the current financial year. 
TCS ended with 25.8% operating margin in the year ended March 2018. 
The TCS stock now trades at 22.94 times one-year forward price-earnings while Infosys trades at 17.16 times of one-year PE. 
On Monday, TCS also overtook outsourcing and consultancy giant Accenture Plc which has a market cap of $98.20 billion. However, Accenture ended fiscal 2018 with revenues of $34.90 billion, far higher than TCS’s annual revenue of $19.1 billion.
Shares of TCS have surged over 30% so far this year, gaining nearly 8% in the last two trading sessions alone after its earnings announcement. The BSE IT index is up 20% in 2018 so far.
On Thursday, TCS said its dollar revenue increased 3.9% (2% in constant currency terms) to $4.97 billion in the quarter. Net profit improved 5.7% to $1.07 billion in the March quarter from $1.01 billion in the preceding three months while operating margin improved 20 basis points to 25.4% from 25.2% in the October-December period.
Nomura finds valuations of TCS to be expensive at 20 times projected fiscal 2020 earnings and sees risk to street expectations of double-digit constant currency revenue growth and flattish margin. The brokerage firm has a cautious stance on the stock due to sluggishness in large segments, margin pressures and expensive valuations.
TCS large segment US and BFSI remained weak and Nomura expects that it is likely to grow at low-to mid-single digits year on year with clarity on BFSI still a quarter away amid risks from insourcing at a large US bank.
Kotak Institutional Equities said on 20 April, that the stock trades at 19 times fiscal year 2020 estimates earnings. “To put valuations in context, TCS requires incremental revenue addition of $2.1 billion per year in FY2019 estimates and about 11% CAGR in incremental revenues over the next 7 years to justify the price"", the report added.
On 13 April, Infosys reported a 1.8% sequential rise in dollar revenue to $2.8 billion, allowing it to end 2017-18 with $10.94 billion in revenue, a 7.2% year-on-year growth, and 24.3% operating margin. In constant currency terms, it managed a 5.8% growth, which was lower than industry body Nasscom’s estimate of 7.8% growth last year.
According to PhillipCapital, Infosys reported decent earnings. Its revenue growth and total contract value were encouraging even as it reported weak margin outlook. The firm is positive on Infosys, on the back of improving business metrics and the significant valuation gap versus TCS.
“Assuming Infosys achieves mid-point of its guidance, it will report CC organic growth similar to TCS. Despite that, the stock trades at 14x FY20 – a significant discount to TCS (19x). We expect the valuation gap to narrow over the next two years, with a smooth management transition and dealflow boosting growth for Infosys"", Phillip Capital said in a note to its investors."
382,2018-05-03,Infosys,"It's a crucial time for Infosys and its new chief executive Salil Parekh. How much he can deliver will determine whether Infosys will continue to be a force to reckon with or become an also-ran

On 23 April, Infosys Ltd’s chief executive officer (CEO) Salil Parekh told investors the company needed some time to recover from the chaos it was thrown into after former chief executive Vishal Sikka quit in August last year, amid an ugly spat with founder shareholders. 
On 23 April, Infosys Ltd’s chief executive officer (CEO) Salil Parekh told investors the company needed some time to recover from the chaos it was thrown into after former chief executive Vishal Sikka quit in August last year, amid an ugly spat with founder shareholders.
Parekh sought three years to restore Infosys’s former position as the bellwether of India’s $167 billion technology industry, dashing hopes of a quicker turnaround among analysts and investors gathered at Taj Land’s End hotel in Mumbai to hear the new CEO outline his strategy.
To the 40-odd people who were present at the meeting and hundreds of others who had logged on to a webcast of the event, Parekh said a return to faster growth will take until at least 2021.
Over the past few years, Infosys, which ended fiscal 2018 with $10.94 billion in revenue, has been steadily falling behind bigger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS).
With Mumbai-based TCS’s revenue at $19.1 billion in the same period (see table 1), the gap between the two firms has widened to $8.15 billion. That will only widen further in the coming months, with TCS expected to clock a double-digit growth in the current financial year and Infosys expected to grow its dollar revenue between 7% and 9%
For this reason, many believe Infosys under co-founder and non-executive chairman Nandan Nilekani and Parekh have one last chance to salvage brand Infosys and put the firm back on the global software map before it is relegated as an also-ran IT services firm. Can Parekh and Nilekani deliver?
“Internally, we’ve set a three-year road map where we want to do all these changes in a step-by-step way. The first year in fiscal 2019 will be to stabilize where we are. The second year, we will start to build momentum. And the third year, start to accelerate where we can have more and more share of our clients’ relevance. And that will translate overall to a better Infosys,"" Parekh told a gathering of analysts and investors.
Parekh and his senior management declined to clarify whether the three-year journey implied that Infosys will only start posting industry-matching growth from the third year. Analysts present on the call interpreted it as an admission that the company needs to stabilize first for the next two years.
“Over the past 12-24 months, there has been a lot of change… For this reason, we have said FY19 will be year of stabilization, and all the investments we have spoken about, we expect to see momentum on this from FY20,"" Parekh told analysts.
“I agree that this is the last chance for us because we cannot again have another change at the top… we need stability,"" said a senior executive at Infosys on condition of anonymity. “All of us recognize this and if you read the management’s commentary, our strategy is not significantly different.""
“We believe the most distinct change in INFY’s strategy is moving away from software and focusing on digital services,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 23 April.
“In some respects, we think INFY strategy discussed at the analyst event is replicating the strategies of competitors. We think improvement in revenue trajectory will take some time, if it materializes. We forecast less than 7% y/y CC (constant currency) growth in both FY19 and FY20. Despite incremental investments, we could envision scenarios in which the current revenue trajectory is the new normal, meaning new revenue sources are offset by weakness in legacy areas.""
Infosys’s cautious approach is understandable. It reported a 7.2% dollar revenue growth and an operating margin of 24.3% in the year ended 31 March. In comparison, TCS reported an 8.6% dollar revenue growth at an operating margin of 24.8%.
But for much of the previous fiscal year, Infosys appeared to be relatively better placed than TCS. Clients were trusting Infosys, as reflected by the 7.4% dollar revenue growth in the year to March 2017. This was higher than the 6.2% dollar revenue growth reported by TCS.
Employee morale was still unscathed by the constant bickering between founder N.R. Narayana Murthy and Sikka.
In February last year, TCS decided to elevate chief financial officer Rajesh Gopinathan as chief executive officer, replacing N. Chandrasekaran, who was appointed chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, the group holding company. This development then made some analysts uneasy, with a few of them even wondering whether TCS’s growth will slow further. Already, dollar revenue growth at TCS had fallen from 15% in 2015 to 6.2% even as Infosys managed to accelerate its growth from 5% to 7.4% during that time.
Still, in what can be termed as the biggest reversal of fortune at corporate India last year, TCS ended last year by adding $1.5 billion in incremental revenue, more than twice the $741 million added by Infosys.
Unsurprisingly, TCS now comes across as a more confident and better-run unit than its smaller peer Infosys.
Sample this: in the first week of March, about 700 of the senior-most executives of TCS got together at Novotel Hyderabad to brainstorm about business. Over two days, the senior management, led by chief executive Gopinathan, held multiple discussions, strategizing how to better win large mega deals (IT contracts greater than $500 million in value).
“Billion is the new million,"" Gopinathan remarked in one his many interactions with his senior team, according to an executive who was briefed by the CEO.
This statement was in reference to company’s three large deal wins, including two more than $2 billion, multi-year outsourcing contracts from television ratings measurement firm Nielsen and Transamerica Life Insurance Co., a unit of Dutch insurer Aegon NV. 
“The statement was also to get the senior leaders to get more such large deals as only large deals can move the needle,"" said the executive cited above.
So, how does TCS manage to win large, mega IT outsourcing deals even as others struggle? 
“The top teams meet once in every 40 days, where we share and see how we can make each of these smaller deals bigger and where is the opportunity. Because we have a visionary management team, almost all of them who have stayed with the company, these people know what our customers want, and we are able to scale up larger deals,"" TCS’s chief operating officer N. Ganapathy Subramaniam said in an interview last month.
In the January-March quarter, TCS claims to have won more than 450 small digital deals with a combined value of more than $1 billion, according to Subramaniam. TCS’s deal wins in digital—the fuzzy umbrella term that each company uses to classify revenue generated from areas generally classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud computing and Internet of Things—is higher than the $905 million worth of total deal wins, including re-bids and new wins, by Infosys in the fourth quarter.
At Infosys, Parekh and Nilekani have three challenges that need to be addressed swiftly. 
Firstly, Infosys needs to retain the trust of its employees. Last year, Infosys’s attrition rate was 20%, as against 11% at TCS. Put simply, this means one in five employees left Infosys last year.
Secondly, Parekh needs to quickly see that the business gets stabilized and the company does not lose customers.
For now, Infosys continues to get more business from its largest 10 clients, as business from this segment grew faster than the company’s overall growth of 7.2%.
However, 10 months after Sikka’s resignation, one big challenge faced by Infosys is retaining some of its smaller but marque clients.
One of them is PepsiCo, which first outsourced application development and maintenance work to Infosys in 2004.
Earlier this year, Pepsi decided to streamline the number of IT vendors it does business with, and consequently, Infosys lost at least $20 million in business, according to two executives in the know.
“PepsiCo’s IT application maintenance work has been handled by third-party vendors across many regions for some time,"" a spokesperson for PepsiCo said in a statement in response to Mint’s questionnaire. “In an effort to improve effectiveness, we have decided to consolidate application maintenance work with TCS in India. This move will not impact PepsiCo associates in the US.""
Infosys has seen a loss of at least $30 million in 2017-18, compared with last year, hurt by less business from three other customers, including Kraft Heinz Co., Mondelez International Inc. and Procter and Gamble, according to three other executives familiar with the development.
Infosys declined to comment if the company had seen loss in business from the four customers mentioned.
In stark contrast, TCS has continued to win not just larger clients but even retain and win smaller marque customers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Rolls Royce Group, and Marks and Spencer.
Finally, even as TCS’s market capitalization crossed $100 billion, Infosys faces the test of shareholder confidence as over the past 12 months, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have trimmed their holdings in India’s second largest IT outsourcing company.
At least three of the company’s long-standing foreign investors, including Oppenheimer Developing Market Fund, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and Government of Singapore, have pared their holdings, even as FII holding in Infosys dropped to 35.24% at the end of March 2018 as against 38.31% at the end of March 2017, according to the company’s shareholding pattern for the quarter ended March 2018.
“I think Infosys is at a crossroads, with some tough decisions to make,"" said Rod Bourgeois, founder and head of research at US-based DeepDive Equity Research LLC, adding that TCS’s recent contract signings strength reflects market-share gains rather than cyclical demand improvement. “An improving demand cycle would be icing on TCS’s already-good cake of FY19 revenue growth prospects,"" said Bourgeois.
Most worrying for Infosys’s investors is the management’s decision to lower the profitability outlook to 22-24% for 2018-19, as against 24-26% two years ago. Infosys said the reason behind the lowering of profitability is to plough back the savings to invest in digital technologies. 
Further, Infosys expects savings to cover costs related to hiring more locals in US and to pay more to hire the brightest engineers. Again, TCS outlined a positive outlook towards profitability, as the management said it expects to operate between 26% and 28% operating margin in the current fiscal.
“Infosys needs to get its new strategy working effectively to win over some concerned investors,"" said Phil Fersht, chief executive officer of US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing research firm. “The new focus on digital business models and moving away from products is the right direction for the firm—now they have a critical 12 months ahead to prove they can stick to this plan, make the right acquisitions, evolve their workforce and global presence. It’s no surprise that some investors are skittish after all the public nonsense last year and departure of Sikka."""
381,2018-05-06,Infosys,"For the first time, the Infosys board disclosed the parameters on which the company will give the variable pay to its CEO Salil Parekh

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd has signalled its intention to significantly increase its share of business from digital technologies, build a stable management team and ensure a higher return for its shareholders with the board linking chief executive officer (CEO) Salil Parekh’s annual compensation to the progress the firm makes in each of the three metrics. 
Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd has signalled its intention to significantly increase its share of business from digital technologies, build a stable management team and ensure a higher return for its shareholders with the board linking chief executive officer (CEO) Salil Parekh’s annual compensation to the progress the firm makes in each of the three metrics.
For the first time, the Infosys board disclosed the parameters on which the company will give the variable pay to Parekh. This, according to one proxy advisory firm, does assuage many of the shareholder’s concerns on CEO compensation. However, three executives—one Infosys employee and two executives from two executive search firms—said the company could do better by disclosing more details. 
Parekh, who took over on 2 January for a period of five years and was given a joining bonus of Rs9.75 crore, stands to earn up to Rs16.25 crore in cash every year, which includes a fixed salary of Rs6.5 crore and a variable pay of up to Rs9.75 crore. However, his compensation includes two additional components as well. These are an annual grant of Rs3.25 crore in stocks, a third of which will be vested every year over the next three years, and an annual performance equity grant of Rs13 crore that will be paid at the completion of three years.
“The number of shares that will vest shall be calculated upon the CEO’s successful completion of three full fiscal years with the company, concluding on 31 March 2021, and will be determined by company’s performance on total shareholder return, quality of revenue and organizational capability building, as determined by the board (or its committee) in its sole discretion for the three-year period,"" Infosys said in a filing to the exchanges on 4 May.
This decision by the Infosys board, led by co-founder and non-executive chairman Nandan Nilekani, is a marked departure from the earlier board’s decision to link former CEO Vishal Sikka’s $11 million compensation to Infosys’ progress to become a $20 billion firm with an operating margin of 30% and revenue per employee of $80,000 by March 2021.
In the past, many, including some founders of the company, believed the ambitious plan was merely a pipe dream, and the higher compensation was just one of the many areas of discontent between Sikka and some of the founders, which culminated with Sikka resigning in August.
“This is a fairly sensible cocktail of metrics and I believe Infosys has done a reasonably satisfactory job,"" said Amit Tandon, founder and managing director at Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS), a proxy advisory firm. “Most companies in the US work on the premise of total shareholder return. Again, chasing revenue for the sake of revenue may not be best approach and so it is heartening if the company is focusing on getting more business from non-legacy areas of work. But I can understand why the board is somewhat recalcitrant to share more granular details, especially where they are coming from,"" he said.
Still, Infosys’s non-disclosure on the weightage of each of the three parameters or if similar metrics will also be used for evaluating the performance-linked pay of other senior executives has at least three others executives, including two executives at the company, question if this is the best practice.
Infosys declined to offer a comment.
“These metrics are very vague where the board appears to have tried to address the concern but not taken the leap,"" said one executive. “The company (Infosys) has already outlined to share a large percentage of cash with shareholders under its capital allocation policy, so it is obvious that stock price will only improve. But we don’t know what the weightage of each of these components is,"" the executive said.
“We need greater clarity and just beyond these English words. A CEO’s job is to focus only on business metrics and so the focus has to be on revenue and profitability,"" said a second executive.
Infosys’ major rival, Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., discloses more details on the remuneration of senior management, including its CEO. 
Cognizant’s revenue growth has a 50% weightage in the variable pay compensation of senior executives.
The firm’s non-GAAP income from operations carries a 40% weightage and company’s days sales outstanding or the time taken by Cognizant to collect cash on the invoices has the remaining 10%."
380,2018-05-06,Infosys,"Since the start of the year until 12 April, TCS shares gained 16.2%, Infosys 11.8% and HCL 13.5%, while Wipro lost 8.5%

Mumbai/Bengaluru: A less-than bullish commentary by managements of Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, and fewer analyst recommendations for buying their shares, have made many wonder if the current financial year will be better for the industry than the last one.  
Mumbai/Bengaluru: A less-than bullish commentary by managements of Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, and fewer analyst recommendations for buying their shares, have made many wonder if the current financial year will be better for the industry than the last one. 
In January, executives at India’s largest information technology (IT) outsourcing companies had exuded optimism that 2018-19 was going to be a better year. Investors bought into the story as shares of the four largest IT companies outperformed the Sensex until 12 April.
Since the start of the year until 12 April, a day before Infosys declared earnings, TCS shares gained 16.2%, Infosys 11.8% and HCL 13.5%, while Wipro lost 8.5%. During this time, BSE Sensex hardly posted any return, gaining 0.13%. 
However, two months into the current financial year, it appears many of these companies are grappling with unique challenges and that all of them will struggle to improve the growth reported in the last two years.
India’s largest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services Ltd has bucked this trend so far. The Mumbai-based company has been an outlier—its management reaffirmed that it should clock double-digit growth in the current year, leading to more brokerages putting a buy recommendation on the shares after it declared earnings on 19 April.
But fewer analysts are now bullish on Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies (See adjoining table) after the companies declared earnings than at the start of the year.
“Save for TCS, the question to be asked to IT companies is, where is the recovery,"" said the former CEO of one the largest IT firms. “Certainly, the growth outlook is not much better than last year. Even the management commentary is not cheerful as it sounded in January. So, what has really changed in the last four months?""
Infosys reported a 7.2% dollar revenue growth at 24.3% operating margin in the year ended March 2018. For the current year, the company expects to grow its dollar revenue between 7% and 9%, but at a lower operating margins band of between 22% and 24%, prompting some analysts to change their bullish outlook. 
Ditto for Wipro and HCL. 
Two client-related bankruptcies and the company’s planned restructuring in the Middle East and India is taking longer than chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala had anticipated dashed any hopes that Wipro will turn the corner soon. 
Wipro does not give a full-year revenue guidance but expects quarterly revenue to be between a decline of 2% and growth of 0.2% in constant currency terms in the April-June period from the preceding quarter.
HCL Technologies, which reported a 12.4% growth last year, expects to grow its dollar revenue between 10.5% and 12.5% in the current fiscal. However, management expects more than half of this incremental growth to come from acquisitions and because of business brought from the company’s many intellectual property (IP) partnerships.
Worryingly for investors, all these companies are not struggling for revenue growth alone as a few analysts like Keith Bachman of BMO Capital Markets have expressed scepticism on the profitability outlook for them."
379,2018-05-11,Infosys,"More changes in Infosys board are not ruled out in the coming months, what with Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw's elevation as lead independent director and now Ravi Venkatesan's resignation

Bengaluru: Ravi Venkatesan, the former co-chairman of Infosys Ltd, resigned from the post of independent director at India’s second-largest IT outsourcing company, a move many observers said was part of co-founder Nandan Nilekani’s board reconstitution. 
Bengaluru: Ravi Venkatesan, the former co-chairman of Infosys Ltd, resigned from the post of independent director at India’s second-largest IT outsourcing company, a move many observers said was part of co-founder Nandan Nilekani’s board reconstitution.
Infosys, in a filing to the exchanges on Friday, said that Venkatesan, who joined the board in 2011, had decided to step down as the former head of Microsoft India wanted “to pursue an exciting new opportunity"".
Last month, Infosys elevated Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw as the lead independent director.
At least one proxy advisory firm believed that Venkatesan could have completed his current term—it was to end in April 2019—and that his resignation from the company reflects the board reconstitution, with more changes not ruled out in coming months.
“This is not surprising and was expected, especially since what happened in August last year,"" said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of investor proxy firm InGovern Research Services.
On 17 August, Infosys board blamed founder N.R. Narayana Murthy for his “continuous assault and misguided campaign"", and said this was the primary reason behind the abrupt exit of chief executive officer Vishal Sikka. As the company was thrown into chaos, Nilekani returned as non-executive chairman, even as three independent directors, including chairman R. Seshasayee, Jeffrey S. Lehman and John Etchemendy, resigned. Nilekani’s return also saw Venkatesan stepping down as co-chairman, less than five months after he was elevated to run the board along with former chairman Seshasayee, as the company sought to buy peace with the promoters.
The trouble between Venkatesan and Murthy became public, when Mint cited an email written by Murthy to some of his advisers, claiming that at least three independent directors, including Venkatesan, had told him that Sikka was more chief technology officer material than CEO material.
Venkatesan then said that his discussions with Murthy were part of “privileged conversations"" he had had with Murthy, even as both declined to comment on the email.
“I believe more changes at the board can be expected in the coming months as Infosys under Nilekani starts afresh,"" said InGovern’s Subramanian.
In the eighteen months to Sikka’s resignation in August last year, Murthy lambasted the board over issues related to corporate governance, an irregular and very generous severance package given to its former chief financial officer, and salaries of the CEO and chief operating officer.
“All these measures, including having CEO Salil Parekh to be based out Bengaluru, selling (acquisitions) Panaya and Skava, company having a services-led approach and the conservative revenue guidance (7-9% dollar revenue growth in this fiscal), appointment of Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw as lead independent director, and now Venkatesan’s resignation is a clear sign of the company going back to the promoter’s vision,"" said a former executive vice president of Infosys, on the condition of anonymity.
Venkatesan, in a statement sent along with Infosys’s filing to exchanges, said: “My seven years on the board have been exciting, rewarding and eventful. l feel fortunate to have been part of this extraordinary company at a seminal moment in its history and to have worked with so many fine colleagues on the Board and in management.""
Calls and text messages to Venkatesan seeking comment went unanswered.
Nilekani said, “I thank Ravi for his pivotal contributions to Infosys in a period of important transitions and towards a digital-first future. This passage is one that every entrepreneurial company faces eventually and I thank Ravi for his leadership in ensuring a successful transition."""
378,2018-05-16,Infosys,"Infosys says it has formed a blockchain-based trade finance network in partnership with 7 private-sector banks, to raise efficiency in the banking sector and strengthen its product offerings

Mumbai: India’s Infosys Ltd has formed a blockchain-based trade finance network with seven private-sector banks, to increase security and efficiency in the banking sector while also broadening its product offering. 
Mumbai: India’s Infosys Ltd has formed a blockchain-based trade finance network with seven private-sector banks, to increase security and efficiency in the banking sector while also broadening its product offering.
India’s second-biggest software services exporter, whose Finacle software powers the core functions of the majority of Indian lenders, is in talks to sign up more domestic and foreign banks to the network, senior company executives told Reuters on Wednesday. 
Blockchain technology allows all stages of transactions to be securely shared between network members, as opposed to each bank working independently which is more expensive and increases the chance of error.
Just days earlier, HSBC Holdings PLC said it had performed the world’s first trade finance transaction using a shared blockchain platform, in a push to boost efficiency in the multi-trillion-dollar trade finance segment.
Infosys is setting up its trade finance network in a banking sector rattled by an over $2 billion fraud at India’s second-biggest state-run lender, Punjab National Bank (PNB), allegedly by two jeweller groups with help from rogue bank staff.
The jewellers have been accused of raising credit from Indian banks’ overseas branches using fake trade finance guarantees provided by PNB staff in Mumbai who did not enter those guarantees in the bank’s computer system.
Infosys’ network will make transactions transparent for “the buyers, the sellers, the buyer’s bank, the seller’s bank and any regulator who is on this network,"" Rajashekara Maiya, Finacle global head of product strategy, said in a telephone interview.
“With that kind of a capability, the technology can avoid all the fraud that could have taken place in a situation like Punjab National Bank,"" he said.
In March, India’s central bank barred all lenders from issuing letters of undertaking – a form of credit guarantee at the heart of the PNB fraud.
Banks can continue issuing letters of credit and bank guarantees. The instruments are among the various forms of trade finance that importers use to fund overseas purchases.
Sanat Rao, chief business officer at Finacle, said lenders currently testing its trade finance network are ICICI Bank Ltd, Axis Bank Ltd, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, Yes Bank Ltd, IndusInd Bank Ltd, RBL Bank Ltd and South Indian Bank Ltd.
Rao said Infosys is also in talks with other Indian and overseas lenders.
“We’re in very advanced discussions in Australia with a consortium of banks and I think you’ll see more announcements,"" he said."
377,2018-05-22,Infosys,"Attempts to fully address concerns of activist shareholders may divert the time and attention of Infosys board and may impact share prices, the IT firm said in its Annual Report 2017-18

Bengaluru: A new chairman and a new chief executive officer at Infosys Ltd have led to a shift in the way the company perceives risks to its business. 
Bengaluru: A new chairman and a new chief executive officer at Infosys Ltd have led to a shift in the way the company perceives risks to its business.
Last year, Infosys told shareholders that activist shareholders were one of the challenges, as the company said: “Actions of activist shareholders may adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic priorities, and could impact the trading value of our securities.""
Now, Infosys, under new CEO Salil Parekh and non-executive chairman Nandan Nilekani, appears to have taken the responsibility, partially, on itself to face this challenge.
“Attempts to fully address concerns of activist shareholders may divert the time and attention of our management and board of directors and may impact the prices of our equity shares and ADSs (American depositary shares),"" Infosys said in its 2017-18 annual report.
Infosys calling out activist shareholders as a risk last year caused much consternation among its promoters after this paper reported that it was aimed at some of its founders, including N.R. Narayana Murthy, who had repeatedly questioned some of the decisions made by the board.
Then, Infosys denied that the insertion of this clause was aimed at any particular group of investors, with former chairman R. Seshasayee telling shareholders in the annual general meeting in June that “any inadvertent pain (to founders)"" was “sincerely regretted"".
But Seshasayee’s apology was too little, too late, as two months later in August, the 18-month-long feud between the then board and Murthy culminated with both CEO Vishal Sikka and Seshasayee stepping down. 
Understandably, at least one proxy advisory firm believes that Infosys’s new statement underlines a more pragmatic approach under Nilekani as Infosys looks to avoid any confrontation with any group of shareholders.
“Infosys believes it is vulnerable after the Cognizant episode (In November 2016, activist shareholder Elliott Management pushed Cognizant to get rid of what it felt was an “antiquated, growth-at-all-costs"" business model, and focus instead on total shareholder returns). It (Infosys) believes dealing with activist shareholders can take a lot of management bandwidth,"" said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of proxy advisory firm InGovern Research. “Last year, it appeared to be targeted at one specific group, the founders, while now the board has left it more generic and even admitted that it needs to work on it, which I believe is a more pragmatic approach. Also, unlike last year, the management and board are not at loggerheads with any group of shareholders""
For now, Infosys is the only large information technology (IT) outsourcing firm that cites engagement with activist shareholders as a risk factor.
Cognizant CEO Francisco D’Souza in an interview last year said that the management does not subscribe to the view that any of its shareholders are a risk and rather “shareholders are owners"" of the company."

New Delhi:The country’s second largest IT services firm Infosys on Wednesday said it has completed the acquisition of US-based WongDoody.

It added that the acquisition—which is in accordance with the terms set out in the agreement announced by the company in April—brings globally recognised creative talent and deep marketing and brand engagement expertise to Infosys. 
“Through this acquisition, Infosys enhances its digital experience services ecosystem with services ranging from strategy, design and user experience, to creative and digital marketing across the customer experience value chain,"" it said.

374,2018-06-06,Infosys,"In markets like Europe, Australia, New Zealand and US, the overall sentiment is to enhance more local jobs activities, says Infosys CEO Salil Parekh

New Delhi: Infosys Ltd on Wednesday said stricter work visa norms across various markets like the US and Australia will not “constrain"" its business growth as the IT firm is focussing on hiring locals and training workforce in these geographies. 
New Delhi: Infosys Ltd on Wednesday said stricter work visa norms across various markets like the US and Australia will not “constrain"" its business growth as the IT firm is focussing on hiring locals and training workforce in these geographies.
“I think, in general what we see in many of our markets—Europe, Australia, New Zealand, US market, independent from the current political situation—the overall sentiment is to enhance more local jobs activities,"" Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said at Morgan Stanley’s 20th Annual India Summit. 
Parekh was responding to a query on whether the software services major is concerned about measures being taken by various governments to tighten work visa norms. “....what we are building with this localisation approach is really gearing towards making sure that our business model evolves in the right way, without sacrificing the best elements of the business model for the future. So, I don’t think we see that this is going to constrain our business growth,"" he said. 
Over the past many months, there has been increased scrutiny over the temporary work visas in various countries like the US, Australia and Singapore. This has prompted many Indian IT companies to tweak their business models by reducing dependence on visas and hiring more people overseas, instead. 
Parekh explained that local hiring and training manpower is among the four pillars identified by the company to drive growth. The Bengaluru-based firm had last year announced that it will set up four technology and innovation hubs and hire about 10,000 locals in the US over two years. 
The chief executive said Infosys has already hired 4,000 people in the US and is also recruiting freshers from colleges. “We have had 800 college graduates... We have a plan that this will become close to 1,000 college graduates per year in the coming fiscal and the fiscal after that,"" he said, adding that these steps are also finding appreciation with state governments in the US. At the end of fiscal 2018, Infosys had 2.04 lakh employees. 
“We think the environment is such that if we do the things in the right way, this is going to be a further expanding business. So, we don’t see it as a constraint but the dynamic globally is different and the business model needs to evolve to adapt to it,"" he said. 
Parekh, who took over the top job at Infosys earlier this year, said the company is also investing in enhancing digital capabilities, infusing artificial intelligence and automation across projects and also re-skilling talent on these new-age technologies.
Infosys estimates the agile digital market opportunity to be about $160-200 billion in size. Parekh said the company’s digital revenues stood at $2.79 billion in FY18, which was about 25.5% of its total revenues."

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd’s decision to defer its plan of adding 10,000 local employees to its US workforce by May 2019 underscores analysts’ observations on the incumbent chief executive Salil Parekh’s conservative approach. Analysts say Parekh believes in setting more realistic targets, unlike his predecessor Vishal Sikka.  
Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd’s decision to defer its plan of adding 10,000 local employees to its US workforce by May 2019 underscores analysts’ observations on the incumbent chief executive Salil Parekh’s conservative approach. Analysts say Parekh believes in setting more realistic targets, unlike his predecessor Vishal Sikka. 
Sikka initially set the plan to add 10,000 local employees in the US in two years, starting May 2017. Now, Infosys suggests it will take more time to increase this number. 
“We announced 10,000 local US hires, of which in the last 12 months we have already achieved 4,000. We have hired 800 college graduates. We have a plan to hire 1,000 graduates per year in the coming fiscal and the fiscal after that,"" Parekh said at a Morgan Stanley-sponsored analyst event in Mumbai on Wednesday. He, however, did not share further details. 
But, according to two Infosys executives, the CEO’s suggestion indicates the IT firm will realistically not meet that number before April 2020.
An Infosys spokesperson referred to the firm’s recent post-earnings press conference in April, wherein its chief operating officer U.B. Pravin Rao had indicated that the company would meet its US hiring target only by April 2020. 
Analysts also believe that recent developments, including the target of 7-9% dollar revenue growth in the current fiscal year, show that the company is recovering from the turbulence of August 2017, when Sikka and former chairman R. Seshasayee were forced to quit, and co-founder Nandan Nilekani was brought in to save the day. 
Interestingly, the US hiring decision was not the first time that Infosys re-evaluated its near- and long-term goals following Sikka’s departure. The company had also cut down on its $20 billion revenue target by 2020, as it had put additional pressure on the company’s top executives to meet aggressive near-term goals. It had also led to the exits of at least a dozen senior executives, who were reporting to Sikka.
At least one foreign analyst said that Infosys, under the new CEO, is setting more realistic targets. “We come away from our meeting with leading industry participants a bit more confident that Infy can meet targets for FY19. Moreover, we did not think that the previous Infy management set realistic targets, but we believe new management has set achievable FY19 targets,"" wrote Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, in a note dated 23 May."

New Delhi: Software services firm Infosys Ltd on Monday said its proposal for voluntary delisting of its American Depositary Shares (ADSs) from Euronext’s Paris and London exchanges has been approved by the board of directors of the two bourses. 
New Delhi: Software services firm Infosys Ltd on Monday said its proposal for voluntary delisting of its American Depositary Shares (ADSs) from Euronext’s Paris and London exchanges has been approved by the board of directors of the two bourses.
Infosys had in March announced its intention to delist the ADSs on account of the “low average daily trading volume of Infosys ADS on these exchanges, which is not commensurate with the related administrative requirements"".
“...the voluntary delisting of its ADSs from the Euronext Paris and Euronext London exchanges has been approved by the Board of Directors of Euronext Paris SA and by Euronext London Ltd,"" Infosys said in a BSE filing on Monday.
During the five-year period of the listing on Euronext Paris and Euronext London, the average daily trading volume of Infosys ADSs was significantly lower than its average daily trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Infosys said, adding that there will be no change to its Infosys share/ADS count, capital structure or float as a result of the delisting from the above exchanges. Also, Infosys ADSs will continue to be listed on the NYSE.
“The delisting procedure will allow Infosys ADSs listed on the Euronext Paris and Euronext London exchanges to be sold on the NYSE. A sales facility will be provided to the holders of Infosys ADSs trading on the Euronext Paris and Euronext London exchanges..."" it said.
The sales facility is slated to begin on 18 June and end on 29 June.
The last day of trading of Infosys ADSs on Euronext Paris and Euronext London will be 4 July and will be delisted the following day.
Holders of such shares can choose to participate in the sales facility to sell their ADSs on the NYSE in accordance with Euronext Paris and Euronext London rules, Infosys said. If they choose otherwise, they can continue to keep their ADSs and be able to trade them on the Euronext Paris and Euronext London exchanges until the date of completion of the proposed delisting and only on the NYSE thereafter.

369,2018-06-12,Infosys,"In the 25 years since listing, Infosys has rewritten corporategovernance rules

Mumbai/Bengaluru: On 14 June 1993, a Bengaluru-based company, with a little over $5 million in annual revenue and fewer than 250 employees got listed. 
Mumbai/Bengaluru: On 14 June 1993, a Bengaluru-based company, with a little over $5 million in annual revenue and fewer than 250 employees got listed.
Infosys Ltd ended last year with $10.94 billion in revenue and a workforce of 204,107. In the 25 years since 1993, it has not only rewritten the corporate governance norms for all listed firms but also democratized wealth creation among shareholders and employees, changing the way business is done in India.
“The biggest takeaway from Infosys’s listing was that it showed to Indians that a few ordinary people, with no powerful background and rather simple middle-class upbringing, can set up a great company and on a global scale,"" said T.V. Mohandas Pai, a former human resources head and chief financial officer of the company.
Pai joined Infosys as a consultant in January 1994, six months after the company went public.
“I believe when it comes to corporate governance and disclosure norms, Wipro is a surrogate for Independent India and Infosys became the proxy for post-liberalized India,"" said Shankar Jaganathan, founder of CimplyFive Corporate Secretarial Services, a tech solution provider for compliance standards.
“In fact, Sebi’s report on corporate governance takes source from much of the practices followed by Infosys during the early years from 1995 until 2000,"" said Jaganathan, also the author of the book, Corporate Disclosures: The Origin of Financial and Business Reporting.
The listing of Infosys, which was set up in 1981 by N.R. Narayana Murthy and his six friends, took place at a time when the country had just begun opening itself to foreign investors. Up until then, foreign investors were not allowed to hold shares in Indian companies; markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India had just been set up in 1992, and the stock markets were still reeling under the $1 billion banking and securities fraud by stock broker Harshad Mehta.
Three months before Infosys’s listing, on 12 March 1993, a series of bombs exploded one after another at several places in Mumbai, including the Bombay Stock Exchange. They had been planted by terrorists who intended to avenge the destruction of Babri Mosque in December 1992 by Hindu nationalists.
Investor sentiment was tepid, and shareholders, like most people in the country, were still not clear about what Infosys actually did. 
“Infosys listing was a seminal moment. This despite people not knowing about the company and its IPO (initial public offering) almost having flopped,"" said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of proxy advisory firm InGovern Research.
Infosys’s IPO was undersubscribed but Morgan Stanley bailed the company by picking up 13% of equity at the offer price of  ₹ 95 per share. Infosys shares opened at  ₹ 145 a share, almost a 60% premium on the day of listing.
However, the management’s relentless focus on transparency and disclosures, on the back of the company reporting consistent growth, year after year, soon made Infosys the darling of investors. In 2000, Infosys even became the second-most valuable company in the IT index, behind Wipro.
Firstly, Infosys’s focus on corporate governance norms made many large foreign investors and analysts take note, which in turn made other companies borrow from some of its initiatives.
“At a time when there were no norms for appointment of independent directors, Infosys started disclosing governance policy, the board charter, the attendance of board members, the qualification and remuneration paid to its board members,"" said Jaganathan of CimplyFive.
“In the subsequent years, under Murthy and CFO Mohandas Pai, Infosys redefined accounting, disclosure and corporate governance standards. It was the first company which shared a sustainability report, first to reports its accounts in US GAAP accounting standards. All these disclosures were a breath of fresh air and certainly, the company caught the eye of foreign investors too,"" said Subramanian of InGovern Research.
Infosys also put in place a whistle-blower policy, articulated rules to limit insider trading and formed an independent board committee to oversee best practices. All of this was then unheard of at most other listed companies.
Secondly, Infosys became the first listed firm to articulate a financial policy with investors, stating the management’s aim was to generate a return on capital (RoC) that was twice the cost of capital and three times the cost of capital deployed. The management started meeting analysts every quarter and, beginning 1995, started giving a yearly revenue growth outlook, another first. 
Infosys also showed other companies that its employees and shareholders were at the heart of business as it democratized wealth creation among both employees and shareholders. Employees held 13.6% of shares in 1992 and with the introduction of an employee stock option scheme in the subsequent years, many of the company’s over 18,000 employees who held shares became dollar millionaires.
Finally, Infosys changed the way companies did business in India.
“It changed the way companies looked at employees. Infosys did not have separate canteens or lifts or restrooms for senior management and junior employees,"" said Pai.
Ironically, the Infosys board came under a cloud over alleged poor corporate governance in the 18 months to August last year. And Murthy’s repeated lambasting of the board over the matter led to CEO Vishal Sikka and chairman R. Seshasayee resigning."

This month Infosys Ltd celebrates its silver jubilee of becoming a public company in India. It was a seminal event for the capital markets in India. Infosys redefined governance standards in the country and created a new form of capitalism based on a good value system, sharing of wealth with all constituents, with clear separation of private interest and public wealth. 
This month Infosys Ltd celebrates its silver jubilee of becoming a public company in India. It was a seminal event for the capital markets in India. Infosys redefined governance standards in the country and created a new form of capitalism based on a good value system, sharing of wealth with all constituents, with clear separation of private interest and public wealth.
The Infosys IPO was a tough act and eventually was bailed out by its investment banker, Enam. Infosys raised  ₹ 16.58 crore at a time when its revenue in the previous year was just  ₹ 8.66 crore. In the roadshow, the company claimed that it would reach $100 million revenue by 2000. This was a bold statement while entering the capital markets when they were just recovering from one of the biggest scams of our generation, the Harshad Mehta scam. The stock was issued at  ₹ 95 per share and ended the day at  ₹ 160 per share. It was a tepid listing but the first step towards history in the making. The first taste of success came with Morgan Stanley taking a large stake. The rest is history. Infosys ended up being one of the largest wealth creators for its investors.
What set Infosys apart from the rest was its insistence on doing business in a fair and ethical manner; its insistence on creating wealth legally and ethically and sharing it with all stakeholders; its mindset to treat shareholders as owners and the management as trustees of shareholders’ money; its practice of using disclosures and financial reporting as a competitive advantage without worrying too much about losing competitiveness; its trendsetting adoption of global practices like quarterly reporting, voluntary adoption of global governance standards; its innovative way of recognizing employees through human resource valuation reporting; its outreach to global investors by providing financial statements in GAAPs of seven countries in their own languages; its innovative ESOP scheme, which made many millionaires including some of the drivers and peons in the company; and finally its insistence on values before profits.
All these did not happen by chance. It happened due to the vision of one great leader—N.R. Narayana Murthy. If you check the history of Infosys, you will find his footprint in every aspect of its success. He created the idea of Infosys that attracted some of the best minds from the corporate world to build a much greater institution of our times. His ability to spot talent, his ability to challenge them to achieve the unachievable, his clear communication of value systems, his ability to walk the talk as a leader and more than anything his ability to provide space for everyone to grow and shine and take a step back when needed. He had simple business rules and a clear focus on business.
Infosys was a dream company for many generations. It was the middle-class dream. Many investors bought their first house selling Infosys shares, many investors got their sons or daughters married with the proceeds of Infosys shares, many middle-class people became millionaires because of their holdings in Infosys and more than all that, Infosys enhanced the aspirations of many Indians and made them think global. One analyst from a global firm wrote a famous report with the title “Infosys, god’s own company"" and for many of us that was not an exaggerated statement. Investors loved the stock and benchmarked other companies to the same standards that resulted in overall governance improvements across the board in India.
Recently, Murthy was very vocal when he saw Infosys compromising on some of its core values and governance principles. For an outsider, he was power-hungry, not willing to let go of his hold on Infosys. But for many of us, who worked closely with him, we knew that it was due to his genuine feeling to make Infosys stick to its core principles and value system. There are not many leaders in corporate history who left the company they built lock, stock and barrel like him. I, for one, strongly believe that the truth has a profound way of establishing itself, irrespective of circumstances, and will always prevail.
I am proud to have been part of this journey, which transformed India’s corporate world forever, and also to have worked closely with a legend, the one and only, Narayana Murthy.

Most chief executive officers (CEOs) today face the unenviable task of making their company pivot into the digital, online world.  
Most chief executive officers (CEOs) today face the unenviable task of making their company pivot into the digital, online world. 
This means different things for different types of firms, since each occupies a corner of an industry or a geography and has unique problems that occur in those corners. 
There has been much conjecture, for instance, around the role of today’s advertising agencies, which, not so long ago, had a fairly simple, though certainly creative, task in order to help chief marketing officers (CMO) increase brand recognition. 
Today’s ads are dominated by the internet and its spawn such as search engines and social networking sites—and ad agencies working with contemporary CMOs have needed to become both creative agencies and technology companies.
Some information technology (IT) services companies have understood this need for vertical integration from the bottom end of the stack, Infosys’s acquisition of the agency Wongdoody is an example.
But CEOs have far more to deal with than their CMO underlings when it comes to steering their firms through the tight turn into the digital age. 
Too fast and you lose control, too slow and you die. The main ingredient in a CEO’s effort to enforce change is through the employees of his or her own firm. 
Recognizing that people are the main ingredient, CEOs and their human resources heads often turn to pompous, but clueless white-shoe consulting firms in an attempt to effect organizational change. Consulting firms have entire “change management"" and “organization design"" practices, and by virtue of having been in hair-raisingly close proximity to them, I can say, hand on heart, that these practitioners aren’t even as good as the one-eyed man who ruled the kingdom of the blind. They spew out psycho-babble and rely on an inexact battery of competing personality assessment tests as the main tools of their trade and get self-righteously indignant when asked to back up their methods with evidence.
The theory of the “tipping point"" is a popular one; it holds that once an idea takes hold with a certain number or “critical mass"" of people within an organization or an electorate, the tide turns inexorably towards that idea. On a related point, I have dwelled on in this column before about how Kenneth Arrow proved that you only need a minority out of a set of people to sway an election (or public opinion) one way or another.
But Arrow only explained the mathematical theory behind what causes the swing, and we have not yet been able to precisely define at what critical mass this tipping point occurs. Knowing exactly how many people you need on your side in order to make your organization go through wrenching change without self-destructing would be a useful tool for any CEO.
Help may be at hand. In a recent issue of the journal Science, researchers from the University of London and the University of Pennsylvania have claimed that they have been able to nail down this magic number through a series of online experiments. The fact that these experiments were online is significant, since the online world is one that is still open to easier manipulation for a CEO (or a politician) than the physical world of tours, speeches and propaganda. 
I shall not go into detail about the online experiment here—suffice to say that it included financial rewards or penalties (much as a corporation would) to allow large groups of people to achieve a consensus. The researchers then introduced committed “confederates"" or “change agents"" into the mix to see at what tipping point they could change the existing consensus and cause a “paradigm shift"". 
In every instance, the confederates only needed to comprise around 25% of the population to effect the “tip-over"". So now we have it. That marvelous magic number is 25%.
This means that all a manager needs to attain using online methods is to get 25% of employees committed to the change. And as the study acknowledges, Machiavellian organizations can infiltrate their own “confederates"" as online interlopers. Once you hit 25%, you have a good chance of swaying opinion in your favour.
Trim your consulting spend; follow the scientific evidence instead.

364,2018-06-23,Infosys,"Nandan Nilekani, at  37the AGM in Bengaluru, said shareholders concerns over Infosys stability have been addressed during the year and the focus is now on relentless execution of its plans, aspirations

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd’s non-executive chairman Nandan Nilekani assured shareholders that their concerns over the company’s stability have been addressed during the year and the focus is now on relentless execution of its plans and aspirations. 
Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd’s non-executive chairman Nandan Nilekani assured shareholders that their concerns over the company’s stability have been addressed during the year and the focus is now on relentless execution of its plans and aspirations.
He also said that he was ready to work as long as necessary at Infosys without compensation. Nilekani was addressing the company’s 37th Annual General Meeting held in Bengaluru on Saturday. 
Infosys went through a turbulent period last year due to a standoff between its founders – led by N.R. Narayana Murthy — and the previous management over corporate governance issues. That standoff culminated in the sudden resignation of its former chief executive officer (CEO) Vishal Sikka and former chairman R. Seshasayee. Co-founder Nilekani was brought in to save the day in August 2017.
“When I stepped for the second time into Infosys in August, one of the concerns that you raised was about the company’s stability. We have taken several steps during the year to remedy this. We have a very stable management team and board, and everybody is united, and agrees that we are really on the verge of something momentous. The focus is now on relentless execution,"" Nilekani said.
It is the resilience of all stakeholders — the board, management, Infosys employees, etc — that has seen the company through testing times and helped it deliver strong financial performance, he added. 
The board and the nomination and remuneration committee also have a well-defined succession plan in place. That plan will not only be applicable for the CEO but also other key management personnel, executives said when asked by a shareholder if there was a back-up plan in place for incumbent CEO Salil Parekh, who was named Sikka’s successor late last year.
“I have already benefited enough from this company so I am not taking compensation. However, let me assure you that I am 100% committed to the company’s future, it’s direction, and I will work as long and as hard as necessary even if I don’t have compensation,"" Nilekani said in response to a shareholder’s suggestion that he ought to take compensation.
The non-executive chairman also said they will look into a shareholder’s suggestion of including founder Murthy on the board. 
Infosys executives also reiterated that the company’s digital revenue will grow at a faster pace than overall revenue growth. 
“We fully expect that digital revenue will grow faster. We had said in Q4 FY18 that quarter-on-quarter growth for digital revenue was significantly higher than overall (revenue) but we have not given any guidance for FY19 on digital revenue. The cloud business is one of our biggest and fastest growing pieces in digital,"" CEO Parekh said."

New Delhi: India’s second largest IT services firm Infosys Ltd on Tuesday asserted it has sufficient time to file a key US regulatory document—the subject of a recent whistleblower complaint—and said the filing will be made “within the stipulated time"".
The company also strongly denied reports that there is an ongoing probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and dubbed “speculation"" to that effect as “baseless and incorrect"".
“This is to clarify that the company will file the Form 20F within the stipulated time and has sufficient time to do so. Speculation that the Form 20F is not filed in time or there is an ongoing SEC investigation is baseless and incorrect,"" Infosys said in a regulatory filing.
The statement comes in the wake of reports that an anonymous whistleblower has flagged concerns over the firm not filing with the US market regulator the stipulated Form 20F, a key document outlining the financials and key risks to the company, generally filed between May and June.
Infosys is also listed on the NYSE.
The whistleblower, in a recent letter to both Indian and US market regulators, had said, “The company’s undue delay in filing Form 20F with its deafening silence on any reason for such delay raises several questions and risks to the shareholders.""
Form 20-F has to be filed by foreign companies with listed equity shares on exchanges in the US. The form calls for the submission of an annual report within six months of the end of the company’s fiscal year.

358,2018-07-09,Infosys,"Tech Mahindra CEO C.P. Gurnani's salary consists has a large component of stock options, which pegs  his remuneration significantly higher than peers at TCS, Infosys and Wipro

Bengaluru: Tech Mahindra’s chief executive officer C.P. Gurnani earned  ₹  146.19 crore in remuneration in 2017-18, bringing his total earnings over the last five years to  ₹ 510 crore. The numbers have rekindled debate among analysts and observers on compensation for the CEO of India’s fifth largest software services company and how it compares with the median salary of its other employees. 
Bengaluru: Tech Mahindra’s chief executive officer C.P. Gurnani earned  ₹  146.19 crore in remuneration in 2017-18, bringing his total earnings over the last five years to  ₹ 510 crore. The numbers have rekindled debate among analysts and observers on compensation for the CEO of India’s fifth largest software services company and how it compares with the median salary of its other employees.
Significantly, Gurnani’s  ₹ 510 crore in earnings is about 24% more than the combined earnings of  ₹ 387.92 crore of nine CEOs at the four largest IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, over the last five years, according to a Mint analysis.
Tech Mahindra’s vice-chairman Vineet Nayyar who retires this year, earned  ₹ 363.13 crore during this period, making the total payout by the company to two of its senior-most executives to  ₹ 873.16 crore over the last five years.
Gurnani and Nayyar’s annual salary has a large component of stock options exercised during the last four years and for this reason, their compensation is higher than their peers.
Tech Mahindra defended the high compensation to its two executives, saying the grant of shares to Gurnani and Nayyar is tied to the company’s performance, with the company having clocked the fastest compound annual growth since 2013.
“The grant of shares for the executives including MD (managing director) & CEO is based on performance parameters and is decided by the Nomination and Remuneration committee, consisting of non-executive and independent directors,""said a spokeswoman for Tech Mahindra. 
“If one looks at the last five years of growth, Tech Mahindra has been the fastest-growing company amongst the top five and the stock has been one of the best performers amongst peer group,"" said the spokeswoman.
Although this is correct, Tech Mahindra’s performance—both revenue and profitability—is not significantly better than its four larger rivals. 
Again, as Tech Mahindra is much smaller than TCS or Infosys, it is only expected of the firm to grow faster. 
Sample this: Tech Mahindra reported a 9.6% dollar revenue growth to end with $4.77 billion in revenue in 2017-18 as against TCS’s 8.6% growth to end with $19.1 billion in revenue last year. 
TCS’s $4.97 billion revenue in the January-March period is more than Tech Mahindra’s $4.77 billion sales for the entire year. 
Still, TCS chief executive Rajesh Gopinathan earned  ₹ 12.49 crore, as against Gurnani’s  ₹ 146.19 crore last year. 
Vishal Sikka, Infosys’s former US-based CEO, who faced criticism over higher salary from some of the software services company’s founders, earned  ₹ 111.32 crore over three years.
“Capitalism is still trying to find a comfortable home in India and it is such instances of high, excessive compensation which in a democracy likes ours gives capitalism a bad name,"" said Gurcharan Das, author and former chief executive officer of Procter & Gamble India. 
“The fact is that flaunting wealth is distasteful and imprudent in our country. The last thing you want is the government to get involved in fixing salaries, but one should not forget that it is these examples of inequality that has partially contributed to leaders like Donald Trump getting elected in the US because it bothers a lot of people. The board of Tech Mahindra and Anand Mahindra (chairman of Tech Mahindra) should use self-restraint and make sure that there is no resentment among employees in Tech Mahindra,"" Das said.
Gurnani, 59, joined Tech Mahindra in 2004, and took over as chief executive officer in August 2012. 
Tech Mahindra, which was founded in 1986 and went public in 2006, allotted shares to Gurnani in 2006-07 and again in 2010-11."
355,2018-07-13,Infosys,"Infosys will report  Q1 results after market hours today and outlook on key verticals like BFSI would be keenly watched

New Delhi: Infosys, India’s second biggest IT services exporter, will announce its June quarter earnings today after market hours. Infosys is expected to announce its first quarter (Q1) results at 4:15 pm, followed by a media briefing by the top management at 4:30 pm. The company will also conduct a 90-minute conference call (open to investors/analysts) at 6:15 pm, according to Infosys. After the strong earnings reported by India’s biggest IT company TCS earlier this week, expectations are high that Infosys will also come out with Street-beating results in Q1.
Here are five things to watch out for in Infosys Q1 FY 2018-19 results:
1) Infosys is expected to report rupee revenue of  ₹ 18,996 crore in the June quarter, up 5.1% quarter-on-quarter or 11.2% year-on-year, according to estimates of HDFC Securities. Infosys had posted a net profit of  ₹  3,690 crore in the March quarter on revenue from operations of  ₹ 18,083 crore. In terms of closely tracked dollar revenues, Infosys is expected to report revenues of $2,835 million, up 1.1% quarter-on-quarter or 7% year-on-year, according to the brokerage’s estimate.
2) Margin is likely to decline 70 bps quarter-on-quarter on account of wage hikes, higher visa costs and higher investment in sales and digital, which will be partially offset by rupee depreciation and operational efficiencies, says Edelweiss Research. Infosys had reported an operating margin of 24.7% in the March quarter.
3) For FY19, Infosys is expected to maintain its earlier guidance of 6-8% growth in constant currency, according to HDFC Securities.
4) Performance of digital, top accounts, deal wins, large deal renewals and outlook of key verticals like BFSI (banking financial services and insurance, which contributes nearly one-third of its revenues) will also be closely tracked by analysts. The TCS management earlier this week indicated that growth in its banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) unit would remain strong in the next one to two years as it posted a record net profit, helped by a rebound in the key division. In a note after TCS announced its earnings, Edelweiss Research said: “We believe BFSI revival marks the next phase of the growth journey for the Indian IT sector.""
5) Progress on increased investment outlay towards onsite hiring, investments in digital and EBIT margin guidance will also be keenly watched, says HDFC Securities. Infosys had earlier issued guidance for a operating margin band of 22-24% for FY19.Infosys shares have outperformed the broader markets since the start of this year. Infosys share price are up nearly 25% year to date."
354,2018-07-13,Infosys,"Despite reporting weak earnings in a quarter that generally sees more business for IT firms, Infosys rewarded shareholders with a 1:1 bonus issue

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd reported weak first-quarter earnings on Friday, as both revenue and profits were lower than analysts’ expectations, marking a slow start to the financial year even as the company jettisoned its practice of giving a full-year dollar revenue guidance.  
Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd reported weak first-quarter earnings on Friday, as both revenue and profits were lower than analysts’ expectations, marking a slow start to the financial year even as the company jettisoned its practice of giving a full-year dollar revenue guidance. 
However, despite reporting weak earnings in a quarter that generally sees more business for IT firms, Infosys rewarded shareholders with a 1:1 bonus issue. The board also inducted Mike Gibbs, chief information officer at oil giant BP Plc, as an independent director for three years, taking the total board strength to nine, including six independent directors.
A Bloomberg survey of 19 analysts had forecast Infosys to report revenue of $2.84 billion, or  ₹ 19,526.1 crore, in the quarter. 
The analysts estimated the company to report a net profit of $540.38 million, or  ₹ 3,719.2 crore, in the period.
In morning trading on Nasdaq, Infosys shares were trading down 3.75% at $19.26 a share.
Infosys’s operating margin declined 100 basis points to 23.7% at the end of the June quarter from 24.7% in the January-March period.
It posted 6.8% year-on-year dollar revenue growth in the April-June period, after reporting a 9.2% y-o-y dollar revenue growth in the March quarter, suggesting that the company is still struggling for stability. 
Worryingly for the firm, 11 months after co-founder Nandan Nilekani returned as its non-executive chairman, and six months after it appointed Salil Parekh as chief executive officer, Infosys’s attrition rate continues to move northwards, with attrition in parent IT services business rising to 20.6% from 16.6% at the end of March. Including Infosys’s subsidiaries, the attrition rate is 23%. Infosys saw a 2% sequential constant currency growth in business from clients in the US, which accounts for 60% of total revenue. 
In the industry segment, the company saw a de-growth in business from customers in the banking and financial services sector, which accounts for 31.8% of revenue.
Infosys’s performance in the first quarter pales before that of its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), which declared a strong first quarter earnings on Tuesday. Mumbai-based TCS, despite doing 44% more business in the first quarter than Infosys, reported a 4.1% sequential constant currency growth at 25% operating margins. 
Infosys maintained its constant currency guidance of 6-8%, but declined to share the company’s latest projections on actual dollar revenue growth for FY19. 
Chief financial officer M.D. Ranganath said that the company was sticking to its constant currency guidance and its earlier 7-9% projection of actual revenue growth, based on 31 March exchange rates, but declined to share the actual revenue growth figures based on 30 June exchange rates. 
For now, Infosys has retained its full-year growth outlook of 6-8% in constant currency terms, again far less than TCS, which again reaffirmed that the company will clock a double-digit growth in the current financial year.
“We think we had a solid quarter in Q1 of fiscal 19. We had 6% growth overall in constant currency terms. We had 25% growth in terms of our digital business. These are good numbers. We had 23.7% operating margins,"" said CEO Parekh.
“In fact, we’ve now put in place a very clear strategy. We are starting to execute on our three-year transformation plan…So, to me, it was a solid quarter and the start of the execution of our strategy. From my perspective…I would call that a solid quarter."" 
“1Q19 revenues marginally lower than Street estimates but better than feared,"" Morgan Stanley analysts Parag Gupta and Gaurav Rateria wrote in a note to investors after Infosys reported its earnings.
“Net income of  ₹ 36.1bn (-2.1% q-o-q, +3.7% y-o-y) was lower than MSe of  ₹ 37.2bn and consensus of  ₹ 37.2bn, largely due to provisions of  ₹ 2.7bn pertaining to reduction in value of disposal assets held for sale."""
353,2018-07-13,Infosys,"Infosys' American Depository Receipts (ADRs) fell over 4% in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange

Mumbai: Infosys Ltd’s American Depository Receipts (ADRs) fell over 4% in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Investors are evidently unhappy with the company’s June quarter results. 
Mumbai: Infosys Ltd’s American Depository Receipts (ADRs) fell over 4% in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Investors are evidently unhappy with the company’s June quarter results.
On the face of it, things seem steady at the company. Infosys retained both its revenue growth and profit margin guidance for the year. But underneath the surface, it is a different story.
Revenues grew by 6% year-on-year in constant currency terms last quarter, lower than the 6.4% growth reported in the March quarter. Remember that nearly all IT stocks have risen this year on the hope of acceleration in growth. Infosys’s numbers aren’t supporting the theory yet. What’s more, the key financial services vertical reported a marginal drop in revenues sequentially. So although the company sounded gung-ho about the prospects for this segment, based on deal flow, it doesn’t yet have the numbers to back up its optimism.
In contrast, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) reported an over 200 basis points improvement in growth rate last quarter vis-à-vis the March quarter. And the financial services sector, which grew 3.7% sequentially, had a good deal to do with this. As things stand, TCS’s growth this year could be 3-4 percentage points higher than Infosys’s. The gap between the two is widening, after having narrowed when Vishal Sikka was at the helm at Infosys (see chart). 
In fact, this was another reason IT stocks have rallied lately—the expectation was that the depreciation in the rupee would boost profits. Again, this thesis isn’t supported by Infosys’s guidance. It appears that it will reinvest gains from the currency back in the business to drive growth. As such, any increase in growth rates will come at a sizeable cost. 
Another worry is the simultaneous rise in both employee utilization and attrition at Infosys. To start with, a jump in attrition at a time when the industry is growing in single-digits is unusual and worrying. It’s not like there are opportunities galore in the industry.
Besides, utilization rates have reached record highs of 85.7% excluding trainees, which means the company doesn’t seem to have much of a buffer if there are unexpected growth opportunities. It is either unexcited about growth prospects or, worse, blindsided about growth opportunities. Either way, the messaging is poor as far as investors are concerned. 
So while the company’s post-results commentary focused on a pickup in new deal wins and a healthy deal pipeline, the fact that hardly any of this is reflected in the June quarter financials is naturally worrying some investors. 
The writer does not hold any positions in the companies mentioned above."

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd’s ambitious plan of hiring 10,000 American workers in the US over the next few years, is facing its first challenge as Indiana Hotel Equities Llc, a Michigan-based firm, in a lawsuit, alleged tortious interference by the Bengaluru-based software giant and its former chief executive officer (CEO) Vishal Sikka. Indiana Hotel’s charges include conspiracy by Infosys, along with the Indianapolis Airport Authority (IAA), to remove Indiana Hotel Equities as a tenant in order to secure occupancy to build its work centre.
Indiana Hotel Equities, a privately held partnership firm, in a lawsuit filed on 11 July, alleged that Indianapolis Airport Authority, Infosys and Sikka, along with other Indiana government officials, wrongfully removed Indiana Hotel Equities as a tenant from a leased property owned by the Indianapolis Airport Authority. Indiana Hotel Equities itself filed bankruptcy proceedings under chapter 11 on 10 April.
In April last year, Infosys first announced its plan to hire up to 3,000 people by 2023 in Indianapolis and started building and redeveloping a 70-acre commercial plot of land outside the terminal of Indianapolis International Airport. The terminal is no longer used, but the commercial land has a 257-room hotel, which is at the centre of dispute.
“Unknown to IHE (Indiana Hotel Equities)…the Indiana Government Employees sought to pre-textually terminate the Lease for purpose of housing the tech giant—Infosys. Upon information and belief, one of the Indiana employees had a personal relationship with Infosys’s then-CEO Sikka, and is reasonably believed to have initiated the communications and negotiations between Infosys and the Indiana employees,"" reads a statement from the 157-page complaint filed by Indiana Hotel Equities’s counsel O’Reilly Rancilio P.C.
Mint has reviewed a copy of the complaint.
“IAA (Indianapolis Airport Authority), Infosys, Sikka and government officials for the State of Indiana worked in concert to accomplish their unlawful purpose to forcibly remove IHE from the Property and tortuously interfere with IHE’s contracts with IAA and IHV (Indiana Hotel Ventures LLC). Infosys and Sikka’s participation in this civil conspiracy violated the general duty to not interfere with another’s reasonable business expectations and contracts with third persons. Infosys and Sikka knew of the existence of both the Lease and Management Agreement. Despite this knowledge, Infosys and Sikka negotiated with the IAA and other employees of the State of Indiana for purposes of conveying the subject property to Infosys as a campus attached to the innovation hub to be built at the closed terminal.""
The Indianapolis centre is one of the four hubs India’s second largest information technology (IT) outsourcing firm plans to open. The other three are in Raleigh, North Carolina, Providence, Rhode Island and in Hartford, Connecticut. 
A spokesperson for Indianapolis Airport Authority said it does not comment on pending legal cases. 
“The claims alleged in this lawsuit are meritless. Infosys will defend itself vigorously in court,"" said a spokeswoman for Infosys. 
An email sent to Sikka seeking comment went unanswered."

Infosys shares ended the day up 1.83% at  ₹ 1,333.05, while the benchmark Sensex index closed 0.60% lower at 36,323.77 points.
The IT services firm has retained its FY19 guidance for revenue growth in the range of 6-8% in constant currency terms. The guidance implies a required compound quarterly growth rate (CQGR) of 1.8-2.5%, which is higher than 1.6% achieved in FY18, said analysts.
Some brokerages have tweaked their target prices for Infosys shares. Out of 52 analysts covering the stock, 40 have a “buy"" rating, eight have a “hold"" rating, while four have a “sell"" rating, shows Bloomberg data. 
Analysts said although it looks like Infosys will achieve the lower end of its guidance in FY19, the margin band is conservative with the share of digital inching up, recent rupee depreciation and investments already defined internally.
With a buy rating, Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd expects Infosys to grow revenue by 6.6% and 8.6% in FY19 and FY20 respectively, which is a downward revision in their estimate by 0.8 percentage point. 
“While Infosys met expectations on margins in Q1FY19 and is currently at the top end of its guidance band, it has been clear about its plan to invest in the business. Its investments have been identified and so has the quantum, hence leading to potential benefits out of any rupee depreciation that’s already been factored in by the company. We therefore maintain our view of the company achieving the top end of its margin guidance for the year, followed by expansion in FY20,"" it said in a report on 13 July.
ICICI Securities revised its target price on Infosys to  ₹ 1,405 from  ₹ 1,415 but stated that revenue decline in the financial services vertical of 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in constant currency terms and high attrition of 23% on a quarterly annualized basis were the key negatives in the June quarter results.
“Attrition was elevated even for high performers which is concerning especially given their importance for ensuring superior delivery quality and solutioning and for sustaining CSAT levels. Spends are expected to recover in the financial services vertical from Q2FY19 itself with the vertical contributing 40% of deal TCV in the quarter,"" it said in a report on 14 July.
Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd has also raised its target price on Infosys by 3% to  ₹ 1,430 per share. Due to cross-currency headwinds and Q1 dollar revenue miss, the brokerage firm has trimmed its dollar revenue growth assumptions to 7.2% and 8.5% for FY19 and FY20.
Maintaining a “reduce"" rating, Nomura said Infosys Q1 revenue growth was a tad below the Bloomberg consensus expectation and does not provide a reason to change its view that growth could be towards the lower end of its guided band. 
“We believe consensus expectations of growth towards higher end of the range could temper and the stock post a material run-up of 27% year-to-date should take a breather,"" it said in a note on 13 July. It also added that slowing of revenue growth in communications vertical was a negative but retail growth uptick was a positive and mirrored similar trends seen at TCS. 
“The sustainability of this trend is key to watch given structural challenges in this segment,"" Nomura said."
349,2018-07-17,Infosys,"Waning FII interest, low profitability and rising attrition rate show Infosys is losing sheen

Bengaluru: Foreign institutional investors’ (FII) ownership of Infosys Ltd dropped to 34.87% at the end of 30 June, the lowest since March 2009, marking the souring of overseas investors’ love affair with the company. 
Bengaluru: Foreign institutional investors’ (FII) ownership of Infosys Ltd dropped to 34.87% at the end of 30 June, the lowest since March 2009, marking the souring of overseas investors’ love affair with the company.
Bengaluru-based Infosys has been the bellwether information technology firm in India despite not being the largest in the industry, partly because the country’s second-largest software services company set new standards in corporate governance in India, higher profitability and its scorching growth pace in the noughties and many years before that.
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) was the biggest Indian IT firm, while Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Services Corp. clocked the fastest growth for most of the last decade.
Infosys’s current attrition level of 20.6% is the highest in its history while its 23.7% profitability is the lowest, making it a daunting task for non-executive chairman Nandan Nilekani and chief executive officer (CEO) Salil Parekh to return the company to its former glory. 
Still, four reasons explain why Infosys was considered a bellwether for the Indian IT industry. 
First, Infosys’s higher profitability than peers on account of differentiated solution offerings always helped it earn more money. Second, Infosys was always considered to be an aspirational employer. Third, the management and board’s focus on corporate governance norms made many large foreign investors and analysts take note. Understandably, Infosys came to be the preferred bet among FIIs as they owned between 40% and 50% of the company for much of the past seven years.
However, Infosys has lost some of the sheen on all four counts.
“Behind the headline numbers, there is a bigger challenge faced by Infosys. Two of the most important ones is how can the company retain its differentiated solution offerings and retain talent,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst with a foreign brokerage on condition of anonymity. “Once the company gets this sorted, FIIs will surely find merit in investing in the company. For now, it has lost its mojo or so to say the bellwether tag."" 
First, management failure to invest enough in newer and more profitable technologies in recent years means Infosys’s digital practice is smaller than some of its rivals, implying the company’s operating margin is less than Mumbai-based TCS. This fiscal, Infosys outlined a profitability of between 22% and 24% even as TCS retained its outlook of 26-28% operating margin.
A year-long feud at Infosys between promoters and the board and management over some decisions has hurt the company.
The fight affected employee morale, making some analysts and proxy advisory question the corporate governance practice followed by the firm, prompting some foreign investors to trim their holding in the company.
Seven months after Infosys named Salil Parekh as CEO in January, the company continues to grapple with retaining talent as attrition in the IT services business shot up to 20.6% at the end of June from 16.9% in the year earlier. Including Infosys’s subsidiaries, the attrition rate is 23%.
Last month, a report by proxy advisory firm Stakeholders Empowerment Services (SES) argued that the turbulent times witnessed by the company over the last year hurt Infosys’s valuation and adversely affected shareholders.
Consequently, FII holdings in Infosys dropped to 34.87% at the end of 30 June from 38.31% at the end of March 2017.
A few analysts are still confident that Infosys will be able to steer through these turbulent times. 
“Infosys is, by and large, pretty strong and pulling together where it counts and will benefit from Salil Parekh’s experience in the large deal climate… However, a couple of more disappointing quarters will raise eyebrows and turn off several investors who are skeptical of the market and its potential,"" said Phil Fersht, chief executive of US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing-research firm."
348,2018-07-17,Infosys,"Developed by Infosys for the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, the portal was launched by then industry minister Anand Sharma in January 2013

New Delhi: The Narendra Modi government is winding up a flagship eBiz portal launched by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, which was supposed to act as a one-stop facility for businesses to obtain government licences and clearances as well as reduce red tape and improve transparency. 
New Delhi: The Narendra Modi government is winding up a flagship eBiz portal launched by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, which was supposed to act as a one-stop facility for businesses to obtain government licences and clearances as well as reduce red tape and improve transparency.
“The eBiz portal is being wound up. It was conceived in 2009 and implementation got delayed for various reasons. By the time we started implementing it in 2014, many states had their own online systems,"" a government official said on condition of anonymity. “Only limited services could be integrated into eBiz. For example, we could integrate only two services of Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) into eBiz, while if one visits the CBDT portal, one can avail all its services."" 
Developed by Infosys Ltd for the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) under the National e-Governance Plan in a public-private partnership model for 10 years, the government-to-business portal was launched by then commerce and industry minister Anand Sharma in January 2013. 
According to the original plan, the first three years of the term would be the pilot phase, while the remaining seven years would be the expansion phase. During the pilot phase, a total of 50 (26 central + 24 state) services from five pilot states were supposed to have been integrated. It was envisaged that in 10 years, more than 200 services related to investors and businesses would be rolled out through the portal.
After the National Democratic Alliance government came to power in May 2014, it latched on to the eBiz idea for improving India’s ranking in World Bank’s Doing Business ranking. 
In his first budget speech on 10 July 2014, then finance minister Arun Jaitley announced that all government services would be made available on the eBiz platform by 31 December of that year in a bid to streamline clearances that businesses require. 
“The eBiz platform aims to create a business- and investor-friendly ecosystem in India by making all business and investment-related clearances and compliances available on a 24x7 single portal, with an integrated payment gateway. All central government departments and ministries will integrate their services with the eBiz platform on priority by 31 December this year,"" Jaitley had said. That, of course, did not happen.
In February 2015, Jaitley, along with then commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman and World Bank country director Onno Ruhl, added 11 new central government services to the eBiz platform taking the total to 14. 
Four months later, the eBiz portal saw its last update at 4.18pm on 18 June 2015.The government remembered the usefulness of the portal in December 2016 after a disappointing improvement in India’s ranking in the World Bank’s annual Doing Business survey by just one notch to 130. In a high-level meeting of six cabinet ministers, Jaitley finalized an eight-point strategy to realize Modi’s target to take India’s Doing Business ranking to the top 50. 
The first on the list was to make eBiz portal mandatory for starting a business, which will include three functions of the ministry of corporate affairs—registration for PAN (permanent account number) and TAN (tax deduction account number) and registration for Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation and Employees’ State Insurance Corp. However, the portal currently says services like PAN and TAN are “temporarily unavailable"". 
The eBiz project is still relevant as nothing can replace a single-window facility, a former bureaucrat involved in the project said on condition of anonymity. “It is sad that the government has decided to shut it down after spending so much money and effort on it,"" he added."
347,2018-07-20,Infosys,"Infosys is finding it hard to sell Panaya even at ₹582 crore, about 59% less than the ₹1,398 crore it paid in February 2015

Bengaluru: Back in February 2015, Infosys Ltd’s then chief executive Vishal Sikka hailed the firm’s $220 million (₹1,398 crore) purchase of Panaya, calling the Israeli firm’s offerings “an awesome piece of technology."" 
Bengaluru: Back in February 2015, Infosys Ltd’s then chief executive Vishal Sikka hailed the firm’s $220 million (₹1,398 crore) purchase of Panaya, calling the Israeli firm’s offerings “an awesome piece of technology.""
A little over three years on, that bet has soured for Infosys, as India’s second largest outsourcing firm scrambles to find buyers for the Israeli automation technology firm that is now valued at less than half the price Infosys paid for it.
Less than two months after it purchased Panaya, Infosys spent $120 million to buy Skava, a US-based mobile commerce firm, in April 2015. Earlier this year, Infosys decided to sell both Panaya and Skava. For now, Infosys has not marked down the value of Skava. 
Executives familiar with the Panaya sale have described it as “a fire sale"" of sorts, given its latest valuation of  ₹ 582 crore—a 59% discount on the purchase price of  ₹ 1,398 crore ($220 million).
Infosys disclosed the fair value of Panaya in its balance sheet for the June quarter.
According to the executives cited above, if Infosys does not find a buyer quickly, there could be further write-downs over the next few quarters. 
Infosys’s decision to admit the loss in value of Panaya is a clear admission that the acquisition has not worked out for the company in the way it had originally envisioned, according to experts. 
“Infosys is just not set up to sell products effectively—and it took Sikka a while to realize this. Moving to digital is much more in line with the strengths of the firm as a tech agnostic services business. Skava and Panaya were a mistake and they just need to write down whatever they can and move on,"" said Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing-research firm.
Infosys’s purchase of Panaya has been at the centre of a number of controversies under the previous management. One such was Infosys’s decision to pay a generous severance payout to former chief financial officer Rajiv Bansal, which Infosys founder N.R. Narayana Murthy had objected to. 
“Now, due to a regime change at the firm, with both a new management and a new chairman, the firm is realising that it is not getting the value on what it has paid earlier and that it had overpaid earlier,"" said Shriram Subramanian, founder of proxy firm InGovern Research.
Infosys declined to offer a comment, with a spokeswoman saying the firm does not have anything to add to what the management has already said. 
“As part of our strategic review, we put together a set of criteria for our entire portfolio. When we looked at Skava and Panaya, they did not meet that criteria. We then decided to take the actions that we’ve taken,"" Infosys’s current CEO Salil Parekh said in April.
Over the past three years, the Panaya acquisition has been a hot-button subject for Infosys and was a central plank for much of the criticism that was levelled against the company by its founders, based on an anonymous whistleblower complaint which alleged wrongdoing by the previous management on the Panaya deal. Infosys’s earlier board conducted two investigations and absolved the management of wrongdoing although the firm to this day has not made the probe report public. 
Infosys and Sikka in the past have also repeatedly denied any wrongdoing with regards to the acquisition. 
“Infosys just needs to tell which of the three answers best explains the reason behind this loss in value of Panaya. First, is this loss because the transaction done by the earlier management was not at arm’s length? Or is it second, that Infosys was not able to handle this acquisition well? Or is it third, that Infosys’s current management and the board decided to settle scores with the old management and the board,,"" said J.N. Gupta, co-founder of Stakeholder Empowerment Services, a proxy advisory firm."

New Delhi: IT major Infosys has flagged off concerns around increased rejection of work visa applications, and said this could result in delays and increase in project costs for its clients. 
New Delhi: IT major Infosys has flagged off concerns around increased rejection of work visa applications, and said this could result in delays and increase in project costs for its clients.
The Bengaluru-based company has already been ramping local hiring in key markets like the US to tackle increasing scrutiny around work visas by various governments. 
“Recently, there has been an increase in the number of visa application rejections. This has affected, and may continue to affect, our ability to obtain timely visas and staff projects. As a result, we may encounter delays or additional costs in managing such projects,"" Infosys said in a recent regulatory filing. 
Infosys also noted that the company may have to apply in advance for visas or could incur additional cost in maintaining such visas that could result in additional expenses. 
The company also warned that its international expansion strategy, and business could be materially adversely affected if change in immigration and work permit laws impairs its ability to staff projects with local workers. Previously, Infosys had stated that stricter work visa norms across various markets like the US and Australia will not “constrain"" its business growth as the IT firm is focussing on hiring locals and training workforce in these geographies. 
“....what we are building with this localisation approach is really gearing towards making sure that our business model evolves in the right way, without sacrificing the best elements of the business model for the future. So, I don’t think we see that this is going to constrain our business growth,"" Infosys CEO Salil Parekh had said. 
Over the past many months, there has been increased scrutiny over the temporary work visas in various countries like the US and Australia. This has prompted many Indian IT companies to tweak their business models by reducing dependence on visas and hiring more people overseas, instead. 
Infosys has announced that it is setting up four technology and innovation hubs and hiring about 10,000 locals in the US over a two-year period. Of this, about 4,000 people have already been hired."
345,2018-07-23,Infosys,"Increased scrutiny of H-1B visa renewal applications, and restrictions on new H-1B visa applications could result in higher operating expenses, Infosys said

India’s second biggest outsourcer Infosys has warned that increased rejection of work visa applications in key markets could drive its cost higher or delay projects. Top Indian IT services companies like TCS, Infosys and Wipro deploy a large number of its employees at client locations for project completions. Any change in work visa or immigration laws makes them vulnerable to staff their overseas projects with professionals who are not citizens of the country. Analysts say that tightening of norms for H-1B work visas, which are popular among Indian IT professionals, is likely to put cost pressures on the Indian IT services firms and impact their margins.

“The ability of our technology professionals to engage in work-related activity in the US, Europe and in other countries depends on the ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits,"" Infosys added. 
Citing the recent change in the US, Infosys said: “In the United States, the current administration has clarified existing regulations to increase scrutiny of H-1B visa renewal applications, and new H-1B visa applications for workers placed on third party worksites and junior IT workers.""
These changes, Infosys added, “could negatively affect our ability to utilize current employees to fulfill existing or new projects and could also result in higher operating expenses.""
Infosys in the regulatory filing also said that “similar legislative proposals have already been implemented in Australia, where the Australian government’s agenda of significant reform to the temporary and permanent work visa programs is now complete as of March 18, 2018 with the abolition of the subclass 457 visa and in Singapore.""
The Bengaluru-based outsourcer also said that many countries in the European Union are continuing to “implement new regulations to move into compliance with the EU Directive of 2014 to harmonize immigration rules for intra-company transferees in most EU Member States and facilitate the transfer of managers, specialists and graduate trainees both into and within the region""
The changes, Infosys added, have significant impacts on mobility programs and have led to new notification and documentation retention requirements for companies sending service providers to EU countries.
In the regulatory filing, Infosys said that profitability could also be affected by pricing pressures on its services, volatility of the exchange rates, increased wage pressures and higher taxes.
Infosys had posted a profit of  ₹ 3,612 crore in the three months to June, missing estimates due to a one-off charge of $39 million related to the fair value reduction of its Panaya unit. However, Infosys retained its revenue outlook for the fiscal year to March, with its chief executive upbeat about demand for the company’s services in the key markets of United States and Europe."
344,2018-07-24,Infosys,"Starting this financial year, the variable pay of the top six Infosys employees will be based on digital revenue growth, in addition to overall revenue and profitability

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd has, for the first time, linked incentives of six of its top employees to how much revenue the company generates from digital technologies, underscoring how aggressively chief executive officer Salil Parekh is pursuing growth from newer and more profitable offerings. 
Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd has, for the first time, linked incentives of six of its top employees to how much revenue the company generates from digital technologies, underscoring how aggressively chief executive officer Salil Parekh is pursuing growth from newer and more profitable offerings.
This is also the first time that any large information technology services company has linked a part of the variable component of salaries of top managers to digital revenue growth. Starting this financial year, the variable pay of the six Infosys employees will be based on digital revenue growth, in addition to overall revenue and profitability, Infosys said in a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
By linking pay to digital revenue growth, Parekh is trying to encourage the senior management team to aggressively sell its digital offerings even at the cost of cannibalizing some of its traditional maintenance and infrastructure services. Digital offerings such as automating processes and moving away from a people-led approach may hurt Infosys’s revenue in the near term but are future growth areas.
“I think almost every services player is debating this right now and you will see the introduction of different models and adjustments throughout the next three years as they try to get the incentive system that works best for the team and for clients,"" said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology advisory firm.
The six top Infosys executives are chief operating officer U.B. Pravin Rao; chief financial officer M.D. Ranganath; Mohit Joshi, head of the firm’s largest industry segment banking and financial services; deputy chief operating officer S. Ravi Kumar; head of human resources Krishnamurthy Shankar and general counsel Inderpreet Sawhney.
The development comes after Infosys’s board, led by chairman Nandan Nilekani, disclosed the parameters that determine CEO Parekh’s performance-linked pay as part of his annual remuneration of  ₹ 16.25 crore. Parekh’s compensation is linked to the company’s ability to get a higher share of business from digital technologies, build a stable management team and ensure higher returns for its shareholders.
Infosys claims that digital business grew 27% from the year-ago period to $803 million at the end of June quarter. Digital, for now, accounts for 28.4% of the company’s $2.83 billion revenue in the June quarter. 
Mumbai-based Tata Consultancy Services Ltd said that digital accounted for $1.26 billion, or 25%, of its $5.05 billion revenue in the same period while Wipro Ltd’s digital revenue accounted for $569.45 million, or 28.1%, of its $2.02 billion revenue in the first three months of the current financial year. 
“Think of the link as a proxy for the key leadership team to focus on new revenue sources. It’s their incentive to grow new business. This is one model that some organizations have taken, but not the only approach,"" said Wang.
Wipro, Infosys’s cross-city rival, does not intend to link its senior leadership’s variable pay to digital revenue because it believes that digital, despite growing fast, is still less than a third of its total business.
“Not for us,"" Wipro president and chief human resources officer, Saurabh Govil said in an interview last week. “All our KMPs (key managerial personnels) are measured by two parameters, revenue and margin, at the company level. Please remember that for all Indian IT companies, including us, more than 70% is still non-digital and less than 30% is digital. So even if digital is growing fast, non-digital business has to be run very efficiently. I don’t believe leaders at the KMP level need to be incentivised like this because people are very clear that an organisation has to do well and it is not limited to any one or two areas."""

Mumbai: Infosys Chief Financial Officer MD Ranganath, a veteran of nearly two decades at India’s second-largest software services company, has abruptly stepped down from his position, marking the second CFO departure at Infosys in three years.  
Mumbai: Infosys Chief Financial Officer MD Ranganath, a veteran of nearly two decades at India’s second-largest software services company, has abruptly stepped down from his position, marking the second CFO departure at Infosys in three years. 
In a statement to stock exchanges, Infosys did not give a reason for Ranganath’s departure, but said the company’s board had accepted his resignation and Ranganath would continue in his current role till 16 November 2018. The board has already started the process to hunt for Ranganath’s successor, it added. 
According to two people aware of the matter, who requested anonymity, Jayesh Sanghrajka, deputy CFO at Infosys, is likely to replace Ranganath as the company’s next finance chief. 
Ranganath’s departure marks the third top-level exit — all of them at the executive vice-president level — at Infosys under the stewardship of Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh, who took over the reins of the company eight months ago. For Parekh, Ranganath’s exit comes at an inconvenient time, given that Infosys is struggling to maintain its previous levels of margins, even as it chases growth. 
His exit is bound to raise concerns on stability at the top, and Infosys’ ability to retain its most valuable top leaders, given that Ranganath was widely seen as a steadying influence at the company, especially under the tenure of previous CEO Vishal Sikka when the company went through unprecedented levels of tumult. 
Other than Ranganath, Infosys lost two other top leaders this year — former president Rajesh Krishnamurthy and former healthcare business head Sangita Singh. 
“Over the last 18 years Ranga has played a pivotal role in the growth and success of Infosys. During his long stint in the company, I have seen him in a wide spectrum of leadership roles and in each of them he has delivered results with distinction. With Ranga as CFO, the company has in the last three crucial years, delivered a strong and resilient financial performance on multiple fronts, implemented an efficient capital allocation policy and earned the respect of all stakeholders through enhanced value creation,"" Infosys Chiarman Nandan Nilekani said. 
Ranganath, popularly known as “Ranga"", was widely seen as one of the last executives who represented the old guard of Infosys. He worked at ICICI Bank for nearly eight years, prior to joining Infosys in 2000. Over the years, he enjoyed a warm relationship with the founders and the promoter group at Infosys, especially with founder NR Narayana Murthy. During his tenure, Ranganath took on various roles at the company, including chief risk officer. He also played a key role in the chairman’s office that was set up in June 2013, when Murthy returned to the company as executive chairman. 
“I am grateful to Infosys for giving me the opportunity of serving as CFO of this global iconic company. I am proud that over the last three years, during a critical phase of the company, we delivered strong and consistent financial outcomes, maintained high standards of financial reporting, built a world-class finance team, further strengthened the company’s competitive position and enhanced value to the stakeholders,"" Ranganath said. 
“I have worked with Ranga (Mr. M.D, Ranganath, CFO, Infosys) for over 15 years. He is clearly one of the best CFOs in the country. His ability to take tough decisions in challenging situations, his solid financial expertise, strong value system, unfailing courtesy and flawless execution always distinguished him as an exemplary leader and a key asset for the company. He has been instrumental in raising investor confidence in the company during the last five years by managing costs and margins,"" Narayana Murthy said.
With his exit, Infosys has now lost two CFOs in the space of three years, a worrying development for a company of its size. In October 2015, former CFO Rajiv Bansal resigned, amid tensions with the then management team led by Sikka. Bansal was also at the centre of the controversy surrounding the company’s controversial Panaya acquisition, a deal he had opposed. Subsequently, Bansal was paid a huge, unprecedented amount of severance by the previous board of Infosys under then chairman R. Seshasayee. That episode sparked further controversy and attracted the ire of the founders, especially Murthy. 
“Infosys is a very process-driven company and to put it simply, it is the easiest job for a CFO, since the CFO has to only put cash to use and think of a buyback,"" according to a Mumbai-based equity analyst at a foreign brokerage.
“Things are good if there is nothing sinister like the last time (when Bansal quit). I don’t believe he (Ranganath) not gelling well with CEO Parekh should be much of an issue. In every field, you have this challenge. Kumble could not get along with Kohli in cricket and had to leave. So till the time there is nothing sinister, CFO leaving should not be much of a challenge,"" according to another analyst at a domestic brokerage firm."

Market benchmarks Sensex and Nifty hit new closing highs of 38,278 and 11,552, respectively, on hectic buying by investors amid positive global cues. 
Ranganath took over the CFO role in 2015 after the exit of Rajiv Bansal. He is leaving the company to “pursue professional opportunities in new areas"" and will continue in his current position till 16 November, 2018, Infosys had said in a statement. 
The board, which accepted the resignation at its meeting on 18 August, said it will immediately commence the search for Ranganath’s successor. 
“After a successful career spanning 18 years in Infosys, including as CFO for the last three crucial years, I now plan to pursue professional opportunities in new areas,"" Ranganath said."

New Delhi: India’s second largest IT services firm Infosys has hired over 4,700 locals in the US since last year, including nearly 500 people for its technology hub in Raleigh, North Carolina. 
Last year, the company had announced that it will hire about 10,000 locals and establish multiple technology and innovation hubs across the US with a focus on artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), user experience, emerging digital technologies, cloud, and big data. These hubs have been set up in Indiana, Connecticut and Rhode Island. The latest one to open is in Raleigh, North Carolina.
“Infosys announced that it has hired more than 4,700 Americans since Spring 2017, including nearly 500 in North Carolina, as part of the company’s campaign to hire 10,000 Americans and accelerate the pace of innovation for American industry,"" the Bengaluru-based firm said in a statement.
The North Carolina Hub will help Infosys work more closely with clients in the region to develop cross-functional solutions to business challenges in areas like ML and AI among others, it added.
The Hub will also train, upskill and reskill Infosys and client employees in the technologies required to help American businesses accelerate their digital transformations, the statement said.
Infosys Foundation USA is also providing multiple grants for classroom technology and computer science training to teachers and schools. To date, these grants have reached 3,938 students, 102 teachers and 94 schools across the state, it said.
“Supported by academic institutions in North Carolina and around the country, the Hub allows us to co-locate, co-innovate and co-create alongside our clients and build on our passion for creating the next generation of top US technology talent through world-class education and training,"" Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said.
Infosys, like many of its peers, has been ramping local hiring in key markets like the US, the UK and Australia to tackle increasing scrutiny around work visas by various governments. This is also part of Infosys’ three-pronged strategy of focussing on stabilising the company’s business in 2018-19, build momentum the next year, followed by acceleration in 2020-21."

Another thousand-point milestone is within reach for India’s benchmark equity index. Following the drubbing earlier this year, the S&P BSE Sensex is nearing the 39,000 level, the gauge’s third round-number mark since surpassing its life-time peak two months ago - a rally that’s helped the gauge cement the tag of Asia’s best performer this year. 
Another thousand-point milestone is within reach for India’s benchmark equity index. Following the drubbing earlier this year, the S&P BSE Sensex is nearing the 39,000 level, the gauge’s third round-number mark since surpassing its life-time peak two months ago - a rally that’s helped the gauge cement the tag of Asia’s best performer this year.
While there’s optimism that economic growth topping 8 percent will help power equities higher in the coming months, lingering external risks, most notably from the price of oil - and its impact on the rupee - and stretched valuations is giving some investors a pause.
“Markets have run up a lot and there’s certainly an element of risk when this happens - it is never easy to buy in such times,"" said Sunil Sharma, who oversees $1 billion of assets as chief investment officer at Sanctum Wealth Management Pvt. in Mumbai. “There are short-term fears like oil prices that may lead to a correction, though the economy remains on a firm footing.""
Gross domestic product expanded 8.2 percent in the June quarter from a year earlier, the government said after market hours on Friday. That was faster than the 7.6 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 42 economists.
The beat isn’t prompting investors and analysts to sound the all-clear for Indian equities just yet. Here is why:
Valuations
The Sensex trades at an estimated price-earnings ratio of about 21, the steepest among equity benchmarks in the region after New Zealand. Despite the selloff in mid-cap stocks, the one-year forward PE ratio for the Nifty Midcap 100 Index is still at a premium to the Nifty gauge of India’s top 50 companies, signaling higher growth expectations for smaller firms are priced in, UBS Securities India Pvt. said in a report last week.
Earnings Growth
About three-fourths of 50 Nifty members reported results that either beat or met earnings estimates in the June quarter, the highest proportion in at least three quarters, according to calculations by Bloomberg Quint. The “upcycle could be quite significant, a contrast to most parts of the world"" as the share of corporate profits in India’s GDP is close to all-time lows, according to Morgan Stanley. For now, the rally has outpaced the outlook for profit growth, with UBS saying consensus earnings for Nifty are likely to be cut 7-8 percent.
Premium Soars
While Indian equities have traditionally traded at a premium to Asian peers because of the nation’s potential for faster economic growth, the valuation gap between MSCI India Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index has widened to the highest in a decade, Citigroup Inc. said in an 20 August note. Global uncertainties and rich valuations before a general election next year are “enough reasons to be cautious in equities,"" the bank said.
Lopsided Rally
While the benchmark indexes hit multiple records in August, gains have been uneven. The Sensex’s 13.5 percent year-to-date climb has been dominated by three stocks - Reliance Industries Ltd., Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Infosys Ltd. About three-quarters of the 30 Sensex stocks are trading higher than their 200-day moving average, compared with 94 percent in January when the gauge peaked.
Fund Flows Moderate
Persistent buying my domestic equity mutual funds has time and again provided a buffer against foreign outflows. Domestic funds bought $10.8 billion of shares this year, outweighing $283 million of withdrawals by their global peers. Still, retail flows to stock funds have slowed recently, averaging about  ₹ 10,000 crore a month from  ₹ 14,000 crore to  ₹ 15,000 crore at the start of the year, according to Citigroup.
Costly Oil
Moody’s Investors Service last week said India, the world’s fastest-growing oil user, risks missing budget targets because of higher oil prices. While elevated crude prices stoke inflation, a spike also weakens the rupee, which causes foreigners to sell Indian assets. It’s a vicious cycle. The currency fell past an unprecedented 71 per dollar on Friday.
“The biggest risk is from macros like oil and the rupee. If the oil goes above $80-82 range and the rupee declines to 73-75 range, it will create problems for the economy, which will result in postponement of FDI and FII flows,"" said G. Chokkalingam, managing director at Equinomics Research & Advisory Pvt. in Mumbai. “The whole spiral starts playing out."""
335,2018-09-04,Infosys,"Infosys CEO Salil Parekh tells investors that the firm will bolster leadership team, curb senior management exits

New Delhi: Infosys Ltd’s chief executive, Salil Parekh, has reached out to investors to assuage concerns about a string of senior management exits, including that of chief financial officer M.D. Ranganath, assuring them that India’s second-largest software services company will strengthen its leadership team and contain attrition. 
New Delhi: Infosys Ltd’s chief executive, Salil Parekh, has reached out to investors to assuage concerns about a string of senior management exits, including that of chief financial officer M.D. Ranganath, assuring them that India’s second-largest software services company will strengthen its leadership team and contain attrition.
Parekh, who took over as CEO in January, told some analysts that Infosys will hire people from outside to strengthen its account management, large deals and digital teams.
“Mr. Parekh is looking to augment leadership through external hires in account management, large deals team and select digital competencies while interventions are under way to contain attrition,"" Kotak Institutional Equities analysts Kawaljeet Saluja and Jaykumar Doshi wrote in a 2 September note, after a meeting with Parekh.
Last month, Ranganath, a veteran of nearly two decades at Infosys, abruptly resigned from his position, marking the third senior executive departure at the company under Parekh’s watch. Other than Ranganath, Infosys lost two other top leaders this year—president Rajesh Krishnamurthy and healthcare business head Sangita Singh.
“Mr. Parekh believes Infosys’s high attrition can be partly attributed to its strong training engine which makes employees an attractive target,"" the analysts wrote in the note. “Mr. Parekh expects attrition to decline in the coming quarters with multiple interventions kicking in, including: timely wage revisions, more promotions and better employee engagement."" 
Parekh spoke with at least three equity analysts over the last week, according to an executive familiar with the development, as there was growing apprehension that Infosys is struggling to build a stable management team.
“At our meeting with Infosys’s CEO/MD, Mr. Salil Parekh, we discussed investor concerns over the stability of the senior management team in the wake of the CFO’s recent resignation and the ability of Infosys to deal with such top-level departures,"" JP Morgan Chase and Co. analyst Viju George wrote in a note to investors on 2 September. “Our view — we received reassuring messages from the CEO on these and other aspects. Infosys has a very deep management bench as per Mr. Parekh, which should help the company deal capably with senior management departures; recent departures of business (vertical) heads and of the CFO should not have a business impact given the experience and relationships that leaders one level below bring to the table and their readiness/ability to step up as replacements.""
Infosys’s decision to boost its leadership team in account management and large deals reflects the company’s desire to improve the firm’s ability to win mega deals (more than $1 billion in value) and its ability to generate more business from existing customers.
Infosys, which generated $10.94 billion in revenue in the year ended 31 March, expects to grow its revenue between 6% and 8% in constant currency terms in the current financial year. The company, however, lowered its profitability outlook to 22-24% for 2018-19, against 24-26% two years back, as it wants to plough back the savings to invest in digital technologies, the fuzzy umbrella term that companies use to classify revenue generated from areas generally classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud computing and Internet of Things.
Digital accounted for 25.5% or $2.79 billion of the software services company’s full-year revenue last year."

New Delhi: Infosys Ltd’s chief executive officer Salil Parekh appears mindful of the cultural risks associated with hiring senior leaders from outside the company, manifested in the reluctance of India’s second-largest information technology outsourcing (IT) company to hire such executives. Significantly, Parekh’s approach since taking over as CEO in January is distinct from that of former CEO Vishal Sikka, who in his first nine months hired 14 executives from SAP AG, the German business software provider. Sikka himself was board member at SAP before being hired to steer Infosys in 2014.

Parekh’s cautious approach of promoting executives within the company to take up leadership roles rather than hiring from outside also helps quell any discontent and debate over “us versus them"", a narrative for which Sikka came under criticism from both within and outside Infosys.
“(C)ontrolled outside hiring minimizes the risk of a culture hijack and creation of us vs them camps, that can result from a sudden influx from senior leaders from outside,"" JP Morgan Chase and Co. analyst Viju George wrote in a note to investors on 2 September. George wrote the note after meeting Parekh last month when Infosys looked to assuage investor concerns on a string of departures from the top management.
“Investors have noted and asked why there have been hardly any hiring announcement(s) by Infosys of senior leaders from outside firms. Typically, a CEO, who has taken charge, may look to fill critical gaps by hiring relevant senior talent from outside. We saw a fair bit of this early into Dr Vishal Sikka’s tenure with a flow of high-profile recruitment into Infosys from SAP. Mr Parekh has been conscious to resist the temptation to hire too many too soon from outside. The reason is twofold: (a) it is preferable to fill/elevate from within, if the relevant experience is available to offer a career path to deserving professionals, which in turn creates opportunities for advancement for other lower below and (b) controlled outside hiring minimizes the risk of a culture hijack and creation of us vs them camps so to speak that can result from a sudden influx from senior leaders from outside,"" wrote George.
“At Infosys, we have always focused on nurturing talent and leadership within the organisation,"" said a spokeswoman for the company. “On occasion, if a certain skillset is not available within the organization, we hire externally as required.""
To be sure, Parekh has said that he will look at hiring talent from outside the company in areas in which Infosys does not have required skill sets. This will be in areas like account management, large deals and digital teams and none of the leaders will be part of core leadership team, according to an executive familiar with the development. Still, Parekh’s leadership style is more conservative than that of Abidali Neemuchwala who since taking over as chief operating officer at Wipro Ltd in 2015 got eight former colleagues from Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). Neemuchwala himself was at TCS before taking up the role of Wipro chief operating officer and subsequently becoming CEO in 2016.  However, unlike at Infosys, where many former SAP executives joined at the rank of senior vice-president, Neemuchwala got these former TCS executives to join Wipro at lower levels.
Still, a few observers feel IT services companies, including TCS, Infosys and Wipro, need to shun this insular approach of not hiring from outside the company.
“The board of Infosys should look at making the company truly a global firm. This can be done by having local leaders in market-facing geographies like the US, UK, Europe, who are empowered to make decisions in those geographies. These executives should be brought into the leadership position. It will send a very, very powerful message to the market. Remember, signalling is an extremely important thing for these companies and I don’t think Indian IT firms, including Infosys, recognize this,"" said Siddharth Pai, who has personally led over $20 billion in complex, first-of-a-kind outsourcing deals."

India’s third-largest private sector lender Axis Bank Ltd will have a new chief four months from now.

Its stressed assets have fallen, it has made large provisions towards all toxic loans and the bank has improved its loan mix by focusing on retail.  
India’s third-largest private sector lender Axis Bank Ltd will have a new chief four months from now. After a tumultuous three years, the private sector lender’s books are on the mend as its June quarter results showed. Its stressed assets have fallen, it has made large provisions towards all toxic loans and the bank has improved its loan mix by focusing on retail. 
With toxic assets reducing as a part of total loans, the overhang on interest income and margins will recede. Shikha Sharma, current managing director and chief executive officer at the bank, will have some more time to fix the balance sheet.
Amitabh Chaudhry, currently heading HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd, is likely to have a far better book to inherit next year. 
Chaudhry will have a lender poised to grow, especially in the retail and small business space. Of course, a lot of this depends on how resolution of the assets under the insolvency code pan out towards which Axis Bank has an exposure of close to  ₹ 6,000 crore. 
What does Chaudhry bring to the table and what changes can one expect at the lender given that an outsider will be at the helm?
Chaudhry has deep exposure to technology through his BPO (business process outsourcing) days at Infosys Ltd. He also has knowledge on the retail segment for financial products through HDFC Standard Life. 
Analysts are already taking the leadership change positively as it puts an end to the uncertainty. “We would describe Mr Chaudhry as a turnaround expert,"" wrote analysts at IDFC Securities Ltd. They believe that his past success with HDFC Standard Life ensures that Axis Bank too will see its profitability grow. 
Many analysts have upgraded the Axis Bank stock, and it rose marginally amid broad weakness in the markets on Monday. 
However, Chaudhry has all but five years of experience in banking before he headed the Infosys BPO business. As far as risk management and assessment, and corporate banking goes, it could be a blind spot given that his banking experience was as early as 1990s. 
As analyst Hemindra Hazari notes in Smartkarma, a research website, Chaudhry may need to seek help from experts in the field of banking to bring Axis Bank to the next growth level. 
Growth through using technology in conjunction with banking solutions is something Chaudhry should be adept at. But for risk management and assessment, he perhaps may need to seek external advice.
For now, investors are relieved that the uncertainty over leadership is over and Axis Bank is being passed on to able hands."

Second, Fortune 1000 companies are using data analytics platforms offered by information technology (IT) vendors to run their business better. This, in turn, is translating into more work for the outsourcing companies, for now. And third, companies are increasing their spending on digital technologies. The increased spending has led to more contracts valued at over $1 billion.
For instance, Mumbai-based TCS has won three mega deals since December, bringing in a combined $5.6 billion in revenue. Last week, Bengaluru-based Wipro won its largest contract valued at $1.6 billion.
“The early legs of any transformation are always challenging, and this we have seen in the last two years when all companies struggled for growth,"" an executive at Cognizant said on condition of anonymity. “For all the five companies, digital is now a fourth of total revenue. So, without getting into the debate of digital definition, the heartening thing is that quality of revenue is only improving.""
Although all IT firms are moving away from a people-led model to a platform-based business approach, hiring by the largest IT firms continues to be a dominant indicator of their prospects. The five firms together employed 1.17 million at the end of the June quarter.
“Growth is back,"" a senior executive at TCS said on condition of anonymity. “Companies were always spending more on digital in the past. But now, what we are seeing is that if the traditional business can be done efficiently and if you have solution offerings like data analytics and AI (artificial intelligence) platforms, you will be able to differentiate from others.""
“To us (TCS), the question of digital offsetting the loss in traditional is not relevant because there is enough and more work available and hiring is just one indicator,"" said the executive cited above.
The June quarter net additions of the five firms is the highest in at least two years. They added 26,565 people to their workforce in the three months ended 30 June 2016. 
Although TCS does not provide a growth outlook, it is expected to cross 10% growth this fiscal. It managed an 8.6% dollar revenue growth to end last year with $19.09 billion in revenue. Ditto for Wipro, which ended last year with $8.06 billion in revenue. It expects to get at least $80 million or 1% growth this fiscal from the $1.6 billion contract.
“I’m not sure with this ‘little upswing’ we are seeing but the mood is definitely more bullish over the last couple of months,"" said Phil Fersht, chief executive officer of US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing research firm. His caution finds support from some industry executives.
“The biggest downside risk to this growth story is the uncertainty in the many of the first-of-its kind of projects,"" said the Cognizant executive cited before. “The work in areas like IP (intellectual property) platforms runs the risk of IP infringement cases. You are offering data analytics solutions when debate on data privacy is gaining traction. The promised benefits from automation will be tested. So, any incidental issue and this can blow up, making many clients hold back on spending in these areas."""
328,2018-09-14,Infosys,"Among IT stocks, TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra are up 20-53%, while Wipro is up 3%

Technology stocks have raced ahead of benchmark indices in 2018 after lagging them last year, as the Indian rupee weakens and the economic engines in the West roar back to life. An economic boom in developed nations implies greater outsourcing business for India’s information technology (IT) companies. Also, since these companies earn mostly in dollars, a weak rupee means greater revenues. The US economy grew 4.2% in the second quarter, while jobless claims hit a 49-year-low last week. Meanwhile, the rupee has slipped 11.51% against the dollar in 2018, touching a record low of 72.92 on Wednesday. 
Technology stocks have raced ahead of benchmark indices in 2018 after lagging them last year, as the Indian rupee weakens and the economic engines in the West roar back to life. An economic boom in developed nations implies greater outsourcing business for India’s information technology (IT) companies. Also, since these companies earn mostly in dollars, a weak rupee means greater revenues. The US economy grew 4.2% in the second quarter, while jobless claims hit a 49-year-low last week. Meanwhile, the rupee has slipped 11.51% against the dollar in 2018, touching a record low of 72.92 on Wednesday.
In the year so far, the BSE IT index has gained nearly 40%, outpacing gains in the benchmark Sensex index which has gained around 10%. In 2017, even as the Sensex rose 27.91%, the BSE IT index gained only 10.83%, as revenues grew slower at large IT services companies. This is the best performance of the BSE IT index in the last five years. In 2016, it had slipped 8%, gained 4.26% in 2015, was up 17.6% in 2014 and jumped 55.24% in 2013.
According to Arun Thukral, MD & CEO of Axis Securities, the improving US economy has changed sentiments toward IT sector, which draws a large chunk of its business from the US. “Better profitability of US companies (a part of which could come from tax cuts) would mean better business prospects for Indian IT services. Similarly, Europe is also limping back to stability following the economic revival of the financial crisis-hit peripheral economies. This improvement in the business prospects of Indian IT companies has led to the re-rating of the IT sector in general,"" he added.
Among IT stocks, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd are up 20-53% while Wipro Ltd is up 3%. 
Thukral believes Indian IT firms have witnessed a revival of growth on the back of increased technology investments from clients in the US and Europe. “But these investments are in newer areas such as digital and cloud at the cost of traditional outsourcing, where budgets are shrinking. Hence, we like Indian IT companies who are increasing their revenue share from digital and cloud business,"" he added.
According to a Kotak Institutional Equities note dated 10 September, a 1% rupee depreciation aids earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin of IT firms by 20-30 basis points (bps) and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) by 2-3%. It has upgraded FY2019-21 earnings per share (EPS) by 0-7% but slashed its US dollar revenue growth assumptions due to cross-currency headwinds, stating FY2019 EPS will be influenced by hedges, and all companies will receive an earnings boost in the subsequent year. 
According to Kotak, even though the rupee has weakened, its impact on immediate earnings will be decided by hedging. Kotak said Infosys has minuscule cash flow hedges of $300 million; TCS hedges but through options, meaning it will realize the benefit of rupee depreciation unless the company has entered into range barrier options with the rupee depreciating beyond the range; Mindtree hedges only the monetary assets and does not have any cash flow hedges; and Tech Mahindra has hedged 70-90% of net cash inflow over the next 12-months. Wipro, HCL Technologies, Mphasis and Hexaware, it said, have hedged aggressively. “Infosys, TCS and Mindtree do not have meaningful cash flow hedges and will benefit immediately from Indian rupee depreciation,"" the Kotak note said. 
According to a Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd report, a weak rupee boosts net profits and operating margins of the entire IT sector; however, the impact on individual company earnings will be determined by three aspects -- the share of dollar revenue among all currencies; the extent of onsite-offshore revenue mix that will determine the net exposure after natural hedge; and the hedging policy in terms of duration and proportion of the net exposures hedged.
However, it added that had the rupee weakened similarly against all currencies, the impact would have been felt on the majority of the revenues. In the calendar year so far, the rupee has fallen 11.51% against the dollar, 8.03% against the pound and only 8.27% against the euro. 
“Bottoming cyclical pressures and improved capital allocation are factors that will feed into the valuation multiples favourably. Currency keeps earnings growth ticking further,"" Motilal said in its note on 10 September. 
However, Nomura said Indian Tier 1 IT valuations are at a 20% premium to that of multinational corporations (MNCs) and 15-25% discount to Tier 2 IT and challengers. “Indian Tier-1 IT, after progressively showing lower market share gains over the past three years, has lost market share to MNCs. Also, FY19 guidance suggests a weaker year, with Cognizant and HCL Tech guiding for slower organic growth in FY19 versus FY18, Infosys likely to grow near the lower end of guidance (similar to FY18) and Wipro expected to grow low-single digits for FY19, on our estimates. The only exception is TCS, where we expect growth to accelerate in FY19,"" it said in a note on 6 September."

New Delhi: Infosys, one of India’s largest IT services firm, has agreed to spend $76 million to buy Fluido, a Salesforce consulting partner in the Nordics in Europe, the company said on Friday, marking the second acquisition under chief executive officer (CEO) Salil Parekh, who took over nine months ago. 
New Delhi: Infosys, one of India’s largest IT services firm, has agreed to spend $76 million to buy Fluido, a Salesforce consulting partner in the Nordics in Europe, the company said on Friday, marking the second acquisition under chief executive officer (CEO) Salil Parekh, who took over nine months ago.
Finland-based Fluido is a privately held firm that was founded in 2010. Infosys did not disclose the revenue of Fluido but said it expects to close the acquisition during October-December.
“Fluido will be an important addition to the Infosys family, bringing a unique combination of market presence, deep salesforce expertise, agile delivery and training, that combined with our existing capabilities will help companies reimagine and transform their businesses. This acquisition also aligns to our efforts to invest in local capabilities in the regions in which we operate,"" said Ravi Kumar S, president and deputy chief operating officer of Infosys.
Bengaluru-based Infosys’s latest acquisition is significant for three reasons, according to analysts.
First, Infosys through Fluido can expect to generate more business from clients in the Nordic region comprising Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Slovakia. 
Second, the acquisition will help put the consulting arm back on the growth pedestal after more than two years of tepid performance. 
Finally, Infosys’s second acquisition after it spent $75million to buy WongDoody, the US-based ad agency in April, suggests that the company is not shying away especially after its three earlier failed acquisitions made under former CEO Vishal Sikka’s watch. 
In 2015, under Sikka’s leadership, Infosys spent $370 million to acquire Panaya, Skava and Noah Consulting. Three years later, it decided to put both Panaya and Skava on the block, having already been forced to write down 59% of the $220 million acquisition of Israeli-automation firm, Panaya. Infosys has already shut down Noah Consulting, which it bought for $70 million, and transferred all the business to the parent company.
“WongDoody and now Fluido’s acquisitions show that Salil is going to acquire consulting and design firms, one of which also helps the company to scale up its presence in a geographic region that is seeing a lot more companies increase their spend on outsourcing,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage firm on condition of anonymity.
“It is heartening that Infosys has not been bogged down by its earlier failed acquisitions of Panaya, Skava and reflects the new CEO’s desire to put an end to the past,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a foreign brokerage, also requesting anonymity."

“We are excited to further strengthen our relationship with TidalScale. Their ground-breaking software-defined server technology addresses a key challenge that many enterprises face—to rapidly increase the return on their existing investments in technology infrastructure assets,"" Deepak Padaki, executive vice-president of Infosys, said. 
The investment is expected to be completed by 28 September 2018 subject to necessary approvals, the statement said. “At TidalScale, our focus is to solve problems that until now were difficult or impossible to tackle using the usual approaches to scaling.

New Delhi: India’s second-largest IT services major Infosys on Friday said it will open its next Technology and Innovation Hub in Arizona, and hire 1,000 American workers in the state by 2023.
Last year, Infosys had announced setting up of four such hubs and hiring 10,000 locals in the US over the next two years. To date, Infosys has hired 5,874 American workers.
“The Arizona Technology and Innovation Hub will have a special focus on autonomous technologies, Internet of Things (IOT), full-stack engineering, data science and cyber security,"" Infosys said in a statement.
Infosys has so far opened two of these Technology and Innovation Hubs in Indianapolis, Indiana and Raleigh, North Carolina. Infosys also announced an additional Technology and Innovation Hub in Hartford, Connecticut and a unique Design and Innovation Hub in Providence, Rhode Island.
Infosys, like many of its peers, has been ramping local hiring in key markets such as the US, the UK and Australia to tackle increasing scrutiny around work visas by various governments. This is also part of Infosys’ three-pronged strategy of focussing on stabilising the company’s business in 2018-19 and build momentum next year, followed by acceleration in 2020-21.
Employees in Arizona hub will include recent graduates from the state’s network of colleges, universities and community colleges, as well as local professionals.
“The number of jobs Infosys is bringing to Arizona is fantastic news for our citizens, especially given the commitment the company makes to continual training and education in technology,"" Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said.
The Hub will facilitate greater collaboration and advancement in key Arizonan industries such as hi-tech, manufacturing and financial services.
“We are excited to announce the expansion of our presence in Arizona and to 1,000 workers for technology jobs in the state. This investment will strengthen our ability to deliver for our clients across Arizona and the Southwest,"" Infosys President Ravi Kumar said."

New Delhi: The Reserve Bank has shortlisted five IT firms including Infosys and TCS for implementation of a centralised information and management system (CIMS) for seamless data collection and validations.
The central bank had invited of expression of interest (EOI) in July for identification of solution provider for implementation of CIMS by overhauling the Data Warehouse (DW) of the apex bank.
After evaluation of the responses, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said “it has been decided to shortlist"" five vendors for issuance of ‘Request for Proposal’ (RFP) for selection of vendor for CIMS development and implementation. The vendors are: Capgemini Technology Services India, IBM India, Infosys, Larsen & Toubro Infotech and Tata Consultancy Services.
The RBI had proposed a CIMS comprising of DW and Data Lake (DL) which would include, seamless data collection from regulated entities by creating system-to-system interface; system driven data validation and data review; flexible and scalable data repository and providing data dissemination platform.
The CIMS would also include centralised analytics platform to facilitate creation of RBI Data Sciences Lab.
The RBI, in April, had announced to gainfully harness the power of big data analytics by setting up a data sciences lab that will comprise experts and budding analysts, internal as well as lateral, who are trained inter alia in computer science, data analytics, statistics, economics, econometrics and/or finance.
One of the functional requirements for CIMS, as per the EOI, was establishing system-to-system interface for automated element based data collection from about 130 banks/entities.

Bengaluru: Infosys Foundation, the philanthropic arm of technology giant Infosys Ltd, led by Sudha Murthy on Wednesday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Karnataka state police to set up a Centre for Cybercrime Investigation Training & Research (CCITR) in Bengaluru to help law enforcement authorities develop capabilities in tackling rising instances of cyber crime.
Infosys Foundation, which already supports the existing facility for cyber crime in Bengaluru, has committed investment of around  ₹ 22 crore and technical expertise among other services over the next five years for the new venture. The MoU was signed between the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the state police and Data Security Council of India (DSCI) and Infosys Foundation.
“The CCITR is a project for the present and the future; aiming to build state-of-the-art facilities to tackle cyber crime in Karnataka,"" Murthy, chairperson, Infosys Foundation, said in a statement.
Cyber crime and attacks have been rising rapidly in several cities of the country but archaic laws and traditional policing have proved ineffective.
There have been as many as 33,531 cases of cyber attacks in the last three years, according to a reply in the Rajya Sabha by Union minister of state for home Hansraj Gangaram Ahir earlier this year, the Press Trust of India reported.
According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), a total of 9,622, 11,592 and 12,317 cyber-crime cases were registered in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, PTI reported.
Known as the information technology capital of the country, Bengaluru has also had to deal with an increase in cyber crime, especially to do with fake online lottery scams.
The CCITR is expected to be completed within four months and will be able to train at 100-120 police professionals per batch as compared to around 20 now, Praveen Sood, director-general of police, CID, special units and economic offences, said."

New Delhi: Accenture Plc reported 13.5% growth and added $4.72 billion in incremental revenue in the financial year ended August 2018, a shade lower than the combined $4.78 billion new revenue of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp, Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd. 
New Delhi: Accenture Plc reported 13.5% growth and added $4.72 billion in incremental revenue in the financial year ended August 2018, a shade lower than the combined $4.78 billion new revenue of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp, Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd.
Accenture’s scorching growth pace was underpinned by the firm’s aggressive acquisition strategy and the firm generating more business from technology areas that are seeing faster growth: digital, the fuzzy umbrella term which each company uses to classify revenue generated from areas generally classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud computing and Internet of Things.
Accenture claims that its new business, which comprises digital, cloud computing and cyber security, totalled $23 billion, or about 60% of its full-year revenue. Along with its strong consulting practice, Accenture managed to end the year with $39.57 billion in revenue.
Homegrown IT firms, for now, say that digital accounts for between 22% and 25% of their business.
Last year, Accenture spent $660 million in buying companies, less than the $1.8 billion it spent to buy companies in 2016-17. However, Accenture has again upped its acquisition spend in 2018-19.
“This year, we would expect to spend up to $1.5 billion, consistent with our capital allocation strategy. As always, given the right opportunities and the right circumstances, we could certainly spend more than that,"" Accenture’s Chief Financial Officer David Rowland told analysts after the company declared its earnings.
Accenture added 34,309 employees last year to take its total workforce to 459,178 people. Cognizant and the four big Indian IT firms added only 13,772 employees in 2017-18.
“We believe Accenture’s execution is best in class among IT service providers in our coverage. We think digital will continue to help drive strong revenue growth with slow and steady margin expansion over time,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 27 September.
Accenture firm follows a September-August financial year. Indian IT firms follow an April-March financial year while Nasdaq-listed Cognizant follows a January-December financial year.
Over the past three years, Accenture has spent $3.4 billion to buy 70 companies, considerably more than the $1.58 billion spent by TCS, Infosys and Wipro put together, since 1 April 2014.
Only twice earlier have two companies added more than $2 billion in new business in a year, according to a Mint analysis. In 2015, Cognizant had added $2.15 billion in incremental revenue, while Mumbai-based TCS added $2 billion in new business in the year ended March 2015.
In July, Mint reported that Accenture was on its way to script history by adding incremental revenue that would be about the new revenue generated by the five firms together. Save for Noida-based HCL Technologies, all IT companies reported single-digit growth in the year ended March 2018.
Still, homegrown IT firms expect better growth in the current financial year. TCS does not issue annual or quarterly guidance, but the management expects to report double-digit growth in the current financial year. Hiring for all the firms has also seen encouraging signs, as the top five software services providers operating in India added 24,047 people in the first quarter of this financial year, compared with the 13,772 net additions in the previous year, leading many experts to believe that the industry is set to record its fastest growth in three years."

318,2018-10-11,Infosys,"Among the Sensex stocks, IndusInd Bank, Infosys, Tata Steel and SBI were down between 3% and 5%.

New Delhi: Wednesday’s rebound on Dalal Street proved short-lived. The global rout, triggered by an overnight tumble on Wall Street, has reached Indian shores and the Sensex fell over 1,000 points today while the Nifty hit 10,138 at the day’s low.

The broader markets were also under strong selling pressure, with BSE midcap index ending 2.3% lower and smallcap index 1.1%. 
10 things to know about the Nifty, Sensex selloff today:
1) Overnight, on Wall Street, the S&P 500 ended with a loss of 3.29%, Nasdaq Composite 4.08% while the Dow shed 2.2% amid a rout in technology shares like Amazon, Apple and Facebook. It was the fifth straight loss for US markets, the longest slide since Donald Trump’s election win.
2) The US market tumble was so bad that it attracted the attention of US President Donald Trump, who pointed an accusing finger at the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates. “I really disagree with what the Fed is doing,"" Trump said. “I think the Fed has gone crazy.""
3) Hawkish commentary from policymakers of the Federal Reserve, which has hiked policy rates thrice so far this year, has sent US long-term bond yields to their highest in seven years. The surge made stocks look less attractive compared to bonds. The rise in US Treasury yields has been boosted by good US economic data that has reinforced expectations of multiple rate hikes over the next 12 months by the Federal Reserve. 
4) A spike in US bond yields and a strengthening US dollar has led to a selloff in emerging markets, including India. On the other hand, gold prices strengthened today, both domestic and overseas, amid a rout in equity markets. 
5) For example, foreigners have pulled out over $10 billion from Indian stock and bond markets so far this year. 
6) The outflows from the Indian market, rising oil prices and the current account deficit, a tumbling rupee, and a rout in NBFC shares following multiple defaults by infrastructure financier IL&FS have erased all the gains the Sensex and Nifty had posted so far this year.
7) To add to the woes of the Indian stock markets, the rupee has been posting new lows against the dollar, approaching the 74.50 mark a dollar today.
8) The slide in the rupee comes despite many measures announced by the government to shore up the currency. The government had earlier increased import duty on many items while the RBI had allowed Indian companies to raise more money abroad and eased norms for foreign investment in local bonds, though those efforts haven’t stopped the rupee’s slide.
9) The risk of a widening current account deficit has left the rupee vulnerable to the rout in emerging markets amid surging oil prices, trade tensions and rising US interest rates. So far this year, the rupee is down over 14% against the US dollar and is seen sliding to 75 per dollar by year-end, according to the median view of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
10) The rout in global equity markets has sent the price of oil lower. Brent for December settlement was $1.52 lower at $81.57 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange, after falling $1.91 on Wednesday. G Chokkalingam, founder of Equinomics Research and Advisory, said oil prices are down around 5% from recent highs and this will benefit Indian markets. He is optimistic about a recovery in the Indian markets after global markets settle down. The Indian markets had fallen sharply even before the current global equity rout and the oil price fall will provide a cushion to the Indian markets on the downside, he added."

The brokerage expects demand headwinds due to a rise in cost of ownership stemming from higher fuel prices and new motor insurance rules. Reuters

CESC Ltd shares traded 1.37% up at Rs 912 per share on BSE. On Friday, the RP Sanjiv Goenka Group announced partial demerger of CESC as it failed to convince the state power regulator to get its power purchase agreement approved, reported PTI. The power utility announced demerger of non-power businesses of CESC and its subsidiaries, which have now been transferred to two new entities -- RP-SG Retail Ltd and RP-SG Business Process Services Ltd. CESC will now retain only the power business.Motilal Oswal Securities maintained “buy” rating on the stock. “CESC has a strong business model in distribution and generation, which generate double-digit RoE. Retail business is on the verge of a turnaround. As pure-play businesses, the demerged entities will drive better value realization and re-rating,” said the brokerage. “We have increased the risk-free rate to 8% due to an increase in government bond yields. The SOTP-based value is cut to INR1,077/sh. due to a change in valuation of the distribution business and an increase in the risk-free rate.”

Motilal Oswal Securities upgraded LIC Housing Finance to “Buy” with a target price of Rs 550. “Given the ~25% share price decline over the past six months, we believe the street is factoring in sustained spread compression over the medium-to-long term. With its strong parentage and AAA-credit rating since 2002, we believe LICHF will be much better placed than peers in such times of tight liquidity,” said the brokerage.“In addition, balance transfer pressure could ease as peers are facing liquidity pressure. Key risks to our earnings stem from asset quality pressure in the corporate book and negative surprises from Ind-AS accounting. Valuations at 1.3x FY20E PB are close to decadal lows and risk-reward is favorable, in our view. We expect re-rating driven by stable earnings growth over the next 4-8 quarters,” analysts noted.
The BSE Sensex fell 165.08 points, or 0.48%, to 34,568.50, while the Nifty 50 was down 55.05 points, or 0.53%, to 10,417.45.

Read moreJefferies India: “Amidst rising competition from online players, the company undertook price cuts across consumer categories in Q2FY19 which in our view is the right strategy but will result in margin pressure.

We estimate 34% PAT CAGR over FY18-21. However, valuations at 62.3xFY20 EPS of Rs22.7 and 46.2xFY21 EPS of Rs30.5 factor in the expected growth.” It retained “Reduce” with a target price of Rs1285.Motilal Oswal Securities: “We have broadly maintained EBITDA/PAT estimates for FY19/20E, as higher revenue growth is likely to be restricted by lower EBITDA margin. We maintain our 50x P/E on FY20E (on the back of strong competitive moat) to arrive at a TP of INR1,124 (prior: INR1,117). At CMP, the stock is expensively valued at 63x/48x FY20/21E P/E. At such rich valuations, we believe there is limited room for re-rating.” The brokerage maintained “Sell”.

Bandhan Bank shares traded 0.78% up at Rs 472.50 per share on BSE, after rising as much as 3.65% to Rs 486 in early trade. The bank on Friday said Sebi has exempted it from the one-year promoter shareholding lock-in rule. This will allow its promoter, Bandhan Financial Holdings Ltd (BFHL), to bring down its holding from the current 82.28% to 40% to comply with RBI norms. Analysts believe that despite Sebi’s leeway, the bank will find it difficult to reduce promoter holding to 40% in one go. Read more

313,2018-10-16,Infosys,"Infosys's net profit rose 0.5% to $581 million in the September quarter from $578 million in the preceding three months

New Delhi: Infosys Ltd posted a surprise 3.2% dollar revenue growth in the September quarter (Q2) from the preceding three months, the fastest sequential growth by India’s second-largest information technology (IT) services company in more than a year. 
New Delhi: Infosys Ltd posted a surprise 3.2% dollar revenue growth in the September quarter (Q2) from the preceding three months, the fastest sequential growth by India’s second-largest information technology (IT) services company in more than a year.
In constant currency terms, Infosys’s Q2 revenue rose 4.2% from the preceding three months. Currency fluctuations, however, took some sheen off the company’s growth as dollar revenue increased at a slower pace to $2.92 billion in the quarter ended 30 September. Infosys last posted a 3.2% sequential dollar revenue growth in the June quarter of 2017.
Net profit rose 0.5% to $581 million in the September quarter from $578 million in the preceding three months. Operating margin was 23.7%, same as in the June quarter.
A Bloomberg survey of 23 analysts had estimated  ₹ 4,048.5 crore ($548.4 million) profit on net sales of  ₹ 20,318.6 crore ($2.75 billion).
Infosys’s better-than-expected performance was largely helped by a 4.7% sequential growth from clients in the financial services space, which contributed to 32.2% of revenue. A 4.9% increase in business from retail clients, accounting for about 17% of revenue, also helped the company. For the first time in its history, Infosys won over $2 billion in new deals in a quarter.
“Both TCS and Infosys have done well in the second quarter. But TCS has the edge over Infosys as they have been reporting a double-digit, year-on-year growth for three straight quarters. But a $2 billion in deal wins is encouraging,"" a Mumbai-based analyst at a foreign brokerage said on condition of anonymity.
Infosys still faces challenges. Despite its performance in the second quarter and a weakening rupee, it has maintained its full-year operating margin between 22% and 24% and expects revenue to grow between 6% and 8% in constant currency terms. The company does not give a dollar revenue outlook, but it runs the risk of growing at the slowest pace in three years. Infosys reported a 0.9% sequential dollar revenue growth in the first quarter. Business growth is typically slower in the second half of the year for Indian IT firms, and even if Infosys manages to grow revenue by 1% in the third and fourth quarters, it will end the current financial year with 6.8% dollar revenue growth, according to Mint analysis.
Infosys’s year-on-year growth continues to be sluggish. In contrast, TCS—which last week posted a 3.2% sequential dollar revenue increase in the second quarter—has managed a double-digit year-on-year growth for three straight quarters.
Infosys also continues to struggle to retain people. Its attrition was 22.2% at the end of September quarter, a tad better than the 23% at the end of June quarter, but considerably higher than its peers (TCS’s attrition was 10.9% at the end of September quarter).

“EBIT margins were at 23.75% vs consensus expectation of 24.5% in 2Q19. Margins were flattish vs 1Q19 despite absence of visa costs, wage inflation and most important INR depreciation,"" HSBC analyst Yogesh Aggarwal said in a note to clients.
On Tuesday, Infosys shares declined 0.39%, or  ₹ 2.70, to  ₹ 696.40 on the BSE, while the benchmark Sensex gained 0.85%, or 297.38 points, to end the day at 35,162.48. Infosys Q2 results were announced after the end of trading in Mumbai.
Infosys also decided to pay its former chief financial officer, Rajiv Bansal,  ₹ 13.58 crore in outstanding severance payments, including interest, after an arbitration panel last month directed the company to pay the money.
“The company has received legal advice and will comply with the award and make the necessary payments,"" Infosys said in a press release."
316,2018-10-16,Infosys,"Infosys needs to grow at least 2.4% in the September quarter (Q2) to report 6.2% full-year dollar revenue growth

New Delhi: The heartening development at Infosys Ltd is that 10 months into his role as chief executive officer, Salil Parekh is firmly in control of India’s second largest information technology (IT) services firm. But this aside, the mood at the company is edgy. Attrition has remained high even as senior management departures continue to rock the firm. Many within, and outside, Infosys are not sure if the company is benefiting from the uptick in demand for IT services. Again, Infosys has tried to bury the ghost of the Panaya acquisition and has spent $151 million to buy two firms in the last six months. Still, some analysts remain unconvinced about the firm’s digital strategy and how the company is looking to differentiate itself from its rivals.

Again, Infosys has tried to bury the ghost of the Panaya acquisition and has spent $151 million to buy two firms in the last six months. Still, some analysts remain unconvinced about the firm’s digital strategy and how the company is looking to differentiate itself from its rivals.
Its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd has grown, year-over-year, in double digits for three straight quarters: TCS reported 11.7% y-o-y dollar revenue growth in the January-March quarter, followed by 10% growth in both April-June and July-September. Infosys’s y-o-y growth slipped to 6.8% in the first quarter of the current financial year from 9.2% in the fourth quarter of the last financial year. 
Infosys’s second-quarter earnings, to be declared on Tuesday, will be an important marker to know the firm’s full-year growth. The second half of the year (October-March) is tepid for home-grown IT firms. Infosys reported 0.9% sequential dollar revenue growth in the first quarter. Even if the company manages to grow by 1% in both the third and fourth quarters, Infosys needs to grow at least 2.4% in the July-September period to report 6.2% full-year dollar revenue growth, according to Mint analysis. Infosys had outlined dollar revenue growth of between 7% and 9% at the start of the current year.
TCS, on the back of 1.6% and 3.2% growth in the first and second quarter, respectively, will see full-year dollar revenue growth of 9.25% if it grows 1% in both the third and fourth quarters.
An over 300-basis point difference between full-year growth of the two companies, along with a 300 basis points gap in profitability, is one reminder why TCS trades at a premium to Infosys.
So can Infosys cheer investors before the Diwali festival next month? Mint highlights five things to watch for in Infosys’s second quarter results that will be declared on Tuesday.
1. Revenue growth and management commentary for the financial year: Infosys is estimated to post sequential dollar revenue growth of 2.4% in the July-September period, according to an analyst at brokerage JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd. This is higher than the 0.9% sequential growth recorded in the first quarter. Management commentary on the demand outlook for the second half of the current financial year, with the October-March period being tepid for IT services, will be crucial.
2. Performance in key geographies and industry segments: The US accounts for 60% of Infosys’s total revenue. Clients in the banking and financial services industry, or BFSI, bring 32% of the business. The last quarter saw growth remaining flattish in both these segments. Expectedly, management commentary and the impact of insourcing by large banks will be eyed.
3. Growth in digital: Infosys’s digital business grew 25.6% in constant currency terms and accounted for 28.4% or $803 million of company’s $2.83 billion revenue in the April-June quarter. One of the reasons behind TCS’s early uptick in performance has been the scorching growth in digital: TCS’s digital business grew 60% y-o-y in the second quarter.
4. Attrition retention measures: During the first quarter, Infosys reported an industry-leading attrition rate of 23%. Management has tried every trick in the bag to retain employees: from monetary benefits to promotions to even relaxing rules to allow employees to work from home. For this reason, the company’s ability to retain talent and attrition numbers will be important.
5. Update on the Panaya purchase process and severance payments to former CFO: At the end of the June quarter, Infosys had already written down 59% or  ₹ 854 crore from the  ₹ 1,398 crore it paid to buy Israeli automation firm Panaya. Last month, an arbitration panel had directed Infosys to pay  ₹ 13.58, including interest, as part of the outstanding severance to the company’s former chief financial officer Rajiv Bansal. Infosys had said it would seek legal advice. An update on the progress of the Panaya purchase and if Infosys will pay Bansal the remaining money as part of severance will be important as it helps the firm bury the developments of the past."

Mumbai: Benchmark indices BSE Sensex and NSE’s Nifty 50 rose for the third straight session on Tuesday as investors shifted their focus to September quarter earnings season from global trade and geopolitical tensions.

312,2018-10-17,Infosys,"Since Infosys still lags TCS by a wide margin in terms of revenue growth, the strategy to sacrifice margins for growth may be a sensible one

First, the good news: Infosys Ltd’s revenue growth in the September quarter (Q2) was its highest in the past eight quarters. In constant currency terms, i.e. after eliminating the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, revenues grew 8.1% year-on-year in Q2, much better than the average growth of 5-6% in the preceding four quarters. Now, the bad news: the company’s operating profit margin is at a 20-quarter low. And although the rupee has depreciated by over 11% in the past six months, Infosys is continuing to guide for margins of between 22 %and 24% for the full year, the same levels it had forecasted back in April.

And although the rupee has depreciated by over 11% in the past six months, Infosys is continuing to guide for margins of between 22 %and 24% for the full year, the same levels it had forecasted back in April.
This is not how things were supposed to go. The sharp depreciation in the rupee was expected to boost profit margins at least in the near term. Last week, the company’s chief competitor, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), reported a 150 basis points improvement in margins sequentially. Its margins reached a 14-quarter high, boosted by the decline in the rupee.
Infosys, on the other hand, has been forced to hand over the gains from the currency to employees and sub-contractors, to support growth and rein in employee attrition. In the second half of the year, the company plans to step up investments to capitalize on opportunities in digital services, which will put a lid on margins as well.

Since Infosys still lags TCS by a wide margin in terms of revenue growth, the strategy to sacrifice margins for growth may be a sensible one, unless it has struck large deals that entail low margins for some time to come. The company’s revenues were considerably ahead of the Street’s estimates. Besides, it announced deal wins worth over $2 billion, the highest ever for a single quarter, and nearly double the levels it reported in Q1. While this is nothing to sneeze at, the fact remains that expectations have been running high with IT stocks, including Infosys, which has outperformed the Nifty 500 index by about 40% this year. 
In that backdrop, investors will be disappointed that the higher-than-expected increase in revenue growth is not translating into higher earnings growth. Infosys’s net profit grew by 10.3% year-on-year in Q2, less than half the rate at which TCS’s net profit rose.
Of course, one can argue that Infosys also trades at a lower price-earnings multiple of 19 times estimated FY19 earnings, compared to TCS’s valuation of 23 times earnings. But given the large differential in earnings growth rates between the two companies, investors now need to consider if the valuation discount is wide enough."

310,2018-10-24,Infosys,"HCL Technologies is exuding optimism about revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal, but it remains to be seen how much that helps in narrowing the valuation gap with TCS and Infosys

One reason why HCL Technologies Ltd remained on the investor radar, despite delivering subdued quarterly performances in the recent past, is its valuation discount vis-à-vis larger peers Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd. At around 13 times current fiscal earnings estimates, the stock is trading at a considerable discount to the 23 times earnings of TCS and Infosys’s 18 times earnings. The valuation discount reflects subdued expectations and the Q2 results may not alter this in a major way.

At around 13 times current fiscal earnings estimates, the stock is trading at a considerable discount to the 23 times earnings of TCS and Infosys’s 18 times earnings. The valuation discount reflects subdued expectations and the Q2 results may not alter this in a major way.
The results do show an improvement in growth but only incrementally. From a year ago, revenues in constant currency terms increased 10.5% compared to 8-8.5% in the earlier two quarters. On a sequential basis, they are up 3%, largely in line with Street expectations. Profitability has improved.
Importantly, the management expects revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year to be better than what the company delivered in the first half, helping it achieve the mid-point of its objective of 10.5% constant currency growth for the full year. Deal momentum remains healthy.
The commentary is encouraging. The question, however is, will it help narrow the valuation gap with its larger peers? There is some scepticism about that.
What set TCS apart, accelerating gains in its stock, is a broad-based recovery. HCL Tech has seen incremental improvement in growth rates at key service segments. But much of the growth came from the engineering and R&D and business services, which generate less than 30% of revenues.
Growth at the application and infrastructure services businesses, which generate 70% of HCL Tech’s revenues, remains sub-par. Revenues at the application services business (which generates more than a third of revenues) are up just 1.8%. The management attributed the subdued growth to client-specific issues.
That said, HCL Tech’s Q2 results shows a notable improvement in the infrastructure services business—it grew 4.4% compared to 2% in the first quarter. The management sees a healthy outlook for this segment, which adds credence to a better second half vis-à-vis the first half of the fiscal year. It also expects the momentum in the engineering and R&D and business services continuing, which should aid growth.
The question is how much growth acceleration the company can see in the second half of the year. The Q2 results show incremental improvement in growth rates, widely expected by the market. But it is not yet clear if growth will exceed the previous year’s level, which is crucial for the stock re-rating. The third quarter results should provide more cues."
309,2018-11-01,Infosys,"TCS, Infosys, HCL, Wipro and Tech Mahindra stand to make over $1 billion in 2019-2021, says report

New Delhi: The planned rollout of 5G or fifth-generation wireless technology by telecom companies globally offers at least $10 billion business over the next six years for India’s information technology (IT) services companies, according to a Mumbai-based brokerage firm. This new technology spend by telecom firms on software and services could bring over $1.1 billion in incremental revenue over the next three years for country’s five largest companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd. 
New Delhi: The planned rollout of 5G or fifth-generation wireless technology by telecom companies globally offers at least $10 billion business over the next six years for India’s information technology (IT) services companies, according to a Mumbai-based brokerage firm. This new technology spend by telecom firms on software and services could bring over $1.1 billion in incremental revenue over the next three years for country’s five largest companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd.
This development is significant as telecom firms over the last two years had held back their spend on technology, leading to tepid growth at telecom verticals for all IT firms. A new gusher of money should further boost growth for the five largest IT firms, which share among themselves about 30% of homegrown IT companies’ business from telecom companies. 
“The impending rollout of 5G networks by telecom service providers (TSPs) globally could translate to a USD 10bn incremental market opportunity – implying a 1 ppt addition to the overall industry CAGR – over 2019-25 for the Indian IT companies, on our conservative estimates,"" Pankaj Kapoor, director of India IT services and software equity research at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, wrote in a note dated 29 October.
Homegrown IT firms got $5.4 in business during 2014-16 when telecom companies set up the 4G infrastructure and Kapoor of JM Financial estimates a higher spend of over $10 billion, although over a much longer period of six years.
The world’s largest telecom firms are looking to give a face-lift to the current 4G infrastructure as newer technologies allow them to send billions of bits of data a second, higher than the current hundreds of millions of bits of data. This, in addition to letting a consumer download a movie in seconds, also allows autonomous cars and industrial equipment to work better as they need this network of ultra-fast speeds for relaying data sets.
For now, executives at some of the largest IT firms remain optimistic on the new technology spend and maintain that much of the incremental revenue will come in from the second half of the next financial year. 
A big reason behind the optimism of Indian IT companies from this rollout of 5G infrastructure by telecom firms are some of the recent mega-IT contracts awarded to set up hardware. In July, US-based T-Mobile awarded a $3.5 billion contract to Nokia to supply 5G network gear. This was followed by T-Mobile awarding another $3.5 billion contract to Ericsson in September, under which Ericsson will offer both hardware and software to the US telecom major.
“All telecom firms first set up the hardware and software and then work for the services needed to run them. Now the contracts may not be this large but then with newer technologies needed for 5G, many of us (Indian IT firms) have the chance to offer IoT (Internet of Things) platforms, data analytics solutions and other work as part of managing the network,"" said an executive at Mumbai-based TCS. The executive did not want to be named as he is not authorized to talk to the media. 
“Recent commentaries by major operators indicate selective commercial launches could start as early as 2019, though a wider global coverage is likely to be spread over 2020-22… The biggest commercial use-case of 5G is likely to be around narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) that could open an additional market for Indian ER&D/IT services players. While the timing of project flows is difficult to predict, conservatively, we see a meaningful financial impact of 5G on Indian IT companies only from 2HFY20,"" wrote Kapoor in the note."
314,2018-11-01,Infosys,"Infosys built itself into a global giant by running the digital engine rooms of US corporations with armies of engineers in India. But the new technology center  is in the epicenter of the American Midwest

When Infosys, a big Indian technology outsourcing company, opened a new office in Indianapolis this year, executives hailed it as a step along a new path. 
When Infosys, a big Indian technology outsourcing company, opened a new office in Indianapolis this year, executives hailed it as a step along a new path.
Infosys built itself into a global giant by running the digital engine rooms of US corporations with armies of engineers in India. But the new technology center — a sprawling open-plan space in a downtown office tower — is in the epicenter of the American Midwest.
And its recruits are people like Keith Smith Jr., a graduate of Indiana University, who previously held a variety of jobs before Infosys trained him as a software engineer.
Ravi Kumar, a president of Infosys, described the office as “a manifestation of what the future is going to look like.""
The company, a shining success story in the Indian economy, is under mounting pressure to hire more Americans and do significantly more work onshore, in what would be a striking overhaul of its corporate culture and its business practices. In the process, Infosys has become a case study of how market forces and immigration changes by the Trump administration are reshaping corporations.
Infosys is staring at two daunting challenges to its long-successful business model, which generated $2.5 billion in profit in its last fiscal year. Companies are increasingly adopting technologies best built by small teams working side by side with customers, like cloud computing and mobile apps. It is work better situated in the Indianapolis tech center than thousands of miles away in India.
Policy changes from the Trump administration may be even more threatening. As part of his efforts to curb the flow of foreign workers into the United States, President Donald Trump called for tighter controls on skilled worker visas in his “Buy American, Hire American"" executive order last year.
Traditionally, Indian outsourcers like Infosys have deftly exploited the skilled-worker visa system. The majority of its employees in the United States hold one of those visas, analysts estimate. The company has also been fined by the government for abusing visa rules in the past, and its practices continue to draw the scrutiny of federal investigators.
All the steps Infosys is now taking “would be a huge change,"" said Rod Bourgeois, an expert on the industry and the head of research at Deep Dive Equity Research. “It’s not in their DNA.""
Other big offshore outsourcing companies are also responding to the market and political threats, including Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro and Cognizant. But Infosys made the biggest, most public commitment to building up its workforce in the United States when the company declared last year that it would hire 10,000 workers in the U.S. by sometime in 2019.
Then, Infosys began to announce the creation of tech centers in the U.S. Indianapolis was the first, followed by offices in Raleigh, North Carolina; Providence, Rhode Island; and Hartford, Connecticut. Last month, the company said its next hub would be in Arizona. Infosys says it has hired more than 5,800 U.S. workers.
“We will be looking for talent that is closer to our client clusters,"" said Kumar, who is the point man in the company’s initiative to hire US workers. “And our operating model will evolve.""
For now, though, an estimated 80 percent of the 200,000 Infosys workers are in India, a market that accounts for 3% of its worldwide revenue of $11 billion last year. The company garners 60 percent of its revenue in North America, mainly in the United States, where Infosys employs more than 20,000 workers, analysts estimate. About two-thirds of the Infosys workers in the US, they say, have been Indians with skilled-worker visas.
The main such visa programme, H-1B, was intended to bring in talented foreigners with special skills who would complement the domestic workforce and strengthen the US economy.
But critics say the Indian outsourcers mastered the use of legal loopholes to obtain an outsize share of skilled-worker visas, which, in turn, allowed the companies to hire less costly Indian workers.
In 2013, Infosys paid $34 million in a civil settlement with the Justice Department and other federal agencies, which accused the company of systemic abuse of visa rules, including on B-1 visas meant for short trips for training or attending conferences. In that settlement, Infosys agreed to improve its visa compliance practices.
The government continues to monitor the company. One current and two former Infosys employees, who spoke on the condition they not be identified, said they had been questioned by federal investigators in recent months about the company’s visa handling.
The Justice Department and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services did not respond to requests for comment.
Infosys also faces two private, civil lawsuits accusing the company of discrimination in hiring, promotions and firing.
The accounts from testimony and interviews with witnesses tied to those suits vary in detail. But the stories share common themes that illustrate how hard it could be for Infosys to change its ways.
The plaintiffs and witnesses were experienced lawyers, human relations managers, salespeople and engineers who joined Infosys as the company expanded rapidly in the United States. Things went smoothly at first, when the newcomers brought in new customers or smoothed the way with government agencies.
But tensions surfaced. Important decisions were all made in India. Questions were unwelcome. Complaints brought retaliation — reassignments, demotions, abrupt firings and belittling remarks.
“It’s basically a corporate caste system, run out of India,"" said Erin Green, a former immigration lawyer for Infosys, who filed one of the civil suits against the company in Texas last year. “And people who are not Indian are at the bottom.""
Daniel Kotchen, a lawyer who has a pending suit against the company in Wisconsin on behalf of former workers, said, “Infosys has a business model that is discriminatory — its rigid and explicit preference for a certain kind of person.""
Infosys is fighting the suits, denying discrimination and saying its workforce reflects the global labor pool for technology skills.
“Employment at our company,"" Infosys said in a statement, “is decided on the basis of qualifications, merit and the needs of our clients.""
Even as Infosys increases hiring in the US, its lower-paid engineers back in India still animate the business. Wage rates in India have risen in recent years, but the gap is still sizable — a third or a fourth the rates in the United States. Programming work done in India, analysts estimate, is twice as profitable as writing code in the US. On a typical project, 70% or more of the work is done in India.
The Indian employees working at US companies are often there mainly to understand customer needs and communicate with the large teams back in India. They are vital to the Infosys business, but are a fraction of the company’s engineering workforce. That formula — the so-called global delivery model — has been embraced by non-Indian companies, like IBM and Accenture, for parts of their business. But it has been the prime engine of business for Infosys.
“It may be changing some, but Infosys is certainly not abandoning its cash-cow business model,"" said Ronil Hira, an offshore outsourcing expert at Howard University.
In India, Infosys is a hiring and training machine. Its pitch in the United States is that it is transplanting a version of that model here, no matter the higher costs. “We’re going to create pools of talent that do not exist in the United States,"" Kumar said, and “strengthen the American workforce.""
The message is appealing to state governors, winning Infosys praise and tax breaks. In Indiana, Infosys says it plans to hire 3,000 workers by 2023, after a recent announcement that it would build a training center on a 70-acre site near the Indianapolis airport.
Gov. Eric Holcomb, a Republican, describes the Infosys presence as an important building block for his state’s economic development — and well worth a generous incentive package of tax credits and training grants. Holcomb shrugs off critics who claim that Infosys undercuts US workers. “They’re hiring here,"" he said."

Infosys Ltd has returned to stability, almost a year after the appointment of a new chief executive ended a tumultuous period at the Indian software and services company. 
Infosys Ltd has returned to stability, almost a year after the appointment of a new chief executive ended a tumultuous period at the Indian software and services company.
Chairman Nandan Nilekani, speaking on the sidelines of Bloomberg’s New Economy Forum in Singapore, said that the turnaround is complete. “This is all very much from the past,"" he said of the board turmoil that engulfed the company last year. “I’ve been chairman now over a year. We have an excellent CEO in Salil Parekh. Infosys is really on a very stable and forward-looking path.""
Investors seem to agree. The Bangalore-based company’s shares are up almost 30% this year, compared with a 3.1% gain in 2017. In the latest quarter, Infosys booked more than $2 billion in deals and net income topped projections. Parekh, who formally took over in January, has focused on stabilizing the company after public wrangles between its board and co-founders culminated in the dramatic exit of the well-regarded Vishal Sikka.
“The future of India’s IT services is bright because all of the world, the businesses and even governments are going through a huge digital transformation,"" Nilekani said. “Be it automobile, retail, financial services, in every industry there is massive reinvention going on.""
The same is true for Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Infosys’s bigger rival, which in April became India’s first company to top $100 billion in market value in more than a decade. Both are adjusting to the adoption of automation in key areas such as financial services, while immigration curbs hamper its ability to move workers into its largest market of the US India’s $167 billion-IT services industry is now investing in cloud computing and artificial intelligence to jump-start growth.
Nilekani also pointed to Aadhaar, India’s biometric national ID system, as an opportunity for companies like Infosys as well as a tool of empowerment for individuals. Using iris-scanning technology, the database lets people identify themselves, while private companies have embraced it as a way to authenticate job seekers, blood donors and loan applicants.
“Historically, data has benefited companies and governments,"" the Infosys chairman said. “India’s unique infrastructure, thanks to Aadhaar, thanks to its regulations, has the ability for every individual to access his own data and put it to good use. We call that data empowerment, which means a person can use his own data to get a loan, better health care, better education.""

 Mumbai: “Infosys is boring again, and that’s a good thing,"" Infosys Ltd chairman Nandan Nilekani said at Bloomberg’s New Economy Forum last week. His sigh of relief is easy to understand, especially after all the bad blood that flowed between co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy and the company’s board last year. The acrimony and the constant trading of barbs had left investors jittery, but things have been stable since Nilekani, who is also a co-founder, took over as chairman last August. 
 Mumbai: “Infosys is boring again, and that’s a good thing,"" Infosys Ltd chairman Nandan Nilekani said at Bloomberg’s New Economy Forum last week. His sigh of relief is easy to understand, especially after all the bad blood that flowed between co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy and the company’s board last year. The acrimony and the constant trading of barbs had left investors jittery, but things have been stable since Nilekani, who is also a co-founder, took over as chairman last August.
Investors are relieved too. Infosys shares have outperformed the Nifty IT index by 4.5% since the changes in the company’s board of directors in late August 2017. But things aren’t as stable as they seem.
As the chart shows, employee attrition has risen in the past three quarters under Infosys’s new chief executive officer Salil Parekh. Annualized attrition rate stood at 22.7% last quarter. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities added in a note to clients that leadership attrition, or churn among senior employees, seems to have reached worrying levels. What’s more, efforts to arrest attrition are impacting profitability. In the September quarter, Infosys’s operating profit margin narrowed to a 20-quarter low, despite large gains from the depreciation in the rupee. Note that competitor Tata Consultancy Services Ltd’s (TCS) margins widened to a 14-quarter high last quarter, on the back of higher growth and gains from a weaker rupee.
“Perhaps, employees aren’t finding Infosys’s prospects exciting enough,"" says an analyst at an institutional brokerage. “A rise in attrition, at a time when demand for IT services has picked up, is alarming."" 
 ALSO READ | Windfall for engineers as IT salaries shoot up
In other words, boring isn’t good enough for a number of Infosys employees. The related impact on margins is a worry for investors as well. While shares of Infosys have recovered from their lows soon after former CEO Vishal Sikka’s exit, they still trade at a significant discount of around 20% to TCS’s forward price-earnings multiple.
It’s interesting to note that under Sikka, Infosys’s attrition rates had sharply reduced within a few quarters, and the valuation discount with TCS had more or less disappeared. Of course, while comparing the tenure of the two CEOs, it must be noted that Sikka had joined in the first half of fiscal 2014-15, a period when attrition rates are typically higher. Parekh, on the other hand, joined in the fourth quarter of FY18, a period when attrition rates are typically at their lowest. But even after adjusting for seasonality, it’s clear that attrition fell under Sikka and is rising under Parekh.
Some analysts also sense an uneasy calm on the Murthy front. “If the company’s performance stays subdued, we wonder how long Mr Murthy will lie low,"" says an analyst at a multinational brokerage. This is clearly an area where analysts and investors will prefer things to remain boring. But Infosys’s valuations suggest investors aren’t willing to rule out that risk just yet."

303,2018-11-16,Infosys,"Infosys ADS holders have complained that the IT firms's issue of bonus American Depositary Shares in September added to their cost of owning the securities without any concomitant benefits

New Delhi: Holders of Infosys Ltd’s American Depositary Shares (ADSs) have complained that the company’s issue of bonus ADSs in September has added to their cost of owning the securities without any concomitant benefits. They have, in a letter to Infosys’s chief financial officer M.D. Ranganath, asked the Bengaluru-based company to review its ADS programme and refund over $3.7 million to its ADS holders in depository fees collected by the firm on account of issuing new securities. 
New Delhi: Holders of Infosys Ltd’s American Depositary Shares (ADSs) have complained that the company’s issue of bonus ADSs in September has added to their cost of owning the securities without any concomitant benefits. They have, in a letter to Infosys’s chief financial officer M.D. Ranganath, asked the Bengaluru-based company to review its ADS programme and refund over $3.7 million to its ADS holders in depository fees collected by the firm on account of issuing new securities.
The development comes at a time when Infosys is still to name a successor to Ranganath, who decided to step down in August. On Thursday, Infosys named Jayesh Sanghrajka as the interim chief financial officer, effective 17 November.
“In our considered opinion, the consequent cost of your share dividend to the beneficial owners of Infosys ADSs is both unreasonable and excessive,"" George H. Gregor, managing partner of Global Capital Service Group Ltd, said in the 11 November letter. “We intend to speak with current ADS holders and the press to make them aware of your wanton disregard for investor costs and to discuss next steps and available remedies in this regard.""
Mint has reviewed a copy of the letter.
New York-based Global Capital Service Group, which offers advisory services to investors, said that Infosys should have refrained from charging issuance fees on the new ADS and the company could have either reduced the ongoing depository service fees paid by ADS holders or reduced the number of outstanding ADS.
In July, Infosys offered its shareholders an additional share for every share held as the company celebrated 25 years of stock market listing. Consequently, the number of ADSs also more than doubled to 745.58 million at the end of September 2018 from 372.79 million at the end of June. That led to an increase in the fees to own the ADSs.
In the year-ended March 2018, Infosys earned about $9 million in fees from the ADS programme.
An email sent to Infosys seeking comment went unanswered.
Some corporate advisory firms see merit in the latest claim raised by some ADS owners, which hold 17% equity in Infosys.
“Infosys is perceived to be a shareholder-friendly company. So the rationale of charging a fee on additional shares by the company does not make sense. After all, the company has over $5 billion in cash; so why will a company force some investors to complain for $4 million,"" said the head of a proxy-advisory firm, who did not want to be named.
Gregor said Infosys’s decision to issue bonus shares has doubled the annual cost of remaining invested in Infosys ADSs.
“To an institutional investor such as, for example, Blackrock Inc., which previously held approximately 100 million ADSs, the position has now doubled to in excess of 200 million ADSs with zero added value to such investor. The delivery of additional ADSs cost Blackrock more than $1 million in ADS issuance fees charged by your depositary, and the continuing annual service fees charged by your depositary will double from approximately $4 million paid by Blackrock in 2017 (assuming they held a position of 100 million ADSs at that time) to more than $8 million in 2018 (assuming your depositary intends to collect another fee of $.01 per ADSs before the year is through),"" Gregor wrote in the letter."

New Delhi: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has kicked up a social media storm in India after a picture of him with a placard saying “smash Brahminical patriarchy"", referring to the highest Hindu caste, went viral in one of the company’s fastest-growing markets.
The picture, posted on Twitter on Sunday by a journalist who was part of group of women journalists, activists, writers whom Dorsey met during a visit to India last week, had him clutching a poster of a woman holding up a banner with the line that has offended many Indians.
Several prominent Indians, including T.V. Mohandas Pai, a former finance chief of software exporter Infosys, accused Dorsey of “hate mongering"" against Brahmins.
“Tomorrow if @jack is given a poster with anti Semitic messages in a meeting, will his team allow him to hold it up?,"" Pai tweeted. “Why is that any different? Inciting hate against any community is wrong.""
Twitter India said the poster was handed to Dorsey by a Dalit activist - Dalits are at the bottom of the social hierarchy in Hinduism - when it hosted a closed-door discussion with a group of women to know more about their experience using Twitter.
It added the poster was a “tangible reflection of our company’s efforts to see, hear, and understand all sides of important public conversations that happen on our service around the world"".
Late on Monday, Vijaya Gadde, legal, policy and trust and safety lead at Twitter who accompanied Dorsey to India, apologised.
“I’m very sorry for this. It’s not reflective of our views. We took a private photo with a gift just given to us - we should have been more thoughtful,"" she said in a tweet. “Twitter strives to be an impartial platform for all. We failed to do that here & we must do better to serve our customers in India.""
Twitter, whose monthly active users globally averaged 326 million in the July-September quarter, does not disclose the number of its users in India but its executives have said that the country was one of its fastest growing.
Its use is only expected to grow in India in the coming months as political parties in the country of 1.3 billion try to expand their reach to voters ahead of a general election due by May.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with 44.4 million followers, is one of its biggest supporters.
“I enjoy being on this medium, where I’ve made great friends and see everyday the creativity of people,"" Modi tweeted last week after meeting Dorsey in New Delhi.

294,2018-12-20,Infosys,"Mark Livingston, former Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. executive, joined Infosys last week as the head of its consulting business

New Delhi: A year into his role as chief executive officer of Infosys Ltd, Salil Parekh has made the first big hire at India’s second-largest information technology (IT) services firm by naming former Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. executive Mark Livingston the head of the consulting business. 
New Delhi: A year into his role as chief executive officer of Infosys Ltd, Salil Parekh has made the first big hire at India’s second-largest information technology (IT) services firm by naming former Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. executive Mark Livingston the head of the consulting business.
Livingston, who scaled up Cognizant’s consulting practice from less than 1,000 consultants in 2008 to a 6,500-strong unit before leaving the Nasdaq-listed firm in February last year, joined Infosys last week, according to an executive familiar with the development.
This comes in the wake of Ken Toombs resigning as head of the consulting unit in October.
For now, it is not clear if Livingston, who reported to CEO Francisco D’Souza at Cognizant, will report to Parekh.
Infosys declined to comment.
Under Parekh, Infosys has looked at strengthening its consulting business. The company has made three acquisitions, across the US, Europe and Japan over the last nine months. It spent $75 million in April to buy WongDoody, the US-based ad agency, followed by a $76 million payout to buy Fluido, a Salesforce consulting partner in the Nordics in Europe. Earlier this month, Infosys stitched a joint venture with three Japanese companies, including Hitachi, Panasonic and Pasona, with the aim of scaling up business in Japan.
Livingston’s appointment is significant for three reasons, according to analysts and executives.
First, since taking over as the second non-founder CEO of Infosys after Vishal Sikka resigned last year, Parekh has appeared mindful of the cultural risks associated with hiring senior leaders from outside the company.
“Controlled outside hiring minimizes the risk of a culture hijack and creation of us versus them camps, that can result from a sudden influx from senior leaders from outside,"" JP Morgan Chase and Co. analyst Viju George wrote in a note to investors on 2 September, after meeting Parekh.
Thus, Livingston’s appointment reaffirms that Parekh is now looking to hire talent from outside the company in areas in which Infosys does not have required skill sets.
Parekh is believed to be a leader who understands the consulting space as he first worked with EY’s consulting division and then at Capgemini after it bought the former.
“My sense is we have a tremendous opportunity and options within, and now I’ve started to see quite a few people from outside who are calling me, or calling us, to join the leadership levels from some of our competitors,"" Parekh said in an earlier interview. “So we have the opportunity to start bringing people from outside as well. So far, I’ve not done that, but over time it will be a mix, predominantly of internal candidates and occasionally some external as well.""
Second, over the last four years, the consulting business has been an Achilles heel for Infosys as the company has struggled to leverage its consulting arm to win more business from clients: For much of his three-year stint, Sikka acknowledged his company’s struggles to bolster its consulting business.
Over the last few years, Indian IT vendors, led by Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Wipro, have looked to build a consulting practice as they realized that it offered an opportunity when large enterprises over the world looked to simplify their existing technology and business operations. A strong consulting practice helps, especially as most Fortune 1000 companies want their IT vendors to offer them solutions in areas of data analytics and artificial intelligence-led platforms to help them run their business better.
Unlike Accenture Plc, homegrown IT firms do not get any significant business in fees from offering thought leadership and club revenue from software application development and implementation when reporting business from consulting practice. In the year ended 31 March, Infosys claimed to generate one-third or $3.54 billion of its $10.94 billion in revenue from what it called “consulting and package implementation"".
Finally, Infosys over the last many years has looked at different approaches to build a strong consulting practice: from acquiring a pure-ply company like Swiss consulting unit Lodestone in 2012 to having a product-led approach in building consulting business by hiring executives from SAP and other product-led firms.
“Now, it seems that Infosys is looking to take a leaf out of its peers, especially as Cognizant is considered to having the strongest consulting practice,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage on the condition of anonymity."

For Airtel, Roy leaving the company is the second high-profile exit since after its chief technology officer Shyam Mardikar quit to join rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. “The board has accepted the resignation of Nilanjan Roy with effect from 28 February 2019,"" Airtel said in a filing to the exchanges.

Gopalakrishnan) and Rohan Murty (son of co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy’s son) among others.
In the next share buyback plan, Infosys could buy shares at around 20%-25% premium to the current market value, reported TOI, adding that the programme could see some founding members tendering their shares.
Rivals Tata Consultancy Services, HCL Technologies, Wipro and Mindtree had also announced buyback plans recently."

290,2019-01-02,Infosys,"Tech firms, including TCS, Infosys and Wipro, generated more revenue than ever before from standalone outsourcing deals signed in 2018

New Delhi: The twin trends of outsourcing larger technology contracts and Fortune 1000 companies awarding work that was earlier done internally to its vendors have led analysts and information technology executives to suggest that the sector could grow faster in the year starting 1 April. 
New Delhi: The twin trends of outsourcing larger technology contracts and Fortune 1000 companies awarding work that was earlier done internally to its vendors have led analysts and information technology executives to suggest that the sector could grow faster in the year starting 1 April.
These trends are the third positive development for India’s $167 billion information technology (IT) outsourcing sector, after the first six months of the current fiscal saw IT firms adding more employees and raising salaries of some of them by as much as 40%.
“Digital spend is industrializing a little bit, moving from pilots and PoC (proof of concepts) to big spends. That should look well overall for the industry, so I am quite optimistic,"" Nasscom chairman Rishad Premji said in an interaction with Mint last month. “The other interesting and exciting thing is, again at broad basis, the return of larger deals.""
The ability of IT companies to offer solutions through mobility and data crunching platforms that allows their clients, from Citigroup Inc. to Walmart Inc., to do their business more efficiently saw the technology vendors generating more revenue from stand-alone deals signed in 2018 than ever before.
This development is one reason for improved growth at some of the largest companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS).
The largest IT services companies, including TCS, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd, shared this optimism when they briefed analysts at an event organized by outsourcing research firm HFS Research in New York on 12 and 13 December.
“[M]anagement shared that 50% of the value of new deals are coming from 25% of the new signings, which implies that contracts are longer in duration with increasing complexity,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a 17 December note.
Bachman made the observation after speaking with the management of Genpact, the New York-based business process and technology management firm, at the HFS event.
For close to a decade, outsourcing deals shrank as tech work became commoditized. An added challenge for IT firms was the rise of in-sourcing, which saw several large clients setting up their own technology units or captives to do the tech work.
However, 2018 saw this change, according to three executives from TCS, Cognizant and Wipro.
“Several service providers discussed clients that have taken work in-house out of frustration with service providers, but have experienced difficulty in implementing new technologies without external help. As a result, clients are returning to service providers with more realistic expectations,"" Bachman wrote in the note.
“I do not see a huge rush to captives—the big issue is talent shortages in higher value areas, such as digital, AI (artificial intelligence), analytics, machine learning, etc. No one wants to hire those internally—the talent is too expensive and hard to retain,"" said Phil Fersht, chief executive officer of HFS Research. “Hence, we are witnessing a resurgence in services based on higher-value services and deeper, more consultative partnering.""
“In a nutshell what we are witnessing is the shift from ‘outsourcing’ to ‘real value partnering’ and the winning providers are those who can convert to the latter with smart talent and operating model investments,"" said Fersht.
TCS, Infosys and Wipro declined to comment as all three are in a quiet period ahead of declaring their December quarter results.
Since December last year, Mumbai-based TCS and Bengaluru-based Wipro have won four multi-year mega deals, which will together generate over $7.2 billion in revenue.
“A lot of deals, beyond the four mega deals, have seen integrated traditional offerings like infrastructure maintenance and BPO, along with deployment of data analytics platforms and some level of automation. This means that a resulting contract is of larger value than a pure-play traditional work,"" an executive at TCS said on the condition of anonymity."
289,2019-01-04,Infosys,"Digital accounts for less than a third of overall revenue of Indian IT companies, including TCS, Infosys and Wipro. Any slowdown in the US economy will hurt their growth

New Delhi: Concerns about a slowdown in US economy poses the biggest risk to India’s $167 billion information technology (IT) outsourcing industry as experts fear Fortune 1000 companies may cut spending on technology, hurting Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd. Demand for digital services, which includes data crunching and artificial intelligence (AI) powered platforms, is still linked to the overall health of an economy, they say. 
New Delhi: Concerns about a slowdown in US economy poses the biggest risk to India’s $167 billion information technology (IT) outsourcing industry as experts fear Fortune 1000 companies may cut spending on technology, hurting Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd. Demand for digital services, which includes data crunching and artificial intelligence (AI) powered platforms, is still linked to the overall health of an economy, they say.
For this reason, analysts will be closely monitoring management commentary from homegrown IT firms on the growth outlook for the companies when they report earnings starting next week. Mumbai-based TCS kicks off the earnings season, when it reports its results on 10 January, followed by Infosys a day later and Wipro on 18 January.
“If the economies of the world are going to suddenly change in terms of their performance, it will certainly have a bearing on enterprises and, as a consequence, on technology companies. I can see that correlation translate at some level,"" Nasscom chairman Rishad Premji said in an interaction with Mint last month. “So, if the question is ‘if economies of the world are not doing well, will corporations continue to spend on digital?’ I would submit no. So, for now, there’s no decoupling (between economic growth and performance of IT firms)."" (read more)
Over the last two months, many economists and brokerages have flagged that the US will slow down in 2019.
Economists at Morgan Stanley expect a 2.3% growth in the current year from an estimated 2.9% growth in 2018.
US accounts for bulk of business, between 55% and 70% for the five largest companies, including TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies Ltd, Wipro and Tech Mahindra.
A weak growth could derail the uptick witnessed in the IT outsourcing industry in the past 12 months, an uptick in larger technology contracts getting outsourced and most companies awarding work that was earlier done internally to its vendors. The first six months of the current fiscal saw Indian IT companies adding more employees and raising salaries of some of them by as much as 40%.
“We need to wait and see how all of this impact the client budgets (technology spend) in the coming two-three months,"" a Wipro executive said on the condition of anonymity, as the company is in a silent period ahead of its earnings.
Digital accounts for less than a third of overall revenue at each of these companies, and that explains why any slowdown in the US will hurt growth at these companies.
“We believe a key question for Accenture, and the rest of our IT services coverage, is how defensive is its business model in the face of slowing global GDP, or even a recession,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a 20 December note. Bachman maintains that “consulting projects would be “aggressively cut in a recession"".
Bachman made the observation after Accenture Plc declared its results. At least two analysts quizzed the management on the impact of a macroeconomic slowdown on company’s growth during the management’s post-earnings interaction with analysts.
“[W]hen it’s raining hard, either you watch the rain or you build an umbrella. At Accenture, we decided to build an umbrella. And what the umbrella is made of, if you will, probably seven key elements which I truly believe are making Accenture more resilient and more durable across different cycles,"" said Pierre Nanterme, chief executive officer, Accenture on 20 December.
Accenture claims that over 60% of its business comes from newer technologies and digital and maintains that the firm will be a beneficiary.
“[I]n Brazil, they say how are you (Accenture) growing double-digits in Brazil, with terrible economic conditions? Because in Brazil, we are the number one. We are the market leader. And when times are tough, you remember the flight to quality. I would use the same comparison which is flight to leadership. When times are tough, clients are going to the leader with all the characteristics we have and the values,"" said Nanterme.
On Thursday, share prices of TCS and Infosys fell 1.39% and 0.26%, respectively, while that of Wipro rose 0.09% on the BSE. The benchmark Sensex lost 1.05%, or 377.81 points, to end the day at 35,513.71."

New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Tuesday constituted a high-level committee headed by former chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) Nandan Nilekani to set up a robust digital payments ecosystem in the country. 
New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Tuesday constituted a high-level committee headed by former chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) Nandan Nilekani to set up a robust digital payments ecosystem in the country.
The committee has been asked to review the existing status of digitization of payments, identify gaps in the ecosystem and suggest ways to plug them.
According to its terms of reference, the panel has to suggest a medium-term strategy for deepening digital payments, and measures to strengthen safety and security.
“The committee shall submit its report within a period of 90 days from the date of its first meeting,"" the RBI said.
“Looking forward to working with the @RBI and the committee to re-imagine payments for India and Indians!,"" tweeted Nandan Nilekani hours after RBI’s announcement.
Besides Aadhaar architect Nilekani, the other members of the panel are former RBI deputy governor H.R. Khan, former managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) of Vijaya Bank Kishore Sansi, former secretary in the ministry of IT Aruna Sharma and chief innovation officer at the Center for Innovation, Incubation and Entrepreneurship, IIM Ahmedabad, Sanjay Jain.
The terms of reference also include: “To undertake cross country analyses with a view to identify best practices that can be adopted in our country to accelerate digitization of the economy and financial inclusion through greater use of digital payments.""
The panel has also been tasked with the responsibility of increasing customer confidence and trust while they access financial services through digital modes.
Vishwas Patel, chairman of Payments Council of India (PCI), the industry body that represents digital payments companies, welcomed the move and said that all the members of PCI will actively work with the new committee in driving digital payments in the country.
“It is a great step to get specific experts who understand the payments space to identify the issues and give suggestions on what should be done. Each of these five members have already contributed well in this space and will continue to do so,"" he said.
The promotion of digital payments has been one of the primary agendas of the government in the past four years. 
Payments through all electronic forms such as debit and credit cards, mobile wallets, real-time gross settlement (RTGS), national electronic funds transfer (NEFT) and Unified Payments Interface (UPI) have seen a huge rise over the last few years, especially since the government’s demonetization exercise in November 2016.
The newest mode of digital payments, UPI, which was launched in 2016 has witnessed an over 300% rise in transaction volumes in the last year and the growth is seen continuing in the near term. 
A record 620.17 million UPI transactions worth just over  ₹ 1 trillion were conducted in December, as compared to 524.94 million transactions valued at  ₹ 82,232.21 crore in November—an 18% increase in transaction volume, data from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) showed."

Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning will not render people jobless in the future, but rather create more opportunities for humans, Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy said here.
The renowned IT Industrialist noted that technology provides an opportunity for people to move from drudgery to tasks that require more human touch.
“AI definitely is a very important topical area of computer sciences. AI, machine learning, big data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), these are all areas which are likely to make the lives of human beings even more comfortable,"" Murthy told PTI.
Giving the example of the US, the UK, and Japan, which embraced technology early on, he noted that these countries have been able to reduce unemployment rates to single digits.
According to a World Economic Forum (WEF) report, the rapid evolution of machines and algorithms in the workplace could create 133 million new roles in place of 75 million that will be displaced by 2022.
“If you observe the economic history of this world in the last 50 years when computers started playing a bigger role, you can realise that those countries that absorb technology more enthusiastically, have reduced their unemployment much more than those which did not embrace technology,"" Murthy said.
Dismissing the argument that technology renders people unemployed he said that “it is not really true."" “What technology does is it provides an opportunity for human beings to move from drudgery tasks to tasks that require more and more human touch,"" he added.
Murthy noted the automated teller machines (ATMs) are a classic example of technology making human lives easier as they have removed “this whole drudgery of tellers"" and brought the convenience of withdrawing money from a nearby machine whenever you want, and at any time.
“I am not a believer that technology will render societies into a state of higher and higher unemployment,"" he said on the sidelines of the Infosys Prize ceremony here on Saturday.
The Infosys Prize is an annual award given to scientists, researchers, engineers and social scientists by the Infosys Science Foundation (ISF) and ranks among the highest monetary awards in India to recognise research.
Six eminent professors were awarded the Infosys Prize 2018 across different categories of science and research.

The fruits of the weak rupee should be visible in the earnings of IT companies in the December quarter. Kotak Institutional Equities estimates earnings of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) to rise 26%. The company will report its earnings for the third quarter (Q3) on Thursday. TCS is expected to benefit from the recovery in growth rates in key business verticals, operating efficiencies and rupee depreciation. 
The fruits of the weak rupee should be visible in the earnings of IT companies in the December quarter. Kotak Institutional Equities estimates earnings of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) to rise 26%. The company will report its earnings for the third quarter (Q3) on Thursday. TCS is expected to benefit from the recovery in growth rates in key business verticals, operating efficiencies and rupee depreciation.
Infosys Ltd, which is slated to release its earnings on Friday, is projected to report the weakest profit growth among large companies. Its earnings are estimated to grow a mere 9%, weighed down by higher employee expenses and investments in sales. The company has been battling high attrition, and had to dole out incentives and bonuses to try and arrest the trend.
However, by and large, IT firms are expected to gain. Besides, though the macroeconomic situation remains volatile, they had won large deals, which should aid volume growth in the near term. In the December quarter in particular, volumes tend to be a bit sluggish when compared sequentially, given furloughs at clients. Even so, considering the large deal wins, analysts are baking in sequential revenue growth of 1.8% for TCS."
282,2019-01-11,Infosys,"Five things to watch out for in Infosys' December quarter earnings announcement on Friday

Bengaluru: Nandan Nilekani and Salil Parekh are quite content that Infosys Ltd has become a boring company. It is understandable why the chairman and chief executive officer of India’s second largest information technology (IT) services firm intend to make it even more boring. Infosys, under earlier boss Vishal Sikka, was always on the front pages of newspapers, albeit not always for reasons the company would have hoped. As Sikka often complained in the past, this unending stream of news proved to be a distraction for the senior management. Eventually Sikka resigned in August 2017. Worse, employee morale took a hit. Predictably, all this impacted the share price as Infosys’ share underperformed in 2017. 
Bengaluru: Nandan Nilekani and Salil Parekh are quite content that Infosys Ltd has become a boring company. It is understandable why the chairman and chief executive officer of India’s second largest information technology (IT) services firm intend to make it even more boring. Infosys, under earlier boss Vishal Sikka, was always on the front pages of newspapers, albeit not always for reasons the company would have hoped. As Sikka often complained in the past, this unending stream of news proved to be a distraction for the senior management. Eventually Sikka resigned in August 2017. Worse, employee morale took a hit. Predictably, all this impacted the share price as Infosys’ share underperformed in 2017.
The next year was different. Infosys in 2018 focused on doing business quietly. During the July-October quarter, Infosys for the first time in its history, managed to win more than $2 billion in contracts in a quarter. Infosys shares jumped 27% in 2018, emerging as the fourth-best Sensex scrip.
Still, two areas which will test the resolve of Parekh are employee attrition and Infosys’ ability to translate impressive deal wins into actual revenue. Infosys’ attrition and senior management departure continues to be high. Again, Infosys has won a good number of deals in the past but it has failed to translate them entirely on account of poor execution.
These two themes, along with the company’s performance in the October-December period, will be watched when Infosys declares its third quarter earnings on Friday.
Mint turns the spotlight on five things to watch out for in Infosys’ earnings on 11 January:
1. Revenue growth and management commentary for the financial year: Infosys is estimated to post sequential dollar revenue growth of 1.5% in the October-December period, according to an analyst at brokerage JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd. This is 10 basis points higher than what the brokerage expects from TCS’ earnings. A higher growth rate, despite the Mumbai-based TCS being almost twice the size of the Bengaluru-based Infosys, should cheer investors. Management commentary on the demand outlook for the fourth quarter and for the next financial year will be crucial.
2. Will Infosys retain its full-year revenue guidance? In April, Infosys first outlined full-year growth 6-8% in constant currency terms and 7-9% in dollar terms. In October, Infosys retained its annual growth of at best 8% in constant currency terms even though it discontinued its practice of issuing full-year dollar revenue growth outlook. JM Financial’s analyst Pankaj Kapoor estimates Infosys will narrow its 2018-19 growth to 7-8%. Infosys’s investors should be mindful that TCS will grow at least 10% in constant currency terms in the current financial year. Nilekani and Parekh surely cannot rest on their performance, and both will need to steer Infosys to grow better in the fiscal year beginning April. Expectedly, management commentary on the business trajectory will be watched.
3. Can Infosys arrest its industry-leading attrition level? Under Parekh, Infosys’ IT services business has seen an attrition level of 16.6% at the end of the March quarter last year and 20.6% and 19.9% at the end of June and September quarters, respectively. Worryingly, Infosys continues to see the departure of senior leaders. All of this needs to be swiftly addressed, reckon analysts, before Parekh can be credited with having successfully stabilized Infosys. Understandably, attrition rates and management commentary on employee departure will be eyed.
4. How is Infosys improving its execution? Infosys has won over $3 billion worth of deals in the first six months of the current financial year. Agreed, this is less than a third of the $9.8 billion in deals won by TCS, a company almost twice the size of Infosys, during this period. Surely Infosys needs to improve further its ability to win deals. But a bigger challenge ahead for Infosys is to translate deal wins into actual business. This is because Infosys in the past has at times been plagued by poor execution, which led to lower actual revenue than the promised deal wins. Management commentary on how business is translating from deal wins will be eyed. 
5. Share buyback: At the start of the year, Infosys, as part of its capital allocation policy, had outlined that the company intended to return  ₹ 2,600 crore in dividends and another  ₹ 10,400 crore through other means, including buyback, to shareholders. Considering Infosys’ last share buyback was completed in December 2017 and since a listed company can do only one share repurchase in a year, it is no surprise that the board will discuss the issue of share repurchase on 11 January. Analysts will watch if the share buyback along with the performance is able to shore up the share price in the coming week."
278,2019-01-11,Infosys,"Panaya was a bone of contention between founder Narayana Murthy and former CEO Vishal Sikka

New Delhi: Remember Panaya? It was among Infosys Ltd’s most ambitious buys that eventually became a bone of contention between founder Narayana Murthy and the then chief executive officer and managing director Vishal Sikka. Infosys then tried to exit the Israeli enterprise software management company after Vishal Sikka was forced out of the company. It has now shelved that exercise.

Infosys then tried to exit the Israeli enterprise software management company after Vishal Sikka was forced out of the company. It has now shelved that exercise.
The company on Friday said it had declassified the provider of automation technology as well as other sell-off candidates as “held for sale"". This includes Kallidus and Skava. It had bought e-commerce services provider Kallidus for $120 million. This gave it access to the holding group behind San Francisco-based Skava, a cloud-based platform provider of online services for retailers. All the acquisitions happened in 2015.
“During the quarter ended December 31, 2018, based on evaluation of proposals received and progress of negotiations with potential buyers, the company concluded it was no longer highly probable that the sale would be consummated by 31 March 2019,"" the company said in a statement.
Also read: The backstory to Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka’s resignation
Infosys has been an acquisition-shy company, choosing instead to sit on cash — it conducted its first-ever share buyback in 2017 and announced another one on Friday. Sikka, bubbling with ideas as the company’s first non-founder CEO and a desire to move the traditional bread-and-butter software exporter to a company riding on automation and artificial intelligence, tried to change that. Panaya was a step in that direction — Infosys bought it at an enterprise value of $200 million.
Murthy accused Sikka of not being transparent in the deal, while also charging him of other misdemeanours. An April 13 story by Mint mentioned how the company’s then chief financial officer Rajiv Bansal walked out of a board meeting, protesting against the acquisition.
Later, a generous severance package to Bansal was questioned by shareholders and Murthy. A whistleblower claimed that the acquisition was overvalued and this became the foundation for allegations that the company, under Sikka, had bought out Bansal’s silence. Once Sikka was ousted, the company held back further payments to Bansal. The case went into arbitration and Bansal won.
In the December quarter, the company took a one-off depreciation charge and amortisation expenses of $12 million on its books, which hit its margins. Infosys will now continue to hold companies at a reduced fair value with plans to repurpose Skava’s micro services-based business and refocus Panaya’s suite of products."
280,2019-01-12,Infosys,"At its maximum price and size, the buyback will include 103.250 million shares, comprising around 2.36% of the company's paid-up capital on a standalone basis

New Delhi: The Infosys board on Friday approved a share buyback for up to  ₹ 800 a piece, which will cost the company around  ₹ 8,260 crore. This is the second share buyback in the company’s history. The first was in December 2017. A company can do a share repurchase only once a year. That moratorium ended last month for the company.

The first was in December 2017. A company can do a share repurchase only once a year. That moratorium ended last month for the company.
At its maximum price and size, the buyback will include 103.250 million shares, comprising around 2.36% of the paid-up capital of the company on a standalone basis. The company’s equity comprises 4.36 billion shares.
Infosys’ first buyback, at  ₹ 1,150 per share, had returned around  ₹ 13,000 crore to shareholders. 
In April 2018, Infosys had outlined its capital allocation policy under which it said it intended to return its shareholders  ₹ 2,600 crore in dividend and another  ₹ 10,400 crore through other means, including a buyback.
All big IT companies like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HCL Technologies (HCL) and Wipro announced large share buybacks in the last two years.
A share buyback is generally not looked at favourably by investors since it indicates lack of opportunities for the company to utilise cash more effectively. The company, faced with few opportunities to deploy cash and mindful of the fact that a large pile sitting on the books drags down return on equity and hence shareholder value, finds it better to return money to shareholders.
In markets such as the US and Europe, large institutional investors do not take kindly to companies sitting on cash and often force them to return money to shareholders through such exercises."
279,2019-01-12,Infosys,"The company won $1.57 billion of large deals in the December quarter, the second consecutive three-month period of such wins after netting over $2 billion of orders during July-September

New Delhi: Infosys Ltd today revised its revenue guidance for 2018-19 upwards to 8.5%-9.0% from 6%-8% given in April last year. A leg-up in the company’s outlook for its revenues for the year came on the back of what its Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Salil Parekh said was a strong pipeline.

The company won $1.57 billion of large deals in the December quarter, the second consecutive three-month period of such wins after netting over $2 billion of orders during July-September. The company has won $4.7 billion in large deals in the three concluded quarters of the ongoing financial year.
“Many of our segments are growing well. We have a strong pipeline and deal wins. That’s giving us the confidence,"" Parekh said in his comments on the results during a press conference. 
The company notched up revenues of $2.98 billion in October-December, a growth of 2.7% in constant currency terms from the immediate previous quarter. This brought the company’s revenues for the first three quarters of the ongoing financial year to $8.74 billion. The company had closed the last financial year with $10.93 billion in revenues.
The Bengaluru-headquartered company retained its forecast for 22%-24% operating margin for the ongoing financial year. The company was held back on forecasting improved margins as well as the benchmark eroded by 110 basis points from the September quarter to 22.6%. This also hurt its profits that came at $502 million, shaving off 13.6% from the second quarter.
The company’s top management said de-classification of its subsidiaries Skava and Panaya as “held for sale"" and its investment in building capacity for sales had hurt margins. One-offs like additional depreciation charge and acquisition expenses led to the margin suffering. The company had in September acquired Fluido. The Finnish company is a consulting partner of Salesforce, the US-based giant that provides cloud-based software services for customer relationship management."

Infosys, India’s second largest firm, had on Friday reported a 30% drop in its December quarter net profit on higher expenses even as it approved a  ₹ 8,260-crore share buyback—the second in less than 13 months’ time.
Its net profit slumped to  ₹ 3,610 crore in October-December 2018 from  ₹ 5,129 crore in the same period a year ago, the company said in a statement.
In spite of the drop in quarterly profit, the company raised its revenue growth forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2019 to 8.5-9% in constant currency terms, from 6-8% previously. Revenue from operations rose 20.3 per cent to  ₹ 21,400 crore.
Infosys said it will buy back 10.32 crore shares, or 2.36%, for no more than  ₹ 800 per share—17% higher than the closing price of  ₹ 683.70 per share on the BSE.
Infosys also declared a special dividend of  ₹ 4 per share.
Sanjeev Hota, assistant vice-president (research) at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said, Infosys’s performance surprised positively with strong top-line growth for the quarter, though margin performance missed the mark.
“Increase in revenue guidance and better exit rate for FY19 provides comfort on double digit growth in FY20. Buyback quantum seems to be below than expectation, however, will support the stock performance in medium term,"" he added."

Apart from the fact that the shares came off a low base, there have been signs of improvement in growth rates under the new CEO, Salil Parekh. In that backdrop, Infosys Q3 results come as a big reinforcement of that belief.
Growth is certainly back to decent levels. The constant currency revenue growth of 10.1% from a year ago is notably higher than Street estimates. Importantly, Infosys also revised FY19 growth upwards by about 100 basis points. This implies growth momentum should continue into the fourth quarter, and return to double-digit growth is certainly something that will excite investors.
While the Infosys Q3 results were declared after Indian markets closed on Friday, the company’s American depository receipts rose more than 5% on the New York Stock Exchange.
Traditionally, the second half of the fiscal year is relatively softer for software companies due to fewer working days on account of Christmas and New Year holidays. So for Infosys to raise its forecast based on its second-half performance is quite unusual. The firm raised its growth forecast to 8.5-9% from 6-8% earlier.
Deal wins have been strong, too. Infosys won 14 large deals amounting to about $1.5 billion last quarter. Cumulatively deal wins so far in FY19 stand at $4.7 billion, more than double the orders Infosys booked in the year-ago period.
But the optimism is yet to reflect in its profitability. Operating margin narrowed 1.1 percentage points sequentially and 1.7 percentage points from a year ago. While there were some one-offs, even after adjusting for them, margins were lower than Street estimates. But investors seem to be in the mood to ignore margin-related concerns, given the strong pickup in growth.
Infosys is investing in building sales and digital capabilities, besides giving related compensation hikes to tame attrition. In addition, transition costs in large deals are leading to softness in margins. The investments are expected to continue, implying the trend of soft margins should continue in the near term.
While growth is back, it has to be seen if momentum will sustain on a higher base. Growth in the last two quarters came off a relatively low base.
That said, Infosys trades at a sizeable valuation discount vis-à-vis bigger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, and the large share buyback should also help support the former’s stock. The buyback price is at a 16% premium to the last closing price of the stock. Importantly, it will be implemented through the open market route, which means the company will be regularly buying shares from the market and this will support the Infosys stock."

Ganapathy Subramaniam said without naming the companies that are resorting to discounts to boost revenue growth. “We are not worried about the pricing play of our competition because we have always maintained you cannot compromise margins to funnel growth.""
Examples abound in the world of business of how retaliatory price slashing results in a precipitous drop in industry profitability. With TCS’s December quarter (Q3) operating income of $1.35 billion is almost double that of its nearest local rival Infosys Ltd, the Mumbai-based company can use other tactics in its arsenal to stave off the debilitating effects of a price war.
“Pricing alone is not the criteria. So, when we say we will be aggressive, what we are saying is that you need to have a solution, the sleekness of the solution, the ability to create business value, and how you are committing to growth parameters (of a client). All of this makes a winning proposition for clients,"" clarified Subramaniam.
Some analysts had interpreted that TCS might lower its pricing in some work it does after the management told analysts in a post-earnings interaction on Thursday that the firm plans to participate aggressively when it spots a demand opportunity.
TCS reported a Q3 operating margin of 25.6%, about three percentage points wider than Infosys’s 22.6%, highlighting how the Mumbai-based TCS is generating more revenue at higher profitability.
Significantly, until the Q3 of 2008-09, Infosys earned more for its services offered, as its $373 million in operating profit was more than TCS’s $367.2 million.
TCS said it continues to work towards operating between a 26% and 28% profitability band, even as Infosys in April last year dropped its profit outlook to between 22% and 24% for the current fiscal.
Many analysts say this was on account of the company looking to drop prices for its services, although Infosys maintains that the reason for the lowering of profitability is to plough back the savings to invest in digital technologies and also cover expenses related to hiring more locals in the US and pay more to hire the brightest engineers.
The underlying reason for declining profitability at Infosys and other large IT firms, including Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, is that there is pricing pressure on commoditized deals or traditional information technology work, which still account for over three-fourths of total revenues.
These firms maintain they earn more money on work related to digital, the fuzzy umbrella term that each firm uses to call revenue generated from areas generally classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud computing, and Internet of Things.
However, digital still brings less than a third of the overall business.
Worryingly for investors of Infosys, some analysts say the company’s profitability will remain challenged in the current quarter and will be unchanged in the fiscal beginning April.
“We project margins to be roughly flat in FY20,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 11 January.
“We think margins will be lower sequentially in 4Q, as INFY (Infosys) will have a negative impact from INR appreciation, and has continued expenses in localization, reskilling, and compensation changes to help lower attrition. Also, we think there is a ramp time for new deals, which we expect will also weigh on margins in 4Q. In FY20, we project 23.0% operating margins, as we think investments will stabilize though FX will be a headwind,"" wrote Bachman."

The board will also consider a proposal for issue of bonus shares at the meeting.

If Wipro announces a bonus issue, it will be second such move by the Bengaluru-headquartered IT services company in two years. In 2017, Wipro had announced a 1:1 bonus issue.
Cash-rich Indian IT companies have been returning cash in their books to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Also in 2017, Wipro had carried out an  ₹ 11,000 crore share buyback programme.
When a company announces bonus issue, the number of outstanding shares goes up as investors get extra shares. The face value of a company’s share does not change but it increases the liquidity of shares in the market. Bonus issues may also result in higher dividends for investors because of higher number of shares. Analysts say that bonus issuance signals that the company may increase its profitability to justify expanded equity base.
Infosys, which announced Q3 earnings last week, had also approved an  ₹ 8,260-crore share buyback, the second in less than 13 months’ time. Infosys also declared a special dividend of  ₹ 4 per share. Last year, Infosys had also approved 1:1 bonus issue to celebrate 25 years of stock market listing.
TCS, India’s biggest IT services exporter, had also carried out a  ₹ 16,000 crore share buyback last year.

Bengaluru: A biopic on Infosys Ltd co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy, one of India’s most celebrated entrepreneurs, is in the works. But this is one movie that is unlikely to feature a song-and-dance sequence, standard fare in most Hindi films. Filmmaker Sanjay Tripathy first approached Murthy about eight months ago and is now working on the script of the film, two executives familiar with the development said, requesting anonymity.
“About eight months back, Tripathy first expressed interest to make a movie on Murthy. Tripathy met Murthy at his home a couple of times and after much deliberation, Murthy approved the project,"" the first executive said on condition of anonymity.
Murthy’s brief was simple: “Don’t distort facts.""
“It is known that Murthy took a  ₹ 10,000 loan from wife Sudha to start the company. This cannot be twisted. But what was discussed between them can be shown according to what the director thinks is best,"" said the second executive.
Infosys Ltd, founded in July 1981, ended the last fiscal with a revenue of $10.94 billion and is considered by many as the company that put India on the global software map. Now, 72, Murthy is estimated to be worth $2.3 billion by Forbes.
The movie apart, Murthy is in the midst of penning a book on Infosys, according to a third person familiar with the development.
An email sent to Murthy on Tuesday seeking comment remained unanswered.
The son of a schoolteacher, the Infosys co-founder was born in Chikkaballapur district in south Karnataka and went on to do his masters from IIT, Kanpur. After a brief career as a systems programmer with Patni Computer Systems, Murthy, at 35, went on to start Infosys in Pune, with his home serving as the software startup’s first makeshift office.
The CEO of Infosys from 1981 to 2002 and later the chairman of the company, he stepped down in 2011. He returned in 2013 just for a year before stepping aside for Vishal Sikka to take over as the first non-founder CEO.

Tripathy has already submitted a 30-page script to Murthy in Hindi and subsequently sent him an English translation, said the first executive cited earlier. “The script is still not locked and hopefully, it should be done in the next few months,"" the person said.
Biopics on businessmen are rare in Indian cinema. Mani Ratnam’s 2007 movie Guru was loosely based on the life of Dhirubhai Ambani, founder of Reliance Industries Ltd.
Tripathy made the popular Turning Point science programme in the 1990s for Doordarshan. In 2013, he made his first Hindi movie, Club 60. Mahaveer Jain may be the producer of the movie, according to the two executives.
“Once the script is finalized, the locations will be scouted. At the same time, actors, including who will play the role of Murthy, too will be decided and then direction will start,"" said the second executive.
Murthy owns 0.38% in Infosys, while his wife Sudha, daughter Akshata and son Rohan together own 3.07% , bringing their total ownership to 3.45% in the company.
For now, it is not clear if the movie will show the turbulent times faced by Infosys under Sikka. Murthy was unhappy with some of the decisions taken by the company during the period Sikka helmed it and flagged concerns about what he believed were corporate governance lapses. This eventually led to Vishal Sikka’s resignation and a board shake-up, which saw the return of co-founder Nandan Nilekani as non-executive chairman.
Will there be song and dance in the movie?
“Will the movie address the lowest common denominator or will it let the makers of the movie do it with honesty is the decision that will be taken once the direction starts,"" said the first executive.
It needs to be seen if a movie can capture these shades of a man, who although simple in his lifestyle, was always complex in his thought."

Significantly, Infosys raised its full-year revenue outlook to 8.5-9% in constant currency terms from the earlier 6-8%, though the company’s profitability took a hit, after Mumbai-based TCS too saw a contraction in operating margin.
The Infosys board on Friday approved a share buyback for up to  ₹800 a piece, which will cost the company around R 8,260 crore. This is the second share buyback after the company returned  ₹ 13,000 crore through its first share buyback completed in December 2017.
Infosys also declared a special dividend of  ₹4 per equity share and fixed 25 January as the record date for the special dividend and 28 January as the payment date.
In constant currency terms, Infosys’s Q3 revenue rose 2.7% from the preceding three months."
268,2019-01-21,Infosys,"Wipro is seeing a good deal flow. According to the management, the order pipeline is strong.Company's revenue grew 5.1% in Q2 and 2.4% in Q1 from a year ago

Shares of Wipro Ltd gained over 10% last week after the company said its board will consider a bonus issue of equity shares. The board eventually approved a 1:3 bonus issue, and what’s more, its earnings exceeded Street estimates. The constant currency revenue growth of 7% year-on-year indicates continued recovery. Revenue grew 5.1% in Q2 and 2.4% in Q1 from a year ago.
But the 0-2% revenue growth forecast for the current quarter caught the Street off guard. This can temper expectations. The subdued guidance comes in the backdrop of strong revenue growth commentaries by larger rivals.
Encouraged by robust deal wins and order pipeline, both Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd have guided for strong growth momentum in the current quarter, with the latter even revising its FY19 growth guidance upwards by a percentage point.
Wipro is also seeing a good deal flow. According to the management, the order pipeline is strong. “The management is confident of growth recovery on the back of a) continued traction in BFSI and digital; b) robust demand environment especially for digital transformation and enterprise scale modernization services, c) steady progress in client mining,"" SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note. BFSI is banking, financial services and insurance.
But recovery is not broad-based yet. The sectors which are on the recovery path—financial services, consumer and energy—continue to see acceleration. The laggards—healthcare and manufacturing—have continued to languish. The saving grace is that they account for only a fifth of Wipro’s revenue, although even then, they have been a drag on overall growth.
The uneven recovery is clouding the near-term outlook. Revenue growth in the healthcare segment is directly correlated to enrolments, which have been low. Similarly, performance in the manufacturing vertical is likely to be volatile due to restructuring.
So, even as the company delivered healthy execution and margin improvement for the second consecutive quarter, the subdued growth outlook is constraining earnings expectations. While the Wipro stock trades at a discount to larger peers, lacklustre growth is proving to be a handicap.
“Despite some improvement, Wipro continues to underperform other top-tier IT services companies on growth and valuation at 15x FY20E P/E is expensive by comparison (vis-à-vis growth expectations), keeping us on the sidelines,"" Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note."
267,2019-01-21,Infosys,"The first elephant is the turmoil in the US equity markets, which indicates the end of a long expansion 

Information technology (IT) analysts are largely a happy bunch. Their primary arguments for an overall rosy macro outlook include comments that there appear to be no headwinds seen on clients’ IT budgets because of the deal renewal cycles as well as the fact that digital spending is now becoming “non-discretionary"". The latter supposedly means that IT departments at client firms that outsource to service providers have no choice but to spend large amounts on digital projects.
Early last year in this column, I predicted that IT services firms would have a good 2018, primarily because of large deals being recycled out into the market, and because of early “digital"" efforts made by clients now moving into the mainstream. The first phenomenon is a cyclical one, and it appears as if the effect of the expansion caused by deal renewals will continue into 2019.
As the spending on digital goes from the ideation stage (where Indian IT services firms have a lacklustre presence) to the execution stage, which allows them to compete on a level playing field with others, Indian players are seen benefiting from clients’ budgets. The other macro shift that worked in favour of Indian service providers in 2018 was the fall in the value of the rupee vis-à-vis the dollar.
While the positive impacts are clear, each enterprise has had firm-specific factors affecting performance. And so, much of the commentary this quarter has started to focus on the relative differences among firms. Analysts seem to favour stocks such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd and Infosys Ltd, while being lukewarm towards others.
There is also speculation about probable consolidation among mid-cap providers, especially where existing investors, such as private equity firms or large single investors, look to monetize their stake through exits and forced mergers. The promoter equity at these firms is now dwarfed by the private equity stake, and investors will have to look to moves by private equity firms as a leading indicator of stock price performance.
Last week, Mint carried an article about moves by Baring PE Asia, KKR and Café Coffee Day’s V.G. Siddhartha, which could massively impact at least a couple of mid-cap providers that are already billion-dollar revenue bracket firms.
The rest of the analysis seems to focus on the expected spending from the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector, the largest sector from a revenue perspective for almost all Indian IT services firms. This analysis focuses on two vectors.
The first vector is on the interplay between insourcing of work through the BFSI sector’s India-based in-house delivery centres and outsourcing of work to IT services firms.
The second vector is on the apparent spending pattern within BFSI, which is seeing cautious expansion into digital running alongside continued spending on older systems.
Such fine splitting of hairs while analysing recent results and near-term forecasts is but to be expected in a sector that has grown mature, and by some accounts, past its “use by"" date. In my opinion, however, most analysts seem to have completely missed three elephants in the room.
The first elephant is the turmoil in the US equity markets, which indicates the end of a long expansion and the possible start of economic contraction in that market. This contraction is based on fears of a “bull in a China shop"" (quite literally) attitude toward US trade with China, increasing rhetoric around US trade wars and slowing growth in both China and Europe.
After a decade of growth, many investors are worried that a contraction is near, and December’s jitters on the heels of a threatened fifth raise of interest rates by America’s Federal Reserve was only a preview. Markets in the US have calmed over the past few days and US stocks have seen a rebound, but only because another interest rate action by the Fed now seems less likely, after the Federal Reserve officials repeatedly assured investors that they were sensitive to concerns about the economy and would be flexible and patient with further interest rate hikes. However, many factors behind last year’s alarming and precipitous drop loom in the shadows.
IT analysts also seem blind to two other pachyderms: political upheaval in both the US and in the UK, still two of the largest markets for Indian IT. The first is the ongoing battle between US President Donald Trump and those who oppose his border wall proposal and the latter is the complete chaos on Brexit.
The US is now well into its longest government shutdown, with Trump and opposition Democrats casting blame for the deadlock on each other. Whoever is to blame, there is no doubt at all that the shutdown will exact a massive price on the US economy; the shutdown’s total costs will far outweigh the $5.7 billion for the wall that Trump and the Democrats are quarrelling about. According to Standard & Poor’s, the last time the US government shut down for 16 days in 2013, the economy took a $24 billion hit. This shutdown is 31 days old and counting.

265,2019-01-25,Infosys,"Finding a successor to CEO Francisco D’Souza, improving growth figures are the two key challenges ahead for firmCognizant has had only four CEOs so far, while Infosys and Wipro have had at least four bosses in the last decade alone

NEW DELHI :
For a quarter of a century since it was set up in 1994, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. has followed a simple mantra: capitalize on the opportunity emerging out of every crisis.
“Frank (CEO Francisco D’Souza) often says never miss a crisis, it’s an opportunity,"" said Ramakrishnan Chandrasekaran, executive vice-chairman, Cognizant India.
This approach is best exemplified by the company’s performance during the financial meltdown of 2008. Cognizant’s revenue grew 16% in 2009 and 40% in 2010; Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd could only manage single-digit growth.
“Unlike some Indian firms, Cognizant increased its investments in business. From hiring more sales executives to even doing some work pro bono for clients, Cognizant realized that all this will help the company in future,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a foreign brokerage, requesting anonymity.
Cognizant, which started as a software services arm of Dun & Bradstreet Corp. with 175 employees in 1994, will end 2018 with over $16 billion in revenues. The Nasdaq-listed firm completes 25 years on 26 January. TCS completed 50 years last year.
Cognizant is envied by its Indian rivals for its scorching pace of growth. Beginning 2010, it has been adding over $1 billion in incremental revenue every year. In other words, in the 12 years ended December 2018, Cognizant has added $14.66 billion in revenue, or the combined numbers of what Wipro and Tech Mahindra Ltd could achieve.
“Cognizant had a challenger strategy,"" said Ray Wang, founder, Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm. “The key was that they had less rules, less bureaucracy to do the right thing, and that led to explosive growth.""
Four things underline Cognizant’s steroid-charged growth.
First, the company’s super-aggressive sales culture as the firm always had more people managing its large accounts. Second, Cognizant’s senior management comprises more people from outside the firm, unlike the insular approach followed by homegrown companies. “We are truly an MNC,"" said R. Ramkumar, executive director, Cognizant India. “We had a CEO who operated out of the US, the next one operated out of India, and the one after him out of the US. If you were to look at the next 25 years, this one aspect of being a global organization with a global mindset and a global leadership positions us well to thrive in the digital era,"" said Ramkumar, who joined Cognizant from TCS in 1998. Third, stability at the top. Since inception, Cognizant has had only four CEOs. Srini Raju and Lakshmi Narayanan were based out of India, while Kumar Mahadeva and current boss D’Souza are based out of US. Both Infosys and Wipro have had at least four bosses in the last decade alone.
Finally, the company has gained from its focus on fewer countries and industry segments. In 2017, the US accounted for three-fourths of its total revenue, while business from banking, financial services and insurance and healthcare accounted for 38.1% and 28.8%, respectively.
Still, 25 years later, Cognizant again finds itself at a crossroads.
The IT major’s growth fell to single digit for the first time in 2016, when activist investor Elliott Management Corp. pushed the management to focus on improving profitability rather than its growth-at-all costs approach. 2018 will be the third straight year of Cognizant reporting single-digit growth.
Understandably, a few analysts such as HSBC analyst Yogesh Aggarwal, have said in the past that Elliott’s decision was nothing short of “destructive activism"".
A bigger challenge ahead for the company is to find the successor to CEO D’Souza, and the board is evaluating both internal and external candidates. D’Souza is expected to step down sometime this year.
“Cognizant has been a good story,"" said former Infosys CFO V. Balakrishnan. “Their USP has, however, been to grow higher than Indian firms. The Elliott chapter was a distraction for the company, and it needs to be seen if the company can get back its old DNA.""
Amazon, which was also founded in 1994, set up its cloud services business, Amazon Web Services, in 2006. AWS’s revenue now stands at $21 billion (on trailing 12 months basis), more than TCS.
For now, Chandrasekaran won’t admit if Cognizant, like its Indian peers, lacked the foresight to invest in cloud computing business. “The good thing is that we were able to scale our business. The bad thing was we didn’t focus on path-breaking innovations, but in the future you will see a lot more path-breaking innovations,"" said Chandrasekaran.

HCL Technologies Ltd on Tuesday reported a 4.9% sequential increase in its dollar revenue for the October-December quarter, the fastest among the large companies in India’s $167 billion information technology (IT) outsourcing sector.
HCL Tech’s dollar revenue improved sequentially to $2.2 billion in the quarter, while revenue grew 10.8% year-on-year (y-o-y).
In constant currency terms, the company’s revenue rose 5.6% on a sequential basis.
Net profit was at $364 million in the December quarter when compared with $357 million in the September quarter.
However, its operating margin fell 30 basis points from 19.9% to 19.6% in the quarter under consideration, on account of rising wages. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
A Bloomberg survey of 29 analysts had forecast revenue of $2.18 billion, or  ₹15,514.1 crore, besides profit of $357.54 million, or  ₹2,541 crore, for the December quarter.
Noida-based HCL Tech’s performance in the October-December quarter was better than its Bengaluru-based rivals, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd, which reported 2.2% and 1.8% sequential dollar revenue growth, respectively. Mumbai-based Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, which does more business than Infosys and Wipro put together, reported 0.67% growth.
For now, HCL Tech’s growth continues to be driven by higher business from its infrastructure management services unit, besides revenue from its acquisition strategy.
HCL Tech expects its full-year revenue for 2018-19 to grow at the upper-end of its guidance of 9.5-11.5%. Mumbai-based TCS, which does not provide a growth outlook, is expected to grow over 11%, while Infosys expects at-best 9% growth.
Industry body Nasscom expects revenue for the industry to grow between 7% and 9% in constant currency terms.
“I’m very happy with the outstanding performance delivered by us during this quarter,"" said HCL Technologies chief executive officer C. Vijayakumar.
“For now, we see healthy demand and we don’t see any impact on our client spends from either the continued shutdown in the US or any macroeconomic slowdown.""
“HCL Tech delivered impressive revenues growth for the quarter with 5.9% constant currency growth, however, margins perHformance was a tad below estimates,"" said Sanjeev Hota, an analyst with brokerage Sharekhan Ltd.
The brokerage, however, said it continues to have concerns over the company’s $1.8 billion acquisition of eight software products from IBM, which was announced last month.
On Tuesday, HCL shares rose 1.24% to  ₹988.1 on the BSE even as the benchmark Sensex slipped 64 points, or 0.18%, to end the day at 35,592.5 points. HCL Q3 results were announced after market hours."

261,2019-02-04,Infosys,"Consulting practice executives to work along with sales, delivery heads to sell more of its offeringsNo Indian IT firm, including Cognizant and TCS, share revenue from their consulting practices 

Executives from Infosys Ltd’s consulting practice will now work jointly with sales and delivery heads to garner more business by offering a wider array of services to its top clients.
This effort is the latest initiative being rolled out by Infosys under chief executive Salil Parekh, who since taking over in January last year has focused on bringing stability at India’s second largest information technology (IT) services firm.
“There is a lot more focus on driving growth in top 30 accounts,"" said U.B. Pravin Rao, Infosys chief operating officer. “As part of this, we are looking to get digital strategists. Digital strategists are people, who will be again a handful, and who are consultants or technologists or people with industry background and will be looking at these top accounts.""
Infosys expects to grow at a faster pace in the current financial year than in 2017-18. The company, after posting a 2.2% sequential increase in dollar revenue during the October-December period, raised its revenue outlook for 2018-19 to 8.5-9% in constant currency terms.
Infosys’s revenue grew 5.8% in constant currency terms in financial year 2017-18.
“We need it (consulting) to be part of the account team. It has to be a consultative-led selling approach,"" said Mark Livingston, Infosys’s head of consulting.
Infosys, like its peers, gets the bulk of its business from its largest clients: the top 25 clients accounted for a third or $1 billion of Infosys’s $2.98 billion in revenue in the October-December quarter.
In the quarter ended December 2017, just before Parekh took over as CEO, the top 25 customers accounted for 35.3% or $972.5 million of Infosys’s $2.75 billion in revenue.
This means that in calendar year 2018 business from top 25 clients grew at a slower pace of 4.1% as against an 8.4% growth in Infosys’s quarterly revenue.
Infosys’s latest effort appears it is looking to take a leaf out of its rival Cognizant’s approach which during the last decade modelled its ‘three-in-a-box approach’ under which the Nasdaq-listed firm got a consulting partner to work along with a sales and delivery executive for its largest accounts.
One reason behind this push by Infosys to make consulting more integral to its business is also driven by the change in the way companies globally, from big banks to healthcare firms, are looking to do business with their IT vendors.
Over the last few years, newer digital technologies like data analytics and cloud computing platforms offer companies to run their business better.
“Consulting is key as you have to work with clients at a strategic level to identify opportunities and co-create and co-innovate solutions. The account-based models require consulting to be a key part of the selling and service model,"" said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm.
Infosys’s latest approach to consulting comes after many failed attempts by its earlier management over the last 15 years to leverage its consulting arm: From setting up a consulting arm at the start of the century to buying Swiss consulting unit Lodestone, then later merging it with its own small consulting business, Infosys has struggled to scale up its consulting business.
None of the Indian IT firms, including Cognizant and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, share revenue from their consulting practices but analysts attribute Cognizant’s industry-leading growth over the last decade to its strong consulting business."
260,2019-02-05,Infosys,"Wipro Ventures’ fundings underscore IT firm’s success in tapping startup ecosystemWipro has done a better job at M&As and investments than its peers, including Infosys, say analysts

NEW DELHI :
Wipro Ventures has deployed $65 million, or two-thirds of its corpus, in 18 startups since it was set up in 2015 and has helped its parent, Wipro Ltd, win more than 100 deals, underscoring the early success of the software services company in tapping into the disruptive startup ecosystem.
Of its total investments, 14 are in the US, three in Israel and one in India—in Pune-based big data start-up Altizon Systems Pvt. Ltd.
“As of date, we have committed more than $65 million in capital,"" said Venu Pemmaraju, a managing partner at Wipro Ventures.
Both Pemmaraju, formerly a senior investment manager at Intel Capital, and the other managing partner, Biplab Adhya, are based out of California. They report to Rishad Premji, the elder son of billionaire, philanthropist and Wipro chairman Azim Premji.
“Since 2015, we have had more than 100 wins in conjunction with the startups we have invested in,"" said Adhya.
Wipro Ventures’ investments have allowed Wipro to offer new-age technology solutions in engagements with some of the firm’s 1,132 customers, and win contracts, highlighting how large information technology (IT) companies are keeping pace with the latest technologies.
In the last few years, Wipro’s revenue growth has lagged its larger rivals, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd. At the end of the June quarter, HCL Technologies Ltd edged past Wipro to become India’s third-largest IT firm.
Wipro Ventures’ performance, however, has been one of the few bright spots in the Wipro story.
Infosys, which also set up a $500 million corporate venture arm, Infosys Innovation Fund, in 2015, has invested in only eight startups so far. Infosys divested its stake in ANSR Consulting Holdings Inc. in December 2017.
Rishad Premji, who is Wipro’s chief strategy officer and director, also oversees the company’s mergers and acquisitions.
Over the last four years, Wipro has been second only to Noida-based HCL in acquisitions, having spent $1.17 billion in acquiring six companies including Denmark-based design firm Designit and US-based cloud computing firm Appirio Inc.
Understandably, many analysts maintain that Wipro has done a better job at mergers and acquisitions and investments than its peers, including Infosys.
“Wipro has done a better job of M&A than most IT services firms to date,"" said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm.
“We measure both the financial health of the companies and the strategic value to Wipro and the startups. Our baseline investment strategy is still the same—invest into early- to mid-stage enterprise software companies that have exhibited initial product-market fit, deployed their solution at a handful of enterprise customers and put mechanisms in place to engage with a global technology services provider,"" said Pemmaraju.
“That said, each deal is different and one size doesn’t fit all. So we do modify our evaluation criteria accordingly,"" said Adhya."

Early-stage investor 3one4 Capital, which has backed data platform Tracxn, meat delivery firm Licious and fintech startup Tonetag, is raising  ₹350 crore ($50 million) for its new fund, Continuum I, a top company executive said.
The firm is managed by Pranav and Siddarth Pai, sons of former senior Infosys executive T.V. Mohandas Pai.
“While the primary purpose of this fund is to invest in our current companies’ growth stages, we do have flexibility from our limited partners (LPs) to invest in new companies if it is a good opportunity,"" said Pranav Pai, founding partner, 3One4 Capital.
Continuum I, the venture capital (VC) firm’s third fund, will invest selectively in growth stages of 3one4’s portfolio companies. The fund has already hit a first close of  ₹150 crore, with backing from a top university endowment in the US and from Sojitz Corp., a Japanese conglomerate, Pai said. The fund is backed largely by new limited partners (investors in VC funds), though some LPs from previous funds will also pool in.
The fund will focus on Series B and subsequent rounds with cheque sizes between $3 million and $5 million, primarily co-investing with other investors, Pai said.
3one4 plans to invest in automation, media and content development, fintech and health. It also plans to invest in consumer data generation technology-enabled services to develop deep consumer behavioural insights, a sector it hasn’t invested in before.
3one4 raised its first fund of  ₹100 crore in 2016, and a  ₹250-crore second fund in early 2018. The VC firm’s investors include Kris Gopalakrishnan, co-founder, Infosys; N.R. Narayana Murthy, co-founder, Infosys and Catamaran Ventures; Reliance Ventures; Nandan Nilekani’s family office; and Mohandas Pai’s family office.
“As we raise this fund, our biggest takeaway is that we have to help businesses. It’s not just about the money. We provide advice and guidance to our founders,"" Pai said.
While 3one4’s third fund will focus on follow-on rounds in portfolio companies from its first fund, its second fund continues to invest in new early-stage startups.
Its portfolio includes peer-to-peer lending platform Faircent, media startup YourStory, and data science learning platform Jigsaw Academy.
3one4 is the latest entrant to the club of venture capitalists raising add-on funds to back winners and fast-growing companies in their portfolio. Mint reported on 24 January that a number of early-stage funds, including Kae Capital and Blume Ventures, are raising add-on funds to double down on winners. Kae is raising a  ₹100-crore add-on fund, while DSG Consumer Partners raised two add-on funds of $10 million and $20 million in 2014 and 2016, respectively, to back fast-growing companies from its first fund."
258,2019-02-07,Infosys,"Only a handful of stocks, including RIL, Infosys Ltd. and TCS have driven the gains in the NSE Nifty 50 IndexThe market may begin to broaden now that the Nifty has reclaimed the key psychological level of 11,000

Mumbai: The benchmark equity gauge of India’s 50 biggest companies reclaimed the 11,000 level after four months on Wednesday, but not all investors are celebrating.
Only a handful of stocks, including Reliance Industries Ltd. and software exporters Infosys Ltd. and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. have driven the gains in the NSE Nifty 50 Index since the year started. What’s more, about 40 percent of the gauge’s members are trading below their prices from three months ago, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Anemic breadth among frontline stocks aside, confidence in the broader market has also been busted recently by the meltdown in stocks teeming with risky debt. The Nifty Midcap 100 Index has slid to near its lowest level since October, led by companies such as Dewan Housing Finance Corp. that lost almost half its market value last week and Anil Ambani’s Reliance Infrastructure Ltd., which plunged 32 percent on Wednesday.
“It is a bipolar market where the main index has gained but bulk of the stocks remain in negative territory,"" said Dharmesh Kant, head of research at Mumbai-based Indianivesh Securities Ltd. “The uncertainty around elections, concerns regarding leveraged companies and possible debt defaults is dragging down the broader market.""
Why are some of the biggest names in the Nifty rising? The answer lies in the flows from global exchange-traded funds, which typically deploy cash in few heavyweights in times of uncertainty, Kant said. Foreigners have bought a net $144 million shares this month after withdrawing $75 million in January.
The market may begin to broaden now that the Nifty has reclaimed the key psychological level of 11,000, some analysts who study stock price moves say. A widely expected shift in the central bank’s policy stance to neutral at its rate decision due Thursday may also help turn the sentiment, according to Angel Broking Ltd.
“We expect the Nifty to hasten towards 11,200 and won’t be surprised to see the index extend the move toward 11,400 in the next few days,"" Angel said in a note Wednesday.

257,2019-02-11,Infosys,"The top five IT firms added 99,010 employees last year to take their workforce to about 1.23 millionAnalysts say that there is no structural change to conclude that the pace of hiring will continue

New Delhi: India’s top 10 information technology (IT) companies added 114,390 engineers to their workforce in 2018, a more than four-fold increase from the previous year. While the numbers are the best in five years, few are predicting a similar showing in 2019.
Much of the jobs added in 2018 may have been because of increased hiring in the US under pressure from the Donald Trump administration and customers outsourcing large contracts on the condition that the vendors absorb some of their employees, two human resources (HR) executives said.
Although none of the companies disclosed details of hiring in the US or the number of employees absorbed from clients, the HR executives claimed that at least half of the net hiring made by companies in 2018 is on account of one of these two reasons.
The top five IT firms—Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Cognizant Technology Services Corp., Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd—added 99,010 employees last year to take their workforce to about 1.23 million as against an addition of 19,360 people in 2017, according to an analysis by Mint.
The rest of the top 10—Tech Mahindra Ltd, Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd, Mindtree Ltd, Cyient Ltd and Zensar Ltd—added just 15,380 engineers compared with 2,796 in the previous year.
India’s $167 billion software services industry employed 3.7 million people at the end of December and the 10 largest companies accounted for 38% of them.
Some experts say last year’s jump looks more like a temporary recovery as the industry undergoes a structural change from a people-led model to a platform-based approach.
“I see the global economy slowing this year, and IT hiring will slow with it. Plus, the emerging IT services models will ultimately require fewer people to support it with smarter automation and the use of platforms,"" said Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing-research firm.
For now, stable macroeconomic growth in both the US and Europe has made more companies across industries spend more on outsourcing technology work, resulting in higher demand for services offered by IT outsourcing companies.
Unsurprisingly, a few analysts expect the sector to grow at faster pace in 2019 than in the recent past.
“(A)nnual growth rates in CC (constant currency) slowed in CY (calender year) 2017 by ~250bps (basis points) y/y across the Indian IT services industry, and improved in CY18 by ~90bps across the industry. Based on current Street estimates, we expect the Indian IT services industry revenue growth rates to continue to re-accelerate in CY19 at 9.3% y/y growth,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 6 February.
Mumbai-based TCS is expected to grow its revenue by more than 11% in constant currency terms while Infosys expects full-year revenue to grow, at best, 9% in the year ending 31 March.
A large number of big IT outsourcing contracts have seen some employees of clients join the workforce of technology vendors.
For instance, 9,000 of the 13,514 people added by Wipro in 2018 joined from Alight Solutions as part of an outsourcing contract. Wipro won a $1.6 billion deal from Alight Solutions LLC, the former benefits administration and human-resources outsourcing business of Aon Plc in September last year.
Infosys’s contract with Verizon and TCS’s two mega contracts—the over $2 billion, 10-year contract from Transamerica Life Insurance Co. and $1.36 billion over 10 years from a unit of British insurer Prudential Plc—also saw the two IT firms absorb employees from their clients. The Transamerica contract alone added 2,200 employees to TCS’s workforce, which totalled 417,929 at the end of December.
Not many expect IT firms to add as many people in 2019 as they added last year.
“There is no structural change to conclude that the pace of hiring will continue. The industry is going through a change and faces the same pressure from automation. Of course, we will continue to hire in the US. But overall hiring depends on client budgets, which in turn is tied to macroeconomic growth,"" an executive at Wipro said on the condition of anonymity.
“Talent in areas such as algorithm development and automation is increasingly scarce and expensive, which will stifle resources and put increased pressure on services firms to train junior or mid-level staff at a faster pace than ever. I predict hiring will slow in the second half of 2019 and not pick up aggressively until early 2021,"" said Fersht of HfS Research."
256,2019-02-12,Infosys,"After Infosys vs Wipro, N.R. Narayana Murthy and Azim Premji find themselves in another duel: Catamaran Ventures vs PremjiInvestN.R. Narayana Murthy’s Catamaran Ventures is now mulling whether it should continue to back startups

New Delhi: Infosys Ltd’s founder N.R. Narayana Murthy and Wipro Ltd’s chairman Azim Premji battled for supremacy in India’s information technology (IT) outsourcing industry for more than three decades.
Murthy, 72 and Premji, 73, find themselves in another duel, as the two billionaire septuagenarians’ financial and strategy skills are put to the test while they oversee their family offices, Catamaran Ventures Llp and PremjiInvest, respectively.
A decade after Murthy set up Catamaran in 2009, the venture capital fund continues to wrestle with how to find the best playbook.
Catamaran is now mulling whether it should continue to back startups and make any new investments in the sector, said two executives familiar with the matter. Instead, the company plans to focus on investing in listed companies, the executives said, requesting anonymity.
The potential revamp of investment strategy by Catamaran tracks the appointment last month of Abishek Laxminarayan as chief executive. His appointment follows the exit of Arjun Narayanswamy who took over as CEO of Soroco, a Boston-based artificial intelligence-focused firm.
Incidentally, Soroco was founded by Rohan Murty, son of Narayana Murthy, in 2014.
“In December, a review of the portfolio was undertaken by NRN and it was decided that Catamaran will not make any fresh investments in startups,"" said an executive familiar with the discussions. The executive did not want to be named as the discussions are private.
“The (Catamaran) fund will wait to get an exit from its current investments. The focus will now be to look at investing more in listed firms,"" the executive said.
Murthy and Narayanswamy did not respond to emails seeking comment. 
PremjiInvest declined to comment.
Mint could not independently ascertain the total investments made by Catamaran since it was founded in 2009. However, Catamaran’s performance pales in comparison to PremjiInvest, the family office of Azim Premji.
Since it was set up in 2006, PremjiInvest has become India’s largest family office, managing about $5 billion of assets, said a third executive familiar with the matter. PremjiInvest backs about two-dozen startups and also owns equity stakes in about 40 listed companies.
One of the executives attributed the performance of the two funds to the varied approaches adopted by Murthy and Premji.
Murthy started Catamaran with an initial corpus of $120 million as against Premji who wrote a $1 billion cheque.
Secondly, PremjiInvest did not limit its investments to only India and backs both startups and listed companies in the US.
Finally, PremjiInvest is bigger in terms of manpower, employing about 40, as against Catamaran, which has half-a-dozen people.
“Premji got a professional in Prakash (Parthasarathy) to set up and run the fund, and Prakash managed to build it to this size where because of the size, most private deals come to PremjiInvest. This is something which Murthy could not do because he relied on a team of youngsters who had recently graduated from college to run the firm,"" said the first executive cited above.
Catamaran currently has investments in seven startups, including education-technology focused startup Ace Creative Learning Pvt. Ltd, ad-tech firm Vyoma Media, Acko General Insurance, medical diagnosis firm Achira Labs, Healthspring Community Medical Centres, Innoviti Payment Solutions and Threadsol, a startup that offers enterprise material management technology to garment manufacturers. Catamaran exited from Hector Beverages Pvt. Ltd, which makes traditional drinks under the Paper Boat brand, and sold its stake in Manipal Global Education Services in 2013.
Catamaran has investments in seven listed firms, including a 3.83% stake in Vesuvius India Ltd, 2.46% in Garware Technical Fibres Ltd, 2.65% in Ambika Cotton Mills Ltd and 1.07% in Nesco Ltd. Catamaran also has less than 1% in Wabco India Ltd, S.H. Kelkar and Co. Ltd and SKF India Ltd.
In addition, Catamaran has a joint venture with Amazon.com Inc.—Cloudtail India Pvt. Ltd, the largest seller on Amazon India’s platform.
The joint venture partnership changed with Murthy’s firm now owning 76% in the JV as against 51% earlier after India changed the rules in December last year, limiting foreign e-commerce firms from owning a controlling stake in an entity which also sells on the market place."
255,2019-02-13,Infosys,"Persistent Systems has named IBM's Christopher O'Connor as CEO in place of Anand DeshpandeChristopher O'Connor is the second outsider within a week to lead an IT firm after Cognizant

New Delhi: When IBM’s Christopher O’Connor was named as the chief executive officer (CEO) of a Pune-based software services company on Monday, he became the second outsider within a week to lead an IT services company after Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.
Persistent Systems announced on Monday that Anand Deshpande, founder, chairman and managing director (MD), will transfer his CEO responsibilities to O’Connor over the next three quarters.
His appointment means six of India’s 11 largest IT services firms have hired external candidates as their CEOs in the last three years, underscoring the insider versus outsider debate in an industry that is facing business disruptions from newer technologies.
Until August 2015, five of these six companies, save for Infosys Ltd, had an internal candidate as their CEO.
Last week, New Jersey-based Cognizant, which has most of its employees in India, named Brian Humphries, currently CEO of Vodafone Business, as the successor to founder and CEO Francisco D’Souza.
Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd (LTI) first hired former Infosys executive Sanjay Jalona as CEO in August 2015, which was followed by Zensar Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Infosys all appointing an external candidate to steer their firms.
Incidentally, the decision by Infosys to appoint former Capgemini SE executive Salil Parekh as CEO in January 2018 followed the failure of the company’s earlier decision to entrust former SAP executive board member Vishal Sikka to lead the firm. Sikka left Infosys three years after taking over in August 2014.
At least one expert attributes this trend to most companies not having enough leaders to take on the top job. “If you include the examples of NIIT Technologies, Hexaware and ITC Infotech, then the number of companies total nine,"" said Navnit Singh, chairman and regional MD, Korn Ferry India, an executive search firm.
Former Infosys executive Sudip Singh took over as CEO at ITC Infotech on 1 February while NIIT appointed former Genpact executive Sudhir Singh to the top post in January last year. Hexaware appointed former HCL Technologies executive R. Srikrishna as its CEO in July 2014.
“Clearly the boards of these companies were looking for a kind of game-changer and did not want an internal candidate, who they believed is too seeped into a company’s working style. So, a company getting an outsider as a CEO is a reflection that they don’t have internal candidates,"" said Singh. “But you have to give credit to all these leaders as these companies are on a roll, despite the disruptions facing the industry.""
Age is another factor— most external hires are young. Cognizant’s new boss Brian Humphries, at 45, is the youngest. Sanjay Jalona was 46 when he was hired by LTI while Abidali Neemuchwala was 48 when he got the top job at Wipro.
“Competing companies with identical business models seek strikingly different attributes in their CEO. CEO selection inevitably carries uncertainty,"" JPMorgan Chase and Co. analyst Viju George wrote in a note dated 8 February.
George clubbed the hiring of outsiders as CEO under three categories. Companies that have consistently done well prefer to promote internal leaders to take on the top job, and this decision also carries the least uncertainty. TCS elevating chief financial officer Rajesh Gopinathan to CEO in 2017 is one such example.
Others, such as Infosys, Wipro, LTI and Zensar, appointed their new chiefs from within the IT industry, an indicator that they want a departure from current working styles, though they are still wary of bringing in a rank outsider, George said in his note.
Cognizant’s move to appoint Humphries, who is from the telecom sector, comes with an additional risk compared with other IT firms that have hired CEOs from within the industry. George, however, wrote that Humphries, because of having worked across finance, strategy and operations across the US, UK, Europe, and South Africa, is a “good"" choice."
254,2019-02-13,Infosys,"Infosys has set up its new innovation centre at Providence to train its graduates for digital jobsThe company has so far hired 100 techies as part of its goal to create 500 jobs in the northeastern state by 2022

Bengaluru: Infosys is partnering with the Community College of Rhode Island to set up a digital economy aspirations lab for training students in the US for digital jobs, said the software major on Wednesday.
""Our digital innovation and design centre at Providence in Rhode Island will help bridge the gap for design and human-centric skills and provide digital technologies to our clients,"" said the city-based IT firm in a statement here.
The centre offers designers and design graduates training in digital skills, exposure to systems, platforms, strategy and organisation domains to make them employable in a digital world.
The $11-billion IT behemoth has so far hired 100 techies as part of its goal to create 500 jobs in the northeastern state by 2022.
""We have hired 7,600 American workers since spring 2017 as part of our commitment to speed up digital innovation of enterprise clients in the US,"" said the statement.
The outsourcing firm committed on May 2, 2017, to hire about 10,000 American techies to bridge the IT skills gap in the US and set up six technology-cum-innovation hubs across North America by 2022-23.
Global clients across the US account for about 60 per cent of the company's software export revenue annually.
The company's technology-cum-innovation hubs are at Indianapolis in Indiana state, Raleigh in North Carolina, Richardson in Texas, Phoenix in Arizona, Hartford in Connecticut and Providence in Rhode Island.
By studying user-experience to how people interact with systems, the graduate hires will be equipped to create 360-degree solutions to business challenges.
""Critical thinking is key to building human-centric solutions our clients need to accelerate their digital transformation. As demand for talent with design skills will rise, we are training American workers in them,"" said Infosys Chief Executive Salil Parekh on the occasion.
Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo lauded Infosys for setting up its new innovation centre at Providence to train its graduates for digital jobs.
""Our state has some of the world's top designers who testify the strength of our workforce for Infosys to tap and develop their talent,"" said Raimondo in the statement.
The digital lab is at the forefront of education and workforce development of the community college students for careers in the digital economy, said Infosys President Ravi Kumar in the statement.
""We will co-develop bridge programming to support the four-year degree course and enable the students to pursue careers in IT,"" added the statement."
253,2019-02-17,Infosys,"Shrinking valuations are also prompting smaller companies to buy their own stock, said analystPSU firms, including Coal India Ltd., NHPC Ltd., are on a buying spree to help the govt to meet asset-sale target

 India Inc. is extending a banner year for share buybacks.
Seven weeks into 2019, two dozen companies led by technology major Infosys Ltd. have announced or completed plans to buy  ₹170.5 billion ($2.4 billion) of their own stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This compares with about  ₹545 billion for all of 2018, which was the highest in at least six years, the data show.
“Buybacks this year are likely to equal the year before, if not exceed, as improving liquidity boosts cash flows for companies,"" said Sameer Kalra, president of Target Investing, an investment advisory firm based in Mumbai.
While the rush to return excess cash to investors is driven by the tax efficiency of buybacks over dividends, declining share values and a slowing global economy has helped accelerate the trend. Software exporters, which get a bulk of their revenue from abroad, are leading the pack as shrinking client budgets leave them with fewer opportunities to use their cash.
Infosys, Asia’s second-largest software exporter, last month said it would buy  ₹82.6 billion of its own stock. The offer accounts for about half of this year’s total deal value. Larger peer Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. completed a  ₹160billion buyback in 2018. Both companies have made the offers for a second time in as many years.
Shrinking valuations are also prompting smaller companies to buy their own stock, according to Indianivesh Securities Ltd. A gauge of midcap shares is down about 10 percent since Jan. 1, extending last year’s drop that was the biggest since 2011, amid an aversion to risk assets.
“The last couple of years, especially 2018, have been a washout for small and medium-sized firms, and despite recent earnings showing signs of economic recovery, investor reaction hasn’t been favorable,"" said Dharmesh Kant, head of research at Indianivesh. “The buybacks show the founders are confident about their business models.""
Even state-run firms, including Coal India Ltd., hydro-power generator NHPC Ltd. and iron-ore miner NMDC Ltd. are on a buying spree to help the government — their biggest shareholder — meet its asset-sale target.
Buybacks allow cash-rich state firms to return excess funds to the government in a tax-efficient manner than paying out dividends, which attract a distribution tax, Target’s Kalra said.

252,2019-02-19,Infosys,"Next-gen family members are now keen to start independent entities, and not carry forward past legaciesWith fewer members from next generation showing interest in the family business, a host of other issues also arise

Mumbai/New Delhi: So what? Kavin Bharti Mittal, co-founder of Hike messenger and son of Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman of Bharti Airtel, shot back when he was asked about carrying forward his father’s name and legacy. Kavin has chosen not to join his family business and ventured out on his own to set up Hike, a messaging platform, and in doing so, he is trying to create a name and legacy for himself distinct from his father’s. Yet, there is an element of risk—the risk of Hike’s failure, the risk of his own failure and the risk of letting down the family name, if at all.
“These thoughts cross my mind once in a while,"" Kavin said, adding that he reminds himself everyday about his reasons for not joining Airtel. “I really believed that the world is changing so fast that I would like to understand the world with my two eyes and not through the eyes of others or some pre-defined lens and I am happy to work a million hours a day to have that freedom."" Kavin is firm that he does not see himself being a part of his father’s business in the foreseeable future. He does not think it is in the DNA of telecom operators to disrupt the ecosystem the way disruptions are caused by the tech firms.
In Bengaluru, 2,150 kilometres away from Kavin’s office in Delhi, Rohan Murty has set up a firm called Soroco that is busy disrupting a business that his father N.R. Narayana Murthy created at Infosys.
How?
While Infosys deploys engineers to work on technology requirements for companies, across industries, globally, Rohan’s firm, Soroco offers the same companies products or software platforms which can do away with human intervention. This is by using algorithms, Big Data, artificial intelligence to make enterprises and people and processes far more productive.
There are many stories like those of Kavin and Rohan’s, which put out a narrative that is as much about new generation family members pursuing new areas of growth to seek an independent identity as they are about bringing new dimension to business families in the country.
Family rules the roost
Rahul and Abhimanyu, sons of late Raman Munjal who co-founded the then Hero Honda Motors Ltd along with his father late Brijmohan Lall Munjal, have diversified into renewable energy and financial services. Anuvrat, the only son of Hero MotoCorp’s current chairman and managing director Pawan Munjal, wants to build something of his own in the tech space even as he is finishing his studies. Akash and Isha Ambani, the children of India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, have disrupted the telecom market with their venture Jio and now plan to amalgamate Reliance Industries Ltd’s technology and retail platforms to build what their father calls “new commerce"". The children of Kumar Mangalam Birla, Ananya and Aryaman, are pursuing their interests in microfinance and cricket respectively.
These are just a few examples in a corporate India, which for now is largely controlled by families running their business. An overwhelming 69 of the BSE-100 companies are family-run businesses. Almost all of them still have a family member on the board, either as fruits of ownership or by playing a role in the operational decisions of a firm.
Yet, there are examples like Noida-based HCL Technologies Ltd. India’s third-largest information technology (IT) services firm was founded by Shiv Nadar in 1976. Nadar’s only child, Roshni Nadar, has said in the past that she does not see herself running the business and she would work in philanthropy through Shiv Nadar Foundation. Although Roshni was appointed as vice-chairman of the company last year, HCL clarified that she will not play a role in the operational decisions of the company.
In doing what they want to do, these next-gen family members are in a way also shaping up the new outlook for Indian family businesses. Such businesses are increasingly looking for ways to redefine how business is conducted, are seeking better solutions to address disputes and enforce governance, and, of course, smarter ways to divide family wealth.
With fewer members from next generation showing interest in the family business, a host of other issues also arise. Whose bloodline takes over? Who is the next chairman? Who is the next leader in the business? Will women from the family be involved? If yes, should they just share the wealth or also have a say in business affairs.
A matter of bloodlines
In earlier times, it was given that the next generation will come into the business. What has changed now? “Second generation or third generation of a family no longer interested in running their family’s business just reinforces what I’ve said for sometime: Haveli ki umar saath saal (which means the life of a business house is 60 years),"" said Gurcharan Das, author and former chief executive officer of Procter & Gamble India.
“Deep down, critics of capitalism have got it terribly wrong when they say capitalism is driven by greed. Of course, money is an incentive. But when you see the second generation examples like Rohan (Murty) or Kavin (Mittal), you’ll realize that they want something which is more than just money. The motivation is for recognition.""
Sunil Munjal, chairman of Hero Enterprise, and former joint managing director of Hero MotoCorp Ltd has a slightly contrarian view. “This is not unusual. This is the way how things have worked. What is happening in family businesses is that you are trying not to get too many people focused on one business and energy of the rest can be used to tap other opportunities. Sometime they branch out on their own and sometime they are funded by the family itself,"" said Munjal, who first branched out of his family business in the 1980s to set up a spinning mill only to encounter the Great Bombay textile strike called by unionist Datta Samant in its first week of production. Munjal’s mill situated in Malerkotla near Ludhiana was subsequently shut due to the prolonged strike.
In the past, India did not allow accumulation of wealth as it levied as much as 85% state duty on the wealth generated in family businesses. After liberalization, these norms were relaxed and that resulted in rapid creation of wealth in late 1990s and early 2000s as the Indian economy opened up to new businesses.
“As families became wealthier and more prosperous, they encouraged their next generation to take up new challenges to keep spirit of entrepreneurship alive. The startup culture has just given a new dimension to the whole thing,"" Munjal said, adding that the other advantage of branching out early is that the next generation family members get a chance to learn tricks of the trade in a business environment that requires less investments and low risks.
Das, however, thinks that it is the technology (that drives the entire startup culture) that has a far-reaching impact on more business, across industries and the trend of next generation family members looking out for opportunities will only continue. “You should compare it with history. Pre-liberalized India was a time when there were not many opportunities. So a son of a trader or merchant would have at-best gone to some new location and done business. Now, because of technology, most businesses are also facing disruptions. So technology is again a big driving factor behind this change. And this trend is seen globally,"" Das said.
Munjal somewhat agrees with this view. “Next generation not being interested is completely possible because the prospect of doing things on your own gives you a different kick. No matter what you plan, it is hard to predict it beforehand. That you can make a choice that you don’t want to do your family business is a great luxury. It is a success of the system,"" Munjal said.
No stigma attached to failure
Most of the new ventures have had limited success but because of the family wealth the pressure to make profits isn’t so intense. Also, many from the next generation family members are branching out early because they have the comfort of knowing they can always fall back on the family business in the event of a failure. To that extent, there is no stigma attached to failure.
It is a story that’s being played out even more vividly in the small and medium segment where traditional businesses are anyway under pressure. “So, we have seen a lot of this trend in Gujarati-Marwari businesses, where the children may want to do something else and they come back if it fails. Now we are seeing women also being involved in these things,"" said Rishabh Shroff, partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.
These changes are redefining how business families across the country are now viewing strategic and succession issues. Mint on 16 January reported that Rahul Bajaj and his three cousins—Shekhar, Madhur and Niraj—have signed an agreement that outlines how the family will jointly own group companies and establishes formal processes to deal with issues related to succession, ownership and conflict resolution.
The move confers on the Bajaj group the rare distinction of being India’s only large business family that has stuck together for four generations while ensuring a smooth transition for the fifth generation family members. The whole process at Bajaj is driven by a long-term logic. “We don’t know what happens to our children and grandchildren. But, we know we want to be together. We are trying to see how we can strengthen our relationship,"" Shekhar Bajaj, chairman of Bajaj Electricals, had said.
Similarly, the TVS Group has initiated consultations aimed at a possible restructuring of ownership among the various members of the family that runs the $8 billion conglomerate.
At the New Delhi-based Bharti Enterprises, which owns Airtel, a system has been devised where a family member will have to choose between two different hats—one of a promoter another of a professional. “There is nothing against family members coming into the businesses as long as they choose between two hats—a separate hat for ownership and another as a professional. If they are coming as professional, there is no harm,"" said a person close to the family.
In Sunil Munjal’s case, his move to cash out of Hero Group’s flagship company Hero MotoCorp is seen as a step to keep intact the ethos of the group founded by his father as well as making sure his own personality does not get compromised under the shadow of his brother Pawan Munjal who is running the motorcycle company.
In Conclusion
The earlier generation had few role models. Today, thanks to global exposure, the role models are men like Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg. In many cases, entrepreneurs want one of their children to start a different business for other reasons: either to create a hedge against the main business floundering or as a way to divide the family capital among two sons. In the latter case, one offspring gets to run the existing business and another is entrusted with the family’s seed capital. In this too, the family council’s decision is guided by their assessment of who is good at what task.
This has been a time-tested formula and has been the driving force behind the asset divisions in numerous families, said Shroff of Cyril Amarchand. “It is a great way to address a lot of issues that crop up in a family business. If you manage to create a new business, it gives you room to accommodate other family members,"" Shroff said.
Family businesses often face tough challenges during the transition phase, when the founders attempt to retire and hand over the reins of the business to their successors. The senior generations usually fail to realize the need to prepare their offspring to succeed them. Thus conflicts arise. Further, as families grow, this results in fragmentation of ownership of the business across family members and generations. “So, the reluctance of families to talk about (succession) is slowly fading away, which is a very good sign,"" said Shroff added.
Kavin, Rohan and an increasing number of next-gen businesspeople can take some credit for this change."

The company in its meeting with the regulator's internal committee in February 2018 proposed to pay  ₹34.35 lakh towards settlement charges.
The amount was approved by the panel of whole-time members of Sebi, the regulator said in an order dated February 15.
Infosys paid  ₹34.35 lakh towards settlement charges on February 4, following which the regulator has disposed of the ""proposed adjudication proceedings in respect of the applicant for the defaults"".
Enforcement actions, including restoring or initiating the proceedings, could be initiated if any representation made by them is found to be untrue, the Sebi order said.

Here are 10 things to know about Sensex, Nifty fall today
1) IT stocks like TCS, Infosys and Tech Mahindra witnessing profit-booking today as these stocks had run up a lot as a defensive bet and are trading at higher valuations, said Umesh Mehta, head of research at Samco Securities.
2) For India Inc, the December quarter remained lackluster in terms of earnings growth. A Mint analysis of 2,018 listed companies (excluding banks, financial services firms and oil and gas companies) showed that aggregate profit growth, after adjusting for one-time gains or losses, was at 5.29% in the three months ended 31 December, the slowest in five quarters.
3) Many brokerages have cut their earnings per share (EPS) estimate for FY19 and FY20. “Our FY19/20 Nifty EPS estimates have been cut by 2.8/3.0% to  ₹496/629 (prior:  ₹510/648),"" domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal said in a note.
4) Further weighing on Indian markets, global oil prices have been on a rising trend in recent months.
5) International Brent crude oil futures have moved past $66 per barrel, the highest level this year. The price of crude has gained nearly 20% this year, driven primarily by the prospect of a decline in oil supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other top exporters such as Russia.
6) India’s trade deficit for January widened to $14.7 billion, from $13.1 billion in December, largely due to higher oil prices.
7) And going ahead, domestic brokerage Edelweiss expects the trade deficit to remain high. “We expect exports to remain weak owing to weak global demand. Further, crude oil prices are now higher than in the past two months. Crude prices and global demand remain key monitorables,"" the brokerage said.
8) The next major support for the Nifty is seen at 10,500 and if this level is breached, markets could head further lower, says Jayant Manglik, president of Religare Broking. Participants are now eyeing the global cues like US-China trade talks and global oil prices, in absence of any major event, he added. The next round of talks between the United States and China to resolve their trade war will take place in Washington from later today, with follow-up sessions at a higher level later in the week.
9) On the domestic front, profit-taking in private banking counters and IT majors, which were holding the benchmark index, are added negatives, he added.
10) Atul Bhole, vice-president and fund manager at DSP Investment Managers, said there were multiple factors dampening sentiment. “To begin with, Indian markets are quite expensive as compared to global peers, which is why other markets are preferred. Also, uncertainty around the elections is adding to the jitters,"" he said."

244,2019-03-29,Infosys,"ABN AMRO will continue to hold the remaining 25% stake in Stater, which operates in the Netherlands, Belgium and GermanyInfosys says the ABN AMRO deal for Stater is in alignment with its strategy to strengthen its mortgage servicing capabilities in Europe

Mumbai: India’s second largest IT services firm Infosys on Thursday said it will acquire 75% stake in ABN AMRO Bank’s wholly owned subsidiary, Stater, for €127.5 million (about  ₹989 crore). Both the companies have signed an agreement to this effect.
Founded in 1997, Stater provides end-to-end mortgage administration services in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.
As part of the deal, Infosys will acquire 75% of the shareholding in Stater, while ABN AMRO will continue to hold the remaining 25%, Infosys said in a statement.
Infosys said the partnership is in alignment with its strategy to strengthen its mortgage servicing capabilities in Continental Europe. The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, subject to customary closing conditions, it added.
“This transaction strengthens our approach to offer clients digital platforms and industry focused solutions. It brings together our complementary capabilities to enhance the value we offer to our financial services clients,"" Infosys president Mohit Joshi said.
The current management team of Stater will continue to steer the company, it added.
“While mortgages are a key product for ABN AMRO, providing administrative mortgage services is not a core activity. That’s why we are very pleased with Infosys as Stater’s new majority shareholder. ABN AMRO will keep a strategic interest of 25% and will continue to be an important client to Stater,"" Christian Bornfeld, member of the executive board of ABN AMRO, said.
Infosys said mortgage services is a focus area for large corporations in the financial sector, given the importance of the asset on a bank’s balance sheet.
“The specialised knowledge and experience of Stater in the mortgage services market, combined with the global reach, AI, digital transformation and automation capabilities of Infosys, can potentially create differentiated solutions for the market,"" it added.
In a regulatory filing, Infosys said it will have the rights of a majority shareholder as part of the terms of the shareholders’ agreement.
On Thursday, Infosys shares rose 1.30% to  ₹738.50 apiece on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex gained 1.08% to end the day at 38,545.72 points."
243,2019-04-05,Infosys,"How a bunch of entrepreneurs built Mindtree over two decades but forgot to fence it against a hostile takeover by L&T

New Delhi: Late one Sunday evening in March this year, V.G. Siddhartha, who was in Mumbai, texted Mindtree Ltd’s executive chairman Krishnakumar Natarajan in Bengaluru about his decision to sell 20.3% shares the founder of the Café Coffee Day had held for close to two decades in the information technology (IT) outsourcing company to Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T). An agitated Natarajan, who knew that the company risked an ownership change, spoke to his friend and another co-founder Subroto Bagchi, who was in Bhubaneswar, more than 1,700km from Mumbai.
Three years ago, Bagchi had relinquished his role as executive chairman of the firm to devote time to his new calling as chairman of Odisha Skill Development Authority.
Though immersed in his new role, Bagchi hadn’t forgotten Mindtree. After all he, along with nine other friends, had set up the company on 18 August 1999.
“An imminent threat of hostile takeover of Mindtree has made me to resign from the government to be able to go, save the company. I must protect the Tree from people who have arrived with bulldozers & saw chains to cut it down so that in its place, they can build a shopping mall,"" Bagchi tweeted at 8.37pm on 17 March.
An imminent threat of hostile takeover of Mindtree has made me to resign from the Government to be able to go, save the company. I must protect the Tree from people who have arrived with bulldozers & saw chains to cut it down so that in its place, they can build a shopping mall.
Seven minutes later, he tweeted again.
“Mindtree has not been designed as an “asset"" to be bought & sold. It is a national resource. It has a unique culture that humanizes the idea of business. It sets the standards of corporate governance. I need to be there in its time of difficulty. Hence the hard decision to return.""
Mindtree has not been designed as an “asset to be bought & sold. It is a national resource. It has a unique culture that humanizes the idea of business. It sets the standards of corporate governance. I need to be there in its time of difficulty. Hence the hard decision to return
Over the next 48 hours, the three co-founders, including Natarajan, Bagchi and chief executive Rostow Ravanan, played the emotive card to express their unhappiness over what was India’s first hostile takeover bid in the IT services sector.
Not everyone was impressed. “Quite clearly, the bulldozer tweet and the decision to cast L&T as a villain is something the founders could have avoided. This is not how business leaders run,"" said an executive at a large IT firm, requesting anonymity.
But Natarajan, Bagchi and Co. aren’t cast in the same mould as other business leaders. To understand their present woes, one needs to go back to the beginning.
A brief history of the Tree
Fifteen years before the country was witness to the startup frenzy of 2014, Mindtree was set up by 10 friends, who came from Wipro Ltd, Cambridge Technology Partners Inc. and Lucent Technologies in 1999. Ashok Soota, who was then the vice-chairman of Wipro’s IT services business, had started discussions with Siddhartha, the firm’s first investor. After another two rounds of meetings, Soota was convinced, and told Azim Premji, Wipro’s charismatic chairman, about his decision to leave the company in February that year.
Over the next five-and-a-half months, a period which also witnessed the first dotcom boom in India, eight other co-founders joined Soota. Siddhartha and venture capital firm Walden Software put in about $8 million, while Soota and his eight friends came up with $1.4 million.
Finally, on the morning of 19 August, the nine co-founders, led by Soota, who was appointed as chairman and managing director, announced Mindtree to the world at a press conference in Bengaluru. A get together in the evening at Taj Residency was attended by over 100 guests, including Premji and Nandan Nilekani of Infosys Ltd.
S. Janakiraman, who was Wipro’s global head of research and development at the time and who would join in October as the 10th co-founder, was understandably missing from the party.
Mindtree, which raised $9.5 million, was valued at $40 million in 1999. The 10 co-founders, together, owned 75% of the new company while Siddhartha and Walden Software, which exited in 2012, owned the remaining 25% shares.
In 1999, Wipro’s IT services business was a tad over $100 million while Infosys had ended the financial year with $120 million in revenue. In 2001, Capital Group invested $10 million while an additional $4.4 million was put in by Franklin Templeton (Siddhartha got them into the company), Soota, Siddhartha and Walden. By now the firm’s valuation had jumped to $80 million. Six years later, Mindtree, after having raised over $24 million, went public in February 2007.
Mindtree, like many of the other IT vendors, deploys engineers to do software testing, manage IT infrastructure and write codes for applications that eventually help its clients, from Microsoft Corp. to Southwest Airlines Co. run their business. It wasn’t a unique proposition but investors still liked the IT story and its shares were subscribed 110 times.
Now, the company’s founders owned about 35.46%, a number that would progressively go down even as they focused on building a unique work culture incorporating some of the best practices from companies such as Infosys and Wipro.
Indeed, Mindtree’s two-decade journey is full of moments that can be the stuff of business school curriculums. One such instance shows how the firm won an account. A month after he had joined Mindtree as head of marketing, Joseph King arrived in Mindtree’s US office early one morning and made a direct call to Larry Kinder, the chief information officer (CIO) of Avis, the car rental firm.
“The IT business is all about relationships. So Joe came into the office early and called directly because he realized that was the only time he could connect with him as the receptionists would not have come in at that hour,"" Soota recounted in an interview.
Kinder took the call, liked the story, gave Mindtree executives an appointment and finally agreed to give them business, which over a three-year period became a $7 million account.
“I was employee no. 7 in the US and I joined Mindtree on 4 October 1999,"" said Joseph King, who now heads marketing and communications for Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) in the US. “I remember speaking to the Avis CIO in November 1999 and we started our engagement there in early 2000.""
However, the company also had its fair share of near-death experiences. The dotcom crash in 2000 was the first, followed quickly by the 11 September 2001 terrorist attack. “The second round of funding, led by Capital Group, got closed in the first week of September 2001, days before 9/11,"" said Janakiraman. “Post 9/11, it was a different world and imagine what would have happened had there been any delay.""
The financial crisis in 2008 was another. The company’s failed move to make mobile handsets, after it paid $8 million to buy Kyocera Wireless’s India R&D unit in 2009, only to shelve it later, was yet another. This failed attempt was too big a setback for Soota, who was spearheading this move. He decided to leave the company in 2011 and subsequently sold his 11.6% shares to Siddhartha, whose ownership increased to 20.32%.
Finally, Mindtree’s long restructuring exercise, which saw the firm hire management consulting major Bain and Co. in 2013, was another phase when both growth and profitability took a hit.
But Mindtree steered through each of these setbacks. Four reasons essentially explain how Mindtree survived many of the challenges it faced.
During the dot-com crisis, when almost 198 of the 200 companies that were set up in 1999 crashed, Mindtree had enough money to steer through the stress. “We survived because we had taken a lot of money and we still had money when the dot-com crash happened,"" said Soota.
Second, the decision to include engineering business helped the firm diversify with an alternative revenue stream.
Third, during the dot-com crash and then again during the financial crisis of 2008, the senior management, led by the founders, agreed to take salary cuts. Salaries of senior management were cut by 20-25% while mid-level managers agreed to a 10% cut. Finally, there was the excellent rapport between the founding team and the key investors, the two VCs in Walden Software and Siddhartha.
Betrayal or Bailout
So when the crunch came in 2018, why did Siddhartha choose to sell his crucial 20.32% stake in Mindtree at  ₹980 a share to L&T, even though the founders had repeatedly expressed their reservations to him about India’s largest engineering and construction company which had in the past, too, made overtures for a stake sale? After all, just two weeks before L&T’s announcement on 18 March, another global private equity firm had agreed to buy the shares at  ₹975, in a deal that was acceptable to Mindtree founders.
Siddhartha was forced to sell his shares because of a sudden liquidity squeeze in the lending markets, triggered by defaults in payments by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd in August. It led to his lenders calling in  ₹3,000 crore of loans given to him against his entire holding in Mindtree which had been pledged. 
With repayment deadlines fast approaching, he needed to monetize his holding in Mindtree at the earliest. However, none of the dozen-odd private equity firms, sovereign funds and long-term funds which were interested in buying his shares was okay with a complex deal. This was because for any sale to take place, the potential buyer needed to pay for the unpledging of the shares before buying them or at least agreeing to an arrangement wherein the shares stayed with the banks even while the transaction to sell them was underway. A deal just couldn’t happen as none of them was willing to pay unless the shares were transferred.
“They could have tried to get Infosys’s founders, including (N.R. Narayana) Murthy, (S.D.) Shibulal, and Krish (Senapathy Gopalakrishnan) to pick up some shares,"" said a former Infosys executive. “They would not have risked losing control of their firm. But the founders (Mindtree) thought nothing will happen to them.""
Natarajan does not comment on why the firm could not have got a friendly investor from an existing IT firm to buy Siddhartha’s shares, saying the founders did everything they could. It is also possible that at this moment of crisis, they missed Soota’s contacts and astuteness.
“Ashok was clearly the captain,"" said Janakiraman. “He was more like a father-figure to all of us and helped us stay sane as we sorted through each of the episodes.""
So did Mindtree miss Soota during this period? “Possibly,"" said Janakiraman.
“Absolutely not,"" Natarajan said, adding that the founders did everything possible to fend off the hostile takeover bid.

What is clear is that their inability to buy the shares of the five co-founders who exited the company over the years, in the process leaving the current founders with just 13.32%, cost them dearly—perhaps even their control over the company. Thus, when Soota exited in 2010, he sold his substantial 11.61% stake to Siddhartha. Ditto for Kalyan Banerjee and Anjan Lahiri, who together sold 2.06% in the open market.
Looking ahead
Even as Mindtree’s four independent directors evaluate the unsolicited offer by L&T, it appears a given that L&T will eventually get to own Mindtree.
L&T’s two listed technology firms, L&T Infotech Ltd and L&T Technology Services Ltd ended with $1.13 billion and $580.4 million in revenue, respectively, in the year ended March 2018. The company has said it intends to keep Mindtree, which ended with $846.8 million last year, separate for now. However, most analysts like JP Morgan Chase and Co. analyst Viju George expect parent L&T to combine the three entities once they, together, cross $5 billion in revenue. This will take at least three years, provided two of the three companies clock a 15% annual growth.
ALSO READ | A culture shock awaits Mindtree employees under L&T
Will combining the three firms be enough to compete against the large IT firms? Mumbai-based Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) will end the current year with more than $20 billion in revenue while Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., which follows January-December as the financial year, is expected to end with over $17 billion. Bengaluru-based Infosys will end with over $11 billion while HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd will end with more than $8 billion each.
Clearly, L&T’s consolidated IT business will still lack enough firepower to compete against the big boys of the industry. At best, it will be competing with Tech Mahindra Ltd, GlobalLogic and other mid-tier IT firms.
ALSO READ | Mindtree battle enters final decisive phase
The downside risk is in the cultural mismatch. Mindtree’s informal culture, where many employees call members of the founding team by their first names is in contrast with command-and-control and top-down management at L&T.
For now, Mindtree founders don’t have many options other than to delay the inevitable and negotiate for a smooth transition. Management guru Peter Drucker best described it as: “Many problems cannot be solved; they have to be survived."" Ironically, Bagchi often recounted this to employees in the past when the company was faced with challenging times."

241,2019-04-08,Infosys,"The note also that the banking and financial services vertical, a critical segment for the IT industry, is facing its own set of challengesGrowth challenges apart, the industry faces headwinds on the margins front

MUMBAI :
What goes up must come down. India’s information technology (IT) exports are estimated to have risen 9.2% in FY19, faster than the 7.8% growth in the preceding fiscal, according to industry lobby group Nasscom. With major IT companies set to report FY19 results and provide an outlook for the new fiscal, a moot question is if growth rates will scale down.
After all, apart from the high base effect for some companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, the industry needs to contend with a global slowdown. This double whammy has already hit growth at Accenture Plc, which reported results for the quarter ended February late last month. The company’s financial year starts in September and ends in August.
In the quarter ended August 2018, Accenture had reported revenue growth of 11% in local currency terms. But this year, growth slowed to 9.5% and 9% in the first and second quarters, respectively. Based on its guidance for the rest of the year, growth is estimated at 8.5% and 7% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively.
“Accenture indicated that macro uncertainties remain and budgets for next year will grow but less than last year,"" analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a 29 March note to clients. The fact that Accenture’s growth is dropping even in the March-August period, which coincides with a seasonally strong period for the sector, is a negative, the broker added.
But such worries are missing from the Street’s estimates of FY20 growth as well as commentary by top IT companies. Both seem quite sanguine. The general belief is that growth in FY20 will be more or less similar to that in FY19, on the back of large order wins in the past year. “Benefit from strong deal flow and increasing digital deal sizes will be offset to some extent with slower spending growth in budgets in FY20. We expect broadly similar industry growth in FY20,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a 29 March note to clients.
The note also that the banking and financial services vertical, a critical segment for the IT industry, is facing its own set of challenges. The segment’s contribution to Accenture’s revenue has fallen sharply, with growth slowing to just 2% in the February 2019 quarter from 7% in the year-ago period. “Any replication of weak BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance)/Europe trends at tier-1 IT could be a risk to Street growth expectations,"" Nomura’s analysts said.
Apart from the uncertain macro conditions, Accenture’s growth has been hit because of a high base in the year-ago period. Growth of 10-11% was among the highest in recent years, as the chart shows. Likewise, for Indian companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, growth picked up materially in FY19 and represents a relatively high base as well. But for some such as Infosys Ltd, which is in the middle of a recovery, growth may well turn out to be a tad higher this fiscal.
Growth challenges apart, the industry faces headwinds on the margins front. The rupee has appreciated materially in recent months, which in itself is a large setback as far as profitability is concerned. Besides, thanks to increasing restrictions on visas in the US, the cost of delivering on-site services has increased. “Profitability will face the test of increasing cost on-site,"" said Kotak’s analysts.
Despite all of these challenges, most IT stocks are now trading at a 25-30% premium to their five-year median valuation multiples, according to JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd. If growth rates do end up slowing down in FY20, so will these lofty valuations. After all, what goes up must come down.

240,2019-04-09,Infosys,"Companies in the IT and banking sectors are expected to report decent numbersConsumption slowdown, especially in rural India, may weigh on automobile and FMCG earnings

Corporate earnings have been a constant source of disappointment for many quarters now. However, the tide seems to be turning. Bloomberg’s one-year forward consensus estimates for the Nifty’s earnings per share (EPS) are heading north (see chart).
The optimism is driven by the improving health of banks and expanding liquidity conditions. However, the ongoing consumption slowdown and subdued global growth cannot be ignored. In such a scenario, apart from the revenue and profit figures, investors should focus on cues about whether these estimates will sustain.
Automobiles: Tepid demand leading to high inventories can hit the earnings of auto companies. A watch on the demand outlook is, thus, essential. Investors will want to know the production strategies given that BS VI emission norms will be implemented from 1 April 2020. Concerns related to Brexit continue to haunt Tata Motors. Hence, investors would want to keep a watch on the commentary on Jaguar Land Rover.
Aviation: Financial woes at Jet Airways (India) Ltd pushed up airfares for metro routes during the quarter. IndiGo (InterGlobe Aviation Ltd) and SpiceJet Ltd are expected to gain. However, higher yields can be counter-balanced by a decline in the passenger load factor. In February, domestic passenger growth registered its slowest monthly gain in over five years.
Banks, NBFCs: Public sector banks’ recapitalization ratios will be watched. Commentary on unrecognized stresses in corporate loans, and the pace of bad loan resolution through the insolvency framework are crucial. Market share gain for banks from NBFCs is another important indicator. For NBFCs, the key parameters are asset-liability management, the liquidity outlook and the cost of funds.
Cement: March is a strong quarter for the sector. However, government-driven demand could have been impacted by the forthcoming general election. Choppy price trends make commentary on overall pricing important. As input costs ease, the outlook on margins is key. 
FMCG: Commentary on volume growth of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms is crucial after worries of a consumption slowdown have surfaced. Easing input costs make the outlook regarding margin growth important. Investors will be keen to know if ad spend will be trimmed.
Information technology: Usually, the March quarter is weak for the IT sector as customers are into their budgeting term. This time, however, the execution of recently-won deals would aid performance. Revenue guidance for fiscal year 2020 along with deal pipeline will be closely watched. Also, the outlook on the banking and financial services vertical, considering weak global macro conditions, is important. The impact of new stringent US H-1B visa norms on sub-contracting costs and hiring plans too will be crucial.
Real estate: Investors will want to know how the transition to new accounting standards and the new goods and services tax regime have impacted the sector. Buyers may have delayed purchases because of the latter. Launch pipelines and inventory data should be watched. Other vital cues will come from real estate pricing strategies and how debt levels are moving."

""In the near term, we continue to remain cautious on the Indian markets, as we believe choppiness is likely to remain high. In the coming sessions, focus of investors would shift to Q4FY19 earnings season and domestic macro data (IIP, CPI & WPI), which are likely to dictate the trend of the market,"" said Jayant Manglik, president for retail distribution at Religare Broking.
""Further, market participants would closely monitor the progress of central elections, behaviour of crude oil prices and fluctuation in currency, as it would further induce volatility in the markets.""

For stocks worldwide, it may be time to worry about the upcoming earnings season. But there’s one place where profit estimates are surging: India.
The fundamentals of corporate India are improving, and the average analyst projection for next year’s earnings at S&P BSE Sensex Index companies has jumped to a record high -- not just in rupee terms, but also in US dollars. That’s a stark contrast with members of the MSCI All-Country World Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which have seen steady declines in estimates.
“We expect the earnings recovery momentum to continue this quarter as well with aggregate earnings growth expected in mid-double digits,"" said Jyoti Vaswani, the Mumbai-based chief investment officer at Future Generali India Life Insurance Co. overseeing  ₹40 billion ($570 million) in assets. She expects corporate banks to report a significant recovery in earnings, while retail banks are expected to continue with their steady performance.
The beginning of the earnings recovery may be apparent in results for the final quarter of the last financial year, ended March 31, particularly when it comes to banks. With financials accounting for more than a third of the Sensex, good results for the sector could help boost the nation’s stock market. A pickup in credit demand and a recovery in loans is helping the firms now, after a mountain of bad debt — especially at state-run banks — dented profitability last year and took the market down 14 percent from a peak.
“We expect earnings to grow at 15 percent to 20 percent and that should drive markets higher, bringing in foreign investors,"" Vaswani said. “With this, domestic investors, too, should start coming back.""

236,2019-04-12,Infosys,"Analysts expect TCS and Infosys to report 'healthy' revenue growth in March quarterMargins may face headwinds from wage inflation

India’s top software exporters, TCS and Infosys, report March quarter results today, kicking off the earnings season. Despite March being a seasonally weak quarter for IT companies, Elara Capital expects India IT services firms to report a good quarter of revenue growth. Another brokerage Motilal Oswal also sees IT companies reporting another quarter of “healthy"" set of numbers. “There is significant revenue acceleration amid strong momentum in deal activity; however, the rupee appreciation can act as a headwind,"" Motilal Oswal said in a note. Infosys and TCS shares edged higher today in early trade. 
Shares of IT companies have outperformed markets in the past one year, with Nifty IT index rising about 24% as compared to 11% gain for the Nifty50 index. Both TCS and Infosys are set to report earnings after market hours today.
The Indian IT sector has also been in the spotlight in the wake of some big deals in the sector. Baring Asia Private Equity has agreed to acquire the founders’ (promoters + NIIT) stake in NIIT Technologies. L&T bought a fifth of Mindtree from coffee baron VG Siddhartha and companies related to him for  ₹3,269 crore and said it planned to raise its stake to 66%.
Here are 5 things to watch out for in TCS, Infosys results:
Growth guidance: Infosys had in January raised its full-year revenue outlook to 8.5-9% in constant currency terms from the earlier 6-8%. Some analysts expect Infosys to guide for a higher growth in FY20. “We expect revenue growth guidance of at least 9-11% in constant currency terms, given the buoyant demand environment,"" Elara Capital said in a note.
TCS in the December quarter had posted a fourth straight quarter of year-on-year double-digit revenue growth in constant currency terms. Analysts say that TCS’ impressive deal wins over the past few quarters should help it maintain growth in the next fiscal.
Margins: The margin prospects of IT companies assume critical importance in the light of major cost headwinds in the form of wage inflation owing to talent shortage, say analysts. “Levers for margin defence are steadily eroding, with utilisation at reasonably high levels, rupee tailwind receding and investments in the business likely to remain a constant need to scale-up digital growth,"" Reliance Securities said in a note. “We would watch the margin picture in FY20, and believe growth, increasing automation and higher digital pricing owing to high demand are the key levers for margin defence.""
In the December quarter, Infosys profitability took a hit while Mumbai-based TCS too saw a contraction in operating margin. Infosys had reported an operating margin of 22.6% in the October-December quarter, 110 basis points narrower than the 23.7% in the July-September period. The operating margin of TCS had also narrowed by 90 basis points to 25.6% in October-December quarter from 26.5% in the July-September period, hurt by cross-currency movement and higher employee costs.
Elara Capital expects Infosys to guide for an EBIT margin guidance of 21-23% for FY20.
Management commentary: The commentary from top bosses from TCS and Infosys will be closely watched to gauge the demand scenario for IT services as global slowdown worries take centre stage. However, some analysts believe that the IT sector is poised for a multi-year spending uptick as it is in the middle of a major technology refresh cycle. “Despite macro headwinds, we expect commentary across most firms to be positive. The US economy continues to do well,"" analysts at Elara Capital said in a recent note.
Share buybacks: Return of cash to shareholders is a theme that continues to play out with many Indian IT services companies resorting to share buy-backs to make better usage of their cash balances. Bengaluru-based Wipro this week said that that its board will discuss buyback proposal on its meeting scheduled on April 16. A buyback can be done only once in 12 months. Infosys had earlier in January this year approved a  ₹8,260 crore share buyback, the second successive repurchase in as many years. In June last year, TCS had approved a  ₹16,000 crore share buyback.
BFSI vertical: IT companies could see a slower growth from the banking vertical for the industry in FY2020, says Kotak Institutional Equities. “Overall we expect broadly similar industry growth for IT services in FY2020 with growth to be front-ended,"" it added.
“The stock returns for IT companies can be muted from here after a strong performance in the past 12 months,"" says the brokerage."
235,2019-04-12,Infosys,"FMCG, auto and banking stocks led the markets higherMidcap and smallcap stocks also notched up gains
Indian markets closer higher today, lifted by gains in banking, auto and FMCG stocks. Investors await cues from results of Infosys Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd later in the day. Analysts expect the IT bellwethers to report a good quarter of revenue growth but profitability could be hurt due to higher costs. Infosys rose 0.52% while TCS slipped 0.25%.
Investors also eye retail inflation data, which will be released after the close of market hours.
India's retail inflation is expected to have accelerated to 2.80% in March from 2.57% in February on slightly higher food prices, a Reuters poll predicted. It, however, remains under the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 4%.

In broader markets, SpiceJet Ltd rose 9% after the airline said it would induct 16 Boeing 737-800 aircraft into its fleet to 'bring down flight cancellations to nil'.

232,2019-04-13,Infosys,"Q4 results show TCS crossed $20 billion in annual revenue while Infosys delivered on top end of full-year revenue outlookTCS continued its margin dominance with 25.1% in Q4 while Infosys came with a guidance that chimes with a challenging environment

New Delhi: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd kicked off Q4 earnings season on a strong note Friday, with their March quarter revenues growing by close to double-digits in dollar terms. The Tata company crossed the milestone of $20 billion in annual revenue for the first time while Infosys provided a reasonably acceptable margin outlook for the ongoing financial year.
TCS’ Q4 revenue rose 8.5% year-on-year to $5.39 billion. The net profit was up 7.8% at $1.15 billion, meeting a Bloomberg estimate of 20 brokers.
“Double-digit growth, higher quality of the incremental business, and best-in-class execution capabilities have helped us expand our operating margin year on year. Our foresight in investing very early on in building digital skills and transformational capabilities has not only gained us market share, but has also resulted in our very resilient, industry-leading margin today,"" said V. Ramakrishnan, chief financial officer (CFO) at Tata Consultancy Services.
Infosys’ Q4 revenue rose 9.1% on year to $3.06 billion. The company delivered on the top end of its 9% annual revenue growth outlook in constant currency terms, the outlook having been increased from 6-8% in the last quarter. It delivered on the Ebit margin outlook for FY19 as well, the metric coming at 22.8%, albeit towards the lower end of the company’s guidance of 22-24%.

Ebit stands for earnings before interest and taxes.
Profits of Infosys were up 1.7% at $581 million in the March quarter, higher than the Bloomberg estimate of $570.07 billion.
TCS continued its margin dominance with 25.1% in the just-concluded quarter, while Infosys came with a guidance that chimes with a challenging environment, as currency tailwinds are put behind and the US gets stricter with visa permissions.
Infosys has given an operating margin guidance of 21-23% on a revenue growth outlook of 7.5-9.5% in constant currency terms. In the last quarter, Infosys’ operating margin was 21.5%.
In constant currency terms, the March quarter revenue of TCS rose 12.7%, the fifth straight quarter of year-on-year double-digit revenue growth in constant currency terms for the Mumbai-based company. Infosys’ revenue growth in constant currency terms for the quarter was right behind TCS’s at 11.7%.
Infosys continues to suffer from high attrition, a concern accepted by chief operating officer Pravin Rao during a press briefing. The attrition rate increased to 20.4% in Q4FY19 from 19.5% in the same period last year. The company had net additions of 2,622 staff in the quarter gone by against TCS’s 6,356.
“...Realization per billed employee was steady, which reflects increasing usage of automation in core services and faster growth in newer digital services,"" said Rao. “Overall attrition remains high and we are continuing our focus on arresting the same.""
At a press conference, the TCS management brushed aside concerns on the impact of H-1B visa changes. The concerns arose as the US government had said a few months ago that the H-1B lottery selection process will be reversed to favour advanced degree holders from US universities. There is a yearly cap of 65,000 on new H-1B visa issuance, with an additional 20,000 visas for those with advanced degrees from a US institution.
“From an H-1B point of view, there are some changes, but a local degree was always a criteria. So there will be an advantage for people who have done masters in the US. Wherever we are we have to hire locally, that is the culture, and we have to meet the talent demand of the area,"" said Ajoy Mukherjee, executive vice president and global head of recruitment at TCS.
India is one of the largest beneficiaries of the popular H-1B visa regime that allows professionals to work there.
TCS chief executive officer and managing director Rajesh Gopinathan said that revenue from industry segments such as banking and financial services have improved and are in a much better position than last year.
“All elements of our strategy have worked this year,"" he said.
""We are more focused on opportunities at a customer level. Macro is important but macro doesn’t buy, customers buy. Our new deals have been built on organically invested assets to generate market leading opportunities in order to drive the digital champion status we are seeking.""
On Friday, TCS shares fell 0.26% to  ₹2,013.75 apiece on the BSE while those of Infosys gained 0.63% to  ₹747.85 per share. The benchmark Sensex gained 0.41% to end the at 38,767.11 points. The BSE IT Index gained 0.19% to close at 15,471.41 points.

231,2019-04-14,Infosys,"Order bookings at TCS and Infosys are robust, providing good revenue visibilityBut the premium valuations of both companies capture the growth expectations

IT behemoths Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd reported strong growth for the March quarter, clocking 2.4% and 2.1% sequential rises, respectively, in constant-currency revenue. The Street, at best, expected the companies to report a 2% growth.
The performance underscores strong execution and strong order inflows. Infosys signed large deals of $1.57 billion, taking the cumulative size of deals won to $6.28 billion for the full year. This is twice that of FY18. TCS also did well, bagging contracts of $6.2 billion last quarter, higher than the $5.9 billion of deals it secured in the December quarter.
The strong deal wins place both TCS and Infosys in a commanding spot for FY20. “Our order book is bigger than in the prior three quarters, and the deal pipeline is robust,"" said Rajesh Gopinathan, chief executive officer and managing director of TCS.
The commentary reinforces the belief that the growth momentum, which picked up in FY19 will continue in FY20. However, for investors looking for growth acceleration to justify further increases in the valuation of TCS and Infosys, the March quarter results provide limited levers.
The rising cost of business is increasingly undermining profitability. TCS’s operating margin contracted for the second straight quarter. It softened 30 basis points from a year ago to 25.1% in the fourth quarter of FY19. A basis point is 0.01%.
The impact is more pronounced at Infosys, which is behind in digital investments. Its operating margin dropped 3.2 percentage points from a year ago, to 21.5%. The continuing need for more investments means profitability could be suppressed in FY20 as well.
Infosys’s 7.5–9.5% constant-currency revenue-growth guidance for FY20 implies no significant acceleration from the year gone by. Its constant-currency revenue grew 9% in FY19. The company’s guidance may be conservative given the backdrop of its strong order book and guidance revision during FY19. However, it also underscores uneven recovery in its key business verticals.
Comparatively, key business segments at TCS have seen notable acceleration in growth rates from the year-ago quarter (Q4 of FY18). The better performance should help TCS maintain the valuation premium to Infosys. Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities estimates that the TCS stock trades at 22 times FY20 earnings estimates and Infosys, at 19 times. TCS’s valuation hinges on whether it can arrest the profitability erosion.
Investors need to be mindful of the softening business environment. Industry surveys show sluggish manufacturing activity in key markets of the US and Europe. Continued slowdown in the business environment could compel customers to delay execution, potentially delaying revenue accretion, warns Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities. How well these risks, macroeconomic and cost pressures, are managed will determine stock returns in FY20."
225,2019-04-15,Infosys,"Though there are some macroeconomic headwinds on the horizon, steady growth is expected over the next several years in the Indian outsourcing industry

This February, the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) stopped publishing its yearly estimate for India’s IT exports and refrained from providing guidance for fiscal year 2019-20. Nasscom numbers had long been cited by captains of Indian IT industry for communicating their quarterly results to the world.
Infosys Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd announced their Q4 results last week, and the rest will follow over the coming days. However, investors cannot act upon the information in the absence of industry-wide data. Since Nasscom is refraining from providing a growth benchmark, investors will look for the vacuum to be filled by analysts and consulting firms.
One such is ISG, my former employer. It puts out a quarterly view of the industry called the ISG Index. Since outsiders’ visibility gets murkier as deals get smaller, it refrains from commenting on deals that are smaller than a certain size ($5 million presently) in annual contract value (ACV). Nonetheless, its methodology is robust, and it produces a startlingly accurate view of the deal cycles in the industry.
I recently met Michael Connors, chairman and chief executive officer of ISG, who along with Bret Breeding, ISG’s data czar, proceeded to give me an education.
This column will focus on numbers, since it will highlight some aspects of ISG’s research that are germane to the current earnings season.
According to Connors, though there are macroeconomic headwinds on the horizon, ISG continues to forecast steady growth over the next several years in both the IT and business service segments globally.
ISG’s trailing 12-month growth numbers for the traditional sourcing industry clock in at 8%, yielding a number of $27.5 billion in ACV. Meanwhile, the “as-a-service"" market, which includes everything that is cloud-based, has grown at 37% on a trailing 12-month basis and now almost equals traditional services outsourcing, clocking in at $23.6 billion for the year. Combined, these numbers show a trailing 12-month growth of 20%.
These counts are for the commercial sector only; they do not include government deals and only focus on deals that are above ISG’s $5 million visibility floor. Smaller deals are difficult to trace, but these broader market numbers still suffice as a guide to the overall health of the IT industry.
Interestingly, ISG’s data shows a general decrease in ACV from approximately $20 million to $15 million from 2010 to 2015, followed by stabilization since then at the $15-million mark. The more telling statistic is that there are many more awards coming to the market in the smaller ACV bands. In 2018, the broader market finished with 60% of its awards in the smallest ACV band of $5 million to $10 million versus 2010, when this number stood at 46%. This means that despite splashy headlines, the main battles are not being fought in the mega-deal space, but in the small- and medium-sized bands. For a detailed look at these numbers, I suggest you see the ISG Index here.
What is driving the reduction in deal size?
First, deal duration decreases since software and hardware assets included in previous deals are now accounted for elsewhere and are not depreciated over long-term tenures. The 10-year deal is now a 3.5-year deal.
Second, software applications get replaced or shifted to the cloud. For example, let’s say there were 100 applications that were part of the original deal and that half of those would move to a public cloud during the contract. That means half the service provider’s workload for computing and support would now be shifted to a cloud provider such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft’s Azure. Meanwhile, other software applications would be replaced by cloud solutions like Salesforce or Workday. This results in decreased spend with the traditional service provider.
However, there is some consolation. New digital services counteract to some extent the revenue losses to the cloud. Nobody can go digital without a service provider. Here’s how digital plays out in different verticals:
One, the digital demand trends for banking and insurance are in cloud migration, cybersecurity and intelligent automation. Digital investments have also accelerated in wealth management and commercial banking. As interest rates rise, enterprises should see their profitability expand, and they will be more optimistic about spending.
Two, in manufacturing, digital spending has begun to rise as companies shrink their product development cycle and reinvent the supply chain from research and development to production to sales to customer care. Investments are aimed at 3D printing, autonomous technology and solutions to meet the demand for digital manufacturing and engineering services.
Three, the energy industry’s volatility comes from the fluctuations in crude oil prices, causing companies to continually evaluate their capital spend to manage profitability. Firms in this vertical tend to invest in the Internet of Things and robotic process automation to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.
Four, retail clients continue to strengthen their digital business channels to enhance frictionless omnichannel experiences, personalized “market of one"" retailing and responsive supply chains.
Five, the healthcare and pharma industry shows a growing interest in analytics programmes and an ongoing demand for cloud migration initiatives, but digital has not permeated the sector as much because of stringent regulations in the space. For healthcare providers and payers, the focus remains on improving efficiencies and advancing patient care and satisfaction.
The bottom line is that ISG expects digital growth to stay robust and to top 25% this year while the overall market itself will expand by 3.2% on a constant currency basis. The game has been redefined, but the prize money is still large.

227,2019-04-15,Infosys,"Infosys' localization efforts have helped its business become ""much more resilient""North America is the largest market for the Bengaluru-based firm, accounting for 61.2 per cent of its revenue

NEW DELHI :
Infosys will roll out an incentive scheme this year for employees equipped with digital skills and will aggressively re-deploy staff on projects offering opportunities to work on new technologies as it looks to stem rising attrition in the face of stricter visa rules, a top executive has said.
Infosys COO Pravin Rao, during a recent investor call, said Infosys' localization efforts have helped its business become ""much more resilient and less susceptible to the visa regime than in the past"".
""This is an effort we need to continue till we get to the 50 per cent mark,"" he added.
In January, Infosys had said it has already hired over 7,600 staff in the US - more than three-fourths of its target of recruiting 10,000 American workers. It had also spoken about making recruitment from local schools a ""sustained effort"" in the region.
North America is the largest market for the Bengaluru-based firm, accounting for 61.2 per cent of its revenue.
Infosys announced its fourth quarter financials on Friday reporting a 10.5 per cent growth in consolidated net profit at  ₹4,078 crore, and a 19.1 per cent increase in revenue at  ₹21,539 crore in the March 2019 quarter from the year-ago period.
The Bengaluru-based company, which has forecast its FY20 topline growth to be 7.5 - 9.5 per cent in constant currency terms, added 2,622 people (net) during the March 2019 quarter to take its total headcount to over 2.28 lakh.
""... attrition has marginally gone up from 17.8 per cent to 18.3 per cent on a standalone basis. A big part of the attrition is for people with 3-5 years' experience and to this set of people, the earlier value proposition was onsite opportunity,"" he said.
Rao explained that given the ""mobility challenges"" due to restrictive visa regimes, such opportunities are ""fewer"".
""So that is probably one of the reasons why they look forward to move to other opportunities, where either they are able to get higher compensation or different kind of jobs. So, from our perspective to address this, we have looked at new employee value propositions...There are many initiatives on the ground to address this,"" he said.
Rao said it will roll out an incentive scheme this year for those equipped with digital skills, and that the company is also looking at a ""much more aggressive redeployment in projects"" to allow people to work on new technologies.
""Some of these initiatives obviously will take time to bear fruit but we are confident that over a period of time, the attrition rate should come down to a manageable 13-15 per cent level,"" he said.
Infosys CEO Salil Parekh, who took over the top job last year, has outlined 'localisation', along with strategic investments and enhancing company's digital capabilities as key areas of this three-year strategic plan.
The strategy outlined focussed on stabilising Infosys' business in 2018-19, building momentum the next year, followed by acceleration in 2020-21.
Infosys, like many of its peers, has been ramping local hiring in key markets like the US, the UK and Australia to tackle increasing scrutiny around work visas by various governments.
According to the report by Care Ratings, Infosys had 2,122 visa denials in fiscal year 2017-18, followed by its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services with 1,896 rejections. The approvals, the report pointed, had declined by a sharp 50 per cent in FY18 to 22,429 from the 43,957 in the year-ago period.

228,2019-04-15,Infosys,"Infosys has guided for 7.5-9.5% revenue growth in constant currency terms in FY20Infosys operating margin in the March quarter dropped 3.2 percentage points from a year ago to 21.5%

IT major Infosys reported a mixed bag of fourth quarter numbers, with margins coming in below expectations even as revenues came in-line. Infosys also reported strong large deal wins during the quarter which came in more than $1.5 billion. Infosys’ guidance for this fiscal starting April 1, 2019, came in below the Street’s estimates. Infosys shares fell as much as 5% in early trade before closing 3% lower. Infosys' bigger rival TCS, which also reported Q4 earnings on Friday, jumped 5% today. 
Coming back to Infosys' fourth quarter numbers, the company reported strong 2.1% sequential rise in constant-currency revenue, underscoring strong execution and strong order inflows. This is the second successive quarter where Infosys has achieved more than 10% growth year-on-year in constant currency. The Bengaluru-based company said it signed large deals of $1.57 billion during the quarter, taking the cumulative size of deals won to $6.28 billion for the full year. This is twice that of FY18.
In this context, many analysts say that the growth momentum, which picked up in FY19 will continue in FY20. So, they view Infosys’ guidance of 7.5-9.5% growth in constant currency terms as conservative.
“We believe the IT major is being conservative in terms of its revenue guidance for FY19, which is slightly below what we were expecting (8-10%),"" Reliance Securities said in a note.
Ravi Menon, lead analyst for IT at Elara Capital, said that Infosys growth guidance for FY20 was ""disappointing"" given large deal wins in FY19.
In terms of profitability, Infosys operating margin in the March quarter dropped 3.2 percentage points from a year ago, to 21.5%, led by wage hike impact and possibly costs related to large deal integration. This was below the Street’s estimates. The company also expects margins to remain suppressed in FY20 as well, guiding for in a range of 21-23%.
Analysts also remained concern over rising attrition, which was above 20% in March quarter. “Attrition remains a bug-bear. This is an area that Infosys needs to focus given major digital talent shortage and attendant margin pressure due to wage cost inflation,"" Reliance Securities said in a note.
Another brokerage Centrum has revised Infosys ratings to ""Add"", from ""Buy"" earlier. ""Infosys’ Q4FY19 results delivered a steep miss on EBIT margin. The company has also lowered EBIT margin guidance band to 21-23% for FY20. We trim EPS estimates by 4.0/3.8% for FY20E/FY21E owing to the EBIT margin downgrade,"" it said in a note.
Centrum believes that the open-market buyback could act as a medium-term support for Infosys shares. Infosys initiated buyback from March 20, 2019, after receiving all requisite approvals. Out of total buyback size of  ₹8,260 crore, the company has bought back shares worth  ₹1,546 crore so far.
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), India’s largest IT services company by revenue, ended fiscal 2019 with double-digit revenue growth as the company reported a 11.4% growth in constant currency terms in the fiscal ending 31 March, the company said in a statement. For the March quarter, TCS reported a revenue growth of 2.4% from the preceding three months in constant currency terms. Revenue grew 12.7% from the same period a year ago.
This is TCS' fifth straight quarter of year-on-year double-digit revenue growth in constant currency terms.
In terms of deal wins, TCS also did well, bagging contracts of $6.2 billion last quarter, higher than the $5.9 billion of deals it secured in the December quarter.
The rising cost of business also hit TCS' profitability. Its operating margin contracted for the second straight quarter. It softened 30 basis points from a year ago to 25.1% in the fourth quarter of FY19.
Though Q4FY19 operating margin dipped 50bps QoQ, FY19 margin improved 80bps YoY. We attribute the latter to higher growth and excellent execution. Moreover, TCS’ investments in digital capabilities and sales initiatives are now reaping dividends. We believe, margin will sustain at the current level on account of robust revenue growth and tight leash on attrition.

IT major Infosys today reported a net profit of  ₹4,074 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, a growth of 10% year-on-year, helped by strong growth in its key financial services segment and large deal wins during the period. That came above the Street's estimates of  ₹3,956 crore. Revenues for the quarter rose to  ₹21,539 crore, a growth of 19.1% year-on-year and 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. Infosys margins however narrowed to 21.4% in the the March quarter of FY19, as compared to 24.7% in the same quarter of the previous year. Infosys shares closed 0.50% higher today.

3) Infosys CEO and MD Salil Parekh termed the results as strong on multiple dimensions including revenue growth, performance of digital portfolio, large deals and client metrics. ""Our planned investments have started yielding benefits. As we look ahead into fiscal 2020, we plan to deploy various measures of operational efficiencies across the business,"" he said.
4) For the financial year 2019, its board recommended a final dividend of  ₹10.50 per share.
5) For FY20, Infosys guided for an operating margin of 21%-23%. And for FY19 operating margin was at 22.8%.
6) In dollar terms, Infosys reported a revenues of $3,060 million in Q4, up 2.4% quarter-on-year and 9.1% year on year. In constant currency terms, revenues grew 11.7% year on year in constant currency. This is the second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in constant currency.
7) In Q4, digital revenues rose to $1,035 million (33.8% of total revenues), a year-on-year growth of 41.1% and sequential growth of 9.7% in constant currency.
8) The company's attrition rate however rose to 20.4% in the March quarter. “Overall attrition remains high and we are continuing our focus on arresting the same,"" COO Pravin Rao said.
9) Infosys also reported strong deal wins during the quarter. Large deal signings rose to $1.57 billion in the March quarter, taking the overall large deal wins to $6.28 billion for FY19. “We had another quarter of over $1.5 billion large deal TCV (total contract value) in Q4, as a result of which FY19 TCV doubled over FY18. Realization per billed employee was steady which reflects increasing usage of automation in core services and faster growth in newer digital services,"" said COO Pravin Rao.
10) Sanjiv Bhasin, executive VP for markets and corporate affairs at IIFL, said going forward margins of IT companies could remain under pressure due to pricing pressure on commoditised services and wage inflation due to higher onsite hiring though volume growth may remain strong. ""Technology has been an over-owned sector but going forward we are more optimistic on domestic cyclicals that can offer better value propositions,"" he said.

234,2019-04-15,Infosys,"The company added that its operating margin guidance for the FY20 would be between 21 to 23%While attrition rates have increased to 20.4% in Q4FY19, from 19.4 in the same period last year

BENGALURU :
Infosys Ltd overshot revenue and profit expectation for the financial year ended FY19 by a small margin, even as it offered to pay dividends at  ₹17.50 per share to shareholders.
A Bloomberg survey of 26 brokers had estimated Infosys’ to report revenue of $3.08 billion, or  ₹21,449.8 crore, in the current quarter. The brokers also estimated the company to report a net profit of $570.07 million, or  ₹3697.2 crore, in the same period.
However, Infosys’s fourth quarter results' announcement and guidance for fiscal year 2019-20 (FY20) may not please shareholders and analysts. The company’s statement says that revenue guidance for the financial FY20 would be between 7.5% and 9.5%.
The company added that its operating margin guidance for the FY20 would be between 21 to 23%.
Infosys also declared a special dividend of shares at  ₹10.50 per equity share and with an inclusion of  ₹7 per share via interim dividends, taking the total dividend for the year FY19 to  ₹17.50 per share.
Currency fluctuations, however, helped the company’s dollar revenue. In the January-March period (Q4FY19), Infosys reported a 2.4% sequential rise in dollar revenue to $3.06 billion, allowing it to end fiscal year 2018-19 (FY19) with $11.79 billion in revenue, a 7.9% year-on-year growth.
In constant currency terms, Infosys managed a 11.7% Y-o-Y growth in terms of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019. Additionally, Infosys also reported a 2.1% sequential growth in revenue in terms of constant currency.
In rupee terms, Infosys’ revenue for the fourth quarter of FY19 stood at  ₹21,539 crore, compared to  ₹18,083 crore a year ago during the same period. For the year ended 2019 (FY19), Infosys reported revenues of  ₹82,675 crore, up 17.2% from  ₹70,552 crore in FY18.
Infosys’s net profit increased 10.5% to  ₹ ₹4,078 crore for the fourth quarter ended 31 March, against  ₹3,690 crore in the same period a year ago. Operating margin stood at 21.5% in the fourth quarter of 2019, 110 basis points narrower than the 22.6% in the October-December period.
For the full year ended 2019, the company’s net profit decreased by 3.9% to  ₹15,410 crore. With a slight fall in profitability, the lower margin guidance for FY20 and the slightly low revenue forecast may be a dampener for investors.
The BFSI sector continued to fetch the majority of Infosys’ revenue in the year ended March 2019, accounting for 31.6% of its overall operating income in Q4FY19. However, the BFSI business saw a marginal drop in growth in the fourth quarter and so did the retail and life sciences segments.
While attrition rates have increased to 20.4% in Q4FY19, from 19.4 in the same period last year.
Revenue contributions from the digital segment (services, products and platforms), however, increased by 2.3% to around 33.8% in Q4-FY19, while retail industry accounted for around 15.9% of Infosys’ overall revenue in Q4-FY19.
“We have completed the first year of our transformation journey with strong results on multiple dimensions including revenue growth, performance of our digital portfolio, large deal wins, and client metrics.
This is a reflection of our increased client relevance stemming from our focus on digital, positioning, and longstanding client relationships"", said Salil Parekh, CEO and MD. “Our planned investments have started yielding benefits. As we look ahead into fiscal 2020, we plan to deploy various measures of operational efficiencies across the business.""
Commenting on the high attrition rates, Pravin Rao, Chief Operating Officer Infosyssaid, ""Primary challenges in meeting attrition targets are because of higher attrition across the 3-5 experience bracket, and 2-3 yrs exp in US marker. We are including milestone-based appreciation (for employees) for the upcoming year, and also encouraging our employees to take up skill upgrade courses."" Infosys aims to reduce the attrition rates to a ""slightly more comfortable"" 13-15%.
The results were declared after market hours. Infosys gained 0.63% to close at Rs747.85 per share on Friday on BSE, while the benchmark index, Sensex gained 0.41% to close at 38767.11 points and the BSE IT Index gained 0.19% to close at 15471.41 points."

The company said revenue will increase 7.5% to 9.5% in constant currency terms in the year ending March 2020. It forecast an operating margin 21% to 23% for fiscal year 2020 estimates, from an earlier guidance of 22-24% for fiscal year 2019.
The negative surprise on margin guidance is due to continued investments for future growth, including enhancing digital competencies, large deal capabilities and localisation. However, the management stated that the aggressive investments on sales revitalization are completed and the pace of investments will be less intense in fiscal year 2020 estimates.

226,2019-04-16,Infosys,"Seven years ago, Infosys’ cash flows were 23% higher than TCS’s. Now they are 55% lowerInfosys is now valued at 40% of TCS’s market capitalization. In January 2011, its valuation was only 10-12% lower

Mumbai: How times change. About 12 years ago, this column had said that if cash is king, Infosys Ltd ruled the Indian IT industry. Even though its revenues were far lower than those of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) back then, its free cash flow was higher in absolute terms.
In fact, as the chart above shows, this was true even about seven years ago. In fiscal year 2012 (FY12), Infosys’s revenues were about 30% lower compared to TCS, but its cash flows were 23% higher at $1.38 billion.
But all of this was before the leadership crisis at Infosys reared its ugly head. What soon followed was a period of flux, with multiple changes in the company’s top leadership as well as its board of directors. The impact these changes has had on Infosys’ financials qualifies as a classic case study on why companies must take leadership development and succession planning very seriously.
Seven years hence, Infosys has become a shadow of its former self, while TCS has become a far more formidable competitor.
In FY19, Infosys’s free cash flows were less than half of the $4.23 billion TCS generated as cash. This is largely a function of better revenue growth and improving profitability at TCS. In FY19, TCS’s earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) of $5.35 billion was nearly double Infosys’s Ebit of $2.71 billion. In FY12, TCS’s operating profit was only about 40% higher compared to Infosys.
While TCS’s margins have dropped around 200 basis points in the last seven years, Infosys’s margins have fallen by 600 basis points. One of the key differences is the larger spends the latter has had to make to retain employees amid all the uncertainty.
Besides, it has also had to invest higher amounts to drive growth, given the large gap in its growth rates compared to TCS.
Infosys’ troubles also began around the time when industry dynamics were changing, with increased demand for new digital services.
Companies with better capabilities in these new services did better compared to those that relied largely on traditional services.
The struggle to play catch-up, while at the same time managing high employee attrition, has evidently taken its toll. Infosys’s current margin woes are also reflective of the same struggle. While the company’s revenue growth has picked up to decent levels under its new chief executive officer, Salil Parekh, this is coming at a great cost.
All of this is of course also visible in the companies’ market valuations. Infosys is now valued 60% lower than TCS’s market capitalization of  ₹7.9 trillion. In January 2011, its valuation was only 10-12% lower.
Great is the price that Infosys shareholders have paid for the company’s leadership woes."
224,2019-04-17,Infosys,"Wipro’s revenue growth in Q4 has slowed after just two quarters of acceleration even as TCS and Infosys surged aheadWipro’s guidance of a -1% to 1% revenue growth on a sequential basis in Q1 FY20 provides limited confidence

Mumbai: Just when it was thought Wipro Ltd had recovered from its growth problems, its March quarter (Q4) results have once again raised uncomfortable questions about revenue growth.
Revenue growth slowed just two quarters after acceleration. The sequential constant currency revenue growth stood at just 1% in Q4. In the previous two quarters it grew in the range of 2-3%. This is in contrast to the revenue acceleration theme investors are banking on.
Year-on-year growth rate declined marginally last quarter, unlike its peers, where growth rates had increased last quarter. As was the case with Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, Wipro said it is seeing strong deal momentum and has a healthy pipeline, which should help it deliver better FY20 than FY19. However, mere 5.4% growth in FY19 means the bar is not high. TCS and Infosys clocked 11.4% and 9% growth, respectively, in FY19.
Worse, Wipro’s guidance of a -1% to 1% revenue growth on a sequential basis in the June quarter provides limited confidence. The guidance of revenue contraction in a worst-case scenario goes against the strong deal momentum commentary.
According to the management, some large projects it has won require time to ramp-up. Besides, the healthcare and manufacturing business verticals, which generate a fifth of Wipro’s revenue, are struggling for growth and are impacting overall growth rates.
The management says it is focusing on earnings accretive business and is selectively participating in traditional contracts. This is leading to better quality earnings reflective in margin improvement (FY19 vs FY18) and cash flow generation. But as one analyst with a domestic broking house points out, the margin improvement is coming on a lower base vis-à-vis larger peers TCS and Infosys. And, in any case, the depreciation in the rupee has aided profitability for most IT firms in FY19.
In any case, margin improvement can only take earnings so far. Ultimately, revenue needs to grow at decent rates for investors to be impressed. Wipro’s key business verticals show uneven recovery, with growth largely being driven by the banking financial services and consumer business units. Three business verticals—healthcare, manufacturing, technology—saw a year- on-year fall in revenues in constant currency terms last quarter.
At 16 times estimated FY20 earnings, Wipro is trading at a discount to TCS and Infosys’s price-earnings multiple of 22 times and 19 times, respectively, reflecting subdued expectations on the Street. The widening gap in revenue growth rates may further deepen the valuation discount. And as if this wasn’t enough, Wipro has also reported issues related to cybersecurity. If the matter isn’t contained quickly enough to the satisfaction of clients, it may well have the potential to derail growth further."

In 2017, Wipro had undertaken a  ₹11,000 crore buyback and in 2016, a  ₹2,500 crore programme.

Indian markets on Monday fell 1.3%, its steepest fall of 2019, as a rise in global crude oil prices heightened concern about domestic inflationary pressure and fiscal slippages.

“Indian markets had a rough day today, on the back of sharp rise in crude oil price. As a significant importer of crude oil, the high oil price is not good for Indian macros. Further, after breath-taking rally of past two months, a correction was due in the Indian markets; and crude oil has triggered it,"" said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, senior VP and head of research (Wealth) at Centrum Broking Limited .

Creating a business to address a social cause is easy but making it profitable is the tricky part. And that’s the balance Binbag Recycling Services Pvt. Ltd has been able to achieve. The Bengaluru-based startup has carved out a niche by catering to small and medium companies’ need to dispose of their e-waste. Since 2014, when it was set up, it has established a 300-tonne e-waste plant in Andhra Pradesh and is in the process of setting up another 100-tonne e-waste plant in Guwahati. The latter will be the first such plant in the North-East, says founder Achitra Borgohain, 40.
In the beginning
But this is Binbag’s pivoted avatar. When it began, it was a one-man operation and the waste was collected in Borgohain’s Fiat Punto. It also catered only to individual customers. During the week, he would be busy with his corporate job and on weekends he would visit individual houses and collect e-waste. “In a week, the car would be full and I would head to a recycler, who would pay me accordingly,"" he recalls. Within four months he got incubated by IIM Bangalore. To scale up, he enlisted local kabadiwallas, where he would pay them depending on the volume of e-waste they collected.
“It worked for a while but kabadiwallas are a networked community and work depends on emotional bonding. So, if someone from the community asked for their time, they would oblige. It was difficult to provide customer service since we had to depend on them,"" he says. Expanding the customer base was also becoming hard since collecting small quantities door-to-door was proving to be an expensive proposition. Borgohain found that he was getting a number of calls from small enterprises and organizations. “They don’t generate e-waste in the volumes of, say, Infosys because of which e-waste companies wouldn’t be interested in catering to them. It was a signal. But it took me six months to realize how we should pivot,"" he says.
After 18 months, Borgohain shifted his business model from individual customers to SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) segments and organisations like the Art of Living and Narayana Hrudayalaya, and new-age tech companies like Myntra and Jabong, who were former clients. Currently, Binbag has over 40 clients from IT, IT enabled services and manufacturing across the country. Many of these are repeat customers, he states.
Borgohain also decided to own not only the supply chain but also the recycling; in other words, providing a complete end-to-end solution. It was also the time when he got on board a co-founder. “It was an ‘aha’ moment for me. Having a co-founder helped. Since we pivoted, in the last two years, we have been doing ‘good’ instead of ‘doing well’,"" he says.
In the first year after the change of customer base, Binbag’s turnover was  ₹1 crore, much more than Borgohain expected. In the second year, the turnover doubled.
Creating a business to address a social cause is easy but making it profitable is the tricky part. And that’s the balance Binbag Recycling Services Pvt. Ltd has been able to achieve. The Bengaluru-based startup has carved out a niche by catering to small and medium companies’ need to dispose of their e-waste. Since 2014, when it was set up, it has established a 300-tonne e-waste plant in Andhra Pradesh and is in the process of setting up another 100-tonne e-waste plant in Guwahati. The latter will be the first such plant in the North-East, says founder Achitra Borgohain, 40.
In the beginning
But this is Binbag’s pivoted avatar. When it began, it was a one-man operation and the waste was collected in Borgohain’s Fiat Punto. It also catered only to individual customers. During the week, he would be busy with his corporate job and on weekends he would visit individual houses and collect e-waste. “In a week, the car would be full and I would head to a recycler, who would pay me accordingly,"" he recalls. Within four months he got incubated by IIM Bangalore. To scale up, he enlisted local kabadiwallas, where he would pay them depending on the volume of e-waste they collected.
“It worked for a while but kabadiwallas are a networked community and work depends on emotional bonding. So, if someone from the community asked for their time, they would oblige. It was difficult to provide customer service since we had to depend on them,"" he says. Expanding the customer base was also becoming hard since collecting small quantities door-to-door was proving to be an expensive proposition. Borgohain found that he was getting a number of calls from small enterprises and organizations. “They don’t generate e-waste in the volumes of, say, Infosys because of which e-waste companies wouldn’t be interested in catering to them. It was a signal. But it took me six months to realize how we should pivot,"" he says.
After 18 months, Borgohain shifted his business model from individual customers to SME (small and medium-sized enterprises) segments and organisations like the Art of Living and Narayana Hrudayalaya, and new-age tech companies like Myntra and Jabong, who were former clients. Currently, Binbag has over 40 clients from IT, IT enabled services and manufacturing across the country. Many of these are repeat customers, he states.
Borgohain also decided to own not only the supply chain but also the recycling; in other words, providing a complete end-to-end solution. It was also the time when he got on board a co-founder. “It was an ‘aha’ moment for me. Having a co-founder helped. Since we pivoted, in the last two years, we have been doing ‘good’ instead of ‘doing well’,"" he says.
In the first year after the change of customer base, Binbag’s turnover was  ₹1 crore, much more than Borgohain expected. In the second year, the turnover doubled.
Another by-product of its core business has been getting into the office liquidation business. If a company is shutting down or shifting, besides collecting the e-waste, Binbag also helps them sell the office furniture.
Staving off competition
While there are a lot of e-waste recyclers in the market, Borgohain believes there is room for more. At present, he barely has competition in catering to the SME sector.
“There are enough recyclers but we need a great e-waste collection mechanism and that’s where we want to stand out,"" he says.
More participants would also mean more innovation in the sector. For instance, if a firm can extract gold and silver from computer parts in a highly efficient manner even at low volumes.
Going forward
Besides recycling, Borgohain says his Andhra Pradesh plant has a refurbishing licence and can refurbish electronic products. “We have kept a space in the plant for it,"" he says. At present, however, his team is busy building a technology to efficiently manage customer service and logistics while collecting the e-waste.
“I believe the impact of what you are doing is much more when you make money and are able to make your business sustainable,"" says Borgohain.
Solutions from Waste profiles startups that have created businesses or products from discarded materials."

Singapore: Brexit is now worse than Y2K — at least in terms of customer concerns, according to India’s second-largest provider of IT services.
“All of us knew Y2K would come to a head, right? In this case, nobody knows whether it’s going to be June, July, or October, or 2020,"" Mohit Joshi, co-president at Infosys Ltd, said Tuesday in a 'Bloomberg Television' interview on the sidelines on the Milken Institute global conference in Beverly Hills, California.
Brexit day came and went on March 29 and the UK is still in the European Union. The drawn-out saga of Britain’s departure from the bloc was thrown into disarray by the UK Parliament’s repeated rejection of the divorce deal negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May. Exasperated EU leaders granted the UK another extension to 31 October to provide more time for Britain to work out its domestic politics.
“It is something which is a huge concern to all our clients,"" Joshi said. “What they’re telling us is that the uncertainty is really affecting them, and the uncertainty is affecting their investment plans.""

Indian equities closed flat on Friday after benchmark indices gave up all their gains in the final hour of trading.

212,2019-05-16,Infosys,"Company board also grants company stocks worth  ₹4 crore to COO U.B. Pravin RaoThe IT major also expanded Stock Ownership Program 2019 for its employees

NEW DELHI :
IT major Infosys Thursday announced that its board of directors has approved granting of annual performance-based stock inventives worth  ₹10 crore in the form of restricted stock units to CEO Salil Parekh.
Moreover, the board also approved granting of company stocks worth  ₹4 crore to COO U.B. Pravin Rao.
The board also approved change in terms of appointment of Pareakh, by changing vesting period of annual performance equity grant from the earlier three years to one year.
The company also expanded Stock Ownership Program 2019, which links long term employee incentives with shareholder value creation.
""By making employees owners, they get an opportunity to be beneficiaries in the long term success of the company and realize the results of their work and dedication,"" Parekh said.
The Infosys Expanded Stock Ownership Program 2019, under which grants will be vested based on performance, aims to align employee interest with shareholder value creation, incentivize, attract and retain key talent, and reward employee performance with ownership, the company said.
Subject to shareholder approval, the ""unique"" plan proposes to allocate 50 million shares (or 5 crore shares) equating 1.15% of the company's equity shares to a broad base of employees, the company said in a release."
211,2019-05-17,Infosys,"'Expanded Stock Ownership Program 2019' proposes to allocate five crore shares to incentivise employees based on performanceCEO Salil Parekh gets stock incentives worth  ₹10 crore as part of the plan

NEW DELHI :
In order to retain talent, India's second largest IT firm Infosys Thursday said its board has approved a series of performance-based incentives for its employees. This apart, the board also approved stock incentives for the company CEO Salil Parekh and COO U.B. Pravin Rao. Here are a few things to know about the decisions taken by its board.
1) 'Expanded Stock Ownership Program 2019' proposes to allocate five crore shares to incentivise employees based on performance. The grants will be vested strictly on performance. Accordingly, it is proposed to allocate a maximum limit of five crore shares (about 1.15% of the equity share capital) of the company under the 2019 Plan.
2) Infosys said it is proposed that CEO and Managing Director Salil Parekh be granted annual performance-based stock incentives in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) worth  ₹10 crore under the 2019 Plan. Similarly, it is also proposed that Infosys COO UB Pravin Rao be granted annual performance-based stock incentives in the form of RSUs worth  ₹4 crore that will vest 12 months from the date of each grant.
3) The grants allocated to employees over a period of seven years will vest based on challenging performance criteria of relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) against an industry peer group; relative TSR against domestic and global indices; and operating lead performance metrics. ""Our employees are our biggest asset, and through this program we aim to recognise and reward individuals who are committed to driving value creation for all stakeholders... By making employees owners, they get an opportunity to be beneficiaries in the long term success of the company,"" Parekh said.
4) These measures come in the wake of the company's attrition being at 20.4% during the March 2019 quarter as compared to 19.5% in the year-ago period.
5) The new plan is different from Infosys' 2015 plan. “Under the 2015 plan, the grants were largely vested based on time, whereas under the 2019 plan, the grants will vest strictly on performance,"" the company said in an exchange filing."
210,2019-05-20,Infosys,"India’s IT service firms have various options as they rework their delivery models around tight US norms

There are many weapons used in a trade war. The two used most often are complaints to the World Trade Organization or unilateral changes in tariffs against a trading partner, as we have seen with the US and China. Non-tariff trade barriers are often more potent and can be used with relative stealth. One such non-tariff barrier, often used on people-centric industries, is a restriction of the free movement of labour. India still gets about 70% of US H-1B visas issued each year. US consulates in India have considerable latitude. They can act on Washington’s orders to tighten up the H-1B regime without any drastic change in US immigration laws. Other similar “work permit"" rules in countries such as Australia, Singapore and the UK also vary over time.
I spoke recently with Viju George of JP Morgan, a veteran information technology (IT) sector analyst, whose insights I respect. George has strong data to back his conclusions. His analysis of the H-1B situation reveals that the rejection rate of H-1B visas has sharply increased for Indian IT since 2015. The rejection rates as of April 2019 of H-1B visas filed for by Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services and Cognizant have risen to 35%, 33% and 39%, respectively, versus 2%, 4% and 4% in 2015. The visa rejection rate for India’s TWITCH providers (TCS, Wipro, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Cognizant and HCL Technologies) between September 2018 and April 2019 has spiked to 36%. This is astoundingly high, nine times higher than 2015’s rejection rate of approximately 4%.
Tier-I Indian IT firms are not alone in facing such H-1B denial rates. The authorities have also applied the whip to global IT services firms operating in India such as IBM, Accenture and Deloitte. It appears that the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) authorities are judging the offshore/on-site IT Services business model as taking undue advantage of H-1B visas, regardless of the firm’s heritage.
What is most alarming is that the acceptance rate of applications for extensions from people who are already working on H-1Bs in the US is also sharply declining. It is harder to substitute on-site H-1B resources already working at a client site with local resources at short notice. This is to say nothing of the human costs that affect workers who are suddenly uprooted from the US and have to relocate to India with their families. The US is no longer seen as a plum posting by senior IT services employees.
Big Tech players such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Intel have far lower denial rates. These are still in single-digit percentages. In absolute terms, they are receiving increasing approvals. Captives such as Walmart and Goldman Sachs also have very low denial rates. Clearly, the USCIS does not view such players as “unfair"" H-1B users. According to George, many of their applicants hold US Masters’ degrees and command much higher pay packets than their IT Services counterparts—more than a 50% premium. Also, while about 70% of Big Tech employees applying for H-1Bs have Masters’ degrees, the picture for IT Services employees is inverted. Only 30% of them have Masters’ degrees. It appears that both lower pay and applicants without higher degrees are frowned upon by the USCIS.
US wages have been stagnant for more than a decade. Inflation has also been low, but real wage appreciation is largely absent. The current administration’s desire to push up middle-class wages, since it is this class that votes in large numbers, may be driving its current approach. However, tech, which has near zero unemployment, is probably the wrong sector to choose. Such knee-jerk methods are ineffectual and will end up hurting the US economy in the long run.
The question is whether these rejection rates are high enough to impact the bottom line or delivery operations of IT services firms. As is evident from several providers’ earnings announcements, George sees an impact on costs already but not yet on operations. Yet, if rejection rates continue to rise, can India’s IT players manage the operational risks that go with interrupted service delivery to customers? George’s analysis suggests that such risks will manifest themselves if rejection rates for H1B visa extensions approaches 45%. At the current rate, he says we will hit this point in less than two years.
How, then, can providers mitigate the operational risks if visa denial rates keep rising? Apart from increasing local hiring at higher costs, IT services firms have to structurally change their delivery methodologies to cope with visa pressures. Methods such as location-independent Agile development, extreme offshoring, and automation with bots are some of these.
Such a structural change will take time to play out. For example, location-independent Agile, a new-age delivery system, can be revolutionary since its development today needs team members playing multiple, parallel roles, which is more easily accomplished when they are co-located. Another method is extreme offshoring, where more than 90% of resources sit offshore. Predictable, longer-term annuity engagements are more amenable to this method. Third, the use of bots, instead of human employees, can reduce the reliance on visas for people.
There is increasing buy-in from clients for new delivery models if their execution is satisfactory. Firms have just started on this journey and the results will take time. That said, I have seen the industry face structural problems before, dust itself off and carry on.

NEW DELHI :
Salil Parekh, the chief executive officer of Infosys, took home a pay package of  ₹24.67 crore in the last financial year, the company's annual report showed.
Parekh, who joined Infosys in January 2018, received  ₹6.07 crore in fixed salary and  ₹10.96 crore in bonus, incentives and variable pay in 2018-19.
He also received  ₹7.64 crore in perquisites on account of exercise of 1,03,604 restricted stock units (RSUs) during fiscal 2019, the annual report said.
Compared to this, Tata Consultancy Services CEO Rajesh Gopinathan drew a package of over  ₹16 crore. In its annual report, the country's IT services firm said Gopinathan's compensation had grown over 28 per cent in FY2018-19.
Gopinathan's remuneration included  ₹1.15 crore in salary,  ₹1.26 crore in perquisites,  ₹13 crore in commission and over  ₹60 lakh in other allowances - all of which added up to a package of  ₹16.02 crore.
Infosys chief operating officer UB Pravin Rao earned  ₹9.05 crore in FY2018-19 against  ₹8.22 crore in the previous financial year.
His remuneration in FY2018-19 included  ₹4.41 crore in fixed salary,  ₹3.83 crore in bonus/incentives/variable pay and  ₹0.81 crore in stock option.
Last week, Infosys had announced that it would allocate five crore shares to its employees under a new stock incentive plan - Plan 2019. Under this, Parekh would be given  ₹10 crore worth of shares, while Rao will receive stocks worth about  ₹4 crore.
Infosys Chairman Nandan Nilekani - in the annual report - wrote that over the past year, the company has been ""working relentlessly to rebuild a 200,000-plus people organisation to operate with the speed and agility of a startup"".
""We are reforming root and branch, replacing legacy systems and mindsets, dissolving thick encrusted silos, energising the believers and converting the sceptics,"" he added.

208,2019-05-20,Infosys,"Parekh can sell his performance-based shares every year, rather than the earlier stricture of selling them after 3 yearsInfosys has sought approval from shareholders after the board put its stamp on cutting the vesting period of performance-based shares awarded to Parekh

NEW DELHI :
India’s second-largest information technology (IT) services company, Infosys, believes things are back to normal under chief executive Salil Parekh, and it has achieved stability after it was thrown in chaos following the resignation of former boss Vishal Sikka in August 2017.
Infosys has rewarded Parekh by awarding him the right to sell his performance-based shares, a maximum of  ₹13 crore in value, every year, rather than the earlier stricture of selling these shares only after three years.
Bengaluru-based Infosys has sought approval from shareholders after the board put its stamp on cutting the vesting period of performance-based shares awarded to Parekh.
“The company has delivered a strong performance over the past fiscal year, creating significant shareholder value. There is now a clear strategic direction to drive competitive growth through a resilient business model. Additionally, the company has (i) delivered strong total shareholder value, (ii) increased total revenue and share of digital revenue and (iii) achieved organizational stability,"" Infosys said in a filing to the exchange over the weekend.
“In recognition of the above, and Salil’s contribution to the same as the CEO and managing director, the board of directors of the company has recommended a revision in the vesting schedule of the annual performance equity grant (as defined in the Original Resolution),"" said a spokeswoman for Infosys.
“Amending paragraph 3 (b) of the Original Resolution by changing the vesting period of the annual performance equity grant from the current three years to one year,"" it added.
“The number of shares that will vest under each annual performance equity grant shall be calculated upon the successful completion of each of his three (3) full fiscal years with the company, the first of which shall conclude on March 31, 2021,"" reads a statement from CEO Parekh’s old employment contract with the company.
“The board believes that things are back to normal at Infosys,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage, on the condition of anonymity. “Typically, once the shares are vested, CEOs don’t have any lock-in period. With the board removing the lock-in period or what can be called as additional handcuffs, Parekh will now have to only focus on growth.""
Infosys clarified that it has not tweaked anything other than removing the lock-in clause of performance-based shares under Parekh’s employment agreement with the company. “This change applies to the grants made in FY19 and prospective grants,"" said an Infosys spokeswoman.
Infosys reported 7.86% dollar revenue growth, or added $860 million in incremental revenue, to end with revenues of $11.8 billion in the year ended March 2019. Infosys grew faster than the 7.16% and 7.4% growth recorded in FY18 and FY17, respectively. However, Infosys’s growth last year was slower than its larger rival, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, and the third largest IT firm, HCL Technologies Ltd, which grew 9.6% and 10.1%, respectively.
However, at least one other analyst was skeptical. “Infosys has not disclosed the metrics based on which these performance-based shares will be awarded. Since the vesting time has been cut to every year from the earlier three years, it appears that the CEO has got a sweet deal,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a foreign brokerage.
“Revenue growth is only one parameter. The company has not done well on profitability.""
Infosys’s operating margin fell 150 basis points from 24.3% at the end of March 2018 to 22.8% at the end of March 2019. During this time, Mumbai-based TCS expanded its profitability by 80 basis points from 24.8% to 25.6%, while HCL Technologies’ profitability declined 20 basis points from 19.7% to 19.5%.
Infosys shares were the second-best performing scrip among large IT firm with the stock returning 31% in the period between 1 April, 2018, and 31 March, 2019. TCS shares returned 40.4%, higher than the broader BSE-IT Index and BSE-Sensex, which were up 26.3% and 17.3%, respectively."

201,2019-06-11,Infosys,"In a first step, Sebi has sought to address the issue of so-called vested complainants in cases of insider tradingTo address the issue of veracity of complaints, Sebi proposes to set up an office independent from investigations department

Mumbai: Investigations by the Securities and Exchange Board of India or Sebi into the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Infosys Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd all have one thing in common -- they are all based on so-called whistleblower complaints.
Sebi found some merit in these complaints; with it passing orders in the case of alleged lapses at NSE's colocation platform, allowing settlement in the probe into corporate governance lapses at Infosys, sending letters to Sun on a case of alleged insider trading when it purchased Ranbaxy, and issuing notice to ICICI Bank on inadequate disclosures.
However, during the probes questions were raised on the veracity of the complaints and complainants. For instance, one of the so-called whistleblower complaints in case of lapses at NSE came from the office of 63 Moons Technologies Ltd (formerly known as Financial Technologies Ltd), similarly Sun asked Sebi to intervene and look into the genuineness of the complaint.
In a first step, Sebi has sought to address the issue of so-called vested complainants in cases of insider trading.
Sebi on Monday issued a discussion paper which proposes a reward, amnesty and protection policy for 'informants' who blow the whistle on cases of insider trading. Sebi will create a separate disclosure window for such whistleblowers to submit information of alleged wrongdoing and they will be rewarded to the tune of  ₹1 crore for cases where disgorgement has been at least  ₹5 crore. Sebi hopes that this policy move will improve its conviction rate in cases of insider trading.
To address the issue of veracity of complaints, Sebi proposes to set up an office independent from the investigations department which will look into complaints filed in cases of alleged insider trading.
In case the office determines that the complaint is frivolous or vexatious, Sebi can initiate appropriate action against the informant under the securities laws and any other applicable law, Sebi said in the discussion paper.
While this addresses the issue of 'vested and frivolous complaints' it may also discourage complainants as the ramifications of a wrong complaint have been kept wide ranging, said a lawyer practicing securities law.
Considering that the past two years have seen big cases come to light through complaints filed by anonymous complaints, Sebi should propose such a mechanism for fraudulent trade practices too and not limit it to insider trading, he added."

TCS pipped other IT majors like IBM India, Infosys, Larsen & Toubro Infotech to get the key project of the central bank.
The project has to be completed within a year of the commencement of the contract with the RBI.
The RBI had invited of expression of interest (EOI) in July 2018 for identification of solution provider for implementation of CIMS by overhauling the data warehouse (DW) of the apex bank.
The CIMS will comprise of DW and Data Lake (DL) which would include, seamless data collection from regulated entities by creating system-to-system interface; system driven data validation and data review; flexible and scalable data repository and providing data dissemination platform.
The CIMS would also include centralised analytics platform to facilitate creation of RBI Data Sciences Lab.
The RBI, in April last year, had announced to gainfully harness the power of big data analytics by setting up a data sciences lab that will comprise experts and budding analysts, internal as well as lateral, who are trained inter alia in computer science, data analytics, statistics, economics, econometrics and/or finance.
One of the functional requirements for CIMS, as per the EOI, was establishing system-to-system interface for automated element based data collection from about 130 banks/entities.

Bengaluru: Former Infosys CFO and multi-sector investor T V Mohandas Pai has said India does not face a job problem, but one of wages, as a lot of low paid jobs being created do not find favour with degree holders.
""India is not producing good jobs, but creating a lot of  ₹10,000- ₹15,000 low-paid jobs which are not fancied by degree holders. India has a wage problem, not a job problem,"" he told PTI.
Also, India has regional and geographical problems, Pai said.
Pai suggested that India adopt the Chinese model of opening up labour-intensive industries and building infrastructure near coasts, besides investing heavily in hitech R&D to meet the aspirations of job-seekers.
""We should look at what China has done. They first opened up the labour intensive industry - invited the rest of the world to come and use its labour and started an export industry.
We have not incentivised labour intensive industries. We don't have proper policies, so we cannot use our surplus labour,"" he said.
Pai pointed out that China has also invested heavily in hitech Research and Development in many areas, including electronic assembly and chip creation, by incentivising at lower level to create an eco-system.
""Thirdly, China built infrastructure near the coasts so that infrastructure and supply chain comes down. We have not built infrastructure around the coasts,"" he said.
Pai said the data on unemployment put out by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) that 11 million jobs were lost in 2018 was erroneous.
""There are flaws in the survey methodology for unemployment for the age group of 15 to 29 years,"" he said.
Pai said the best data on jobs was the EPFO payroll data, which says 60 to 70 lakh people get formal jobs every year.
Even vehicle sales throw light on the job situation in India, Pai said, adding that every year 30 to 35 lakh people get jobs after discounting vehicle purchases.
""For example, India buys about seven lakh tractors, six lakh autorikshaws, seven-and-a--half lakh trucks every year.
As many as 28 lakh cars are bought, of which five lakh may require drivers. The drivers create 30 to 35 lakh jobs every year,"" he said."

Bengaluru: The United States' plans to cap H1-B work visas, used by Indian IT firms to send employees there, would imply a ""further crunch"" for businesses to access skilled workforce, industry lobby group Nasscom said on Thursday.
The United States told India it is considering caps on H-1B visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally days ahead of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's visit to New Delhi, Reuters reported on Wednesday citing three sources with knowledge of the matter.
The warning comes as trade tensions between the United States and India have resulted in tit-for-tat tariff actions in recent weeks. From Sunday, India imposed higher tariffs on some U.S. goods, days after Washington withdrew a key trade privilege for New Delhi.
The $150 billion Indian IT sector uses the work visas to fly engineers and developers to service clients, including software giants such as Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc in the U.S., their biggest market.
If Washington made it more difficult to hire advanced tech workers, it would only weaken the U.S. companies that depend on them to help fill their skill gaps and put jobs at risk, Nasscom said in an emailed statement.
However, the lobby group, which counts Wipro Ltd Chairman Rishad Premji and Infosys Ltd Chief Operating Officer U.B. Pravin Rao among its governing members, said it awaited clarity from official sources on the matter.
""The American companies themselves need Indian talent, so if there is a cap on these visas, this will impact U.S. companies also and hurt their business interests,"" said Sudheer Guntupalli, an analyst with Ambit Capital in Mumbai.
""Clearly this seems to be a retaliatory measure from the U.S. government.""
Shares of sector heavyweights Infosys fell as much as 2.13% on Thursday, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) lost 2.12% and Wipro fell over 3% in early trade, following the report, before recouping losses later in the day.
Infosys and Wipro did not comment on the matter, while TCS did not immediately respond to requests for their views on the report."

CHENNAI :
Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu that’s reeling under a severe water shortage, will get the resource transported from other parts of the state even as a provincial minister performed a ceremony appealing to the Hindu god Shiva for rain.
The city, gateway to the Indian factories of Hyundai Motor Co. and Ford Motor Co., will get 10 million liters transported from other parts of the state daily, the government said in a statement. Meanwhile D. Jayakumar, the province’s fisheries minister and a leader of its ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) party, participated in a Hindu ritual called yagna -- where symbolic offerings are made to fire -- invoking Shiva to deliver rain, said N. Balaganga, a party district secretary.
A water crisis is brewing in many parts of the world’s second-most populated nation as unsustainable use and few measures to harness rain lead to shortages. Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, two biggest contributors to India’s $2.7 trillion economy, are among the worst affected. Monsoon rainfall, which accounts for 70% of the nation’s annual rainfall, has been 38% below normal as of Sunday. Poor rain may make it tougher for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to revive growth that has slumped to a five-year-low.
“The city has neglected all its water bodies and efforts to improve and recharge in the past decade,"" said Sunita Narain, director general of the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment. “Water crisis will be here to stay if we don’t understand the need to save every drop of water and rain.""
Chennai received the lowest rainfall in 15 years in 2018. The poor rainfall didn’t stop indiscriminate use of water from the city’s four reservoirs, which has contributed to a crunch this year, said Jyoti Sharma, who heads a non-profit working to conserve water. The city’s reservoirs have less than 1% of capacity as on Monday, that compares with 20% a year earlier, according to data on the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board.
A fight over water led to a man attacking a woman in Chennai, while another man was killed for objecting to attempts by his neighbor to store a large quantity, the Indian Express reported last week. More than 20,000 employees working in technology firms have been asked to either work from home or move to offices in neighboring states, the Hindustan Times newspaper reported, citing T. Bharanidharan, president of the IT Employees Association.
Meanwhile residents in Chennai are looking for ways to conserve water. Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. has installed special nozzles in washbasin taps that lowers water consumption by 80%, the company said in a statement. Hyundai Motor is asking its customers to “dry wash"" cars, while restaurants are serving food in plantain leaves to avoid having to wash utensils.
The government has provided Renault-Nissan BV’s plant with pumping systems from nearby open wells to be used in an emergency, the company said in a statement. Infosys Ltd. said it has cut all non-essential services.
India isn’t the only country facing a water crisis. Africa’s booming cities are running out of the essential resource and 2 billion people now live in countries experiencing high water stress, the United Nations said in its World Water Development Report in March. Recognizing the urgent need -- and the opportunity -- Modi has made an ambitious pledge to bring piped water to every rural household in India by 2024, when he would face re-election once again.

Indian markets fell sharply today, extending losses to the second day. At day’s low, the Sensex fell over 900 points and breached the 39,000 mark, extending its two-day loss to over 1,300 points. The Nifty slumped below 11,600. On Friday, both the Sensex and Nifty fell nearly 1% after some Budget proposals spooked market sentiments. Global cues were also weak today after strong US jobs data tempered expectations for a Fed rate cut. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost more than 1%, with every market in the red.
Among the Sensex stocks, Bajaj Finance was the biggest loser, falling nearly 9%. NTPC, L&T, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki and ONGC fell between 4% and 6%.
Here are 5 things to know about market fall today:
1) In Budget 2019, “tax on buyback of shares from companies and move to raise public float to 35% are fresh surprises and that would lead to some more adjustment of prices on the down side,"" says Ashish Nanda, EVP at Kotak Securities.
2) Rajiv Singh, CEO of stock broking at Karvy Broking, said many companies would need to increase their public shareholding, mostly by selling of promoters' stakes or additional equity issuance. ""The detail to watch out for is the time allowed to meet this new rule,"" Singh added.
3) Though many analysts have welcomed the Budget proposals, they say there’s no big fiscal stimulus plan, quite contrary to what many investors had expected.
4) A higher income tax levy on high net individuals has also hurt sentiments further, say some analysts. Amar Ambani, president and research head at Yes Securities, said: “Union Budget FY20 was well detailed and in the right direction in terms of focus of this government. However, higher tax on high net-worth individuals reduces their investible surplus in stocks directly, through MFs and PMSes, especially in the midcap space."" The BSE midcap index fell 2% today.
5) Analysts say that after the initial overhang of the Union Budget, focus would shift to the earnings season. IT heavyweights TCS and Infosys will announce their results on July 9 and July 12, respectively. On the macroeconomic front, IIP and CPI inflation will be unveiled on July 12.

The decision by India’s government to impose a tax on stock buybacks puts the brakes on what could have been another great year for share repurchases.
More than 70 companies, including software exporter Wipro Ltd., announced or completed  ₹354.6 billion ($5.2 billion) of share buybacks in the first half of 2019, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s about two thirds of the  ₹546 billion of such transactions for all of 2018, which was the most in at least six years, the data show.
“In the last three years, buybacks had supported the rally in stocks and helped improve the earnings per share for companies,"" said Umesh Mehta, head of research at Samco Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “That opportunity is now closed. Companies would now have to move back to distributing dividends, where the tax liability is lower.""
Taxing Times
The proposed tax may affect share purchases worth  ₹100 billion that are in progress. Infosys Ltd., India’s second-largest provider of IT services, has until Sept. 19 to complete buying back 82.6 billion rupees of its own stock, while Adani SEZ & Ports Ltd. is looking to repurchase shares worth 19.6 billion rupees, according to exchange filings.
Shares of Infosys extended two weeks of losses on Monday, while those of Adani SEZ closed at the lowest price since May 22.
Companies have been using buybacks as a more tax-efficient way to return excess cash to shareholders in addition to dividends, which attract a levy of 15%. India’s top five software exporters have returned a combined 867 billion rupees over the past three years via this route, according to Jefferies.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman closed the window Friday by announcing a 20% tax on stock repurchases. The trigger for the levy to kick in depends on when the company actually pays the money for the shares tendered, said Mehul Bheda, a partner and tax consultant at Dhruva Advisors in Mumbai.
“The tax saving on the buyback has been substantially reduced,"" he said.

Mumbai: Indian stock markets are likely to tick lower on Friday dragged by weakness in global peers.
Asian shares pulled back on Friday as concern over renewed trade tensions between Washington and Beijing weighed on sentiment ahead of the release of June trade data from China. Expectation of an interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, later this month, arrested losses.
Bets on a rate cut remained strong despite a rise in US consumer inflation in June, and helped push the S&P 500 index to a record high closing on Thursday.
The S&P 500 gained 0.23% to end at a record closing high of 2,999.91 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average also hit a record high close of 27,088.08 points on Thursday, having risen 0.85% during the day.
On Friday, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.05% in early deals, with Australian shares sliding 0.16% and Japan's Nikkei stock index trimming 0.11%.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated on Thursday that a rate cut was likely at the Fed’s next meeting as businesses curb investment due to trade disputes and a slowdown in global economic growth.
President Donald Trump on Thursday said China was not living up to promises it made on buying agricultural products from farmers in the US.
Later on Friday, China will release trade data for June, with analysts expecting exports to have fallen as weakening global demand and a sharp hike in US tariffs took a toll on the world’s largest trading nation.
Back home, the markets regulator is probing whether the management of InterGlobe Aviation Ltd misled shareholders by downplaying the true extent of differences between the co-founders of India’s largest airline, according to a Mint report.
Shares of Infosys will be in focus as the IT major is expected to announce its June quarter earnings later today. Edelweiss Securities Ltd estimates its revenue to grow 2.8% quarter-on-quarter in constant currency terms, while dollar growth is seen down marginally due to cross currency headwinds. EBITDA margin is likely to fall 60 basis points (bps), hit by rupee appreciation (30bps), while wage hikes could further pressurise the same. Operational efficiencies are expected to partially nullify this impact. Commentary on digital growth rates, BFSI and initiatives to manage attrition will be key things to watch for.

NEW DELHI :
An estimate-beating June quarter profit and large deal wins helped Infosys Ltd raise its revenue guidance for the full year, while maintaining its margin forecast on Friday. The information technology company also revised its cash allocation policy, deciding to distribute 85% of its free cash flow over five years cumulatively, against 70% earlier.
The Bengaluru-headquartered software exporter raised its full-year constant currency revenue growth guidance from 7.5-9.5% in April to 8.5-10%. It also retained its full-year margin guidance of 21-23%.
Infosys’s April-June net profit rose 5.3% year-on-year to  ₹3,802 crore, supported by large deals worth $2.7 billion.
A Bloomberg estimate of the company’s net profit, based on forecasts given by 22 analysts, had pegged it at  ₹3,736 crore.
Revenue for India’s second largest IT services exporter came at  ₹21,803 crore, a rise of 14% from the year-ago quarter. It was, however, a trifle short of the Bloomberg estimate of  ₹21,814 crore, an average of forecasts given by 24 analysts. In constant currency terms, revenue was up 12.4%.
“We are fortunate to see the (earnings) growth coming back strongly. We are complete with all our investments. Our focus is on operational efficiency,"" Infosys’s chief executive officer and managing director Salil Parekh said at a press conference.
Pushing off wage hikes for a section of junior level employees to July couldn’t hold back the erosion in the company’s margins, which deteriorated by 3.2 percentage points to 20.5%.
The company usually staggers its salary hikes, reserving April for junior-level staff, July for mid-level employees and October for the senior management.
Attrition, a constant battle for most IT companies—particularly Infosys—remained high, rising by 40 basis points (bps) from the year-ago period to 23.4% at a consolidated level.
On a sequential basis, exits were even worse, rising as much as 300bps. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The company added 906 employees in the quarter. Pravin Rao, Infosys’s chief operating officer, said the company will continue to persevere to arrest attrition, but added that it was difficult to say when it would eventually come down.
The IT major plans to hire 18,000 freshers from university campuses this financial year.
“Overall, earnings performance was healthy and the increase in revenues guidance to 8.5-10% has positively surprised us. Also, the company’s new stated objective of capital allocation to investors at 85% of free cash flows is quite comforting,"" said Sanjeev Hota, vice-president, research, BNP Paribas-owned Sharekhan.
Sharekhan has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of  ₹840, a premium of 15.5% from Thursday’s close of  ₹727.10 on the BSE. The results were announced after market hours.
The company’s management maintained that its decision to return more money to shareholders was aimed at more value creation, and it would in no way hurt its merger and acquisition (M&A) plans.
Infosys’s chief financial officer Nilanjan Roy said the cash balance of $3.5 billion was more than sufficient to meet any contingency, as well as M&As.
Infosys said it would continue with its share buyback programme, notwithstanding the government’s decision to tax such returns to shareholders at 20%.
Companies often took the share buyback approach to avoid the 20% tax payable on dividend distribution.
The Union budget has plugged the anomaly.
The company is on track to complete its previously announced share buyback of  ₹8,260 crore. It has, till date, bought back shares worth  ₹5,934 crore."
182,2019-07-13,Infosys,"Infosys, which has over 2.29 lakh employees, is also battling high attritionThe company said there was no impact of attrition on its deliverables and that historically, the first quarter of the fiscal has a higher level of attrition

Bengaluru: India's second largest IT services firm Infosys Friday said it will recruit 18,000 people from campuses this fiscal.
Infosys, which has over 2.29 lakh employees, is also battling high attrition, although the company asserted that this has not impacted its deliverable.
""Overall for this quarter, we have recruited close to 8,000 people, of which freshers are about 2,500... For the year, we are looking at about 18,000 people or so from the universities,"" Infosys Chief Operating Officer U.B. Pravin Rao said.
Infosys added 906 people (net) during the June 2019 quarter. The attrition (annualised consolidated) was at 23.4 per cent up, compared to 20.4 per cent for the quarter ended March 2019.
The company said there was no impact of attrition on its deliverables and that historically, the first quarter of the fiscal has a higher level of attrition.
Infosys has initiated a number of measures for employee engagement, investment in career opportunities and enrichment of experience for employees, he said."
184,2019-07-14,Infosys,"Investors hailed Infosys’ strong results and its move to increase payouts to shareholdersThe company upped its annual revenue guidance, thanks to an increase in large deal wins

After Tata Consultancy Services Ltd reported a disappointing set of numbers for the June quarter, all eyes were on Infosys Ltd's results to see if the entire industry is witnessing a drop in growth rates. But Infosys has bucked the trend, with a strong performance for the June quarter. Revenues increased 2.8% sequentially in constant currency terms. On a year-on-year basis, they are up 12.4%, better than the 11.7% growth in the March quarter. What’s more, Infosys has announced it will increase its cash return ratio to as high as 85% of free cash flow, from 70% earlier.
It’s little wonder Infosys shares were up about 8% in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. To be sure, growth was propped up partly by the Stater N.V. acquisition, which added about 60 basis points to sequential growth. Excluding this, the constant currency growth stands at 2.2%, which more or less similar to the 2-2.1% growth TCS is estimated to have clocked in June quarter. TCS didn’t report a sequential growth number in constant currency.
But unlike TCS, whose management gave a somewhat guarded commentary, Infosys put up a more optimistic face. TCS had pinning the sustainability of double digit revenue growth on business momentum in the September quarter. Infosys has gone ahead and increased its annual revenue growth guidance, on the back of an increase in large deal wins since April, the management said on a call with analysts. Infosys raised the revenue growth guidance for the current fiscal by a percentage point from 7.5-9.5% to 8.5-10%.
A moot question is if all this tilts the scales in favour of the Infosys stock, also given its valuation discount vis-à-vis TCS. That would be a premature call, says an analyst, citing that Infosys’s earnings per share growth continues to be weak at just 6% on the back of falling margins. On a year-on-year basis, Infosys margins fell by 320 basis points to 20.5%. TCS had reported a 13% increase in earnings per share in the June quarter, and its margins had declined only 80 basis points year-on-year in Q1.
Infosys has said it has completed the one-off investments it had outlined last year. From now, the focus is on cost discipline and deriving operating efficiencies, it added on the call. The recent appreciation in the Indian rupee notwithstanding, the company has maintained its operating margin guidance range of 21-23%. Of course, it remains to be seen whether the company delivers on this. Analysts are particularly worried about the high attrition rates at the company, and its impact on margins.
For now, Infosys has done well to improve deal flow. Last quarter the company saw record deal bookings of $2.7 billion. In the preceding two quarters, large deal bookings averaged at around $1.5 billion. Infosys highlighted that the upgrade in revenue growth guidance is driven more by improving traction in large deal pipeline, rather than the contribution from acquisitions.
For the stock to narrow its valuation discount with TCS further, it would need to deliver not only on deal flow and revenue, but on margins as well."
178,2019-07-15,Infosys,"Infosys upped its revenue growth guidance for FY20 estimates to 8.5-10%Infosys reported strong large deal wins of $2.7 billion

Shares of Infosys Ltd on Monday rose as much as 5.5%, gaining the most in the last one year, as the company, post market hours on Friday, reported strong June quarter earnings and increased its revenue growth guidance for fiscal year 2020.
The management said it was also confident of delivering within its guided EBIT margin range of 21-23%, despite recent rupee appreciation, and was expecting to return more cash to its shareholders.
The stock surged as much as 5.49% to hit a high of  ₹767 a share. At 9.50 am, it was trading at  ₹758.60 on the BSE, up 4.33% from previous close.
""We believe increased FY20F revenue growth guidance, strong deal win momentum and improved capital allocation policy are positive,"" said Nomura Research in a 12 July note.
Infosys result came as a relief for investors especially after the lower-than-expected earnings reported by Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.
Infosys raised its revenue growth guidance for FY20 estimates to 8.5-10% against 7.5-9.5% forecast earlier. The management indicated that strong deal wins and order pipeline were the key reasons for raising revenue growth guidance for the year.
""We believe that while the company’s results print does have a few wrinkles (street’s FY20E EBIT margins at 22.2% continue to be at risk), the revision in annual outlook and strong order intake should help cut the recent under-performance versus TCS. We thereby raise our weights for Infosys in our EAP portfolio. A worsening of global macros and INR appreciation remain key risks,"" said Emkay Global in a 12 July note.
On a year-on-year basis, Infosys' revenue grew 12.4%, which is ahead of TCS even adjusting for inorganic contributions from Stater (70 basis points) and Fluido (10 bps). Infosys reported extremely strong large deal wins of $2.7 billion, including some contribution from Stater, its highest ever, against $1.5 billion over the past two quarters and $1.1 billion in first quarter of FY19.
""Broad-based growth, robust deal intake, growing deal pipeline and continued strong traction in digital inspire confidence that growth challenges are largely behind for the company. The management exudes confidence that margin trajectory will improve in the coming quarters as the specific investment phase to expand digital capabilities and address gaps in the sales engine is largely behind. We believe growth convergence and return of margin stability at Infosys will narrow the valuation discount to TCS over the medium term,"" said SBI Cap Securities in a 12 July note.
Rise in shares may be limited as Infosys’ attrition rate increased by 40bps year-on-year to 23.4% on a consolidated basis in first quarter of FY20 and is turning alarming. The attrition rate has not settled down despite management efforts such as increasing the employee engagement programme, higher-than-peer increments and performance-based rewards.
Analysts believe that the company is not factoring in the risk of this uncontrolled attrition in its guidance and thus remains a risk to the financial performance."

Mumbai: Indian stock markets are likely to be subdued today dragged by weak global cues. Asian shares started the week on a softer note on Monday after posting their first weekly decline since early June, while the dollar was on the defensive ahead of key economic data from China.
Trading was expected to be light as Japan was shut for a public holiday.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was a shade lower at 524.9 points. It fell a little more than 1% last week, snapping five straight weeks of gains. Australian shares slipped 0.8% while South Korea’s KOSPI inched 0.3% lower.
Markets will be focused on Chinese gross domestic product (GDP) data which showed that country's economy grew at its slowest rate in nearly three decades in the second quarter, hit by the US-China trade war and weakening global demand.
The world's second largest economy expanded 6.2% in April-June. The reading would mark the worst quarterly growth in almost three decades but stay within the government's target range of 6.0-6.5% for the whole year. The economy grew 6.6% in 2018.
China will also publish activity data for June including retail sales, industrial production and urban investment, which could give more clues on whether earlier support measures are starting to kick in, or if more policy easing is needed.
Back home, shares of Infosys, DHFL, IndiGo will be in focus.
Software exporter major Infosys, posted its June quarter earnings post market hours on Friday. Infosys raised its full-year constant currency revenue growth guidance from 7.5-9.5% in April to 8.5-10%. It also retained its full-year margin guidance of 21-23%. Its net profit rose 5.3% year-on-year to  ₹3,802 crore in April-June, supported by large deals worth $2.7 billion.
Shares of Dewan Housing Finance Corp Ltd (DHFL) are also likely to be in focus as it warned that its financial situation was so grim that it may not survive. The company said it was “undergoing substantial financial stress"" and its ability to raise funds was “substantially impaired and the business has been brought to a standstill with there being minimal/virtually no disbursements.""
Meanwhile, InterGlobe Aviation Ltd’s co-founder, Rahul Bhatia, has claimed that he bore most of the financial risk to grow the once fledgling airline, while his estranged partner, Rakesh Gangwal, restricted his investment to less than  ₹15 crore, justifying the wider powers vested on him to run IndiGo, India’s largest airline.
In currency markets, the greenback was flat at 97.818 against a basket of major currencies. The dollar index fell for three days in a row as markets fully priced in the chance of a 25-basis-point (bps) cut to US interest rates. There is also a small probability of a 50 bps cut.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar languished near the lowest since early June at 107.81 while the single currency was mostly unchanged at $1.1271 after three successive sessions of gains. Expectations that the Fed will keep rates supportive have sent bonds rallying with ten-year US Treasuries below the current Fed rate range of 2.25%-2.50%.
In commodities, US crude fell 6 cents to $60.15 a barrel. Brent crude was off 7 cents at $66.65.
Gold was higher at 1,416.14 an ounce, not far from a recent six-year top of $1,438.60.

What experts sayover 4% after the IT company started FY20 on a strong note with constant currency revenue growth of 12.4% YoY. The Bengaluru-based IT company also raised its revenue forecast for the year on upbeat demand for digital services. Infosys, lifted the revenue forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2020 to between 8.5% and 10% on constant currency basis as its first quarter net profit beat analysts' estimates. This compares with its previous guidance of between 7.5% to 9.5%.
Infosys also reported record deal wins of $2.7 billion in the quarter. Infosys posted a net profit of  ₹3,802 crore, ahead of analyst expectations of  ₹3,612 crore. Infosys maintained its operating margin guidance for 2019-2020 in the range of 21% to 23%.
Some analysts however pointed out to the higher level of attrition in the company. With a churn rate of 23.4%, Infosys said it would hire 18,000 staff from university campuses this year.
Infosys has revised its capital allocation policy upwards to distribute about 85% of free cash flows cumulatively over a 5-year period, from 70% earlier, a move which is positive for the stock, say analysts.

NEW DELHI :
Indian IT majors like TCS, HCL and Infosys have raised concerns regarding market access issues and non-tariff barriers in China with Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal, as they are creating hurdles for them to set up business in that country.
During the discussions, the representatives of the companies informed the minister that India's investments and business have not been able to grow in China due to various non-tariff barriers and challenges faced by Indian companies to set up their entity in China, said an official statement.
One of the major focus area of the discussion was market access issues as it creates hurdles for Indian companies to open their business in China.
Chinese IT services market is the third largest in the world.
The meeting held here on Wednesday was attended by senior managers of TCS, Satyam Venture Engineering, HCL, NIIT Tech, Infosys, Invento Robotics, Tech Mahindra and Wipro.
Goyal asked the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) and the senior managers of the companies to share specific data regarding non-tariff barriers being faced by them in China and other East Asian markets.
""Government of India will give all support for the global growth of India's flagship industry and will make all efforts to facilitate the IT service industry and for that it is ready to engage with China and also Japan and Korea"", Goyal said during the meeting.
Sangeeta Godbole, DG of Services Export Promotion Council (SEPC) and President of NASSCOM, Debjani Ghosh, were also present during the discussions with Goyal.
The focus of the meeting was also on exploring opportunities for IT companies to invest and grow their business in new markets like the Nordic countries, Eastern and Central Europe, Canada, Australia and Africa.
India's IT industry contributed 7.7 per cent to the country's GDP in financial year 2016-17 and is expected to contribute 10 per cent of India's GDP by 2025.
According to IT industry body NASSCOM, the aggregated revenues of the sector stood at USD 160 billion in 2017. The United States account for two-third of India's IT services exports.
India's IT and ITeS industry grew to USD 181 billion in 2018-19. Exports from the industry increased to USD 137 billion in fiscal year 2018-19 while domestic revenues (including hardware) advanced to USD 44 billion.
The minister also asked the IT services companies to explore other markets and not be inhibited in operating in countries that are non-English speaking.
He urged the top five Indian IT firms to create a corpus that will be spent on training manpower in languages like Mandarin, Japanese and Korean for accessing the markets in these countries.
India is the largest exporter of IT services in the world and exports dominate the Indian IT industry and constitutes about 79 per cent of the total revenue of the industry."

172,2019-08-12,Infosys,"Profitability softened at large companies as well, with HCL Tech suffering a significant hitExcept Infosys Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, revenue growth at most front-line IT firms lagged Street estimates

Global headwinds and the resultant weakness in financial services, a large business vertical, weighed on the growth rates of IT firms in June quarter. However, order wins and deal pipelines remain strong to keep growth hopes alive.
Except Infosys Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, revenue growth at most front-line IT firms lagged Street estimates. Growth at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), the largest company, moderated from the March quarter. Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd reported lacklustre performance.
The slowdown is more pronounced at second-rung firms. High client concentration and slowdown in revenues adversely impacted the profitability of these firms compared to their larger peers. “Mid-tier companies witnessed slowdown in revenue growth on year-on-year comparison to low teens from high teens earlier. Slowdown in growth from large clients and a few client-specific challenges contributed to weak results,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note. “Mid-tier companies have a strong leverage to growth; slowdown in the same has resulted in margin contraction across all companies.""
Profitability softened at large companies as well, with HCL Tech suffering a significant hit. Talent crunch, high subcontracting, deal transition and visa costs impacted profitability. Without the support of currency, profitability can remain under pressure for FY20, said the Kotak analysts.
Even so, as one analyst at a domestic broking firm pointed out some time back, relative to other sectors IT companies’ earnings have been less volatile.
Further order bookings and pipeline across the firms remain strong, providing good visibility. “Total contract value (TCV) of deal wins has been strong across all companies, reflecting a demand environment that is still reasonably good,"" analysts at Kotak said. “We appreciate that TCV may not be a reliable indicator for growth due to lack of clarity on renewals of existing business. On the other hand, it is a good indicator for momentum in wins, something that has been comforting up to now.""
Tracking the strong deal momentum, Infosys raised its lower end of the revenue growth guidance for FY20 by one percentage point. HCL Tech is confident of meeting its revenue growth guidance for the full year. TCS, despite pinning growth momentum hopes on the second quarter, is confident about prospects and is stepping-up hiring. Similarly, Tech Mahindra reported strong deal wins for the June quarter.
In comparison, Wipro announced tepid sequential revenue growth guidance of 0-2%. Similarly, company-specific troubles mean growth at Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. is expected to remain subdued in the near term. The variation in performance and growth profiles explain the valuation gap between Wipro, Tech Mahindra and others. But valuations of other front-line companies at one-year forward earnings estimates are not cheap either."

168,2019-08-29,Infosys,"The proportion of Ebitda that converted into operating cash flow in FY19 was 98%, most among large IT firmsThe variation in growth rates may be part of the reason

The story at Wipro Ltd in recent years has been a series of false starts. Even as revenue growth for its larger peers, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, accelerated, Wipro lagged. But one metric where the company is scoring is cash conversion.
The proportion of Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) that converted into operating cash flow stood at 98% in fiscal year 2019, the highest among large IT companies. Wipro maintains this lead with cash flows to Ebitda staying at 95% in the 12 months ended June 2019, showed an analysis by Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd.
Wipro’s growth in operating cash flow and free cash flow exceeded Ebitda growth in 12 months to June. Free cash flow adjusts for capital expenditure as well, apart from cash operating expenses.
Importantly, this is not a recent phenomenon. Cash flow growth is far superior at the company even using three-year annual average growth rates. “Over the last three years, cash conversion has been stable for Infosys/TCS, deteriorated at HCL Technologies Ltd and improved for Wipro,"" analysts at Nomura India said in a note.
What explains the variation in performance is better receivables management. Comparatively, the receivables position increased at other large IT companies, with Infosys seeing material deterioration in recent quarters.
The variation in growth rates may be part of the reason. Constant currency revenue growth year-on-year remains in mid-single digits at Wipro, while its larger peers are growing in double digits. “Typically, a growth-focused company may give some leeway to customers on payment terms,"" said an analyst on condition of anonymity. Even so, as the analyst added, Wipro is doing a decent job in getting money quickly from customers.
Of course, all of this is but a silver lining on the dark cloud of poor growth. Most analysts remain sceptical about Wipro’s growth outlook. The September quarter revenue growth guidance indicates no major improvement. The pressure on legacy business is more pronounced at Wipro than at other large companies, showed an analysis by HDFC Securities Institutional Research.
This is reflected in the valuation discount vis-à-vis other large peers. “TCS and Infosys trade at premium valuations due to revenue predictability and stable performance,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in the June quarter results review note, referring to the valuation gap in IT stocks. For Wipro’s returns to pick up, revenue growth will have to inch up as well."

New Delhi: Technical skills that are in the greatest demand today are analytics, user experience, automation, IT architecture and Artificial Intelligence, revealed new research from Infosys on Thursday. Infosys looked at two perspectives on the barriers that prevent sufficient demand-supply match of talent -- tangible and intangible barriers to talent transformation.
Among the tangible barriers, lack of budget is the biggest barrier to repurposing efforts, followed by organisational issues, lack of management awareness or support, and inadequate talent management plans.
Among the intangible barriers, learnability received short shrift in the research, and it limits the tremendous potential of reskilling as a competitive advantage for companies that embrace learnability. Undervaluing learnability limits the potential of other talent initiatives.
""There is not just a talent war -- it's a famine. To succeed, companies must hire, develop, and retain talent better than their competition,"" said Pravin Rao, Chief Operating Officer, Infosys.
""As enterprises progress in their digital journeys, the winners will be those who utilise multiple hiring sources and reskill workers in a culture of lifelong learning -- invest in their people, who are the ultimate differentiator in a commoditized world,"" Rao said.
Soft skills that emphasise collaboration are just as important as technical prowess, according to the report titled ""Infosys Talent Radar 2019"".
For example, the soft skill empathy is essential for design thinking, while learnability is key to the continuous personal and technical development essential for today's digital talent.
For the study, the Infosys Knowledge Institute conducted an online survey that included more than 1,000 CXOs and other senior-level respondents from companies with revenue greater than $1 billion.
Respondents represented multiple industries and were from India, Australia, China, France, Germany, the UK and the US.

Hyderabad: Built with over 2.5 times more steel than the Eiffel Tower, a built-up area spanning about 65 football fields, a helipad and 49 elevators which move one floor per second, e-commerce giant Amazon's largest campus building in the world is the latest landmark in Hyderabad.
Built in the Financial District, a key IT cluster, this campus with 1.8 million square feet office space is Amazon's first owned office building outside the US and its single largest building globally.
Spread over 9.5 acres, this 282-feet tall building can house more than 15,000 employees.
The massive campus, built amid the gleaming towers of various corporate giants, is equipped with 49 elevators, which can move a floor per second. Built on three million square feet of construction area, it is also Amazon's single largest building in the world in terms of area.
Amazon officials say the total built-up area, when spread out, will span over 68 acres or approximately 65 football fields. Out of total built-up space, 1.2 million square feet is earmarked for recreation and parking.
""The campus contains over 2.5 times more steel than the Eiffel Tower, measured by weight,"" revealed Amazon Vice President and Global Real Estate and Facilities Director John Schoettler at the inauguration of the facility recently.
Interfaith prayer rooms, a mother's room, quiet rooms, showers, helipad and an all-day open cafeteria are some of the key features of the campus, built in a short span of three years. The company officials say the structure is designed to facilitate inclusion and diversity.
It also features casual, collaborative workspaces, as well as private areas for concentration and confidentiality.
""Every detail is aimed at improving well-being and efficiency, from Destination Control Systems to manage elevators that can move 972 people simultaneously, to 290 conference rooms and 3 scrum areas per floor to foster collaboration,"" the company said.
As many as 2,000 persons were on site every day for 39 months to construct the building, spending 18 million man-hours.
Last year, the construction was awarded the Golden Trophy and Certificate from National Safety Council for safe construction process.
The building meets stringent safety standards, with 110 km of fire protection system conduits.
The campus has one conference room seat for every 3.25 workstations, higher than the global ration of 1:5.
With sustainability at its core, the campus has more than 300 trees dotting its grounds with three specimen trees aged over 200 years. It also has a 850,000 litre water recycling plant.
The company officials declined to divulge the investment made in this campus but said hundreds of millions of dollars were spent to create the facility.
Stating that the facility reaffirms their long-term commitment to India, they pointed out that Amazon already announced $5 billion investment in the country and another 500 million dollar in food retail.
Amazon already houses its largest India fulfillment centre in Hyderabad. Spread over four lakh square feet, the centre is located near Rajiv Gandhi International Airport. The company last month announced that it will be expanded to 5.8 lakh square feet.
Hyderabad is already home to giants like Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook, Deloitte, Accenture, TCS, Wipro and Infosys.
After Apple Inc opened its development centre in 2016, IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao had declared that Hyderabad became home to four of the top five most valued tech companies to have their largest offices outside the US.
Software giant Microsoft already has largest presence in Hyderabad outside their headquarters in the US.
Search giant Google also plans to build its biggest campus outside its US headquarters. Coming up on 7.2 acres in the Financial District, it is expected to house 13,000 employees. An agreement for this was signed between Google and the Telangana government in 2015.

The attrition rate at Infosys increased in the June quarter despite measures such as variable compensation, higher promotions, overseas postings and retention bonuses and is “beyond the comfort range for the company"", according to a 29 August report by brokerage firm Sharekhan. “The high attrition has negative impacts like higher recruitment costs, dissatisfaction among the employees, lower client satisfaction, and lower utilisation,"" the report stated.
The company’s attrition rate has been the highest among employees with 3-5 years’ experience, Krishnamurthy Shankar, executive vice president and group head of human resource at Infosys said in an interview. “The Bengaluru numbers are even higher,"" he said.
Infosys has taken various steps in terms of skilling its workforce, to address the rising attrition levels. “We are very confident attrition will come down. A lot of emphasis is being put on training,"" Shankar said.
Infosys has created something called digital tags—essentially digital skill sets that you can learn and tag yourself to. “We have identified a set of 32 skill sets in areas such as cloud architecture and internet of things, wherein we have created specific learning pathways for each of these skills sets. The employees get a certification and a skill tag. We also incentivize them through a skill bonus,"" he said.
Infosys is also focusing on early career growth of employees with incentives such as “early career rewards"" so that they are clear about their growth path within the organization in the first few years itself, Shankar said.
The company has also launched what it calls “bridge programmes"", which enable employees to pick up alternative skills, which in turn brings higher compensation. The scheme is expected to help in upskilling to meet the demands of the future as well as open up more career options, especially for young employees.
A recent trend is employees quitting jobs to pursue entrepreneurship. Infosys specifically doesn’t have any ‘intrapreneurship’ programmes, but “we have something called the Infosys Innovation Lab and hackathons where we help create proof of concepts,"" Shankar said.
The company’s ‘Be the Navigator’ programme helps in “continuous improvement for the client."" The objective of the programme is that clients should look upon Infosys business process management (BPM) as business partners who own their end-to-end process and drive business outcomes, the company said.
“While reskilling by companies can solve part of the problem, it’s not enough. Today, many people do reskilling on their own and when they switch jobs, they easily get a 30% hike, which a normal appraisal within the company can never match up to,"" said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst, Greyhound Research."

A one-time exemption could save about $1 billion in taxes for Indian companies that announced share buybacks this year, according to Umesh Mehta, head of research at Samco Securities Ltd.
Share buybacks announced before the government introduced a 20% levy on such transactions on July 5 will be exempt, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said at a press conference on Friday. More than 70 companies including software exporters Wipro Ltd. and Infosys Ltd. had announced or completed buybacks totaling 355 billion rupees ($5.2) billion before that date, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Companies had opted for share buybacks because they thought it was an efficient way to return money to shareholders, according to Ajay Bodke, chief executive officer for fund management services at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. “They were blindsided when the tax was brought in, so this exemption can act as a one-time boost,"" he said.

160,2019-09-23,Infosys,"Analysts said IT stocks had traded at a premium to other stocksThe new taxation rule will be neutral event for Indian IT companies at the consolidate level, a report said

Mumbai: Shares of information technology companies fell on Monday after investors booked profit as analysts see no material impact on tax rates after the government cut tax rates for domestic companies.
Analysts said IT stocks had traded at a premium to other stocks as investors took to defensive plays due to concern over an economic slowdown and liquidity crunch.
On Monday, shares of Infosys Ltd fell 3.2%, Wipro Ltd declined 2.2%, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd 2%, Tech Mahindra Ltd 1.7%, HCL Technologies Ltd 1.3%. Nifty IT Index slumped 2%.
According to a Credit Suisse report, there will be no material impact on tax rates on IT services companies following the tax cuts. The current blended effective tax rates of 22-27% are a combination of higher tax rates paid outside India and much lower tax rates paid in India. IT companies, thus pay lower than 25% tax rates in India and the cuts announced Friday will not lower their overall tax rates.
Brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher said it has increased underweight on the sector to 390 basis points and remains cautious as growth in tech spends in BFS clients in the US and European geography will be muted compared to last year due to trade war concerns, uncertainty on central bank policy and interest rates, Brexit related uncertainty. The rupee advantage will also weaken now.
The new taxation rule will be neutral event for Indian IT companies at the consolidate level. Tax rates will be lower than 25% as US and UK rates are at 21% and 18% respectively, Prabhudas Lilladher report adds."
159,2019-09-23,Infosys,"The actual tax incidence varies across IT companies depending on their exposure to tax exemption zonesEffective tax rates of most large IT companies are already low or close to the new tax rates announced by the government

Mumbai: Information Technology (IT) stocks were bystanders in Monday’s market rally, declining an average 2%. Investors are cautious. The benefit of the cut in corporate tax rate to 22% will be negligible or modest at best for IT companies in the current fiscal.
Not without reason. IT services companies enjoy tax exemptions on revenues from special economic zones (SEZs). So the effective tax rates of most large IT companies are already low or close to the new tax rates announced by the government. “Benefit in FY2020E will be modest to negligible since many avail of tax exemption on SEZ profits in India,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note.
Further, amid growing concerns about sustainability of a pick-up in revenue growth rates and the material scope for earnings upgrades in other sectors from the corporate tax cut, the Street is making a tactical shift in preferences. “We lower (view on technology stocks) to equal weight tactically by taking weights from both TCS Ltd and Infosys Ltd; investors may pivot to domestic sectors,"" Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note. Compared to IT, financials, energy, consumer staples and materials such as metals has scope for notable upgrades in earnings, Jefferies India’s calculations show.
Analysts fear that the growing headwinds to economic growth in the US and Europe may weigh on technology spends, which in turn will weigh on revenue growth rates.
The actual tax incidence varies across IT companies depending on their exposure to tax exemption zones. Due to low presence in SEZs, smaller companies generally pay higher tax. Even then, the benefits are seen to be marginal.
Another sectoral index that traded in losses on the National Stock Exchange was the NSE Pharma index. Domestic pharmaceutical companies, like IT companies, receive several tax incentives such as deductions on investments in research and development. Manufacturing plants in designated industrial zones are taxed at concessional rates. Therefore, the effective tax rates for several pharma companies are already low.
Meanwhile, it does not mean that corporate tax rate cut will go in vain for the IT sector. Tax benefits from SEZs fade over time. Typically profits generated from SEZs are exempt from taxation in the initial five years with benefits receding in subsequent years. The latest reduction in corporate tax will cap the tax liability, pointed out analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. So even as benefits from SEZs recede, thanks to reduction in corporate tax rate, there will be no abrupt rise in taxes for IT companies. “The benefit (from corporate tax rate cut) will be material in the medium term once the SEZ benefit fades away,"" analysts at Kotak said."

BENGALURU :
Indian IT services companies are increasing their local hiring numbers in the US, despite higher costs, to counter the increasingly stringent norms of the H-1B visa programme that allows companies to temporarily employ foreign workers in the US in specialty occupations.
On 13 September, Infosys Ltd said it plans to hire 1,000 people locally by 2023 for its just-launched Technology and Innovation Center in Arizona. The company has surpassed its “spring 2017 commitment to hire 10,000 American workers as part of its ongoing efforts to accelerate the pace of innovation for US enterprises"", it said.
In June, Wipro Ltd announced the opening of a new centre of excellence in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area of the US, for which it will hire 100 people locally over the next two years to boost its already substantial presence in the region. “Wipro specifically plans to leverage local Minnesota talent in addition to providing opportunities for recent university graduates and experts keen on developing their technology-related skills,"" Wipro said in a press release on 13 June.
India’s largest IT services provider Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), already has about 30,000 US employees, making it the largest employer in the US among Indian peers.
Cognizant, too, continues to hire in the US, “keeping up with the needs of our business growth. Nearly 76% of our revenue is from North America. We have nearly 60 US facilities and clients in 49 states. In 2017, we committed to hire at least 25,000 professionals over a five-year period,"" said a Cognizant spokesperson.
HCL Technologies Ltd, too, has brought down its dependencies on H-1B visas by hiring more people locally. The company has about 17,000 employees in the US and 64.7% of them are US citizens, according to estimates from industry insiders.
At present, there is a yearly cap of 65,000 on new H1-B visas, with an additional 20,000 visas for those with advanced degrees from a US institution.
The number of H-1B visas issued during September-October 2018 dropped 10% year-on-year from 373,400 to 335,000 because of tighter scrutiny, which led to higher on-site hiring in FY19, according to a June report by rating firm ICRA. The number of H-1B visas for initial employment that these companies have received has fallen by as much as 40% between 2014 and 2017, according to a report by Nasscom.
“As a result, the share of H-1B employees in total employment in the US has declined and the share of US-born employees has risen by 5-7%,"" it said.
The high visa denial rates are a key contributor to the increase in on-site hiring.
The visa denial rate for Wipro was highest at 62% in the first quarter of FY19 up from 7% in FY15, according to an analysis of data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) by the National Foundation for American Policy, a non-profit body engaged in public policy research. Infosys had a denial rate of 57% in October-December 2018, followed by HCL Technologies (43%), and TCS (37%). USCIS follows an October-September fiscal year.
ICRA said on-site hiring increases the cost for Indian IT services players and adds to higher visa fees and compliance cost associated with enhanced scrutiny of visa applications. “There have been several proposed legislations to substantially increase the minimum wages for H1B visa holders, which will impact the margins adversely, if implemented."" Higher on-site hiring results in higher wage bills and lower margins, it added."
154,2019-09-27,Infosys,"The Nifty ended the September futures and options (F&O) series above the 11,500 levels, gaining nearly 6%For most part of the month, market sentiment was somber due to global and domestic growth concerns

The Nifty ended the September futures and options (F&O) series above 11,500 level, gaining nearly 6%. For most part of the month, market sentiment was somber due to global and domestic growth concerns. To be sure, some growth boosters, including mergers of public bank sector banks, were announced by the government. Investor sentiment turned positive towards the end of the series in reaction to corporate tax cuts.
Going into the October series, a slew of important data releases are lined-up. To begin with, market participants will closely watch the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) meeting on 4 October. Economists are working with a modest interest rate cut expectation of 15 basis points. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. The central bank’s stance on future rate cuts will be important especially after tax cuts.
Secondly, the government's borrowing calendar for the second half of the fiscal year — October-March — is likely to be released by the RBI in the coming week. One of the fallouts of corporate tax reductions would be felt on the fiscal front and most economists have cautioned of a slippage. So, from that perspective, this data point is crucial.
Apart from these, the September Purchase Managers' Index data for Indian manufacturing and services will be published on 1 October and 3 October, respectively. Among high-frequency data, automobile sales for September will be important. Commentaries of auto makers with respect to the anticipated demand revival post tax cuts and the upcoming festival season would be interesting.
Most importantly, market participants will have to brace themselves up for the September quarter corporate earnings. Expectations aren’t too high on this front but outlook on demand and prices will be closely watched. IT major Infosys Ltd will kick-start India Inc’s second quarter earnings season on 11 October.
As far as global cues are concerned, media reports state that Chinese and the US officials could make progress on trade talks at their October meeting. The European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve have their policy meetings scheduled on 24 October and 30 October, respectively. Of course movement in global crude oil prices will be an important cue for global and domestic equity markets. Though oil production is expected to be back on track, geopolitical risks remain.
With market participants’ plate full of data, volatility is bound to remain high. As for levels, technical analysts expect the Nifty to inch towards the 11,900 mark given the long positions that have been rolled over into this series."

Varanium Capital, a portfolio manager that offers investment and advisory services, said it plans to raise a  ₹200 crore fintech-focused early-stage venture capital fund.
The Varanium NexGen fund plans to invest  ₹2-5 crore each across 35-40 fintech startups at a seed or pre-series A stage, Aparajit Bhandarkar, managing partner, venture capital, Varanium, said in an interview.
“We see fintech as an interesting opportunity because financial services represent more of the economy than any other sector. We have seen multiple winners in India and globally, and also see the government focusing on the sector, via Aadhaar, UPI payments,"" he added.
Prior to Bhandarkar, he ran ISME ACE, an accelerator programme for fintech startups in India.
The fund has already raised about  ₹50 crore, marking its first close and plans to start investing soon.
While 10% of the fund is contributed by Varanium, the rest of the investors (limited partners) include domestic business professionals and family offices, including former Infosys chairman Mohandas Pai.
The fund plans to invest more in business-to-business, or enterprise-focused fintech firms, rather than consumer-focused firms, which generally need high amounts of capital to scale.
“The fintech fund also stems from our prior experience in financial services, and gives us the ability to raise capital from multiple pools,"" said T. S. Anantakrishnan, founder of Varanium Capital.
Given the cheque size, Varanium’s investments will compete with angel networks and high-net-worth individuals (HNIs), who invest by themselves. However, Anantakrishnan said Varanium will also be happy to co-invest as part of a larger round.
Fintech-focused funds have been a theme globally as well as in India.
For example, Ribbit Capital is a US-based fund which focuses only on fintech firms, and has been an active investor in Indian startups such as Policybazaar and Razorpay."
150,2019-10-03,Infosys,"Nilekani said that Aadhaar-based identification gave a boost to the government’s financial inclusion planHe said India’s payments system is unique, with a multi-party payments system on the UPI platform

New Delhi: The roll-out of Aadhaar, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), and account aggregators are the three technology-based solutions that has benefitted India the most in recent times, Nandan Nilekani, non-executive chairman of Infosys Ltd, said on Thursday.
“Transactional efficiency of things like identity, payment efficiency, and the ability to use data for individuals and businesses through account aggregators are the three big productivity leaps that have happened,"" he said at the World Economic Forum’s India Economic Summit in New Delhi.
Nilekani is the former chairman of Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which is responsible for rolling out the biometric-based Aadhaar, which comes with a 12-digit unique identity number. He had also played a crucial role in proposing the “invoice matching"" model to plug tax evasion under the goods and services tax. Besides, he headed a committee set up by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on the “Deepening of Digital Payments"", which suggested ways to boost digital payment in India.
Nilekani said Aadhaar-based identification helped fast-track the government’s financial inclusion plans through “banking for all"", or Jan Dhan Yojana. Similarly, the direct benefit transfer programme enabled subsidy to go directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiary, increasing efficiency and reducing pilferage and fraud.
India’s payments system is unique, with a multi-party payments system on the UPI platform, he said. The latest data shows that UPI-based transactions soared to a new high of 955.02 million in September compared with the earlier record of 918.35 million a month ago.
UPI was launched three years ago and picked momentum after the Centre’s massive exercise to ban high-value currency— ₹500 and  ₹1,000 notes—in November 2016. Since then, UPI has also been adopted by several prepaid payment instruments or wallet companies, such as Paytm and Mobikwik.
“We still don’t have WhatsApp (Pay) come online. Once everyone comes online, it is going to be huge.

In its fourth bi-monthly policy review of this fiscal, the central bank reduced its benchmark lending rate by 0.25 percentage point to 5.15% to revive growth that hit a six-year low of 5% in the June quarter.
The RBI also lowered its growth forecast for 2019-20 to 6.1% from 6.9% earlier and affirmed commitment to remain accommodative to address growth concerns 'as long as necessary'.

Mumbai: Indian stock markets are expected to be volatile on Monday. In the truncated trading week, markets will likely take cues from corporate earnings that kickstart with Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and IndusInd Bank reporting their results for September quarter.
Indian companies are expected to report a decline in revenue and profit for the second straight quarter amid a slump in consumer demand that has sent the government scrambling to boost investment and consumption through a raft of measures, including a tax cut for corporates.
Asian shares edged higher on Monday after data showed the US unemployment rate dropped to the lowest in almost 50 years, easing concerns of a slowdown in the world’s largest economy.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.25%. Japan's Nikkei stock index rose 0.29%, while Australian shares were up 0.48%
US Treasury yields inched higher as Friday’s data on the US jobs market suggests the Federal Reserve may not need to cut interest rates further. Sentiment around the US economy deteriorated sharply last week after disappointing data on manufacturing and services suggested the trade war was taking a toll, and more rate cuts would be needed to avert a potential recession in the world’s biggest economy.
The modest increase in US jobs eased some of these concerns, but traders warn that downside risks loom large on the horizon. Unemployment rate in the US fell to 3.5% in September to reach the lowest since December 1969. Non-farm payrolls also grew in September, but slightly less than expected.
The focus will shift to the next round of US-China trade negotiations expected in Washington on 10-11 October to see if the two sides can end a bruising year-long trade war that has hurt global growth and raised the risk of recession.
Back home, shares of Yes Bank are likely to be in focus. According to a Mint report, the private lender is in talks with three top technology companies, including Microsoft Corp., to induct one of them as a strategic shareholder as part of the bank’s strategy to get fresh capital infusion and augment its digital ambitions.
The Essel Group which is the promoter of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) has told its investors that none of ZEEL’s shares were pledged to Russia's VTB Capital Plc, in the structured loan arrangement inked between the firms in September 2017. The development comes after both, VTB Capital Plc and Essel Group, disclosed to stock exchanges on Friday that ZEEL's promoters have created an encumbrance on 10.2 crore shares, translating to a 10.7% stake held by promoter entity Essel Media Ventures Ltd, in favour of VTB Capital.
In the currency market, the yen gained slightly and the yuan slipped after Bloomberg reported that Chinese officials are signaling they are increasingly reluctant to agree to a broad trade deal pursued by US President Donald Trump. The yuan weakened about 0.20% in offshore trade to 7.1285 yuan per dollar. There is no onshore trading as Monday is the last day of China's holiday break. The yen, also considered a safe-haven asset edged slightly higher to 106.78 versus the US dollar and gained to 72.20 per Australian dollar.
The US and China have slapped tariffs on each other’s goods as part of a long-running dispute over Beijing’s trading practices, which Washington says are unfair.
Central banks around the world have been easing policy to offset the negative impact from the trade war. The Fed has already lowered interest rates twice this year, but a strong jobs market suggests further rate cuts may not be necessary. Worries about political instability in Hong Kong could hurt market sentiment after China’s army took the unusual step of issuing warnings to anti-government protesters in Hong Kong over the weekend.
Four months of often violent protests against Chinese rule has pushed the former British colony to the brink of recession and posed a serious challenge to Beijing’s control of the city.

Mumbai: Having opened marginally higher, Indian equities soon slipped into the red on Monday led by losses in banks and auto companies. The stock market will keep an eye on corporate earnings that will kick start later this week.

145,2019-10-10,Infosys,"Organic growth is estimated at 2.4% sequentially for top four IT firms, almost same as growth in Q1Growth at TCS is likely to fall to single digits, after four straight quarters of double-digit growth

The July-September quarter has historically been the strongest one for Indian IT services companies. But in this fiscal year, there is unlikely to be any show of strength when companies announce second quarter (Q2) results.
“Organic growth is estimated at 2.4% sequentially for the top four IT firms— TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Wipro—in the September quarter, barely higher than the 2.3% growth reported in each of the preceding two quarters,"" says an IT sector analyst at a domestic institutional firm, who declined to be named.
What’s more, year-on-year revenue growth at industry leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) is expected to fall to single-digit levels, after four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth.
“We see risks to double-digit growth guidance at TCS,"" analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a results preview note to clients. Analysts expect the company to report 9-9.5% growth, down from 10.6% in Q1. While TCS doesn’t give guidance, its management had earlier sounded confident of achieving double-digit growth in FY20.
If the company’s growth falls to single-digit levels in what is meant to be the strongest quarter in the year, it’s fair to conclude that investors would need to settle for lower-than-anticipated growth for the whole year.
Indian IT companies have been sounding cautious about tech spending in the banking and financial services (BFS) vertical, pointing to weakness in areas such as capital markets, European banks and some US regional banks that are going through mergers and acquisitions.
This was attested to when Accenture Plc. reported results for the quarter ended August late last month. Revenues from its financial services vertical grew 4%, far lower than the 7.2% company-wide growth. This was mainly owing to a continued decline in revenues from European banks.
Since the BFS vertical is a mainstay for most Indian IT services firms, it isn’t surprising that overall growth rates are under pressure. “We believe that IT spending will moderate in financial services in 2019 after a strong year in 2018. IT services companies face pressure from higher squeeze on run spends (i.e. traditional services), while spending in new areas remains steady,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients last month.
While revenue growth is coming under pressure, profit margins, too, have been falling. Increasing protectionism has resulted in a higher cost structure in these companies’ US on-site operations.
To be sure, the impact of these headwinds will be felt differently across different companies. In TCS’s case, a high-base last year will also impact growth. Infosys, on the other hand, had a relatively lower base; besides, it has a set of BFS clients that are reportedly increasing tech spend. It’s little wonder shares of the latter have outperformed TCS by a wide margin in the past three months."
138,2019-10-11,Infosys,"Even as operating profit growth remains weak, investors are seeing Infosys as a company in an investment phase, and are willing to overlook weak profit growth, for nowWhile TCS’s earnings disappointed the Street, Infosys’ Q2 earnings were marginally ahead of estimates

Mumbai: In the past three months, shares of Infosys Ltd have outperformed those of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd by about 22%. The September quarter results announced by the two companies support this shift in investor preference. While TCS’s earnings disappointed the Street, Infosys’ Q2 earnings were marginally ahead of estimates.
While Infosys’s revenues were more or less in line with expectations, growing by 3.3% in constant currency terms, operating profit margins were better than expected at 21.7%.
Of course, operating profit growth remains weak at 0.4% year-on-year, but investors are seeing Infosys as a company in an investment phase, and are willing to overlook weak profit growth, for now. Besides, margins did improve by 120 basis points sequentially, unlike TCS, whose margins fell to a nine-quarter low in Q2.
On the main metrics that investors are focused on, such as deal wins and revenue growth, Infosys continues to do well. Revenues grew 11.4% in constant currency terms, which translates to slightly under 10% growth after adjusting for the impact of acquisitions. It reported strong double-digit growth in nearly all of its business verticals, barring retail, which grew just 1% and dragged down overall growth. “Business in the retail vertical is closely linked to consumer sentiment, which has been weak lately owing to uncertainties in the global economy,"" the company said in a press conference.
Importantly, it announced large deal wins worth $2.8 billion, which is far higher than preceding quarters, although it must be noted that only 10% of these were from new deal wins.
Infosys’s guidance for the year, however, remains conservative. It expects to grow by 10% at best this year, despite growing by over 11.5% in the first half of the year. This implies growth of about 8% in the second half in reported terms, and only about 6.5% growth on an organic basis.
But as an analyst at a multinational brokerage says, “It does look like Infosys is being overly conservative, as the current guidance implies nearly no growth in the remaining two quarters on a sequential basis.""
Given the disappointment at TCS, and with limited options in the markets, investors may well continue to keep the faith in Infosys. Infosys shares were trading 3.3% higher in the pre-market session on the New York Stock Exchange at the time of writing."

“All these are clear signs that we are progressing well in our journey of client-centricity and maximizing value for our stakeholders,"" he added.
Infosys won large deals worth $2.8 billion in the second quarter, said COO Pravin Rao.

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd, India’s second largest software exporter by revenue, posted a strong set of numbers on Friday, a day after the country’s largest information technology (IT) services provider Tata Consultancy Services Ltd missed earnings estimates.
Following a seasonally strong second quarter, Infosys raised the lower end of its fiscal year 2020 revenue guidance, revising it to 9-10% from 8.5-10% earlier, on the back of strong momentum in large deals and market share gains.
Analysts at Emkay Research said they were “surprised that Infosys did not raise the revenue guidance at the upper end despite the confidence of strong order booking as well as H1FY20 revenue performance"".
The company declared its second quarter earnings after market hours.
Net profit for the second quarter ended 30 September stood at  ₹4,037 crore, up 6.2% from  ₹3,802 crore in the June quarter, as revenue grew 3.8% sequentially to  ₹22,629 crore from  ₹21,803 crore.
The management said growth was broad-based across industry segments and geographies.
The closely watched dollar revenue grew 2.5% sequentially to $3.21 billion from $3.13 billion in the June quarter. The company signed large deals worth $2.8 billion during the quarter, a significant part of which were renewals.
“Our performance was robust on multiple dimensions—revenue growth, digital growth, operating margins, operational efficiencies, large deal signings and reduction in attrition,"" said Salil Parekh, chief executive (CEO) and managing director of Infosys.
“All these are clear signs that we are progressing well in our journey of client-centricity and maximizing value for our stakeholders,"" he added.
Financial services and retail segments accounted for nearly half of the revenue, almost the same as in the June quarter. While revenue from financial services grew 8.6%, retail revenue declined 0.6% from a year ago, given the slowdown in retail sentiment due to the US-China trade war.
Operating margins for the July-September quarter stood at 21.7%, up 1.2 percentage points from 20.5% in the first quarter.
“We saw expansion in operating margins during the quarter driven by improvement in operational parameters and cost efficiencies,"" said Nilanjan Roy of chief financial officer of Infosys.
The company’s digital revenue stood at $1.23 billion (38.3% of total revenue), a year-on-year growth of 38.4% and a sequential growth of 10.7% in constant currency terms.
Parekh said the company continues to gain market share in the $160 billion digital market.
“In terms of digital, mostly these are new mid-term to long-term contracts,"" the management said during an analyst call.
Attrition rate declined to 21.7% from 23.4% in the April-June quarter, an indication that various steps taken by the management in terms of reskilling its workforce and offering skill-based incentives are bearing fruit.
Infosys added 28 active clients in the second quarter. The total number of clients in the first quarter was 1,336, which increased to 1,364 in the second quarter.
However, client growth during the quarter was limited to the $1 million revenue bracket as the company failed to add any big client in the $100 million-plus revenue bracket."

143,2019-10-11,Infosys,"Shares of IndusInd Bank slumped more than 6% on Thursday after it announced its earnings for the September quarterInfosys will report its second quarter earnings today

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may remain in focus on Friday:
TCS: The IT major, in its July-September earnings announced on Thursday, reported a constant currency revenue growth of 8.4% year-on-year, missing the Street's estimate of 9-9.5%. This may not bode well for the stock. The company along with IndusInd Bank Ltd kick started the earnings season for the September quarter and is likely to set the mood for the Indian equity market.
Yes Bank: The private lender on Thursday said it has appointed Anita Pai as its chief operating officer and Jasneet Bachal as chief marketing officer. Despite the announcement, shares remained in the red due to worries over the bank’s exposure to stressed sectors, mainly housing finance companies (HFCs) and weak financials.
IndusInd Bank: Shares of the bank slumped more than 6% on Thursday after it announced its earnings for the September quarter. Though the bank saw a 52% year-on-year jump in net profit, a sharp rise in provisions dragged the stock lower. The net profit number also missed analysts’ estimate. The bank’s exposure to a large HFC has been weighing on the investor sentiment.
Lupin: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has pulled up Lupin Ltd for failing to maintain records of batches of manufactured medicines and their sales at the company’s Tarapur plant. The regulator also pointed out that the batch production and control records at the plant do not include complete information relating to production and control of each batch.
Indiabulls Housing: Shares of the company plunged on Thursday, closing down more than 19% as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rejected its proposed merger with Lakshmi Vilas Bank. This has spoiled the non-bank’s plans to get a banking licence amid concerns over tight liquidity and weak asset quality faced by housing finance companies.
Lakshmi Vilas Bank: The stock hit an all-time low on Thursday and was locked in the lower circuit limit of 5% at Rs.25.65 on the BSE as the Reserve Bank did not approve its merger with Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd. In September, the bank was placed under the prompt corrective action list by the RBI for not meeting certain regulatory thresholds.
Infosys: The IT company will report its second quarter earnings today. Experts believe that this earnings season may not do well due to weakness in demand that has led to a slowdown in the economy along with liquidity crisis that has affected the non-banking financial companies, automobile and real estate sectors.
Bharti Airtel: The company on Thursday was the top gainer among the Nifty 50 stocks as investors cheered Reliance Jio’s announcement that it will end free voice calls. The most profitable operator Jio will now charge customers 6 paise per minute for voice calls made to rival phone networks.
SpiceJet: The company on Thursday said no cracks have been found in its fleet of older Boeing 737 NG after the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ordered inspections following a similar move from the US Federal Aviation Administration's to conduct checks for structural cracks on a portion of the 737 fleet operating in the country.
IOB: Indian Overseas Bank said on Thursday it would reduce the interest rates in retail and micro small and medium enterprises by 25 basis points with effect from 1 November. This after the RBI cut the key lending rate by 25 basis points in the October monetary policy meeting."

Bengaluru: In January 2018, Salil Parekh became the second non-founder CEO and MD of Infosys Ltd after Vishal Sikka who resigned over visible differences with the founders. So far, Parekh has been largely successful in maintaining peace between the management and the founders and keeping Infosys away from media speculations. He has managed, what co-founder Nandan Nilekani said, to make Infosys “boring"" again. But, industry-leading growth rates and high attrition remain serious concerns for the company, more so when its closest competitor Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd, which will declare its results today, has fared better. Can Infosys being cheer investors ahead of Diwali?
Mint highlights five things to watch for in Infosys’ second quarter (Q2) results that will be declared on 11 October.
Guidance for FY20
The company is expected to increase its revenue growth guidance for FY2020 on the back of strong large deal momentum and market share gains, given the visibility in revenue growth. “We expect Infosys to raise its constant currency FY20 revenue guidance from 8.5%-10% growth currently by at least ~50 basis points given reasonable arithmetic and momentum from the recent large deal wins,"" brokerage firm Emkay Global said in an earnings preview note. Prabhudas Liladher expects Infosys to raise its guidance to 9-10% from 8.5-10% it had guided during Q1 for FY2020, led by strong large deal wins in the past which helps provide visibility ahead.
Revenue growth
Infosys is likely to post strong revenue growth for the quarter ended September as Q2 is a seasonally strong period. Most analysts see a constant currency revenue growth in the range of 3.1-3.6% and cross currency headwinds of 58-70 basis points (bps). One bps is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Analysts expect the Stater deal to aid revenue growth. “We expect full quarter consolidation of Stater to add 60 basis points to revenue growth. Revenue growth will be broad-based in our view,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a Q2 preview note. In March this year, Infosys acquired 75% stake in ABN AMRO Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Stater to strengthen its mortgage servicing capabilities through digital platforms.
Performance in key geographies and industry segments
The US market accounts for 60% of Infosys’ total revenue. Clients in the banking and financial services industry, or BFSI, bring 32% of the business. In the previous quarter ended June, growth remained largely flat in both these segments. So, investors will keep a watch on management commentary on the BFSI vertical and the North American business, especially any commentary on the US-China trade war. General commentary on the demand environment and deal win momentum will also be monitored.
Growth in digital business
Infosys’ digital revenue accounted for 35.7% of total revenues during the first quarter ended June, a marginal improvement against 33.8% in the March quarter. Its digital revenue in April-June grew 8.1% sequentially to $1,119 million from $1,035 million in the previous quarter ended March. On a year-on-year basis, it grew 39.3% from $803 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2018. So, investors will closely watch out for growth in digital revenues. Analysts expect margin pressure to remain due to pricing pressure in legacy and investments in digital. Nomura expects Infosys to retain its margin guidance of 21-23% for the full year of FY20.
Attrition rates and retention measures
The attrition rate at Infosys stood at 23.4% in the April-June quarter, up from 20.4% in the previous quarter. This was much higher than competitor TCS’ attrition rate that stood at 11.5% in the June quarter. The management has taken various steps in terms of skilling its workforce and offering skill-based incentives, to address the rising attrition levels. Therefore, the company’s ability to retain talent and contain the attrition numbers will be closely watched."

137,2019-10-14,Infosys,"Infosys’s forecast for the current year suggests a sharp drop in growth rates in the second half of the fiscalShares of Infosys have outperformed those of TCS by about 22% in the past three months

Mumbai: Momentum is on the side of Infosys Ltd. After Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) reported a drop in revenue growth to single-digit levels in the September quarter, Infosys Ltd continued with double-digit growth for the fourth straight quarter.
Infosys’s revenue grew 11.4% in constant currency terms, on the back of strong double-digit growth in nearly all of its business verticals. At TCS, growth in constant currency fell to 8.4% in the September quarter, from 10.6% in the preceding three months.
While Infosys may be better off than TCS, growth is unmistakably slowing down for both of India’s largest IT services companies. After adjusting for the impact of acquisitions, organic growth at Infosys is estimated to be around 9.9%, say analysts. In the June quarter, Infosys’s organic growth was estimated at about 11.8%.
“We had expected weak financial services, and that did play out. However, the slowdown spread to other verticals, viz. retail and parts of manufacturing. Profit margin declined sharply y-o-y, with elevated impact due to aggressive hiring at a time of an unanticipated slowdown,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note on TCS results.
Infosys’s forecast for the current year suggests a sharp drop in growth rates in the second half of the fiscal. It expects to grow by 10% at best this year, despite growing by more than 11.5% in the first half of the year. This implies growth of about 8% in the second half in reported terms, and only about 6.5% on an organic basis.
Of course, Infosys appears to be too conservative with the forecast and growth may end up being higher. An analyst at a multinational brokerage, who requested anonymity, said, “It does look like Infosys is being overly conservative, as the current guidance implies nearly no growth in the remaining two quarters on a sequential basis."" Even so, the fact remains that growth is slowing down.
This isn’t entirely surprising. “Tier-1 IT companies had provided a cautious outlook on BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) spends due to weakness in capital markets and European banks and soft spends in US regional banks undergoing M&A,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a 30 September note to clients. “Tech spends will be volatile in the short term as firms balance short-term priorities with long-term need for investments.""
Even so, the sharp slowdown in growth at TCS has taken both analysts and the company itself by surprise. TCS had hired and invested assuming a certain level of growth, which didn’t come by, and as a result, its profit margins narrowed to a nine-quarter low. In contrast, Infosys’s margins widened 120 basis points from the lows of the June quarter.
TCS also told analysts that visibility for the second half of the year is not very strong. Analysts at Kotak say the verticals facing a slowdown such as BFSI, retail and parts of manufacturing, contribute 56% to TCS’s revenue. The surprise element in its results was the sharp slowdown in business from the retail segment. In Infosys’s case, revenue from this vertical grew just 1%, in stark contrast to double-digit growth in most of the other segments. “Business in the retail vertical is closely linked to consumer sentiment, which has been weak lately owing to uncertainties in the global economy,"" the company said in a press conference.
“Going by TCS’s commentary, there is a slowdown in quite a few areas. While Infosys may have weathered the storm in the first half of the year, it is likely things will catch up in the second half,"" said the analyst from the multinational brokerage.
For now, investors seem to be betting that the momentum in Infosys will continue to reap dividends. In the past three months, shares of Infosys have outperformed those of TCS by about 22%. The September quarter earnings announced by the two companies also will be seen as supporting this shift in investor preference."

BENGALURU :
Higher revenue and favourable tax rates helped Bengaluru-based Wipro Ltd report on Tuesday a September quarter net profit of  ₹2,552.6 crore, a 6.9% sequential jump from  ₹2,387.4 crore.
The company’s revenues for the second quarter came at  ₹15,125 crore, up 2.8% q-o-q. The closely-watched dollar revenue for the IT services segment came at $2.04 billion, marginally up 0.5% from $2.03 billion in the immediate previous quarter.
Wipro expects revenue from its flagship IT services business for the quarter ended December to be in the range of $2.06 billion to $2.10 billion, which translates to a sequential growth of 0.8-2.8%, backed by a robust pipeline of digital deals. The revenue growth forecast is higher than analyst estimates of 0-2%. Unlike Infosys which provides guidance for the full year, Wipro guides for the quarter ahead.
“The demand environment remains unchanged for IT spends, though there is an overhang of macro uncertainty in certain sectors. US market grew at 9.4% y-o-y in constant currency while Europe is weak. We continue to see a robust pipeline and the momentum of order book in Q2 has been better than Q1,"" Abidali Z. Neemuchwala, CEO and MD of Wipro said.
Operating margin for the IT services segment stood at 18.1%, an increase of 3.1% year-on-year and a decline of 0.3% sequentially. “We delivered operating margins in a tight range after absorbing the impact of two months of wage hike,"" Jatin Dalal, chief financial officer, Wipro said in a statement. “Growth remains our priority and we remain invested for future.""
In the digital business, Wipro’s revenue grew 7% q-o-q and 29% y-o-y in constant currency and now contributes 39.6% of the total revenues. “Our global investments in digital have created the requisite presence, experience, and scale to support transformation not just in our core markets, but also in our growing markets, aligned to our geographic expansion strategy. We are winning integrated, transformational deals in Canada, Australia, APAC, and in our key markets of US and UK,"" Neemuchwala said.
Banking, financial services & insurance (BFSI), communication and healthcare remained weak during the quarter declining 0.9%, 2.6%, and 0.7% respectively on a sequential basis while consumer (retail) and manufacturing business performed well growing at 1% and 2.9% respectively. In contrast, cross town competitor Infosys showed muted growth in the retail sector.
The voluntary attrition for Q2 on a trailing 12 month basis stood at 17% marginally down from 17.6% in the previous quarter. “The focus is on hiring from campuses and training them. Millennials are driven to join us because of the variety of clients and technologies they get to work with,"" Saurabh Govil, HR head of Wipro.
Wipro announced its earnings post market hours. Ahead of its earnings announcement, Wipro shares closed up 0.14% at  ₹243.70 on the BSE."
129,2019-10-16,Infosys,"Wipro reports a steady revenue growth after a sequential decline in Q1 revenuesNet profit was higher than expectations on better operating margins and a drop in tax rates

Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed,"" said the English poet Alexander Pope.
Investors in Wipro Ltd will not only be not disappointed, they will be quite pleased with the company’s September quarter results.
While revenue growth was more or less in line with what analysts expected, at 1.1% sequentially in constant currency terms, profit margins were better than expected.
What’s more, there was a surprise drop in the effective tax rate in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, and the company now expects an effective tax rate of about 20-21% on an annual basis. This is lower than analysts’ estimates of a 22-23% effective tax rate for FY20 and FY21. As a result, earnings estimates are expected to be upgraded by analysts.
Wipro expects its tax rates to drop as a result of the government’s cut in minimum alternate tax rates. This sets it apart from other software services companies who have decided to stay with the previous tax regime, and hence won’t see an increase in earnings estimates as a result of the government’s tax cut.
This comes against the backdrop of a massive underperformance by Wipro shares in the past six months. While the Nifty IT index fell by 5.6% during this period, the company’s shares have slumped by 15.3%. Wipro’s shares were trading at only around 13 times FY21 estimated earnings, far lower than the more than 20 times valuation in the case of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). “Given the rock-bottom expectations from the company, its performance will be cheered by investors,"" says an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm, on condition of anonymity.
Note that Wipro’s revenue had fallen by 0.7% in the June quarter, after which its stock posted losses vis-à-vis peers.
But while the Q2 show looks decent against the backdrop of the weak Q1 performance and generally low expectations, there are still concerns about growth. Year-on-year growth stood at merely 3.8% in Q2. Adjusted for the contribution from acquisitions, the sequential revenue guidance for Q3 is only 0-2%.
Revenue from the banking and financial services vertical fell sequentially, which is a worry for prospects for growth going forward. Besides, the steady operating profit margins in Q2 were aided by some one-off factors that may not repeat going forward.
As such, investors would do well to not extrapolate the earnings in Q2 as a sign of things to come. Wipro’s year-on-year growth rates remain far lower than those of peers, and a large differential in valuations compared to large peers such as TCS and Infosys Ltd looks justified.
But as pointed out earlier, the fact that things improved compared to the June quarter, and considering the surprise bump in earnings owing to the tax change, the valuation gap can be expected to narrow a bit."

124,2019-10-21,Infosys,"The company has been accused of taking unethical steps to increase short-term revenue and profitsAn anonymous group alleged that CEO Salil Parekh was bypassing reviews and approvals for large deals

Bengaluru: US-listed shares of Infosys Ltd fell nearly 12% on Nasdaq during early trading on Monday after the Indian software services exporter said it had received whistleblower complaints alleging ""unethical practices"" by the company's executives.
The company issued a statement after The Economic Times reported that an anonymous group sent letters to Infosys' board and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleging that the company was taking ""unethical"" steps to boost short-term revenue and profit.
According to reports, an anonymous group that calls itself ""ethical employees"" have written to the Infosys Board as well as American regulator US Securities and Exchange Commission with the allegations. They have claimed that they have emails and voice recordings to substantiate the same.
The group alleged that Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh was bypassing reviews and approvals for large deals, the ET report said.
""In large contracts like Verizon, Intel, JVs in Japan, ABN AMRO acquisition, revenue recognition matters are forced, which are not as per accounting standards,"" the report said, citing cited the letters.
Reuters was not able to independently review the letters.
The complaints follow a strong quarterly show by Infosys, which raised the lower end of its annual revenue forecast on upbeat demand for its digital services from Western clients.
""(The complaints) have been placed before the audit committee as per the company's practice and will be dealt with in accordance with the company's whistleblower policy,"" Infosys said in a filing.
ADRs of Infosys were down 15.7% at $8.91 in premarket trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Indian markets were closed on Monday for a holiday.

127,2019-10-21,Infosys,"A few anonymous employees of Infosys have accused its CEO Salil Parekh and CFO Nilanjan Roy of unethical practices for many quartersThe employees said they have been instructed not to share large deal information with auditors.

Bengaluru: A few anonymous employees of global software vendor Infosys have accused its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Salil Parekh and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Nilanjan Roy of unethical practices for many quarters.
""Parekh and Roy have been resorting to unethical practices for many quarters, as evident from their e-mails and voice recordings of their conversations,"" said the complainants, who called themselves 'ethical employees' in a 2-page letter to the city-based IT behemoth's board of directors on September 20, a copy of which has been accessed by IANS.
When there was no response from the board to their letter, an unnamed whistleblower on behalf of the unethical employees on October 3 wrote to the US-based office of the Whistleblower Protection Programme, alleging willful mis-statement material accounting irregularities for (the) last two quarters (April-September).
In response, the company in a statement on Monday said the whistleblower complaint had been placed before the audit committee as per the company's practices.
""The complaint will be dealt with in accordance with the company's whistleblowers policy,"" the IT major said in a statement to IANS.
""In (the) last quarter (July-September), we were asked not to fully recognise costs like visa costs to improve profits. We have voice recordings of these conversations,"" claimed the letter.
The employees also alleged that in the quarter under review of fiscal 2019-20, the management put immense pressure on them to not recognise reversals of $50 million of upfront payment in FDR contract, as it will slash profits for the quarter and negatively affect the company's stock price. The letter said not recognising reversals of upfront payment in FDR contract was against fair accounting practice.
""Critical information is hidden from the auditors and board. In large contracts like Verizon, Intel and JVs (Joint Ventures) in Japan, ABN Amro acquisition, revenue recognition matters are forced which is not as per the accounting standards,"" said the letter.
The employees said they have been instructed not to share large deal information with auditors.
The plaintiffs are confident of sharing the alleged emails and voice recordings with investigators when demanded.
""The CEO is bypassing reviews and approvals and instructing sales (teams) not to send mails for approvals. He directs them to make wrong assumptions to show margins,"" recalled the unnamed Infoscions.
Alleging that the CFO (Roy) was hand in glove with the CEO (Parekh), the insiders said the former complied with unethical practices, restraining ethical employees from showing large deal issues to the board during presentations.
""The CEO told us, no one in the board understands these things, they are happy as long as the share price is up. Those two Madrasis (Sundaram and Prahlad) and Diva (Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw) make silly points, you just nod and ignore them,"" charged the statement.

Bengaluru: The management of Infosys Ltd has been accused of taking “unethical"" steps to boost short-term revenue and profits, by an anonymous group calling itself “ethical employees"". The group has complained to the board of Infosys and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stating that the complainants have emails and voice recordings to substantiate the claims. The story was first reported in The Economic Times in a report dated 21 October.
“The whistleblower complaint has been placed before the Audit Committee as per the Company’s practice and will be dealt with in accordance with the Company’s whistleblowers policy,"" Infosys said in a response to a query from Mint.
In the letters sent to the Infosys board and the SEC, a copy of which Mint has seen, the group alleges that CEO Salil Parekh is bypassing reviews and approvals for large deals. “He (Parekh) directs them to make wrong assumptions to show margins. CFO is compliant and he prevents us from showing in board presentations large deal issues. Several billion-dollar deals of last few quarters have nil margin,"" the letter states.
In the letter, the complainants have asked the auditors to check deal proposals, margins, undisclosed upfront commitments made and revenue recognition. The letter further added that the complainants were asked to not fully recognise visa costs in the quarter and were pressured to not immediately recognise $50 million in reversals in a contract.
“In large contracts like Verizon, Intel, JVs in Japan, ABN AMRO acquisition, revenue recognition matters are forced, which are not as per accounting standards,"" the letter stated.
According to the letter, CEO Salil Parekh and CFO Nilanjan Roy were pressuring the finance team to show more profits in their treasury management. “In the board meetings, we were told not to present data on large deals and important financial measures as it will get board attention. CEO and CFO are asking us to show more profits in treasury by taking up risks and make changes to policies. This will provide short term profits,"" the letter stated."
125,2019-10-21,Infosys,"Infosys has said that the complaint has been sent to its audit committee

Just when stability seemed to have returned to Infosys after years of tumult, the company has been hit by a fresh controversy. Some of its employees have anonymously accused its CEO Salil Parekh and CFO Nilanjan Roy of “unethical accounting practices"". On 20 September, they reportedly first wrote to the board, alleging suppression of cost information in recent quarters. On 3 October, someone complained to the office of the Whistleblower Protection Program in the US.
Infosys has said that the complaint has been sent to its audit committee. According to the complainants, employees were asked not to fully recognize costs such as those incurred on visas during the relevant quarter. The alleged purpose was to portray higher profits and keep Infosys’s stock price buoyant. They also contend that the management put pressure on them not to officially note reversals of contractual payments worth $50 million.
While it’s good that Infosys has begun examining the charges, its own best interest would lie in a speedy investigation by a credible team. Shareholders had expected that all would be well at the firm after the bruising battle over its leadership was resolved in 2017. For decades, Infosys was regarded as not just a bellwether in the infotech services space, but also as an upholder of professional ethics and high standards of corporate governance. Its archrival, after all, has been Tata Consultancy Services, a Tata Group firm. Widely admired companies usually have the most to lose by the slightest whiff of scandal. The sooner we get to the bottom of this, the better."
104,2019-10-22,Infosys,"Law firm hired to independently examine claims made by whistleblowersAudit committee has begun consultations with internal auditors on terms of reference for an investigation

Mumbai/Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd on Tuesday scrambled to contain the fallout from allegations of accounting malpractices that sent its shares plunging the most in more than six years by engaging accounting firm EY and law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. to examine the claims made by whistleblowers.
In a statement, Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani said that the company’s audit committee began consultations with internal auditors on terms of reference for an investigation into the allegations after its 11 October board meeting while law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas was retained on 21 October to conduct a separate independent investigation.
To ensure an independent probe, Nilekani said chief executive Salil Parekh and chief financial officer Nilanjan Roy have been recused from this matter. “The board, in consultation with the audit committee, will take appropriate steps based on the outcome of the investigation,"" he said.
The move to start an independent investigation comes as investors dumped shares of Infosys. The company lost $7 billion in market value on Tuesday as it plummeted 16.2% to close at  ₹643.30, marking its steepest single-day drop since 12 April 2013.
The sharp fall in share price was not the only bad news for the Bengaluru-based software services company that is considered to be the gold standard for corporate governance in India.
On Tuesday, New York-based Rosen Law Firm said it is preparing a class action lawsuit to recover losses suffered by Infosys’s shareholders. The company’s American depository receipts had fallen 3.61% to $8.955 on the New York Stock Exchange at 9.55pm (IST).
The law firm said in a statement that it is investigating potential securities claims on behalf of shareholders of Infosys resulting from allegations that the company may have issued “materially misleading business information to the investing public.""
Analysts expect the allegations will remain an overhang on the Infosys stock.
“We expect the stock to be volatile till the company clarifies on these complaints,"" brokerage firm Motilal Oswal said in a note.
Analysts also fear that allegations of unethical accounting practices could lead to a de-rating of the stock.
“The key allegation is many recent large deals wins have negligible margins and revenue and cost recognition have not adhered to accounting norms to help improve near-term profitability. The issue is likely to remain an overhang pending further clarity,"" brokerage firm Jefferies said in a note on Tuesday.
To be sure, this is not the first time Infosys is dealing with a major whistleblower issue.
In 2017, a complaint emerged alleging irregularities in the $200 million acquisition of automation technology company Panaya. The episode eventually saw the exit of then CEO Vishal Sikka, although he was exonerated by the board after his departure from the company.
In 2013, Infosys agreed to pay $34 million to settle a civil lawsuit with the US government that charged it with visa fraud and errors in immigration records of its employees, triggered by a case filed by Jack Palmer, a former US-based employee, in 2011 in an Alabama court.
Hetal Dalal, chief operating officer at proxy advisory firm IiAS, said one will have to wait to see the impact of the allegations as their materiality has not been quantified yet.
“The disclosure of such a complaint is driven by how material the information is. Right now there are a bunch of allegations, but one does not how material these are. Further, there is no aggregate quantification of the allegations. The current board has experience in dealing with whistleblower letters,"" she said.
However, other proxy advisory firms said that a company’s disclosures on such events should not be restricted based on materiality of allegations since they point to important company policies such as accounting practices.
“Materiality is not the right measure when it comes to a policy matter. If accounting practices are being questioned, then materiality will be immaterial because you do not know what other policies too are not being followed,"" said J.N. Gupta, founder and managing director at Stakeholders Empowerment Services."
105,2019-10-22,Infosys,"On 21 October, the audit committee retained the law firm of Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas to conduct an independent investigationThe whistleblower complaints can be broadly categorized into three buckets

The recent whistleblower complaints have dented Infosys’s stellar reputation. Given the corporate governance issues at many Indian companies, investors have been paying a premium for companies with good corporate governance practices. Historically, Infosys held on to the highest standards in corporate governance, and seemed to have maintained its standing since the new CEO Salil Parekh took over in the second half of FY18.
The whistleblower complaints can be broadly categorized into three buckets. The first bucket comprises seemingly trivial complaints on the CEO’s travels and deductions on taxes. The second bucket relates to bidding for contracts with low or nil margin, which could be attributed to business decisions taken by the executive leadership, as long as they did not circumvent internal processes.
The third bucket is about over recognizing revenues, hiding costs and consequently boosting margins and profits. It has also been alleged that information was withheld from the auditors and the company’s board. The allegations of malpractices were also made against the CEO and the CFO Nilanjan Roy . This bucket of allegations is very grave and deserves the highest and urgent attention from the company. The whistleblowers also claim to have evidence, including emails and voice recordings. If auditors and the board were not presented the true picture, then the investors were also not presented the true picture. The trust that investors have on the numbers presented to them during the quarterly results will be broken. Infosys can ill afford such a loss of trust. Additionally, management bandwidth could be spent on defending class action suits.
It should be noted that the 2019 Stock Ownership Programme was approved by shareholders in June. Unlike the 2015 ESOP plan, which was time-vested, the 2019 stock vesting was purely performance-vested, linked to multiple performance metrics, mostly, total shareholder returns, revenue growth and operating margins. The 2015 time-vested stock incentive plans compensated employees even when the company was not performing well. It was thought that the 2019 performance-linked plan would ensure that stock ownership by employees based on company performance, would align with shareholders’ interests. From the 2019 Plan, the CEO was also granted restricted stock units (RSUs) with a value of  ₹10 crore per year. In the 2019 Plan, if the company underperformed, there was a possibility that no RSUs would be vested. 
The Nominations and Remuneration Committee had flexibility in determining the components of the performance parameters and also the number of RSUs vesting. If one were to seek out the motivating factors for why the senior management, including the CEO, would want to show enhanced revenue growth and higher margins, one needs to go through the details of the 2019 plan. The company seems to have acted in due process by bringing the whistleblower complaints to the notice of the audit committee, and after the board meeting of 11 October, the audit committee has consulted with EY, as the independent internal auditors, on terms of reference for the investigation. 
On 21 October, the audit committee retained the law firm of Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas to conduct an independent investigation. If one were to fault the company till now, it is on the tardy response to investors. The fact that it was the media and not that company that first reported the whistleblower complaints to investors will increase the scrutiny on the company. Investors will be expecting that the board act with greater alacrity and ensure that investigations are concluded quickly, and the results of the investigations are shared publicly. Investors also need to be assured that internal processes are robust to mitigate risks of misreporting and accounting malpractices, as they hope that Infosys will be able to come out of this storm unscathed.

106,2019-10-22,Infosys,"The software major has been rocked by whistleblower charges that need a probe. The company has initiated one. But its scope should include fresh questions that have arisen

Some two years ago, when Infosys Ltd. co-founder Nandan Nilekani returned to the company as chairman after the exit of then chief executive officer (CEO) Vishal Sikka amid concerns of corporate governance lapses, its shareholders thought the worst was behind them. Little did they expect half a trillion rupees of the software major’s market capitalization to be wiped out in a single day, as happened on Tuesday, the first day of domestic trading after it was rocked by allegations of scandalous behaviour at the top. No charge has been proven yet, but in the eye of the latest storm are its current CEO Salil Parekh and chief financial officer Nilanjan Roy. An anonymous complaint, purportedly filed by a group of employees by means of a letter to its board dated 20 September, accuses Parekh and Roy of demanding “unethical accounting practices"" designed to overstate quarterly profits and revenues and thereby prop up Infosys’s share price. Not only were accounts being fudged, the whistleblowers allege, but deprecatory words were also used by top executives for a few non-executive board members. In a statement issued on Tuesday, Nilekani said that Infosys had placed the letter before its audit committee, which had started consultations with an independent internal auditor to probe the matter.
What’s true and what’s false would take time to determine. However, given the high levels of transparency expected of Infosys, whose success is an integral part of India’s entrepreneurial story, it would be best if the investigation broadens its scope to include other questions that have arisen. While a delayed response to the blow of a whistle is understandable, since a large number of such incoming messages are frivolous, there is a long gap between the receipt of the complaint on 30 September by a board member, as Nilekani’s statement dates this event, and it being turned over to the audit committee, which was done on 10 October. Stock exchanges were informed even later, on 21 October. Prima facie, this seems to be in accordance with legal principles on how to proceed in such cases. The gravity of the charges was for Infosys to determine, and the firm has stated that it did not receive any corroborative material by way of emails or voice recordings. Yet, for the sake of investor confidence, the probe should examine whether its public disclosure took longer than it ought to have.
The timeline assumes importance for the reason that the information had the potential to influence the market price of the company’s stock. Moreover, all listed firms are required to keep the public informed of such developments. Delays create space for suspicions of insider trading. There has been some speculation among traders on social media over allegedly unusual positions taken on Infosys shares. Attention has been drawn to some put options—which let traders make gains off a price slide in the future—said to have been bought in advance. These could simply be part of a regular trading strategy, but if data patterns warrant a closer look, then these may need to be probed as well. It is not in the interest of Infosys shareholders alone to attain clarity on this episode. With its founders serving as role models for entrepreneurs across the country, every citizen qualifies as a stakeholder in this case. Infosys has bounced back from a crisis before and we expect it to do so again."
107,2019-10-22,Infosys,"Whistleblowers can blow the lid off corporate and financial scams, but does India have enough laws to protect them?

Whistleblowers are back in focus after the accusations against Infosys CEO Salil Parekh and other senior officials of indulging in irregular accounting. Whistleblowers can blow the lid off corporate and financial scams, but does India have enough laws to protect them?
How’s whistleblowing defined in India?
According to the Companies Act, 2013, whistleblowing is an action aimed at drawing the attention of stakeholders to instances of unethical practices in an organization. Under central law concerning allegations against public servants, it is a mechanism to receive complaints relating to alleged corruption or wilful misuse of power or discretion. A whistleblower can be anyone who chooses to expose wrong practices and has evidence to support the allegations. They can be either from within or outside the organization—such as current and former employees, shareholders, external auditors, and lawyers.
How does the law protect them?
In India, whistleblowers are protected by the Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2014. The law provides for the protection of their identity and also has strict norms to prevent their victimization. For instance, an organization cannot initiate proceedings against a whistleblower pending a probe into allegations. The same sections have been adopted in the Companies Act, which applies to listed companies, and are a part of the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s governance norms. All listed and public sector firms need to have a whistleblower policy that outlines procedures and recourses available to complainants.
What happens in case of frivolous complaints?
Whistleblowing may sometimes be used to settle personal vendettas or manipulate the stock market. To prevent this from occurring, the audit committee that investigates the allegations will examine them for their merit. If a complaint is proven to be frivolous, the complainant can face a jail term of up to two years.
What is Infosys’ track record on this?
In October 2013, Infosys agreed to an $8 million settlement offer by a US federal court after a former IT manager with the firm filed a whistleblower lawsuit against it. The manager alleged that he was sidelined and victimized by the firm’s top bosses after he refused an internal settlement offer. The episode showed the need for strict rules to protect whistleblowers. Subsequently, in 2014, Parliament approved the Whistle Blowers Protection Act. The Infosys board then amended its vigil mechanism in line with the new law.
What provisions does Sebi have?
India has a poor track record in dealing with insider trading. To improve success rates, the market regulator recently introduced a tipping mechanism. Sebi will award up to  ₹1 crore for information and successful action against insider traders. It has also created a “cooperate and confidentiality"" mechanism. This means that if someone guilty of violating securities law is willing to assist in the larger probe, the person will be given exemption from penal action and their identity will be kept confidential."
108,2019-10-22,Infosys,"An analyst had questioned Infosys about an unusual jump in unbilled revenues this yearThis is reflected in the rise in fixed-price projects, where revenue recognition norms are different

Infosys Ltd’s shares fell 16.2% on the National Stock Exchange on Tuesday, even after investors had a day to sleep over news of a whistleblower compliant that alleged aggressive accounting practices and attempts to blindside the board. A number of senior analysts covering the stock have refrained from putting out notes to clients on the development, saying that the content of the complaint letters can be categorised as hearsay at this point.
In that case, what explains the sharp drop in the company’s shares? To start with, the markets have been fragile, and investors now tend to act first and ask questions later. Besides, not so long ago, Infosys had a murky tussle between the board and management. So fears of a repeat were enough to hit investor sentiment.
But what about the charges regarding aggressive accounting? Do Infosys’s recent financial statements give any clues about this?
Interestingly, in the company's conference call with analysts earlier this month, an analyst had questioned the company about an unusual jump in unbilled revenues and whether there was a change in accounting policy. Unbilled revenue is revenue that is recognized before being billed to the client. In terms of incremental sales, unbilled revenues jumped to almost 24-25% in the first six months of this fiscal, compared to 10-11% in fiscal 2018-19, he pointed out in the call. One way to look at this is that it somewhat reflects the aggressive revenue recognition policies the whistleblower spoke about.
The company answered that there was no change in accounting policy, but that there were a few clients where there was a difference in timing with regards to revenue recognition and actual billing milestones reached for clients. This is true for all IT firms, and in Infosys’s case, it may be pronounced because the proportion of fixed price projects had risen to over 53% of revenues in FY19, from 49% in FY17. With large fixed price projects, the company exercises discretion on when to recognise revenues.
Besides, the company’s recent acquisitions such as HIPUS and Stater have higher receivables positions, and are bound to impact overall trade receivables of the company. But they also have high account payables, which nets out when it boils down to cash flow generation.
They key, then, is to check of the increase in accounts receivables and unbilled revenues is resulting in lower cash flow generation. Infosys’s conversion of net profits into free cash flow has remained fairly steady at about 79% in the first six months of this fiscal.
“If, as the complainant alleged, revenue recognition was inappropriate, this would have reflected in lower cash flow conversion ratios,"" says an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage.
From the available data, claims of malfeasance are exaggerated, most analysts say. The main worry for investors is the alleged attempt to hide information from the company’s board. Another tussle between the board and the top management is the last thing investors want for a company that has barely healed from a similar recent episode."

Shares of Infosys Ltd today crashed 16% to  ₹643.30 after India's No.2 software services exporter said it is investigating whistleblower claims accusing its top two executives of ""unethical practices"" to boost short-term profit. Today's crash wiped off  ₹53,452 crore from its market capitalisation. Infosys Chairman Nandan Nilekani said in a statement on Tuesday that the complaints were placed before the audit committee and the non-executive members of the board.
CEO Salil Parekh and CFO Nilanjan Roy have been recused from the matter to ensure an independent investigation, said Nilekani, who is credited for growing Infosys' annual revenue by four-fold to $2 billion during his 2002-2007 tenure as CEO.
The allegations could start a fresh storm at Infosys, which just two years ago endured a shake-up that saw its then CEO Vishal Sikka leave after a public battle with founders.
""Infosys is the blue-eyed boy as far as corporate governance is concerned... two complaints in two years could shake investor confidence, at least temporarily,"" said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities.
The accusations come days after Infosys raised its full-year revenue guidance on upbeat client demand and said it signed $2.8 billion worth of large deals in the September quarter, helping margin grow by 120 basis points from the previous quarter.
Infosys, whose more than 1,300 clients include Intel Corp and Verizon Communications Inc, also reported a forecast-beating operating profit margin of 21.7%, or 100 basis points higher than analysts' average estimate by Refinitiv.
Another of the complaints ""largely deals with allegations relating to the CEO's international travel to the U.S. and Mumbai,"" Nilekani added.

113,2019-10-22,Infosys,"A break from the glare of public markets would help Infosys refocus

India’s best-known software exporter is facing an impossible trinity of sorts: Out of sales, margins and governance, Infosys Ltd. can hit only two goals at a time.
Or so it would appear from yet-to-be-proven whistle-blower allegations against Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh and Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy that they used hyper-aggressive accounting practices to hide from investors the lack of profitability on large deals. The stock tanked as much as 16% in Mumbai after the letter was published by the Deccan Herald. 
It’s a deja vu moment for co-founder and non-executive Chairman Nandan Nilekani, who returned to the Bangalore-based company two years ago during a previous crisis — sparked by a set of different anonymous charges against Parekh’s predecessor, the former SAP executive Vishal Sikka, who was accused of impropriety in a $200 million acquisition in Israel.
That scandal culminated in an unseemly spat between Sikka and the board on one side and N.R. Narayana Murthy, another of the company’s co-founders, on the other. Sikka resigned in August 2017. The new board exonerated him, but by then the damage was done.
It’s been a slow road to recovery. At a one-year-forward price-to-earnings multiple of 20 times at the end of September, Infosys’s valuation is now almost 50% higher than at the depth of the last crisis. The risk is of a repeat of that slump.
If investors start to believe that the culture at the software services provider, once seen as India’s most transparent company, is beyond redemption, expect a durable deepening of the 10% discount at which Infosys traded against larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., or TCS, at the end of last month. Since the company’s American depository receipts trade in New York, there’s also the threat of expensive class-action suits.
The allegations are being evaluated by the audit committee and the board. The CEO and the CFO won’t be a part of those deliberations. Whatever the truth of the whistle-blower’s complaints, another protracted governance saga could be just as damaging.
It might not be a bad idea for a buyout fund to step in and take Infosys out of the glare of the public markets. As a private company, it could rediscover its moorings and find a new purpose in a digital world where clients increasingly want nimble, cloud-based, on-demand software, rather than clunky, on-premise enterprise solutions.
At $12 billion in the fiscal year that ended in March, Infosys revenue is nowhere close to Sikka's 2020 target of $20 billion. An operating margin of less than 23% was lower than the near 26% at TCS, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
After a period of rehabilitation, Infosys should be able to deliver all three targets: sales growth, margins and good governance. Some private time could be just what it needs to get fixed."
109,2019-10-22,Infosys,"An anonymous employees’ group has accused the management, mainly CEO Salil Parekh and CFO Nilanjan Roy, of unethical accounting practicesSimilar issues had unfolded nearly 3 years ago when the firm’s promoters had blamed the board including former CEO Vishal Sikka for misgovernance

Whistleblower complaints, lapses in corporate governance and internal conflicts are not new to Asia’s second largest IT-services firm Infosys Ltd. An anonymous employees’ group has accused the management, mainly chief executive Salil Parekh and chief financial officer Nilanjan Roy, of unethical accounting practices. Similar issues had unfolded nearly three years ago when the company’s promoters had blamed the board including former CEO Vishal Sikka for misgovernance.
Tension between the then management and founding promoters had mounted after whistleblower complaints made various allegations ranging from the $200 million acquisition of Israeli automation company Panaya in February 2015 being overvalued to top executives having personal interests in the acquisition. Large severance packages of former chief financial officer (CFO) Rajiv Bansal and former chief legal officer David Kennedy and a 55% hike in Sikka’s compensation had heightened the conflict.
Here is a timeline of the events that took place in 2016 and 2017 at Infosys:
August 2017: CEO Vishal Sikka resigns, ending a prolonged rift between the company’s board and promoter shareholders led by N.R. Narayana Murthy over issues of poor governance practices.
July: In an email to the board, Murthy asks if the company could categorically say that no employee or a relative of the employee benefited from Infosys’ decision to spend $200 million to buy Panaya.
June: Law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher submits a report to the board concluding that there was no evidence of any Infosys executive profiting from the decision to buy Panaya in February 2015.
April: Infosys names Ravi Venkatesan as co-chairman and appoints a three-member panel to advise Sikka. This made Sikka unhappy as he had a tough working relationship with Venkatesan on the board.
February: Non-executive chairman R. Seshasayee says there is no conflict of interest between the founders and the board. Sikka clarifies that talks in the media on concerns over corporate governance were “distracting"" and that he has good relations with the founders including Murthy.
February: Murthy reportedly calls off fight with the board, saying the company will resolve issues of corporate governance. Murthy in an interview to the Economic Times says large financial deals given to exiting senior employees “raise doubts whether the company is using such payments as hush money to hide something"". He also speaks of “a concerning drop in governance standards at Infosys"".
January: Board inducts independent director D.N. Prahlad into the nomination and remuneration committee (NRC) that oversees the nomination process, incentives and pay offered to its senior executives, even the CEO. Prahlad, a relative of Murthy, is one of the five members of the NRC.
December 2016: Founders including Murthy, S.D. Shibulal and Kris Gopalakrishnan have a meeting with Seshasayee and Sikka. The founders expressed their concerns over corporate governance issues.
October: Infosys appoints D.N. Prahlad, a former employee, as an independent director on the company’s board. The appointment did not go down well with proxy advisory firms.
September: Infosys discontinues remaining installments of severance payment of  ₹17.38 crore to former CFO Rajiv Bansal after some of the company’s founders express unhappiness.
May: Infosys pays  ₹23.02 crore as severance, pay, salary and other benefits to former CFO Bansal, drawing criticism for awarding an unusually high compensation to an outgoing executive.
April: Only 23.57% of promoter votes cast in favour of a resolution reappointing Sikka as the chief executive of Infosys. He is the first non-founder CEO of Infosys appointed in 2014 for a five-year term.
February: Infosys board decides to reward Sikka with a 55% rise in compensation package to $11 million, making the founder promoters extremely discontent with the decision."

Mumbai: Infosys Ltd on Tuesday saw its market capitalistion erode by over $6 billion or  ₹43,925 crore after a whistleblower complaint accused the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer of unethical accounting practices.
The stock slumped 16%, marking its biggest single-day fall since 12 April, 2013, and touched a low of  ₹645 — a level last seen on 26 December, 2018.
The complaint, dated 20 September, follows more such complaints that led to the exit of previous CEO Vishal Sikka.

""Indian companies enjoy a lower rating on valuations due to mis-governance and Infosys will be also see itself in the list following the development. Auditors in India have recently been under lens for not being true and fair and such developments will on top rated company have an overall impact across the spectrum"", analyst said on a condition of anonymity.
An anonymous letter sent to the company’s board and the US Securities and Exchange Commission has alleged suppression of information related to visa costs. All this, to show higher profits and keep Infosys’s stock price buoyant. The letter also contends employees were pressed not to record reversals of contractual payments to the company worth $50 million.
""Very serious news indeed. This equates to a corporate governance issue. Deputy CFO has also quit. This in itself is an indirect admission that something is rotten"", said Harit Shah, research analyst at Reliance Securities. Shah expects stock to now fall 10-15% in the near term and has a ‘hold’ rating on the stock.
""While we await developments on the board investigation, given that it is so widely held, it is very likely that some investors will vote with their feet and sell at least some of their holdings. The market is very unforgiving of companies that have corporate governance issues and while it would not be fair to directly jump to conclusions, this issue appears quite ugly at least on the surface"", Shah added.
In a clarification to exchanges on Tuesday, chairman Nandan Nilekani said the company has placed both the complaints before an audit committee and before the non-executive members of the board. CEO Salil Parekh and CFO Nilanjan Roy have been recused from the matter.
""The Audit Committee has now retained the law firm of Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. (October 21, 2019), to conduct an independent investigation. The Board, in consultation with the Audit Committee, will take such steps as may be appropriate based on the outcome of the investigation,"" Nilekani said.
""Because the investigation is ongoing, there will be no further comment so that investigation may be conducted in a thorough and objective manner. At the appropriate time we will provide a summary of the investigations results. The Board is committed to uphold highest standard of corporate governance and protect the interests of all stakeholders,"" Nilekani added."
123,2019-10-22,Infosys,"Board yet to give adequate response to whistleblower’s 20 September complaintComplaint claims top management asked some employees to hide information from directors and auditors

For Infosys Ltd, it is more a case of being guilty until proven innocent, rather than innocent until proven guilty. A whistleblower complaint against the company, alleging unethical practices to boost short-term revenue, has led to a massive sell-off in the company’s American depositary receipts (ADRs). On the New York Stock Exchange, Infosys ADRs fell 15% to $8.95 in early trading on Monday.
News reports say the whistleblower complaint was sent to the company’s board on 20 September. Still, the board has no adequate response yet for investors after a month has passed. All the company said in a statement to the stock exchanges is that the complaint has been placed before the audit committee and will be dealt with in accordance with its whistleblower policy.
“The lack of a detailed response from the company is a concern, especially since it’s been a month since the complaint was filed,"" said an analyst at a multinational brokerage, requesting anonymity. With the Infosys board shying away from instilling confidence, it’s natural that investors feel jittery. 
﻿Update: Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani has released a statement on Tuesday morning on the whistleblower compliant.
Infosys shares, however, were still trading about 13% on the National Stock Exchange at 10:00 IST.
Another big worry is that the complaint states the company’s top management asked some employees to hide certain information from directors and auditors. The complainant also claims to have emails and voice recordings to substantiate the claims.
“If there is some element of truth to this claim about withholding information from the company’s board, it will create a huge wall of mistrust between the top management and the board,"" said another analyst from a multinational brokerage.
This can be a huge negative, as a smooth relationship between the board and its management is critical to the smooth functioning of a company. Regardless of whether there were unethical practices at the company, the aspect of withholding information itself creates a lack of trust within the organization that can be counterproductive.
The charges pertain largely to aggressive accounting norms allegedly used by the company to mask zero profitability in some recent large deals, which were signed with the sole purpose of boosting revenue.
Some large investors may give Infosys the benefit of doubt, and brush off the allegations of a low-margin or a no-margin deal with a client as purely a business decision.
“If the company management is comfortable kick-starting revenue growth through an aggressively priced deal, that is purely a business decision, and can’t be seen as malfeasance,"" said an analyst at a local brokerage, also requesting anonymity.
As the chart shows, Infosys’s valuations have caught up with that of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd in the past year and a half. Apart from TCS, Infosys is the only other IT services stock that trades at valuations of over 20 times earnings. One reason for this is that Infosys’s growth rates have picked up this year. The second reason is the fair degree of comfort investors have about the company’s corporate governance policies and practices.
In order to ensure the whistleblower complaint doesn’t deal a major blow to this perception, the company’s board should act quickly in addressing investors’ concerns."
122,2019-10-22,Infosys,"It’s good that Infosys has begun a probe. Its best interest lies in a speedy investigation by a credible team

Just when stability seemed to have returned, Infosys has been hit by a fresh controversy. A few of its employees have accused CEO Salil Parekh and CFO Nilanjan Roy of “unethical accounting practices"". An anonymous letter sent to the board has alleged suppression of cost information in recent quarters. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has also been informed. The employees claim they were asked not to fully recognize costs such as those incurred on visas. All this, to show higher profits and keep Infosys’s stock price buoyant. They also contend they were pressed not to record reversals of contractual payments to the company worth $50 million.
It’s good that Infosys has begun a probe. Its best interest lies in a speedy investigation by a credible team. Shareholders had expected that all would be well after the bruising battle over its leadership was resolved in 2017. For decades, Infosys was regarded as not just a bellwether in the IT space, but also as an upholder of professional ethics and good governance. Widely admired companies usually have the most to lose by the slightest whiff of a scandal. The sooner we get to the bottom of this one, the better."

BANGALORE :
Infosys Ltd.’s shares plunged to a 10-month low in New York after whistle-blowers accused Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh of leading an effort to shore up profits through irregular accounting, turning up the heat on an IT services giant that endured internal turmoil just two years ago.
The letter, addressed to the board and published by the Deccan Herald, charged Parekh with “unethical practices"" to boost revenues and profit in recent quarters, anonymous whistle-blowers wrote in a memo titled “Disturbing unethical practices."" They asked the board to investigate and take immediate action, offering to provide emails and voice recordings to support their allegations. Infosys said in a statement its Audit Committee will look into the accusations and handle the matter in accordance with policy. Its American Depositary Receipts slid more than 12%, their biggest single-day fall since 2013.
The complaint dated September 20 is the latest in a series of whistle-blower complaints that wrought havoc at Asia’s second-most valuable IT services firm, triggering the exit of previous CEO Vishal Sikka after a confrontation with co-founder Narayana Murthy. The company, a symbol of India’s early technological boom, had gained more than 15% of market value this year as it stabilized the business with a transition toward automation. Chairman and co-founder Nandan Nilekani had only just proclaimed last year that Infosys had become “boring again.""
The allegations “could severely damage the company’s pristine brand if true, especially in the IT services industry,"" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana wrote. “It could also hurt short-term sales, as clients may look for other providers for newer projects.""
The allegations come as Infosys and larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., which build software and provide services to some of the world’s largest banks and retailers, navigate an increasingly difficult business environment. The industry is grappling with a trend toward automation and rapid technology changes.
This month, Infosys posted a 2% fall in quarterly profit after nervous clients held off on spending and growth in traditional service contracts stalled. That underscored the challenge for Parekh, who has pledged to drive growth in digital services, re-energize core offerings, re-skill employees and hire locally in a key U.S. market where a tightening H-1B visa regime is making it more difficult to import labor. Tata Consultancy also posted earnings that lagged projections.
“The whistle-blower complaint has been placed before the Audit Committee as per the company’s practice and will be dealt with in accordance with the company’s whistle-blowers policy,"" Infosys said in an emailed statement.

Shares of Infosys Ltd slumped 15% after an anonymous whistleblower letter alleged that the company’s chief executive officer Salil Parekh dressed up the company’s books — accusations that could plunge the software services provider into its second leadership-related crisis in a little over two years.
""Our analysis suggests that some of the aforementioned claims are not justified by the publicly available data. Nonetheless we expect the stock to be volatile till the company clarifies on these complaints. More importantly as happened in the past with such issues, this could arrest the re-rating that had started recently post solid operational performance in trailing 12 months and could potentially lead to lower target multiples in the interim,"" Motilal Oswal Research said in a 21 October report.
""As of now we maintained our stance/estimates and await further clarity on the outcome of the audit committee's investigation,"" the report added.
Other IT stocks also fell. HCL Technologies fell 3.7%, Tech Mahindra declined 1.7% and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd dropped 0.4%.
ICICI Bank rose 4% to hit an all-time high as analyst expect nearly a $1-billion inflow into the private lender on account of a likely increase in its weight on the MSCI Index. Motilal Oswal expects ICICI Bank’s weight in the world’s largest index compiler to increase to 6% from 3%, attracting an overseas inflow of $1.2 billion.

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Wednesday.
Infosys: Shares of the IT-services major may extend Tuesday’s losses and trade in the red because of concerns over accounting malpractices at the top executive level. The stock had plunged 16% after a whistleblower complaint flagged the management’s involvement in unethical practices to boost profit, raising questions over misgovernance.
Axis Bank: The bank posted its September quarter earnings on Tuesday. The private lender reported an unexpected net loss of  ₹112.1 crore for the September quarter due to a one-time income tax adjustment. A Bloomberg estimate had pegged the bank’s profit at  ₹905 crore for the quarter.
HAL: The Indian Air Force (IAF) is likely to sign a deal with Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL)to acquire 83 Tejas Light Combat Aircraft as negotiations over the price of the aircraft have reached their fag end. According to an IANS report, the IAF had issued a single vendor tender to HAL in December 2017 for procuring 83 aircraft.
Bajaj Auto: The two and three wheeler manufacturing company will release its earnings for July-September today. Uncertainty around no-deal Brexit and consequent concerns over disruption in supply chains have kept shares of the firm under pressure.
Biocon: The pharmaceutical company will announce its results for the quarter ended September. Recently, its wholly-owned subsidiary Biocon Biologics and Evotec-owned Just-Evotec Biologics entered into a strategic licensing agreement for an early-stage and pre-clinical biosimilar asset.
JSW Steel: The steelmaker will report its earnings for the September quarter today. It is largely expected to report a fall in profit during the quarter. The company, which acquired Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL) last month, challenged the Enforcement Directorate’s move to attach assets of BPSL in a bank loan fraud case.
HCL Tech: The company will announce its earnings for the second quarter today. According to brokerage firm Motilal Oswal, HCL Technologies Ltd is expected to report a net profit of Rs. 2,521 crore, marginally down from a year ago.
OBC: The state-owned bank announced its results for the September quarter on Tuesday. It posted net profit of  ₹125.9 crore, up 23% on year, as fewer new loan accounts turned bad and on account of a rise in net interest margin. Bad loans declined due to lower fresh slippages.
Hotel Leelaventure: Hospitality firm Hotel Leelaventure Ltd on Tuesday said it has completed sale of its hotel properties and operations to Canada-based Brookfield Asset Management Inc. The  ₹3950-crore deal also marks the entry of Brookfield in India’s hospitality market in a big way.
Bharti Infratel: The company on Tuesday reported a 61% year-on-year jump in net profit in the second quarter due to a change in accounting standard which lowered the operating costs and a higher net finance income. Separately, chairman Akhil Gupta said lack of a key government approvals has held up the proposed merger between Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers."
94,2019-10-23,Infosys,"During the around 3-year tenure of Vishal Sikka, investor wealth grew 7.61% to  ₹2.12 trillion from  ₹1.97 trillionDuring this period Parekh earned  ₹16.25 crore in cash, made up of a fixed salary of  ₹6.5 crore and a variable pay of up to  ₹9.75 crore

Shareholder wealth at Infosys has risen by 23.45% to  ₹2.79 trillion from  ₹2.26 trillion since January 2018, when Salil Parekh took over as the managing director and chief executive officer (CEO).
During this period Parekh earned  ₹16.25 crore in cash, made up of a fixed salary of  ₹6.5 crore and a variable pay of up to  ₹9.75 crore. Plus, there’s an annual grant of  ₹3.25 crore in stocks, a third of which will be vested every year over the next three years, and an annual performance equity grant of  ₹13 crore which will be paid depending upon Infosys’s performance according to filings.
Now, Parekh is accused in an anonymous whistleblower complaint of fudging company profitability by misreporting performance numbers.
Parekh, who was appointed for a five-year term, was given the task of returning the company’s focus on revenue growth and business strategy. In the last 21 months, from January 2018 to September 2019, Infosys’s revenue grew 27.17% from  ₹17,794 crore in the quarter ended December 2017 to  ₹22,629 crore in the quarter ended September 2019. Operating profit also grew 13.73% to  ₹4,912 crore from  ₹4,319 crore during the same period. However, profit after tax during his tenure dropped 21.64% from  ₹5,129 crore to  ₹4,019 crore.
During the around three-year tenure of Vishal Sikka, Infosys’s first non-co-founder CEO, investor wealth grew 7.61% to  ₹2.12 trillion from  ₹1.97 trillion. During this period revenue grew 33.74% from  ₹12,770 crore for the quarter ended June 2014 to  ₹17,078 crore for the June 2017 quarter. Operating profit also grew 28.03% to  ₹4,111 crore from  ₹3,211 crore, while profit after tax rose 20.69% from  ₹2,886 crore to  ₹3,483 crore.
Significantly, unlike the 2015 employee stock ownership plan for Sikka, which was time-vested, Parekh’s incentives were made performance-linked under a stock ownership programme approved by shareholders in June 2019. Infosys said in May that to retain talent its board had approved a series of performance-based incentives for its employees. The board also approved stock incentives for Parekh and chief operating officer U.B. Pravin Rao, which included the ‘Expanded Stock Ownership Program 2019’ that proposed to allocate 50 million shares to incentivize employees based on performance, accounting for about 1.15% of the equity share capital of the company.
Infosys said Parekh will be granted annual performance-based stock incentives in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) worth  ₹10 crore under the 2019 plan. Infosys proposes to grant Rao annual performance-based stock incentives in the form of RSUs worth  ₹4 crore that will vest 12 months from the date of each grant."
98,2019-10-23,Infosys,"The management of Infosys Ltd has been accused of taking 'unethical' steps to boost short-term revenue and profits, by an anonymous group calling itself 'ethical employees'

The sharp fall in the share price of Infosys following allegations of accounting malpractices at the behest of the software exporter’s top leadership has drawn the attention of India’s market regulator. While the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) says it will await the findings of the company’s internal audit committee, it has reportedly taken a suo motu cognizance of a large build-up of put options—a contract that gives the holder the right to sell a share at a pre-set price at a certain point in the future—on Infosys stock. This market position was reportedly taken just before the whistleblower letter sent by a group of people who signed off as “ethical employees"" became public.
The allegations of dodgy accounting practices surfaced on 21 October, when Indian financial markets were shut. However, reports suggest put options had been secured on 1.8 million shares at a strike price of  ₹740 on 18 October, when the scrip closed at  ₹767.75. When trading resumed on Tuesday, Infosys shares crashed by about 16% to close at a little over 643 apiece. This means that the holder(s) of those put options could have made nearly  ₹97 per share as a profit, had they exercised the contractual option of selling Infy shares to the trade’s counterparties on Tuesday—since the shares, at their lowest, were selling for that much less money.
The sheer size of that bet, at 1.8 million shares, arouses suspicion. It could have been just a regular bet on Infy falling, which would be legitimate, though the company had just raised its revenue guidance. But it’s hard not to wonder if insider trading was involved. Did the allegations leak? Was it, perchance, an act of internal sabotage for financial gains? The whole episode deserves a good hard look."

100,2019-10-23,Infosys,"For the second time in about as many years, Infosys is being forced to answer accusations of improprietyInfosys has pledged a full investigation

The dust had barely settled at Infosys Ltd. when Asia’s No. 2 software services firm once more found itself grappling with a potential leadership crisis.
For the second time in about as many years, the Indian icon synonymous with the country’s technological ascendancy is being forced to answer accusations of impropriety. In the most recent of a stream of grievances aired anonymously over past years, whistle-blowers accused Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh of instigating employees to inflate profits, mis-represent the lucrativeness of deals, even of abusing travel privileges. In a memo reproduced in local newspapers, Parekh’s accusers offered emails and recordings to back up their claims.
Little evidence of wrong-doing has emerged publicly so far. Infosys pledged a full investigation Tuesday, while Parekh himself has remained silent. Yet investors blind-sided by the sheer volume of the charges wiped more than $7 billion off the company’s market value in a single day. They may still be smarting from 2017, when internal upheaval eventually sparked an ouster of the popular Vishal Sikka, paving the way for Parekh’s ascension and a board reshuffle.
“The allegations appear serious and reputation is such a fragile thing,"" said Harish Bijoor, a Bangalore-based brand consultant. “It is very unfortunate but this type of thing besmirches a company’s reputation in the eyes of employees, investors and clients.""
The Indian government is closely monitoring the issue but it’s too early to initiate a probe of the company, an official told reporters in New Delhi, asking not to be identified citing rules.
The events unfolding in Infosys’s home-town of Bangalore, the nation’s tech capital, bear a resemblance to those of 2017 that brought down the tech giant’s leadership. Two summers ago, a similar whistle-blower complaint alleged irregularities in a $200 million acquisition, setting off a chain of events that culminated in a vicious face-off with co-founder Narayana Murthy and Sikka’s removal. The accusations against him were never proven.
Sikka and Parekh, a former Capgemini SE executive, were the first outside professionals brought in to run the 38-year-old company, after several decades of co-founders taking turns to occupy the CEO’s office. Infosys’s shares have gained 50% since Parekh took the helm in January 2018, versus roughly 20% over Sikka’s three-year term. And the company’s revenue grew about 25% during both their tenures.
Yet the number of whistle-blower complaints spiked during Sikka’s and Parekh’s reigns, covering a plethora of topics. None spooked markets quite as much as the latest missive published in the Deccan Herald on Monday. The company is now taking the right steps, auditing the whistle-blowers’ letters and appointing a third-party investigator, said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief executive officer of Singapore-based Greyhound Research.
“The CEO has a difficult task at hand coming after the sudden exit of his predecessor, managing founder and investor expectations and operating in a difficult business environment,"" he said. “The world over, companies take a ton of short cuts to look good in front of investors and analysts.""
The brewing crisis around Infosys is far from the only one to hit corporate India of late. State-run lender Punjab National Bank disclosed fraud, for instance, part of a series of scandals to hit the financial industry.
Infosys itself can ill-afford the distraction. It’s grappling with fundamental changes in the software outsourcing industry, where younger rivals are snatching away contracts with newer technologies, and clients are moving away from the paid-by-the-hour outsourcing work that Infosys and rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. specialized in.
At Infosys, revenue growth slowed to single-digit percentages, while operating margins shrank. That marked the end of an era when its co-founders delivered stellar performances quarter after quarter, endearing the stock to investors. Fresh-out-of-college engineers compared a job offer from Infosys to winning the lottery.
This month, Infosys posted a 2% fall in quarterly profit after nervous clients held off on spending and growth in traditional service contracts stalled. That underscored the challenge for Parekh, who has pledged to drive growth.
Both he and Sikka have stressed investments in innovation, digital services and re-training employees in latest technologies such as automation and artificial intelligence. “To build the future Infosys, we have to make those investments now,"" Parekh, who has a reputation for being calm and understated, told Bloomberg in an interview last year.
It could be days or weeks before evidence is gathered and the investigation concludes. Until then, the allegations cast a shadow over Infosys’s management. And it’s likely that the urgent task of addressing broader business challenges will take a backseat to the public drama for now.
“There’s a lot of emotion around everything that happens at Infosys,"" Greyhound’s Gogia said. “While I would wait for the investigation before passing a verdict on the anonymous charges, this episode does make things tougher for Infosys.""

Indian markets wobbled in early trade with Sensex down about 40 points while Nifty was near 11,575. Banking stocks supported the market with Axis Bank shares up 2%. Infosys shares fell 3% in early trade, extending their Tuesday's 16% loss.
Private lender Axis Bank on Tuesday reported a healthy second quarter performance. Though the bank reported a net loss of  ₹112 crore for the quarter ended September 30, it was driven by a one-time tax impact of  ₹2,138 crore due to changes in corporate tax rate. Adjusted for this extraordinary item, net profit of Axis Bank would have been  ₹2,026 crore, up 157% year on year. Profit before tax for Q2 grew 109% year-on-year to  ₹2,433 crore from  ₹1,167 crores in Q2 FY19.
""Technically, Nifty has established a higher bottom - higher top series and strategy should be to buy into strong companies if market corrects to major supports like 11550 and 11500. On the higher side, 11720 would be the ultimate resistance and if that hurdle is crossed, Nifty would start trending downwards to 12000,"" says Shrikant Chouhan, Senior Vice-President, Equity Technical Research, Kotak Securities.
The global cues are weak with most Asian markets trading lower today. Overnight, the Wall Street fell 0.36%. Uncertainty on the Brexit front continued.

""Considering that the complaint was not made to Sebi, it has taken suo motu cognisance of it.

96,2019-10-24,Infosys,"Class action lawsuit is a case brought to the court by a group representing a much larger set of people who have suffered damages

Infosys risks facing a class action lawsuit in the US after whistleblower allegations of accounting malpractices pulled down the firm’s stock and erased billions of dollars in market capitalization. Such suits serve to protect the interests of many people. Mint explores the concept.
1) What is a class action lawsuit?
It is a case brought to court by a group representing a larger set of people, often in thousands, who have suffered the same loss. The accused in such cases usually are corporate entities or governments. Generally, in class action suits, the damages paid may be small at an individual level or may not even be quantifiable. The total damages calculated, however, could be large. As many people might have been harmed either because of negligence on the part of the accused or deliberate intent, a small group of people coming together and collectively raising funds to fight a case enables justice for all.

1) What is a class action lawsuit?
It is a case brought to court by a group representing a larger set of people, often in thousands, who have suffered the same loss. The accused in such cases usually are corporate entities or governments. Generally, in class action suits, the damages paid may be small at an individual level or may not even be quantifiable. The total damages calculated, however, could be large. As many people might have been harmed either because of negligence on the part of the accused or deliberate intent, a small group of people coming together and collectively raising funds to fight a case enables justice for all.
2) What are the benefits of such a suit?
An immediate benefit is that the court has to hear only one case and not several. This reduces the chance of similar cases clogging the already overburdened courts. Besides, as not everyone has the means or time to pursue a legal case, a small group of people with funds or the ability to raise money can bring justice to other victims who may be disadvantaged. Companies are reluctant to face such suits as it affects their brand image. They prefer settling such cases faster to minimize the damage to their reputation. An advantage for the accused parties, however, is that they have to deal with only one case.
3) What are the challenges a class action faces?
The first challenge in such cases is proving that the accused’s action did inflict the same damage on as many people as claimed in the suit. Proving guilt can be arduous. The case can also suffer from poor representation of the matter by the main plaintiff who is arguing for the affected. Besides, class action suits can drag on for years.
4) What are the famous class action cases?
The US is the Mecca of class action lawsuits. The biggest settlement ever made in the world—$206 billion over 30 years—was one cigarette makers such as Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds agreed on in the country in 1998 to fund smoking-related treatments. It wasn’t strictly a class action lawsuit but merits the classification because of the penalty size. A similar case was BP’s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. BP paid $7.8 billion to individuals, besides more than double that sum in fines to various US agencies.
5) Could Infosys be sued in the US?
US-based Rosen Law Firm is preparing a class action lawsuit to recover losses of Infosys investors. The company says it will defend itself against any suit. Sandeep Parekh, managing partner at Finsec Law Advisors, feels strength of evidence will determine if Infosys can be sued, though in issues like revenue recognition, it’s usually a difficult task as there is a lot of leeway to determine when revenue is recognized. However, he fears aggressive US lawyers pursuing civil liability could create a distracting litigation for the firm."

“I cannot comment on the truth of the claim, but it is certainly denting the image of Infosys,"" he added.
The whistleblower allegations also claimed that the complainants were pressured to not immediately recognize reversals of $50 million of upfront payment in the FDR (First Tier, Downstream and Related Entities) contract, as it would crimp quarterly profit and negatively affect the company’s stock price. However, a former board member of Infosys said on condition of anonymity that the allegations do not have much merit as it is impossible for a company like Infosys “to hide financial numbers of such magnitude"".
The whistleblowers alleged that Parekh directed them to make wrong assumptions to show higher margins and CFO Roy prevented them from showing the real picture about the large deals in board presentations.
“Several billion-dollar deals of last few quarters have nil margin…In large contracts like Verizon, Intel, JVs in Japan, ABN AMRO acquisition, revenue recognition matters are forced, which are not as per accounting standards...,"" the letter read.
During the quarter ended 30 June, Infosys announced 13 large contracts worth $2.7 billion that included the deal with ABN AMRO."
92,2019-10-24,Infosys,"What does a controversial event mean for a company and why does that even matter?

The year 2019 has been full of corporate controversies turning into crises, with each worth a complete film script. The Yes Bank controversy with Rana Kapoor’s resignation in January; the Jet Airways crisis in March; the Indigo promoters’ spat in May; Indiabulls Housing Finance in June; the suicide of Coffee Day Enterprise’s founder in July; Punjab & Maharashtra Co-operative Bank, Thomas Cook and Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd in September; the action-packed arrest of Malvinder Singh of Ranbaxy, Religare and Fortis in October’ and now the whistle-blower episode of Infosys—each of these could be a textbook example of crisis and reputation management.
What does a controversial event mean for a company and why does that even matter?
Events of this scale do not merely remain episodes with temporary reactions displayed through stock price movements. They have the potential to impact the long-term reputation of a company, influencing the broader business. Reputation is an emotional concept and emotions rule human behaviour. Thus, it is essential for companies to take cognizance of and be highly responsive to any such development.
Each stakeholder reacts (not responds) differently. Investor and analyst reactions are most evident in share prices and equity research report calls. The media gets into heavy coverage, while regulatory enquiries begin, the board springs to action and employees battle insecurity. All these have an undertone of an emotional response.
When the story is about brands like Infosys, the ire is greater, thanks to the connect stakeholders feel with it. The company sailed through a mega-crisis just two years ago, when Vishal Sikka, its then chief executive officer (CEO), moved out amid differences with its founders. Another management-led controversy was the last thing the brand might be expecting. Whistle-blowers alleging unethical practices in financial management is a serious concern. Many are lauding the company for its swift and clear response. It issued a statement with specifics. It acknowledged the receipt of the whistle-blowers’ letter, discussed the matter at a board meeting, instituted an independent inquiry and had its CEO Salil Parekh, as well as chief financial officer Nilanjan Roy, recuse themselves from this investigation.
Yet, many others are questioning the delay and the unclear timeline for the probe’s conclusion. This no-deadline kind of investigation increases uncertainty, despite a firm’s best intentions. Plus, even though the company is responding systematically, the risk to its reputation still hangs in the air. If the allegations are proven right, then the reputational damage would be obvious. But even if proven wrong, doubt could be sown in the minds of stakeholders. Customers will want to put the company to deeper scrutiny, and investors, regulators and other stakeholders will harbour lingering worries.
So, what should organizations do in such cases? With empowered and informed stakeholders, risks like whistle-blower complaints are real. Organizations have to recognize these risks, plan in advance, and act swiftly. As a first step, it is essential to create a strong narrative with believable proof points. Controlling the narrative is the most important part of crisis management. Long after the crisis is forgotten, when someone googles the brand name, if the search points to news clips of the crisis period, then it’s clear its reputation has been hit hard. Also, with mobile journalism, various versions of the episode could float around, adding fuel to the fire. Clarity in the narrative enables consistent messaging that balances varied opinions with the company’s perspective.
Second, the company must engage and leverage employees as its brand champions. Whenever controversy surrounds an organization, outsiders often ask its employees about it. More often than not, they are clueless and hence offer responses that are limited by their understanding. This results in the company losing an opportunity to control the narrative. If a firm shares its response with employees, along with points, then it could take a position in popular mindspace that is authentic and able to overcome rumour-based beliefs.
The classic example that comes to mind is the Tata-Mistry crisis. Cyrus Mistry’s sudden ouster created a sense of disbelief around the Tata brand. I recall asking many Tata employees about the development and most said that they had no idea what was happening; all seemed fine to them, and they got updates from newspapers, like any of us. Both their body language and tone reflected disappointment and a marred sense of belonging. In contrast, when Thomas Cook India was battling its crisis of association with Thomas Cook, UK, I called quite a few Thomas Cook outlets and also met a few employees to get a sense of their disposition. Believe it or not, everyone gave a scripted response—that Thomas Cook India is a separate entity owned by Fairfax, Canada. The company had masterfully leveraged employees as brand champions. Coupled with consistent communication through multiple channels, it saw the firm through.
Negative news spares no company. How the company engages key stakeholders to tell its side of the story is what matters. In the case of Infosys, since the current crisis originated with employees (as the whistle-blowers claim to be), it is all the more reason for the software major to work closely with its people to control the narrative and protect, or perhaps even enhance, its reputation."
91,2019-10-24,Infosys,"Regulator takes suo motu action, huge short positions built just before complaint under lensOn Wednesday, BSE said Infosys failed to disclose the whistleblower complaint to exchanges as per listing norms

MUMBAI :
The markets regulator is investigating a huge buildup of derivatives positions in Infosys Ltd’s stock before allegations of accounting malpractices raised in a whistleblower complaint were made public, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
Exchange data showed that huge put positions, or the option to sell shares at an agreed price on or before a particular date, were accumulated in the November series contracts of Infosys at a strike price of  ₹740.
Unknown traders first bought sizeable put options in the series expiring in September and held their positions through the October series. The whistleblowers’ letter, sent by a group of people who signed off as “ethical employees"", became public earlier this week and sent Infosys’s shares plunging by 16.2% on Tuesday, as investors dumped the stock.
If the share price falls below the strike price of the put option, then the difference between the strike price and actual price becomes the profit. Traders can make outsized profit in options trading, if their bet turns out to be correct. “Such large build-ups for a large cap stock like Infosys is unusual to say the least,"" said an analyst who declined to be named.
On Wednesday, Infosys’s stock, after opening 4% lower, rose 1.16% to end trading at  ₹650.75. The whistleblower complaint, sent to the Infosys board and the US Securities and Exchange Commission on 30 September, became public on 21 October.
The whistleblowers accused the company’s chief executive officer Salil Parekh and chief financial officer Nilanjan Roy of unethical accounting practices in a bid to boost revenue and profit.
“Considering that the complaint was not made to Sebi, it has taken suo motu cognizance of it. Infosys’s audit committee is already examining the complaint for its merit and was discussed on 11 October. Sebi would seek the audit committee findings for any action,"" one of the two people cited above said on condition of anonymity.
On Wednesday, BSE said Infosys failed to disclose the whistleblower complaint to stock exchanges as per listing norms and sought clarification from the company on this.
According to Listing Obligation and Disclosure norms, all material information needs to be disclosed, and whistleblower allegations are not material until proven to be true.
Companies receive a number of whistleblower complaints every year and they are disclosed only in annual reports. Firms disclose the number and nature of whistleblower complaints without going into the content.
Proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services said that there are no easy answers to when companies should disclose whistleblower complaints.
“When should the disclosure be made—once a complaint is received or when the board decides to investigate or once the investigation is complete and there is something more tangible to share with investors? Given the damage that the Infosys episode has caused, one can argue that the company should have been more forthcoming,"" it said.
Both the CEO and CFO of Infosys were questioned by the board on the allegations on 11 October during the board meeting for its Q2 results, the second person cited earlier said, requesting anonymity."
90,2019-10-24,Infosys,"The stock gained 7.6% from its June-quarter results even as concerns about acceleration in revenue growth rates began undermining shares of larger peersWhile the NSE IT index fell 4%, shares of TCS and Infosys lost 6-16% from HCL’s June-quarter results

The September quarter results of HCL Technologies Ltd will reinforce investors’ faith in the stock. The stock has gained 7.6% since its June quarter results even as concerns over acceleration in revenue growth rates undermined shares of its larger peers. While the NSE IT index fell 4%, shares of TCS Ltd and Infosys Ltd have lost 6-16% since HCL announced its April-June earnings in the first week of August. On Thursday, HCL Tech shares gained another 4.5% in early trades.
In the September quarter, revenue in constant currency jumped 20.5% as HCL began integrating acquisition of select IBM products. On a sequential basis, revenue grew 6%. Much of the sequential growth was driven by the integration of IBM products. Even so, a 14% expansion in organic revenue from a year ago is nothing to sneeze at.
More importantly, the upgrade in annual revenue growth guidance underscores the improvement in core business. The company now expects its organic business to grow in double digits at 10-11% against 8-10% estimated earlier.
In constant currency terms, the full-year revenue growth guidance has been raised by one percentage point to 15-17%. Last fiscal, constant currency revenue grew 11.8%. “This revision in guidance comes on the back of acceleration in organic growth momentum in H1, robust deal wins, and order book, even as the company faces renewal pressure in the IMS (infrastructure management services) business,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note.
The revenue guidance upgrade will please investors. Also, the company has been witnessing a good deal-winning momentum.
Deal flows have improved significantly compared with the June quarter. The company signed 15 transformational deals and added a $100 million client in July-September. Overall caution about banking and financial services business vertical notwithstanding, the company has a good deal pipeline in Europe. Four of the seven business verticals clocked double digit revenue growth last quarter.
The newly formed products and platforms (HCL Software) also got to a good start clocking $100 million of revenues. The platform created after integrating IBM products gives access to 20,000 customers across the globe. The management expects the enhanced reach to aid business momentum.
Operating profit margins jumped to multi-quarter high of 20% in July-September. Margins were boosted by lower amortization expenses and full recognition of revenues from IBM products, expenses of which are partly booked in earlier quarters. Margins may moderate as revenue flow from acquisitions normalize. The management expects full-year profit margins in a range of 18.5-19.5%.
The performance will add heft to HCL’s valuations. How well the company will be able to narrow the valuation gap with larger peers depends on its ability to scale up the products business and maintain revenue momentum. “HCL Software (Products unit) ability to successfully convert IBM customers into its own fold over the next few quarters would be the key for further re-rating,"" analysts at Centrum Institutional Research said in a note."

95,2019-10-24,Infosys,"From alleged visa fraud to malpractices, a cloud of questionable internal practices hangs heavy over the IT firmIn 2013, Infosys had to make a $35-million settlement with US authorities over an alleged visa fraud, which was reported to the authorities by former employee Jack Palmer

MUMBAI :
For the third time in six years, a cloud of questionable internal practices hangs heavy over Infosys Ltd, once seen as the paragon of corporate virtue in India. And yet again, it’s an internal whistleblower who has set off a chain reaction.
In the latest instance, an anonymous group called ‘Ethical Employees’ has complained to the Infosys board and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging accounting jugglery to boost short-term revenue and profits. The veracity of the complaint itself notwithstanding, the issue points to the company’s struggle with whistleblowers and corporate governance standards.
In 2013, Infosys had to make a $35-million settlement with US authorities over an alleged visa fraud, which was reported to the authorities by former employee Jack Palmer. Palmer had filed the whistleblower lawsuit alleging Infosys was deliberately flouting US visa rules to facilitate visits of its Indian employees on short-term B1 visas in February 2011. B1 visas are essentially meant for employees who are travelling to consult with associates, or attend training or conventions. They do not allow full-time employment in the US. While the US federal court, hearing the case, subsequently dismissed Palmer’s lawsuit, the allegations did spur a federal investigation into visa practices at Infosys.While the Indian software company hotly contested the allegations, it did, however, agree to the settlement subsequently.
In August 2017, Vishal Sikka who had taken over the reins at Infosys in 2014 replacing then CEO S.D. Shibulal, one of Infosys’s founders, had to exit after a whistleblower complaint pointed to alleged malpractices by the top management related to Infosys’s acquisition of Panaya, an Israeli software company.
It was alleged that relatives of top Infosys officials had invested in Panaya although they did not do it directly.
The relatives had invested through a fund which then further invested the money in Panaya and made significant returns when Panaya was bought by Infosys in 2015.
Soon after the allegations became public, Infosys CFO Rajeev Bansal left the organization and was offered a severance package that drew accusations of ‘hush money’ due to the timing of Bansal’s departure and circumstances preceding it.
Eventually, Infosys co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy publicly called upon the company management to come clean on the allegations and insisted that Infosys provide a detailed and exhaustive explanation pertaining to the Panaya deal.
Infosys has since then launched three separate investigations into the Panaya deal, but none of these independent probes have established any wrongdoing on Infosys employees who were named in the whistleblower letter.
However, Sikka left the company and co-founder Nandan Nilekani took over as chairman.
In January 2018, Salil Parekh from Capgemini was appointed as the CEO and MD of Infosys, where he was previously a member of the group management board since 2000."

87,2019-10-25,Infosys,"The US lawsuit alleges Infosys caused losses to the company’s ADS holdersInfosys’s ADS price swooned after the whistleblower’s complaint became public on 21 October

Mumbai: Infosys Ltd’s regulatory problems mounted after a US law firm filed a suit against the company on behalf of American investors, seeking damages for manipulating earnings, even as the US securities regulator started a probe into a complaint by anonymous whistleblowers.
New York-based Rosen Law Firm, which filed the class action suit against Infosys on Wednesday, said it has the backing of several hundred American depositary share (ADS) holders and named chief executive Salil Parekh and former chief financial officer M.D. Ranganath as respondents, along with the company.
The allegations of accounting malpractices first came to light in a whistleblowers’ complaint sent to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Infosys board on 30 September that became public on 21 October.
Regulatory heat on the company increased on Thursday, as SEC initiated an investigation into the whistleblowers’ complaint.
“The company has been in touch with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the anonymous whistleblower complaints (anonymous complaints) and has learnt that the SEC has initiated an investigation into this matter,"" Infosys said in a statement. The company will cooperate with the investigation, the statement said.
The US lawsuit, reviewed by Mint, alleges that Infosys violated federal securities laws by misrepresenting books of accounts, concealing whistleblowers’ complaint and causing losses to its ADS holders. Due to the misstatement, the company also artificially inflated its stock price and caused losses to investors from 7 July 2018 to 20 October 2019, the petition claimed.
The law firm has appealed in the court of the Eastern District of New York to direct Infosys and the two directors to compensate its US investors for the damages caused.
The law firm did not quantify the compensation it is seeking, nor did it specify the number of investors in the class action.
On Monday, Infosys’s US-listed shares plunged after the whistleblowers’ complaint, accusing Parekh and the company’s chief financial officer of “unethical accounting practices"" to inflate revenue and earnings, became public.
According to the NYSE, between 6 July 2018 and 30 September 2019, Infosys ADS gained 18.75% from $9.575 to $11.37. But soon after reports of the whistleblowers’ complaint emerged on 21 October, Infosys ADS suffered steep losses. Since 21 October, US investors have lost $6.52 billion.
In the petition, Infosys and its two directors are accused of drafting, producing and disseminating materially false and misleading statements to US investors and choosing not to disclose the fraud at the company.
The law firm alleged that the company improperly recognized revenue to inflate short-term profit; Parekh bypassed reviews and approvals for large deals to avoid accounting scrutiny; the (Infosys) management pressured the company’s finance team to hide information from auditors and the company’s board; and as a result, defendants’ (Infosys, Parekh and Ranganath) statements about its business, operations and prospects were false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.
The company misled investors with these statements since July last year to artificially inflate the ADS, which ultimately “economically damaged"" investors when the ADS price swooned after the whistleblowers’ complaint became public on 21 October, the petition stated.
It alleged that Infosys, with the help of Parekh and Ranganath, used the means of interstate commerce, including US mails, interstate telephone communications and the facilities of the national securities exchange to conduct the wrongdoings.
This is the second instance of an Indian company facing a class action lawsuit in the US. The first was related to the accounting fraud at Satyam Computer Services.
While the US securities holders of Satyam received a settlement of $125 million pursuant to the class action, their Indian counterparts received no compensation and were left only to benefit from the regulatory actions taken against the firm.
“This situation will likely not repeat itself. India recently paved the way for securities class action suits through the Companies Act, 2013. The Indian investors of Infosys can approach National Company Law Tribunal for damages. They now have rights of restitution that will and should change the power balance between shareholders and the management,"" a managing partner at a legal firm said on condition of anonymity."

Data points shared by Infosys Ltd., do not have any “perceivable inconsistency"" as alleged in a whistleblower letter, according to a report by ICICI Securities.
“Some of the data points shared by Infosys, like (the) Verizon deal being margin dilutive by 40 basis points, or visa costs being a margin drag of 80 basis points in Q1FY20, or (the) Stater deal being dilutive by 40 basis points, are consistent with the nature of these deals and investments in our opinion,"" the brokerage firm said in the report today. One basis point, or bps, is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Also, Infosys has always been clear that “certain deals like Verizon and Stater should be seen as investments made to build relationships with strategic clients with margins on these deals expected to remain dilutive to company average for an extended period of time,"" the report said.
A 20 September letter by an anonymous group called Ethical Employees alleged, among other things, that “in large contracts like Verizon, Intel, JVs in Japan, ABN AMRO acquisition, revenue recognition matters are forced, which are not as per accounting standards."" The whistleblower allegations, which became public earlier this month, battered Infosys stock.
A former Infosys board member, on condition of anonymity, corroborated the views of the report saying “such large manipulations were not possible for a company like Infosys and most of the data points were intrinsic to the nature of the deals.""
However, according to the ICICI Securities report, investor response to the whistleblower allegations worsened due to “absence of proactive disclosures by the company as well as the allegations not being looked at in isolation but also in the context of Ranganath Mavinakere (ex-CFO) and Jayesh Sanghrajka (Dy CFO) moving on from the company since Salil (Parekh) has taken over.""
Sanghrajka quit the company on 14 October after spending about 14 years in the company. In November last year, Sanghrajka was made the interim CFO after the then CFO and MD Ranganath quit.
The report clarified that there was concern only if “material information was held back from the auditors and board which we see as less likely.""
ICICI Securities has rated the Infosys stock as “attractive"" and upgraded it to “buy"" as the stock is currently trading at a discounted 15.5 times its FY21 estimated earnings per share compared with that of Tata Consultancy Services trading at 22.5 times. The possibility of a management discontinuity driven by the whistleblower allegations will remain a key risk, the report concluded.
On Tuesday, shares of Infosys closed 0.2% higher at Rs650.60, while the IT index rose 1.7% to close at 14908.32 points. The BSE Sensex rose about 1.5% to 39,831.84 points."

New Delhi: The Ministry of Corporate Affairs has sought information from Infosys Ltd regarding the anonymous whistleblower complaints which have triggered an investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
The move is the first step that the ministry takes when it takes cognizance of complaints or material information warranting government attention about any company, said a person familiar with the development. It does not purport an investigation or inspection of books, which is a decision taken later on based on facts. The ministry has in the recent past sought information from several companies, including in cases where statutory auditors have quit their assignment.
The corporate affairs ministry may also rope in accounting regulator National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) at a later stage in case the authorities find any merit in the whistleblower allegations about the accounting practices followed by the company. The complainants have raised questions about the revenue recognition by the company, which can have an impact on profit margins.
An email sent to Infosys on Tuesday remained unanswered at the time of publishing.
The Economic Times reported on Tuesday that seeking information from companies under such circumstances is a usual practice.
Infosys had last week informed stock exchanges that it has placed the complaints before its audit committee, which has retained law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. for an investigation. Capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India or SEBI has already sought additional information from the company about the complaints. Infosys is also facing a class action lawsuit that has been filed against it in a federal court in the US based on the allegations in the complaints."
81,2019-10-29,Infosys,"Corporations and the wealthy need to make larger contributions to bring about a material change

Over the past decade, many businessmen and super-rich individuals have had attacks of conscience over growing inequality. In 2010, Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates created The Giving Pledge to get billionaires to commit over half their wealth to charity. To date, 204 billionaires have signed up.
A parallel movement, called Pledge1%, one supported vociferously by another billionaire, Marc Benioff of salesforce.com, a company valued by the stock market at around $135 billion, has tried to extend such an oath even to people who are not billionaires. The idea is to commit people to giving 1% of their equity, time, products or profits to charity, thus taking the idea even to startups that may not have generated their first dollar in profit.
There is no doubt that capitalism and capitalists will need to become more conscientious about giving large parts of their incomes and wealth away if governments are not to make laws to snatch them away. However, they also need to realize that giving small bits of wealth is not going to move the needle on inequality. While The Giving Pledge is broadly on the right track, since the amounts pledged would at least top current inheritance taxes in most countries which have them, the Pledge1% movement is clearly sub-optimal.
Giving 1% of a startup’s equity is no use when eight out of 10 will not survive five years. Allotting 1% of your time to charity work is roughly three to four days a year. This volunteerism may be useful for some causes that could use freelance work, but it is little more than tokenism. Giving 1% of your products may make no sense in an era when most tech products are free for users anyway (consider Gmail, Google Maps and free apps), and the products you develop may not be relevant to the poor, who are the intended beneficiaries.
In India, even a high profit-earning company like Infosys gives 1% of its net profits to charity, but one can hardly think of this as making a substantial dent on any kind of inequality. The Tatas have been keeping large chunks of group equity in Tata Sons, whose dividends go substantially to charity. But in an era when Tata Sons is also a holding company that needs to invest in equity, or write off losses in group companies, the total quantity available for charity is again likely to be sub-optimal. One should ask whether shares intended to generate money for charity ought to be part of the promoters’ controlling stake. In this case, charity and control serve divergent purposes.
Perhaps the one Indian billionaire who has indeed moved the needle on contributions is Azim Premji, who, while retaining voting control of Wipro, has transferred two-thirds of the economic benefits of his shareholding to charitable activities. This makes a difference, though in such cases too the question is how long a promoter can retain control without substantial economic ownership too. Shareholders and those in control ought to have convergent economic interests for shareholder capitalism to work well.
One can also go back to an earlier era of global giving by governments, when the World Bank and its soft-lending arm, the International Development Association, exhorted rich countries to give 1% of their GDP as official development assistance to the poor. Few countries did even this, and soon, this too evaporated.
If one had to choose between the Buffett-Gates-Premji and Benioff-Tata-Infosys models of giving, the former wins hands down. The advantage of the Benioff model is that it asks people to start small and give as much as they can. This is not to be rubbished. However, sub-optimal contributions can’t do much to reduce inequality in any country. If at all charity by the rich is to work, it is profitable companies and the super-rich who need to start giving in a big way.
The reality is that startups make their best contribution merely by being there. Even though many will not live to see their fifth birthdays, while they are around, they are the ones creating a large number of jobs. That is even better than charity.
One US study by John Haltiwanger, Ron Jarmin and Javier Miranda found that startups accounted for only 3% of employment, but almost 20% of gross job creation. In short, the real contribution of startups to society lies in the jobs they create while they exist, and not in contributing 1% of their equity to charity.
It is alright to talk of a shift from shareholder capitalism to stakeholder capitalism, wherein corporations do not think of maximizing returns only for equity owners, but we need to avoid the pitfalls of treating minor contributions as worthy of emulation. Corporate and super-rich philanthropy need larger contributions, and not small sub-optimal donations that make no difference at all to inequality and deprivation.
Perhaps The Giving Pledge could be expanded to leave not only 50%-plus of one’s wealth to charity, but also an equal proportion of one’s current income, if sizeable. This will help reduce inequality, especially if these contributions exceed the taxes that have to be paid on income, wealth and inheritance.
True charity is charity only if it substantially exceeds current levels of taxes payable.

80,2019-10-30,Infosys,"Financial services firm ICICI Securities said the tech major does not have any 'perceivable inconsistency' in data points shared by Infosys Ltd as alleged in a whistleblower letter

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Wednesday:
Infosys: Financial services firm ICICI Securities said the tech major does not have any “perceivable inconsistency"" in data points shared by Infosys Ltd as alleged in a whistleblower letter. This may reverse the negative sentiment surrounding the company over accounting malpractices. Separately, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has sought information regarding the whistleblower complaints, which have triggered an investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Bharti Airtel: Shares plunged more than 3.3% on Tuesday as the Supreme Court rejected telcos’ definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), ordering mobile operators to repay past dues within three months to the government amid piling debt and shrinking revenues. Separately, Airtel on Tuesday reported a drop in its average revenue per share user in July-September as growth in its subscriber base outpaced the increase in revenue from mobile services in India.
RIL: The company said it will infuse  ₹1.08 trillion into its telecom subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. Proceeds from the infusion will be used to pare debt of the largest telecom operator by revenue market share. As a result, Reliance Jio's debt to equity ratio will fall from about 2.5 times to 0.3 times. Shares of the largest company by market capitalisation had touched a fresh 52-week high on Tuesday.
IndiGo: InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, which runs India’s largest budget airline IndiGo, has sought support from its employees following its biggest quarterly loss in July-September, saying that it will have to deal with weakening revenue environment going ahead. The airline reported a net loss of  ₹1,062 crore in the reporting quarter as against a loss of  ₹651.5 crore a year ago.
Bandhan Bank: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Tuesday imposed a penalty of  ₹1 crore on the private lender for failing to meet its promoter shareholding norms. The Reserve Bank said the bank was supposed to dilute promoter shareholding of its Non-operative Financial Holding Company in excess of 40% within three years from the date of commencement of the bank’s business.
Petronet LNG: The state-owned company announced its September quarter earnings on Tuesday after market hours. Net profit more than doubled to  ₹1,103 crore compared with  ₹560 crore in the same period last year. The company’s revenue rose 8.7% to  ₹9,361 crore in the second quarter of this fiscal. The revenue was higher than a year-ago figure of  ₹8,613 but lower than the estimate of  ₹9,027 crore.
Vodafone Idea: Traders fear Vodafone Idea Ltd may end up in bankruptcy, since the penalty amount is higher than the cash on its books. The telecom operator will alone have to pay a massive  ₹28,308 crore in past dues that include licence fees and penalties to the department of telecommunications.
Central Bank: The public-sector bank on Tuesday said its board has approved allotting preferential shares to the government to raise  ₹3,353 crore equity capital. In a filing with stock exchanges, the lender said the board approval is subject to the nod of shareholders, regulators RBI and Securities and Exchange Board of India and other statutory authorities.
Tata Chemicals: The company will announce its September quarter earnings today. Tata Global Beverages Ltd will also report its numbers for the second quarter. The companies are in the process of a demerger, where Tata Chemical’s consumer products business will be demerged into Tata Global Beverages’ and the entity with all mass consumption items will be named Tata Consumer Products.
HDFC Life Insurance: HDFC Standard Life has offered the company’s share at a price band of  ₹562-575 per share, seeking about $600 million or  ₹4,260 crore in the the placement of HDFC Life Insurance Company’s shares. There is an option to sell an additional $200 million of shares. Standard Life is looking to sell up to 3.76% stake or 7.58 crore shares in HDFC Life Insurance."
79,2019-10-30,Infosys,"Every second H-1B visa application sent by IT majors like Infosys, Wipro got rejectedOverall, the US government denied an H-1B visa to every fourth applicant

NEW DELHI :
With the Donald Trump administration being tough on immigration rules, the US government is now rejecting every fourth H-1B visa application, according to a report. Data from the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) shows that Indian IT majors like Infosys and Wipro are amongst the worst hit by visa denials.
Almost every second H-1B visa petition sent by both Wipro (53%) and Infosys (45%) for initial employment got rejected in FY 2019 (October-June). As compared with FY 2015 (October-September), the denial rates have gone up by 46% for Wipro and 43% for Infosys, according to the report which analysed data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
The United States issues 85,000 H-1B work visas every year, out of which an estimated 70% goes to Indians.
""As a result of more restrictive Trump administration policies, denial rates for H-1B petitions have increased significantly, rising from 6% in FY 2015 to 24% through the third quarter of FY 2019 for new H-1B petitions for initial employment,"" the report said.
For Tech Mahindra Americas, the denial rate was as high as 41%.
""Given the time and expense involved with filing H-1B petitions, employers generally only file cases for individuals they believe qualify for H-1B status, which is why high denial rates should not be expected,"" the report said.
For big American companies like Amazon (6%), Microsoft (8%), Intel (7%), Google (3%), Apple (2%), Facebook (2%), and others, the rate of H-1B visa denial seem to be less harsher.
At least 12 companies that provide professional or IT services to other US companies, including Accenture, Capgemini and others, had denial rates over 30% in FY 2019 so far. Most of these companies had denial rates between 2% and 7% in FY 2015.
USCIS data reveals that in FY 2019, 88,324 H-1B visa applications for initial employment were approved while 27,707 were rejected.
For continuing employment, the denial rate was 12% as over 1.85 lakh such applications were approved."

ITC and Sun Pharmaceuticals were also among the top five gainers of the day. All five shares rose between 1.5% and 3.4%.
Reports that the government is considering further tax reforms also boosted sentiment. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and the finance ministry are discussing the abolition of the dividend distribution tax (DDT), a review of individual tax slabs, and a change in the holding period of assets to be eligible for tax savings, news agency IANS had reported. The steps are likely to be announced before or in the Union Budget in February.
The BSE Bankex was among the top gainers among sectoral indices, rising 3.6%. United Bank gained around 20% to close at  ₹8.90 after the bank reported a profit of  ₹124 crore for the quarter ended September against a loss of  ₹833 crore a year ago. Central Bank surged around 18% to close at  ₹21.15 after the bank said its board approved raising up to  ₹3,353 crore via allotment of shares on a preferential basis to the government.
Meanwhile, Bandhan Bank lost 1.47% to close at Rs614.35 after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed a penalty of  ₹1 crore on the lender for non-compliance with guidelines on promoter shareholding.
InterGlobe Aviation shares rose 7% as the company, which operates IndiGo, will soon place a ""record"" order for Airbus A320neo family aircraft, including the latest long range Airbus A321XLR planes.

Hopes of fresh tax reforms and lower interest rates in the US kept up the market tempo for the fourth straight day on Wednesday, with the benchmark Sensex closing above the 40,000 mark for the first time since 4 June.
The 30-share BSE Sensex rose 220.03 points, or 0.55%, to 40,051.87, just 215.75 points shy of its record 40,267.62 on 3 June. The 50-share Nifty gained 0.49% to 11,844.10.
A mixed bag of quarterly earnings performance and hopes of lower taxes raised hopes among investors. Global markets were mostly cautious ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting ending later on Wednesday.
Ajit Mishra, vice president of research at Religare Broking, said, “Indian indices continued their upward trend on the hopes of more tax sops for the equity markets from the government."" He said that in the near term, the market will be driven by corporate earnings and, thus, stock-specific volatility may remain high. “Further, any favourable announcement from the government could help sustain the momentum. On the global front, expectations of an interest rate cut by the US Fed are high and the Fed’s guidance will be keenly watched by investors. In addition, other factors such as oil prices and currency movement may have a bearing on the markets.""
The Fed is expected to cut interest rates by a quarter point on Wednesday for the third consecutive time to provide insurance against global risks, while signalling that the committee has probably done enough for now. Investors are pricing in a 90% likelihood of a cut, though economists surveyed by Bloomberg put the odds at 75%. While policymakers see risks from trade uncertainty and weakness abroad, some view the Fed’s cuts in July and September as sufficient to offset those headwinds, absent more shocks.
Higher interest rates in the US typically lead to foreign money flowing out of emerging markets, considered to be riskier assets, while in the case of lower interest rates in the US, there are inflows to emerging markets.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have bought Indian shares worth $710.72 million in October after aggressively selling them following tax proposals in the Union budget that were later rolled back. The budget had raised the surcharge on the ultra-rich that was also applicable to some FIIs. Year to date, FII investments net of selling in Indian markets are worth $8.87 billion.
Rahul Gupta, head of currency at Emkay Global Financial Services, said: “We expect the Fed to cut rates to 1.5-1.75% for the third consecutive time as the unsettled US-China trade war has started taking a toll on the US economic data. The rupee will continue to trade between 70.70-71.30 until we get more clarity on a US-China trade deal.""
Domestic institutional investors have been net buyers of shares worth  ₹51,590.33 crore so far this year, including  ₹5,380.49 crore bought in October.
The rupee on Wednesday ended at 70.90, down 0.07% from the previous close.

76,2019-11-02,Infosys,"The USCICS rejected 45% of H-1B visa applications for Infosys while for Google the figure was only 3%For TCS, the rejection rate was 34% while for Wipro it was 53%

NEW DELHI :
With the United States government becoming tougher on immigration rules under Donald Trump's rule, several Indian IT companies including Infosys and Wipro are having a tough time in sending their employees on H-1B visa to work in the US, according to a latest report.
Even as the denial rate for new H-1B visa applications was as high as 45% for India's IT bellwether Infosys, Google was somehow lucky as only 3% of its petitions were rejected by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), according to National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP).
The data pertains to the first three quarters of FY 2019 (October-June). In the US, the financial calendar runs from October-September.
For American multinationals like Amazon, Microsoft, Intel, Google, Apple and Facebook, the rejection rates varied between 2% to 8%. Employees of Apple and Facebook had the lowest denial rate.
The NFAP report, which provides a detailed break-down of company-wise rejection rates, shows that when it came to Indian IT companies, the rejection rates went up manifold.
In 2015, 4% of all H-1B visa applicants sent by Tech Mahindra Americas were rejected but the figure shot up to 41% this year. For TCS, the denial rate was as high as 34% this year, Wipro 53% and Infosys 45%. In 2015, during the earlier dispensation, the rejection rates varied between 2%-7% for these Indian companies, according to the report.
A change in US policy is also reflected in cases where an existing H-1B visa holder applied for a renewal of his or her work visa. Infosys employees faced the highest rejection rate of 29%, according to the report. For Wipro, the figure stood at 19% and TCS 22%.
If we look at the overall figures, every fourth H1-B visa application got rejected. The US government issues about 85,000 such visas every year out of which an estimated 70% goes to Indians alone. Most H-1B applicants from India are IT professionals."

Bengaluru: The likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter have became big monopolies and time has come for governments around the world to have a control over them, information technology industry veteran T.V. Mohandas Pai said on Monday. The former Chief Financial Officer of Infosys said the government should through its probe agencies investigate the WhatsApp snooping scandal, come out with a report and place it before the people.
""Today platforms like Google, Facebook, Twitter have become big monopolies and they are trying to sensor and monitor what is happening, (and) they are trying to control the minds of citizens globally"", Pai told PTI.
""They have access to a lot of information, they are repository of information, and they have to tell all of us how they are going to protect the information from malware or any technology that can snoop on us"", he added.
He said there is a lot of personal data on these platforms which run algorithms to find out patterns and do psychometric analysis.
""It's a very dangerous situation"".
Pai stressed the need for the Government to draw up norms vis-a-vis functioning of such big platforms.
""Privacy cannot be protected by contract with these companies. Big companies say we have a contract, we will protect you but the contract is totally one-sided...they have control over you, they dominate you"", he said.
""It's time that all legislatures around the world, including Indian Parliament, have control over them. Our government should protect us"", Pai said.

70,2019-11-04,Infosys,"Infosys said it was yet to receive any evidence that could prima facie substantiate whistleblower allegations against the company’s top management

Infosys shares surged on Monday after the software exporter said it had yet to receive any evidence that could prima facie substantiate whistleblower allegations against the company’s top management. Some anonymous employees had alleged that Infosys CEO Salil Parekh and its finance head Nilanjan Roy had indulged in “unethical accounting practices"" in order underplay costs and portray higher profits. While the matter is still being investigated by the company’s internal audit committee and a conclusive report is awaited, Monday’s statement should reassure stakeholders worried about glaring misdeeds and a clear-cut scandal. Crucially, there seems no sign of any corroborative recordings and emails that the whistleblowers had promised to submit.
Why they still haven’t, if “proof"" actually exists, is a good question. It makes observers wonder if the allegations will eventually turn out to be just that, and no more. If the whistle turns out to be falsely blown, it would suggest mala fide intent on the part of people within. Could disgruntled employees have been put up to it by rivals? Was there another ulterior motive? Might it reflect a higher-level tussle of some sort? An answer to any of these questions at this stage would be purely in the realm of speculation.
Any company sworn to transparency would know that juggling numbers to deceive investors is not just illegal, it’s hard to keep hidden for very long. Since the credibility damage would far outweigh any potential upside to such tactics, it’s seems like common sense to refrain from such tricks. But anonymous charges have indeed been levelled and the case is far from settled yet. Apart from the audit committee, the Indian stock market regulator is doing a probe too; and since the stock is listed in the US, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has also initiated an investigation of the whistleblower claims."

""Infosys gives a strong rebuttal to the allegations of the so called ""Whistleblower"". I would go by the credibility of the Infosys Board rather than an unknown, possibly disgruntled set of employees,"" market expert Sandip Sabharwal said in a tweet.
Infosys shares took a knock after the Indian software services exporter had said last month that it had received whistleblower complaints against company's executives, alleging ""unethical practices"". The whistleblower complaints have been placed before the audit committee as per the company’s practice and will be dealt with in accordance with the company’s whistleblowers policy, Infosys had said in a statement.
To ensure independence in these investigations, the CEO and CFO have been recused from this matter, chairman Nandan Nilekani had said in a statement to stock exchanges.
The complaints follow a strong quarterly earnings performance by Infosys, which raised the lower end of its annual revenue forecast on upbeat demand for its digital services."

New Delhi: Two weeks after the whistleblower’s allegations against Infosys Ltd’s management went public, the company said on Monday there is no prima facie evidence that it has received to corroborate any of the allegations made.
At 12:34pm, shares of Infosys were trading up 3.7% at  ₹713.55 on the BSE.
“In any event, the Audit Committee retained the services of the law firm, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. to investigate the matter. Moreover, even before the appointment of the independent investigator, the Audit Committee began consultations with independent internal auditors Ernst & Young. The independent internal auditors were given a mandate to review certain processes on the basis of the allegation in the anonymous complaints,"" Infosys said in a filing on National Stock Exchange.
Infosys further stated that an anonymous letter with certain allegations and no supporting evidence cannot be regarded as being credible or concrete. Therefore, “the company is not in a position to determine the concreteness, credibility and materiality of the anonymous complaints.""
Infosys clarified that it will update the stock exchanges on the basis of key findings of the investigation reports once these are concluded. “The Company will continue making timely disclosures as required under Regulation 30 of LODR Regulations.""
An ICICI Securities Ltd report on 29 October said data points shared by Infosys Ltd, do not have any “perceivable inconsistency"" as alleged in a whistleblower letter.
Infosys posted a strong set of numbers for the second quarter, and raised the lower end of its fiscal year 2020 revenue guidance, revising it to 9-10% from 8.5-10% earlier, on the back of strong momentum in large deals and market share gains."

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd said it hasn’t received any evidence to support allegations, including that of inflating profit, made by anonymous whistleblowers against top company officials, including chief executive Salil Parekh.
“An anonymous letter with certain allegations and no supporting evidence cannot be regarded as being credible or concrete. Therefore, the company is not in a position to determine the concreteness, credibility and materiality of the anonymous complaints,"" Infosys said in a stock exchange filing. The statement sent the company’s stock soaring as much as 6.47% in intra-day trading on Monday.
An anonymous group called Ethical Employees accused Parekh and the company’s chief financial officer of unethical accounting practices in a bid to boost short-term revenue and profit. Infosys has since hired law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas and Co. to look into the allegations.
A former Infosys board member said he believes that there are no malpractices on the accounting front but that the company has mismanaged how the whistleblowers’ complaint was handled.
“The casual manner in which they handled this, how they didn’t respond to the media and investors is what upsets me. The board has to step in and ensure that such issues are handled properly… also the board and management have to work in tandem,"" he said.
The company has been criticized in some quarters for failing to proactively disclose the information to investors and waiting for the allegations to emerge in the public domain before responding to them. In their letter dated 20 September, the whistleblowers accused Infosys’s top executives of inflating revenue and profit, withholding information from the board and abusing travel privileges, among other issues.
“We had posited that the allegations do not pose any major threat to the business and the charges involve subjectivity,"" brokerage Edelweiss Securities said in a note on Monday. “For example, most large deals involve upfront cost and low margins, which normalize over the tenure of the deal. The company remains on a strong footing fundamentally and is firmly on track to deliver industry-leading growth.""
Infosys’s troubles may not be over yet as it still faces class action lawsuits in the US, and both the US and Indian regulators have initiated separate investigations into the allegations.

65,2019-11-06,Infosys,"Recently, Cognizant had said that it will eliminate as many as 7,000 jobs globallyInfosys' consolidated attrition rate on an annualized basis had declined marginally for the second quarter

Global software major Infosys has terminated the services of non-performing employees at multiple levels as part of its involuntary attrition, a company source said on Tuesday. ""As a high performance organisation, involuntary attrition is integral to normal course of business and this (sacking) should not be interpreted as any mass trimming across any level in particular,"" said IT behemoth in an e-mail to IANS.
The company, however, did not disclose how many such employees were fired in the recent past.
Terming a media report on involuntary attrition speculative with unofficial numbers (data points), the source clarified that the company was not laying off thousands of its employees at multiple levels.
""The media report is a mere speculation and sensationalisation with wrong data points, which the company never shared,"" the source asserted.
Involuntary attrition, a jargon used by the companies for firing or sacking employees for not measuring up to its expectations or high standards of performance, has been taking place at the company over a few quarters.
""This is not laying off, if you don't perform for two years or two quarters or whatever then you are asked to go, it's a performance related thing,"" the source pointed out.
Infosys rival, Wipro, also based in this tech hub, regularly discloses quarterly in its employment metrics the number of software engineers who resign on their own for various reasons and those who are asked to quit when they are found non-performing.
""We don't hand over pink slips to our employees. We can't share the data as they are internal processes. We don't tell our people you are redundant and hence can leave tomorrow,"" affirmed the source.
Unlike other firms the world over, the $11-billion Infosys gives its non-performing techies sufficient time to shape up before being asked to go.
Clarifying that disruptive technologies were not factored in assessing the performance of its geeks, the source said ""it is a cool narrative but that is not what it is.""
The outsourcing firm's consolidated attrition rate on an annualized basis declined marginally to 21.7% for the second quarter (July-September) of this fiscal (2019-20) from 23.4% a quarter ago and 22.2% a year ago.
The company sequentially added 7,457 techies in the quarter under review (Q2) and a whopping 18,747 employees on a yearly basis from the same period a year ago.
The company's headcount is 236,486 as against 229,029 a quarter ago and 217,739 a year ago.
Coming as it does, Infosys joins US-based NRI-promoted Cognizant which reportedly decided to fire about 7,000 jobs and shun content moderation business.

BENGALURU :
Infosys Ltd chairman Nandan Nilekani on Wednesday defended the company’s co-founders and management over the recent whistleblowers’ allegations, assuring necessary steps will be taken if an investigation substantiates claims of misgovernance.
Infosys, he said, was committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and has responded responsibly and complied with applicable laws and best practices.
“Infosys has strong processes; even God can’t change the numbers of this company. Our finance team is feeling insulted by these allegations. But I don’t want to bias the investigation,"" Nilekani, a co-founder of the company, said at an analysts’ meet.
He added that Infosys has grown at an average of 11.4% in constant currency terms over the past four quarters, with CEO Salil Parekh playing a lead role in reinvigorating the organization and driving momentum.
On 21 October, Infosys said it has received complaints by whistleblowers alleging “unethical practices"" by senior executives, including Parekh and CFO Nilanjan Roy, to boost short-term revenue and profit. A day later, Nilekani said in a stock exchange filing that the complaints were “being dealt with in an objective manner"".
On Wednesday, shares of Infosys rose as much as 3.7%, before closing 2.37% higher at  ₹712.30 on the BSE.
On the whistleblowers’ allegations that Infosys had bent rules in large deals, Nilekani said large-margin deals are decided entirely by the management and it is within its right to take those calls about margins. He added that while the company is unable to give a timeline on when the investigation will close, a summary of the ongoing probe will be provided after it is complete.
In a separate stock exchange filing, Infosys said it condemned the “mischievous insinuations made by anonymous sources against the co-founders and former colleagues, suggesting their involvement in the recent whistleblower allegations"".
Earlier on Wednesday, Moneycontrol.com reported that a co-founder of Infosys and a former senior executive conspired with the whistleblowers to make allegations of governance failures.
Nilekani said in the filing that “these speculations are appalling and seem to be aimed at tarnishing the image of some of the most accomplished and respected individuals. I have deep regard for the life-long contribution of all our co-founders. They have built this institution and have served this company selflessly and even today, remain committed to the long-term success of Infosys"".
The Bengaluru-based firm reiterated that the audit committee has appointed an external law firm to conduct an independent investigation into the allegations.
Analysts said Nilekani’s comments will build trust and confidence among investors.
“We have to appreciate that Nandan has come out and spoken, something that was long pending. Also, when someone like Nandan has put his personal reputation on the line, it goes to suggest that Infosys is an organization that is very upfront about governance processes, which is larger than any individual,"" said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst at Greyhound Research."
59,2019-11-06,Infosys,"The company appears to be troubled by a culture clash, with an old order pushing back the new

It is eminently possible that the unfortunate affair at Infosys may end up being no more than a ghost in the night that melts away in the morning. Its clarificatory note to stock exchanges stating that “there is no prima facie evidence that the company has received until date to corroborate any of the allegations made"", though not completely reassuring, indicates that 45 days after the allegations were made, they have yet to be supported by solid proof.
Unfortunately, even if the charges are eventually found to be unfounded, Infosys still has a lot to worry about. For one, the very thought of senior people walking around the company’s corridors recording sensitive conversations between its leaders is so alarming an occurrence that it should be the first issue to be investigated, not with reprisal in mind, but with the objective of uncovering what could have created such a climate of mistrust within its ranks. This must be particularly galling for a leader such as Nandan Nilekani, who is known for accessibility, and under whom the company created a culture of openness that ought to have allowed an aggrieved or concerned employee to walk into his room and ask for an explanation. Internal redressal might also have helped place issues in perspective, as at present there is little clarity on the exact nature of wrongdoing that has so incensed the company’s whistleblowers.
Companies pay their leaders precisely to take key business decisions. Mostly, a good leader will get many of those right and a few wrong as well. Usually, such decisions will be based on reams of background data, supported by the views of several others.
In the case of Infosys, the major charges relate to decisions on the pricing of its services and a method of accounting for some costs that may or may not be typical but does not appear to be in the realm of the illegal. In the IT services business, most multi-year contracts typically follow a pattern wherein profit margins grow with time as the client relationship deepens and initial investments get amortized.
On the surface, then, there’s nothing unusual about how the offending contracts were priced. The problem seems to be some arguments made leading up to these decisions, or, more precisely, the water cooler talk that may have preceded these. Some of it may have also been politically incorrect. That is assuming that voice recordings, if they exist, stand up to scrutiny. What if they do? Would it justify the erosion of more than  ₹50,000 crore in investor wealth, as measured by a drop in the value of its shares, in response?
If that is so, where does it leave room for the normal chatter that is so much a part of office discourse? Even as the world discusses l’affaire Infosys, trust levels within the company’s management team must have taken a hit. In a business as intensely competitive as IT services, where the top teams at companies need to work in perfect harmony, any instability on that count can lead to costly slippages in performance. As it is, a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation can be hugely distracting and time-consuming. On average, an investigation by the US markets watchdog can take up to two years for any kind of resolution. The impact on such companies, regardless of the outcome, is severe.
The charges against Infosys’s current chief executive officer (CEO) Salil Parekh, seen in conjunction with the earlier exit of Vishal Sikka two years ago following a similar whistleblower episode, may also point to a pushback by the old order within the company against an “outsider"". Bear in mind that Sikka and his successor Parekh represent the company’s first attempt in the 38 years since its inception to bring in outsiders as CEOs.
Twice now, two of the company’s founders have had to return some years after retiring from their executive positions in pursuance of the rotational policy that they themselves put in place. First in June 2013, N.R. Narayana Murthy, who had retired two years before that when he turned 65, came back as executive chairman to help its under-fire CEO and co-founder S.D. Shibulal run the then underperforming company. Then again in 2018, after the upheaval of the parting with Sikka, Nilekani, who too had done his stint as CEO between 2002 and 2007, had to come back as non-executive chairman to support Parekh as he took charge of the company.
The diffraction patterns that arise from the collision of the old and the new lie at the heart of Infosys’s current troubles. However, the way forward cannot be to keep going back to its past. At one level, the solution to the simmering discontent within the company may well be for the Murthy-Nilekani duo to take charge of the company they founded, restore the confidence of employees and shareholders, and draw a proper succession plan for its future. Ideal as that sounds, it is also unlikely to happen and would also set an unhealthy precedent.
Whether under Parekh or any other future leader, the 228,000-strong company has to learn to accept newcomers and work to the new rhythms they seek to establish. The business landscape around Infosys is changing much too rapidly for it to insulate itself. In a quest to adapt to newer technologies and customer requirements, newer leaders bring with them practices and processes that seem unfamiliar. Rejecting them without a fair trial would impact the company’s reputation and performance. It isn’t a fate anyone would wish upon India’s original corporate standard bearer.

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Thursday:
Yes Bank: Moody’s Investor Service on Wednesday placed the private lender’s foreign currency issuer rating of Ba3 under review downgrade following its weak performance in the September quarter, leading to concerns over the bank’s overall financial position and uncertainty around regulatory approvals for its plan to raise $1.2 billion in equity capital.
Tata Steel: The country’s largest steel maker reported a net profit of  ₹3,302 crore in the September quarter, up nearly 6% year-on-year led by a one-time gain and a favourable tax regime.

54,2019-11-08,Infosys,"The middle-layer accounts for about 20-30% of the total workforce of IT companiesThere were fears of slowdown in the global economies but that impact has not been seen

BENGALURU :
Information technology companies in the country have no choice but to lay off at least five to ten per cent of their middle-level staff to ward off margin pressure and become more agile, IT industry veteran V Balakrishnan said on Thursday.
The middle-layer accounts for about 20-30% of the total workforce of IT companies.
The former Chief Financial Officer of software giant Infosys Ltd said the companies have no choice because they all have built a lot of fat in the middle, so they have to reduce it and become more agile. ""Also, they have to get employees who understand new technologies, they have to get rid of some of the employees, who are more on the legacy, and try to attract talent which is more digital, that has to happen, there is no choice"", Balakrishnan told PTI.
Asked if other companies would follow suit after lay-offs at Cognizant and Infosys, he said they have no choice, because there was lot of pressure on the margins. ""When you go more on the digital side, customers are also becoming more conscious about the cost. On the other side, you have to become more agile, cut all the flab, that's (lay-offs) inevitable, that will happen with all companies"", Balakrishnan said.
However, he said, the growth of Indian IT services companies in general in the calendar year 2019 has been stable with reasonable growth. There were fears of slowdown in the global economies but that impact has not been seen. ""Digital is driving growth. With new technologies, most of the companies are reconfiguring themselves, focusing on digital and also reducing the flab with legacy technology employees and trying to be more cost-effective and having a better pyramid,"" he said. 
""So, it's a combination of both. Focusing more on digital, that's where the growth is, and also reconfiguring employees and slowly moving away from the legacy technologies,"" he added. On the prospects of IT services companies in 2020, he said all the global economies seem to be stable and there are no fears of recession. If they play the game properly, it would be a good year for them as there are no concerns, Balakrishnan added."

Mumbai: People wishing to check Infosys Ltd’s financial figures should “ask God"", Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairman Ajay Tyagi said on Friday, two days after Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani cited God to defend the sanctity of the company’s numbers.
Meanwhile, the regulator’s probe into the whistleblower complaint against Infosys is still on, Tyagi said. “The investors, if they want, can take comfort from Infosys statement, but our probe is still on. This is all I can tell you,"" said Tyagi on the sidelines of a financial markets summit organized by the Confederation of Indian Industry.
“You have to ask him (Nilekani about Infosys numbers) or you can actually ask God,"" Tyagi added.
Nilekani told an analysts’ meeting on Wednesday: “Infosys has strong processes; even God can’t change the numbers of this company. Our finance team is feeling insulted by these allegations. But I don’t want to bias the investigation.""
On 21 October, Infosys said it had received an anonymous whistleblower complaint alleging “unethical practices"" by senior executives, including CEO Salil Parekh and CFO Nilanjan Roy, to boost short-term revenue and profit. A day later, Nilekani, in a stock exchange filing, said the complaints were “being dealt with in an objective manner"".
Sebi is also investigating a huge buildup of derivatives positions in Infosys’s stock, noticed before the whistleblower allegations, raising suspicions of potential insider trading.
Amid reports of credit rating agencies failing to take appropriate rating action on issuers before they default, Tyagi said: “In many cases, the rating agencies have been blamed, and rightly so. But in some cases they do not get timely default information or the issuers are not cooperating....We have taken cognizance of that.""
Mint reported on 18 September that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and Sebi were working on a framework that will allow for more accurate exchange of borrower data between banks and credit rating agencies. That apart, Sebi is also working on a new set of reforms to boost infrastructure investment trusts, or InvITs.
The markets regulator will soon come out with regulations that will allow InvITs to raise funds through preferential allotment and rights issue in line with what is allowed to companies under the Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements.
Tyagi said divestment by public sector undertakings (PSUs) will help boost initial public offerings (IPOs). “My view is that this has to be kick-started with some confidence building. In this, I feel the government’s plan for divestment of PSUs should come in a big way to boost the market.""
In this year’s budget the government said that listed companies would need to maintain a public float of 35%. However, a majority of PSUs are yet to achieve a 25% public float."

Bengaluru: Another whistleblower from global software major Infosys accused its Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Salil Parekh of committing misdeeds and urged the Chairman and the board of directors to act against him on his volatile complaints.
""Though it is a year and 8 months since Parekh joined the company, he operates from Mumbai in violation of the condition that the CEO has to be based in Bengaluru and not Mumbai. What is stopping the board to insist on his movement to Bengaluru,"" said the whistleblower in an unsigned and undated letter to Infosys Chairman and co-founder Nandan Nilekani and Independent Directors on the Board.
Claiming to be an employee in the $11-billion company's finance department, the whistleblower complained that he was unable to disclose his identity fearing retaliation for the damning disclosures he was making against Parekh.
""I am an employee working in the finance department. I am submitting this whistleblower complaint as the matter is so volatile that I fear retaliation if I disclose my identity. Please excuse me for the same, but the matter is of grave importance,"" said the employee in the complaint, accessed by IANS through sources on Monday night.
As an employee and a shareholder, the whistleblower said it was his duty to bring to the notice of the chairman and the board a few facts about Parekh that were eroding the value systems of the company.
""Hope that you will execute your responsibilities in the true spirit of Infosys and in favour of employees and shareholders who have so much of faith in the company,"" the complaint noted.
As Parekh did not relocate to Bengaluru even after he was given two months to do and was visiting the tech hub twice a month, the techie said the company had incurred  ₹22 lakh towards his airfare and local transportation.
""Four business class tickets per month plus home to airport drop in Mumbai, airport pick-up in Bengaluru and drop on the return journey,"" alleged the whistleblower.

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd has received a second whistleblower complaint accusing chief executive Salil Parekh of misdemeanours, days after a similar letter prompted the company’s board to institute an independent probe.
The second whistleblower urged the chairman and directors to act against Parekh.
“Though it is a year and eight months since Parekh joined the company, he operates from Mumbai in violation of the condition that the CEO has to be based in Bengaluru.

As an employee and a shareholder, the whistleblower said it was his duty to bring to the notice of the chairman and the board a few facts that were eroding the value systems of the company.
Accusing Parekh of visiting Bengaluru from Mumbai at least twice a month, the employee said: “As all our employees are paying for their transport from their homes to office and back, expecting the same from the CEO is not wrong. Please initiate actions to recover this money from Salil Parekh immediately.""
When the first letter became public on 22 October, shares of Infosys tumbled about 16% to close at  ₹643.55 on the BSE.
Since then, the stock has recovered 9.5%, while the Sensex gained 3.54%. The markets are closed on Tuesday on account of Guru Nanak Jayanti.
However, the second letter, a copy of which was reviewed by Mint, may not be new.
It could be the one of the “undated letters"" that Infosys had referred to earlier. In a statement on 22 October, Nilekani had acknowledged that a board member had received two anonymous complaints on 30 September—one dated 20 September titled “Disturbing unethical practices"", and the second undated “Whistleblower Complaint"".
When contacted, an Infosys spokesperson said the company has “nothing more to share at this point in time"".
Infosys co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy declined to comment on the ongoing issues of corporate governance in the company. Such questions should be raised with Infosys, he told Mint on the sidelines of a book launch event at the company’s Electronic City headquarters in Bengaluru.

48,2019-11-12,Infosys,"The Infosys saga and the legal empowerment of those who have something amiss to report at a company

A whistleblowing means a whistleblower blowing the lid off a corporate or financial scam committed by an employee, with the same being brought to the knowledge of the public and/or senior management. A whistleblower in India may be any person who exposes information on what is believed to be fraud, corruption or a deviation from corporate rules and Indian company law. The whistleblower discloses what s/he believes to be unethical or illegal behaviour on part of the higher management. This whistleblower can be anyone from either within or outside the organization—such as current and former employees, shareholders, auditors, media, or even lawyers.
Let’s take the Infosys case—specifically, the earlier one that surfaced last month, where the charges were far more serious than the latest one about the CEO’s travel expenses. A whistleblower group that called itself ‘Ethical Employees’ had complained to the Infosys Board of Directors and also the US Securities Exchange Commission that Infosys CEO Salil Parekh and the CFO Nilanjan Roy had indulged in ""unethical practices"" and fudged the company's financial numbers. The letter stated that ""unethical practices are taken up to boost short term revenue and profits. We hope the Board will conduct immediate investigation and take action."" The letter further stated that, ""In last quarter, we were asked not to fully recognize costs like visa costs to improve profits. We have emails and voice recordings of these conversations and we will share when investors ask us.""
Now let’s look at the whistleblower law. The Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2014 provides a mechanism to investigate alleged corruption and misuse of power by public servants and also protect anyone who exposes alleged wrongdoing in government bodies, projects and offices. The wrongdoing might take the form of fraud, corruption or mismanagement. The Act will also ensure punishment for false or frivolous complaints. As per Section 177 of the Companies Act, 2013, certain companies have to establish a “Vigil/Whistle-blowing"" mechanism to report any unethical behaviour or other concerns to the management. Companies which are required to constitute an audit committee that shall operate the vigil mechanism through an audit committee; and if any member of the committee has a conflict of interest in a given case, s/he should recuse herself or himself, so that others on the committee can deal with the matter on hand. For other companies, the board of directors shall nominate a director to chair the audit committee to whom other directors and employees may report their concerns. The law also provides adequate safeguards against victimization of employees or directors who exercise the vigil mechanism. The whistleblower also has access to the chairperson of the audit committee. Once the process is established, in accordance with the law, the existence of the mechanism should be appropriately communicated within the organization, including the website and the Annual Report.
The founders of Infosys, who took turns to steer the Infosys ship, were clear about the creation of a value system. Right from Narayan Murthy (1981 to 2002), Nandan Nilekani (March 2002 to April 2007), S Gopalakrishnan (April 2007 to August 2011) to SD Shibulal (August 2011 to July 2014), all founders had their focus on this value system. Vishal Sikka was the first non-founder CEO of Infosys, and he took over the reins in August 2014. His helm was again cut short by a whistleblower controversy in August 2017. Sikka was at the helm for around 3 years and resigned in August 2017. In a personal note to board colleagues, Sikka cited a ""drumbeat of distractions"" and ""false, baseless, malicious and increasingly personal attacks"" as his reason for leaving Infosys. Many sources suspect that this was in reference to a long-running feud with Infosys founders over the new direction Sikka was reportedly taking the company.
The unceremonious exit of Sikka, who otherwise was a successful corporate executive, raised questions of whether any manager outside the Infosys family could be successful in this hot seat. As if to test this, Salil Parekh got an opportunity to prove the no-outsider hypothesis false. Parekh, had an earlier, otherwise non-controversial stint at Capgemini.
Now, Parekh too has whistleblower charges to address. The Infosys Audit Committee, in consultation with the board, appointed leading law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas to conduct an independent audit on the matter. In order to ensure independence of the investigation, the CEO and CFO have recused themselves. The board, in consultation with the audit committee, will take such steps as may be appropriate based on the outcome of the investigation. The statutory auditors, Deloitte India, have been completely updated on this matter. Whatever the result of the investigation, it could cleanse the system. Once again, Infosys needs to shake off uncertainties and stand tall.

47,2019-11-12,Infosys,"Globally, CEOs of megacorps are known to use a combination of private jets and helicopters to save time and personal energy. In general, the whistleblower seems to be crying wolf

Another Infosys employee seems agitated by what he sees as transgressions by its chief executive officer (CEO) Salil Parekh. The anonymous Infoscion, who claims to be working in the software major’s finance department, has written a letter to its chairman, Nandan Nilekani, listing out charges against the CEO that involve expenses. Parekh, it says, has not relocated to Bengaluru, where the firm is headquartered, and works from Mumbai instead. As a result, goes the gripe, the company has so far incurred  ₹22 lakh on Parekh’s air travel and local transportation. The letter goes on to allege that many employees have taken a cue from that and started working from home.
To top it all, the whistleblower also has a theory of an ulterior motive that is gleefully ascribed to the CEO. Parekh, the letter alleges, has stock market investments in several firms, and he stays in Mumbai to oversee those.
The investment portfolio story is easy to dismiss as bizarre. Thanks to internet connectivity, stocks can be tracked from almost anywhere on the planet. As for travel expenses, while Infosys founder CEOs may have exercised frugality, there is nothing extraordinary about top executives piling up such bills. Their time is valuable, a vast sum of shareholder wealth is at stake, and how they optimize their schedule to generate value is best judged by them. Globally, CEOs of megacorps are known to use a combination of private jets and helicopters to save time and personal energy. In general, the whistleblower seems to be crying wolf."

NEW DELHI :
The government will consider on Friday the proposals of TCS and Infosys to set up special economic zones (SEZ) in IT sector.
The proposals will be taken up by the Board of Approval, the highest decision making body for SEZ, in its meeting on 15 November. The inter ministerial body is chaired by the Commerce Secretary.
Infosys has proposed to set up two SEZs — one each in Kancheepuram and Pune — according to the agenda paper of the board meeting.
The total proposed investment for Pune project is  ₹361.53 crore, while it is  ₹336 crore for the Kancheepuram project.
Infosys has sought formal approval for setting up a sector specific SEZ for IT/ITeS at Kancheepuram district in Tamil Nadu over an area of 5.37 hectares.
The Pune project is proposed at 10 hectares of land.
According to the agenda paper, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd has sought formal approval from the government to set up IT/ITeS zone in Tamil Nadu.
""TCS Ltd has proposed to invest  ₹900 crore in this zone and provide employment to about 12,000 persons,"" it said.
The company has requested to allow for setting up of unit with an initial development centre and start the business operations before the deadline of March 31, 2020.
All these three proposals are placed before the board for their consideration, it added.
Further, the Tripura Industrial Development Centre too has sought approval for setting up SEZ for agro-based food processing sector over an area of 16.35 hectares in the state.
The estimated investment for the project is  ₹1,550 crore.
SEZs are demanding support, including removal of minimum alternate tax, from the government with a view to boost outbound shipments from these zones.
SEZs are major export hubs in the country as the government provides several incentives and single-window clearance system.
Exports from these zones stood at over  ₹7 trillion in 2018-19"
40,2019-11-13,Infosys,"Infosys has long been an exemplar of good corporate citizenship, and for good reason too. While it contends with the whiff of yet another alleged scandal, let’s not jump to prejudge it

When seven engineers founded Infosys in 1981 with just about $250 as startup capital, they would hardly have expected it to achieve iconic status as a company. But Infosys did. In the process, it didn’t just help galvanize India’s information technology industry, it served as a beacon for Indian entrepreneurship. Its founders went on to become very rich, but did not give up their modest lifestyles. The company acquired an aura for middle-class India. It soon came to represent success by the dint of people’s brilliance and hard work, with integrity and transparency as guiding principles. All this, even as it blazed a trail in various aspects of business, be it its generous sharing of the money being made with employees, or its early adoption of global accounting practices. Its very image has been instrumental in granting it a market edge. By attracting the best software talent, it has been able to offer services across the world at competitive prices. Significantly, its rise has given legions of startups the confidence to harbour global ambitions. Little wonder that its leaders, such as N.R. Narayana Murthy and Nandan Nilekani, have cult followings.
It’s not as if Infosys never had critics. Its strategy for high-end consultancy was once panned as timid, for example, as also its aversion to acquisitions. Some saw its pricing formula as flawed. But few saw any reason not to trust the company—till it was hit by a whistle-blower scandal that led to the exit of a chief executive officer (CEO), its first who was not a member of the founding team. Vishal Sikka, who had come aboard from SAP in 2014 as CEO, departed in 2017 amid a raging controversy over issues of corporate governance. In focus was a $220 million acquisition made in 2015, for which it allegedly overpaid, and an unusually high severance package given to a chief financial officer (CFO) said to be well-acquainted with the deal. The CEO’s high salary had also become a sore point. Just when stability seemed to have returned, Infosys was struck by another set of whistle-blower allegations last month. Sikka’s successor Salil Parekh and the current CFO are alleged to have fudged some numbers to inflate the company’s performance. As before, suspicions have arisen of a top-level failure of corporate governance.
Though the latest charges are still under investigation, many investors and well-wishers seem deeply disappointed by the latest turn of events. Some seem so let down that they are lending an ear to anything that smacks of untrustworthiness at Infosys. Earlier this week, another whistle-blower letter went public. This turned out to be a simple gripe by an employee about the CEO’s travel expenses—which appear rather low by global corporate standards. Even though the world of technology is in flux, a vast sum of shareholder value is at stake, and Infosys’s strategic direction is crucial, not everyone appreciates the role a CEO must play. It is hard to escape the sense that the company is in the throes of a cultural shakeup, with some of its staff seeing every departure from the frugality of past leaders as a violation of core principles. Every company needs to adapt to the market forces it is subject to. Of course, this must strictly be done within the law. If any wrongdoing is established, action needs to be taken. But until then, tarnishing Infosys would be unfair. It deserves a chance to live up to the respect it has earned."

New Delhi: Shares of Infosys Limited ended nearly 2% lower on Wednesday, a day after the company received a second undated whistleblower letter accusing Chief Executive Officer Salil Parekh of committing misdeeds. Sentiment for the stock was hit further after the stock exchanges sought clarification from the company on the fresh complaint.
The stock closed at  ₹691.25 on the BSE on Wednesday.
On the BSE, 620,340 shares of the company changed hands today, while 9.97 million shares were traded on the National Stock Exchange.
The letter, which surfaced on Tuesday, urged the chairman and board of directors of the company to take action against the CEO.
Addressed to Infosys chairman and co-founder Nandan Nilekani and independent directors on the board, the letter alleged that Parekh has been operating out of Mumbai. As per the company policy, the CEO has to be based in Bengaluru. The letter also accused Parekh of eroding the value system of the company.
The whistleblower, who claims to be an employee in Infosys’ finance department, said he was afraid to disclose his identity as he feared retaliation.
On 22 October, Infosys, in a filing to the exchanges, had said it had received anonymous complaints alleging Parekh and Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy of accounting malpractices and hiding information from auditors in order to boost revenue and margin. Infosys has appointed law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas to investigate these claims."
44,2019-11-13,Infosys,"MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.2%Retail inflation or consumer price index (CPI) data will be released today

Mumbai: Indian stock markets are likely to be under pressure following weak global cues and deteriorating domestic macro data. Asian stocks and Wall Street futures fell on Wednesday on growing worries US-China trade talks may be stalled after US President Donald Trump failed to deliver any new information about when the two countries would sign a trade deal.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.2%. Australian shares were down 0.17%, while Japan's Nikkei slid 0.38%.
The dollar drifted in Asia after Trump said a trade deal was “close"" but gave no new details on when or where an agreement would be signed, disappointing investors in what was billed as a major speech on his administration’s economic policies. Trump also rattled investors by threatening China with even more tariffs if it does not sign a deal.
Expectations for a “phase one"" trade deal some time this month have been a key factor supporting stocks and riskier assets recently. However, the lack of material progress on an agreement has only increased doubts about whether a trade deal will take place at all.
The US stock futures fell 0.14% in Asia after the S&P 500 eked out 0.16% gain on Tuesday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit all-time highs during trading on Tuesday but stocks ended off the session’s high after Trump's speech.
Washington and Beijing have imposed tariffs on each other’s goods in a bitter dispute over Chinese trade practices that the Trump administration says are unfair. The standoff has roiled global financial markets and raised the risk of recession for some economies as global trade slows.
In recent weeks, both sides have indicated they were making progress towards an agreement that would potentially scale back some tariffs, but a lack of additional information is starting to unsettle some investors in equities and other riskier assets.
In a reminder of the potential for further friction, Trump said on Tuesday he would raise tariffs on Chinese goods “very substantially"" if China does not agree to a deal. “And that’s going to be true for other countries that mistreat us too,"" he added.
Back home, retail inflation or consumer price index (CPI) data will be released today. India’s factory output shrank for the second straight month at 4.3% in September, recording its worst show since the present series was launched in April 2012.
Among stocks, Yes Bank is likely to be in focus. According to a Mint report, Sunil Munjal, chairman of Hero Corporate Services Ltd, and Hemendra Kothari, veteran investment banker and founder of DSP Group, have held separate talks with Yes Bank Ltd to purchase stakes of 5-10% each in the cash-starved private lender. If both investments proceed, the bank could receive a total of up to  ₹3,500 crore.
Infosys Ltd has received a second whistleblower complaint accusing chief executive Salil Parekh of misdemeanours, days after a similar letter prompted the company’s board to institute an independent probe. The second whistleblower urged the chairman and directors to act against Parekh.
In currencies, the dollar was just a shade lower at 108.99 yen, pulling away slightly from a five-month high reached no 7 November.
The yield on benchmark 10-year US Treasury notes rose slightly to 1.9277% but is likely to move in a narrow range before key data due later Wednesday that is likely to show US consumer prices accelerated slightly in October.
Oil prices fell as diminishing prospects of an immediate resolution to a 16-month long trade war between the world’s two-largest economies suggested less demand for energy in the future. The US crude dipped 0.25% to $56.66 a barrel due to worries about weakening demand for oil.

The former Chief Financial Officer of IT major Infosys Ltd termed these job losses as once-in-five-years normal phenomenon with maturing of the industry.

BENGALURU :
Infosys Ltd co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan, who is also the chairman of startup accelerator Axilor Ventures and a trustee of the Infosys Science Foundation, is a thought leader in technology and innovation. On the sidelines of this year’s Infosys Prize event, he comments about science and research in India, the gaps, and the role startups can play in bridging them. Edited excerpts:
What’s the funding scenario in science and research in India?
It is certainly lower than what it should be in terms of quality and quantity. But there is clearly a transition to where the value is in the value chain of a product or a service that we use today. And that value is shifting to information, knowledge, data, algorithms, software, and that’s the reason why we need to do our own research. The government funding is increasing now. For instance, in the Union budget, they have talked about the National Research Foundation, as well as increasing the funding to  ₹20,000 crore which would approximately be 1% of the GDP. We need to increase our private funding from 0.1% of GDP currently to 1.5% of GDP in a stepwise manner.
Which are the technology areas you see certain gaps in and where we need to work on?
We need to work on the technologies that are going to impact us in the next 20-30 years—all the way from artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, of course, smartphones, and internet of things (IoT). We also need to look at genomics, DNA sequencing, 3D printing, nano technology, etc. There’s so many new areas that are emerging at this point. Then there are other areas which will come up as we go forward, for example, quantum computing.
How do you see startups playing a role in India’s innovation in science and research?
All innovation starts with research. Then you create a proof of concept of some of the things to see how they can be converted into a product or a solution or something like that. If it is a good product or solution, you will get funded by external investors and you become a startup. Let’s take, for instance, the transition to electric vehicles. The existing companies are primarily focused on their current generation of technology, the current customers they have. And some of them are now transitioning but since five years or even earlier, we are having startups in electric scooters, electric three-wheelers and even four-wheelers such as Reva in Bengaluru. Startups typically bring out products first in the market before they become big or get acquired. So, startups do play a role in bringing new technologies into the market.
What are the ways in which we can bridge the gaps in science and research in India?
We need to improve on both the quality and quantity of research we do so that we can compete with the best in the world. For a country of our size, we should be producing more number of research papers, technology-based products, etc. We need to see how we can increase the number of institutions that can be world class. We need to look at more interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary work. For example, professor G. Mugesh of Indian Institute of Science (IISc) who won this year’s Infosys prize in the Physical Sciences category is working at the intersection of chemistry and biology. We also need to have strong industry academia partnerships."

30,2019-11-20,Infosys,"Infosys said all material information has been disclosed by the company as per Sebi norms and the firm's materiality policyInfosys said it remains available to provide any additional information or clarification, if required

NEW DELHI :
Infosys has clarified that recent media reports, which claimed that the company is hit by a fresh whistleblower complaint, refer to substantially the same charges made in the plaint that was disclosed by the IT firm last month.
Stock exchanges last week had sought clarification from the company over the media reports that suggested the company was 'hit by another whistleblower complaint against Salil Parekh'.
""...it is clarified that the media reports refer to substantially the same allegations made in the undated whistleblower complaint referred to in the disclosure made by the company on October 22, 2019, to the stock exchanges,"" Infosys informed the bourses on Tuesday.
It further added that all material information has been disclosed by the company as per Sebi norms and the firm's materiality policy.
""The company remains available to provide any additional information or clarification, if required,"" it noted.
The clarification on Tuesday came in the backdrop of reports last week that had given ""an impression that a fresh whistleblower complaint has been made against the CEO of the company"".
Following the reports, the BSE had sought an explanation from the company on the issue.
In October, Infosys had informed the stock exchanges of having received anonymous whistleblowers' complaints alleging certain unethical practices by the top management.
Infosys Chairman Nandan Nilekani had said the whistleblower complaint dated September 20, as well as an undated complaint had been received by one of the board members on September 30.
In the letter, dated September 20, and signed by 'Ethical Employees', it was alleged that CEO Salil Parikh as well as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Nilanjan Roy engaged in forced revenue recognition from large contracts not adhering to accounting standards.
The complaints were placed before the audit committee on October 10, and to the company's non-executive board members on October 11, also the day when Infosys announced its second quarter results.
US market regulator SEC has also initiated a probe on the matter, while Rosen Law Firm had said it was preparing a class-action suit to recover losses suffered by Infosys investors in the US.
Back home, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had sought additional information from the company, while the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) - part of the corporate affairs ministry - is also looking into alleged accounting lapses at the firm.

29,2019-11-21,Infosys,"Regulator moves to tighten norms on loan defaults, rights issues and portfolio managementSebi said it is working on ways to make listed firms more serious about whistleblower complaints

Mumbai: The capital market regulator has tightened disclosure norms for reporting loan defaults, a move that will help investors draw an informed conclusion about a firm’s financial health and prevent a sudden erosion of their wealth when such an event is discovered—as was the case in recent instances.
Any default in repayment of principal or interest to lenders by listed companies which continues beyond 30 days from the pre-agreed payment date will have to be disclosed to shareholders within 24 hours of such an event, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in a statement after a board meeting on Wednesday. The rule will take effect on 1 January.
“Sebi’s move will address the information asymmetry currently existing in the public markets to a fair extent. It will be less drastic than the previous attempt which triggered disclosure of default of one rupee for one day to the present one of 30 days,"" said Sandeep Parekh, managing partner, Finsec Law Advisors. “This will also minimize a false alarm where a technical default occurs because of some minor payment problem.""
Over the past year, several listed entities have defaulted on their loan repayments but failed to disclose these to investors.
The revelations, whenever they happened, resulted in a sharp decline in prices of securities issued by them. Currently, there is no Sebi norm that requires any listed entity or its promoters to disclose repayment defaults to the market.
Instances of loan defaults have increased since financier Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd defaulted on its payment obligations last year.
More recently, Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd, among listed companies, has defaulted on repayments to lenders. Others who have defaulted on repayments over the past year are Jet Airways, Reliance Capital and Reliance Communications .
Sebi’s new mandate on default disclosure norms comes after two years of back and forth with companies, banks and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In an earlier version, borrowers were required to disclose even a one-day default. The change to 30 days addresses criticism that a one-day default could be on technical grounds and may not be material.
Mint had first reported on 28 February 2018 that Sebi was considering 30 days as the threshold.
The market watchdog also said that it is working on ways to make listed firms more serious about whistleblower complaints and disclose such complaints on exchanges if the allegations or its implications are material.
“If the whistleblower complaint is based on serious allegations and is proved with concrete evidences, Sebi will take it very seriously, investigate into the matter and ensure that the company’s board discloses about such a complaint to investors,"" said Sebi chairman Ajay Tyagi.
Recently, a whistleblower complaint was filed against the CEO of Infosys Ltd and some of its top officials. The whistleblower alleged the board of Infosys did not disclose the whistleblower complaint while announcing the company’s earnings; when a news report revealed it, the Infosys stock tanked.
On Wednesday, Sebi also reduced the timeline for completion of rights issues by listed companies. At present, a firm is required to complete its rights issue within 55 days from the date of the opening of the issue. Sebi has reduced this to 31 days.
The market watchdog has also changed norms on portfolio management.
The capital market regulator increased a portfolio manager’s net worth requirement from  ₹2 crore to  ₹5 crore. Existing portfolio managers need to meet the enhanced requirement within three years, it said.
Sebi also doubled the minimum investment requirement in portfolio management service funds to  ₹50 lakh."
28,2019-11-21,Infosys,"The comments come in the wake of the scrutiny at Infosys following yet another whistleblower allegation on the veracity of the accountsAsk him or ask god...investors can draw their own conclusions: Mohandas Pai

Mumbai: Companies need to be forthcoming on allaying specific concerns after whistleblower allegations and not resort to ""rhetoric"" like invoking god to defend, former Infosysian TV Mohandas Pai said on Thursday.
The comments come in the wake of the scrutiny at Infosys following yet another whistleblower allegation on the veracity of the accounts, and chairman Nandan Nilekani's assertions that even god cannot change the accounts at Infosys.
Even Sebi chairman Ajay Tyagi was not very enthused with Nilekani's statement on November 8, saying only god or Nilekani himself can comment on the same.
""Ask him or ask god...investors can draw their own conclusions. Whatever we have to do, we are doing,"" Tyagi told reporters a day after Nilekani vouched the veracity of the numbers at an investor concall.
""These are all rhetorical statements like trusting god, Pai, who was a chief financial officer at Infy, told PTI on the sidelines of an event organised by a former Sebi chairman M Damodaran.
""You can't make it a bland statement on 'we have done this and we are following that process' because people are concerned over the concerns,"" Pai said, adding the specific concerns needs to be allayed.
He said the board has to decide on the ""materiality"" of a particular complaint and decide whether to disclose the same or not. It should also be aware of the power of social media, and arm itself with concrete data to address the concerns, and communicate the same to stakeholders, he said.
Matters like sexual harassment, conduct of the chief executive or related-party transactions have to be addressed with utmost urgency, he said, and pointed out that since whistleblowers fill the information asymmetry, they are an important aspect of corporate governance.
Earlier this month, an unidentified whistleblower had alleged that Infosys chief executive Salil Parekh and chief financial officer Nilanjan Roy were fudging numbers to show better revenue and margins.
Pai also supported Sebi's call on segregating the posts of chairmen and MDs of listed companies.

New Delhi: Shares of information technology (IT) companies fell on Friday on reports of changes in US work visa - H-1B - requirements aimed at protecting local workers.
At 12:45 pm, Infosys was down 3.1% at  ₹691.95. Tech Mahindra fell 2.4%, and HCL Technologies and Tata Consultancy Services were down nearly 2% each.
The BSE Information Technology index also fell over 2% at 14,880.19 points. Overall, BSE Sensex was 0.6% down at 40,351.17 points while NSE was at 11,900.95.
H-1B is the most sought-after visa that Indian IT companies use to deploy their Indian staff on overseas projects. It allows them to deploy cheaper Indian staff on overseas projects, helping them save on salary bills. H-1B visa costs account for a significant chunk of IT companies’ expenses.
According to news reports, the US Department of Homeland Security proposes to revise the definition of specialty occupation to “increase focus on obtaining the best and the brightest foreign nationals via the H-1B program."" The proposed changes are aimed at protecting US workers and their wages.
The H-1B visa application process has become more complex for employers worldwide, including Indian IT companies, due to recent administrative changes in the H-1B programme which has increased documentation requirements for petitioners. Recently, as part of its revised selection process, the US hiked the application fee of the H-1B visa by $10."

RIL: Sony Corporation is in talks with Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL)-promoted Network18 Media and Investments Ltd. According to a Bloomberg report, the Japanese media major plans to tap the booming demand for content in the country. Sony is currently conducting due diligence on Network18 ahead of a likely offer. Sony is also considering several deal structures, including a bid for the company or a merger of its own business in India with Network18’s entertainment channels.
Infosys: Companies need to be forthcoming on allaying concerns after whistleblower allegations and not resort to “rhetoric"" like invoking god to defend, former director TV Mohandas Pai said on Thursday. This comes at a time when the IT major is carrying investigation into alleged whistleblower complaints against the top management for accounting malpractices, and chairman Nandan Nilekani’s assertions that even god can’t change the numbers at Infosys Ltd.
Zee Entertainment: Promoter Subhash Chandra sold 16.5% stake in the media conglomerate to financial investors to raise funds and repay dues of lenders. The stake was sold in a series of negotiated block deals on Thursday to Singapore’s GIF, US investment management company Blackrock, HSBC Global, Capital Research, Norges Bank, Marshall Wace, Wellington Management, SBI Mutual Fund and ICICI Prudential, according to data on the exchanges. Chandra’s shareholding is down to 5% after the stake sale.
Maruti Suzuki: The auto major will introduce a BS-6 petrol version of its two models—Brezza and S-Cross—before 1 April 2020. According to a PTI report, the new Bharat Stage (BS) 6 fuel emission norms will kick in from 1 April, 2020. Auto manufacturers will have to wait for another two-three months to say if the country’s automobile industry has been able to come out of slowdown.
Tech Mahindra: The IT services firm on Thursday said it has signed an agreement with Business Finland for research and development in 5G and 6G. Tech Mahindra Ltd will develop, pilot and implement state-of-the-art digital products and services to foster growth, productivity and innovations in the area of 5G and 6G, a statement said.
Tata Motors: Jaguar Land Rover’s chief executive Ralf Speth said he is open to more alliances to lower the costs of developing technology, but is not looking at a full-blown corporate merger. According to a Reuters report, Speth said the luxury car maker and its parent Tata Motors Ltd are not seeking a merger opportunity with Jaguar Land Rover, the sales and revenue of which are now improving in its largest global market China.
Telcos: Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on Thursday asked telecom companies to submit, on a monthly basis, lists of permanently disconnected mobile numbers on the authority’s website to enable companies that use subscriber mobile numbers for identification and authentication to keep systems updated. Investors may watch Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd on the news.
BPCL: The company was the biggest laggard among Nifty 50 companies in Thursday’s trade despite the government approving the privatisation of state-owned fuel retailer. Investors may have negatively taken the government’s decision to hive off one of the company’s refineries Numaligarh Refinery Ltd in Assam that will later become a part of another public-sector company. Carving out a refinery from a total of four would mean taking a hit on the valuation.
Tata Power: The company on Thursday raised  ₹1,500 crore by issuing unsecured, non-cumulative, redeemable, taxable, listed, rated non-convertible debentures (NCDs) on a private placement basis. It has issued 15,000 NCDs worth  ₹1,500 crore, the company said in a BSE filing. The NCDs would be listed on WDM or wholesale debt market segment of the NSE, the company added.

22,2019-11-25,Infosys,"They do not seem to have engaged startups with the same urgency as foreign firms

It is now becoming better accepted that India’s engine of growth for the future will be driven by its entrepreneurial class, and that the “organized sector"", as generally defined, will be less of a contributor to future growth. This is coupled with the fact that the country’s other large employer, our government, has realized that privatization of assets is the way forward, as evidenced by recent news reports of public sector disinvestment of state-owned companies.
Nasscom recently released a report on startups in India. The study indicates that more than 1,300 startups have been set up thus far in 2019 and that their number has been growing at a healthy clip of 12-15% over the past five years. Seven of these startups reached “unicorn"" status this year (a unicorn is a start-up whose private market valuation is greater than $1 billion), and 24 of these companies are already active in India. The report also counts 60,000 new jobs directly added by these startups, with a knock-on effect of twice-to-thrice that number of indirect jobs getting created. In what is good news to a deep tech/science investor like me, the report says that the share of these startups leveraging deep tech has grown by a compounded annual rate of 40% since 2014 to over 1,600.
It is also evident that startup founders who have successfully cashed out of their first forays are now reinvesting at least some of those proceeds in the startup ecosystem. For instance, over 20 startups were founded by former members of Zoho’s team and over 10 startups by the alumni of FreshWorks.
Outside India, large organizations are engaging startups in growing numbers. This willingness to engage with the startup ecosystem is in part due to a general realization among senior management that their companies are not “agile"" and, as a result, not organized efficiently enough to respond timely to fast-paced technological change.
In addition to the slew of quarter-by-quarter investor demands, employees who have been coddled by an internal bureaucracy pose significant resistance to change in existing corporate cultures. While some lip service has been paid to “internal disruption"", the truth is that the lumbering nature of large enterprises makes them ill-equipped to handle innovation. Engaging with startups instead makes more sense for most large organizations, given that while startups tend to explore low-margin, high-risk and small-market propositions at first, such efforts do not support short-term company growth targets. Given time and money, they may well “disrupt"" or shrink the market share of today’s large firms a few years later, though.
There are many ways for established companies to engage startups. The first is through corporate venture funds and accelerators. These need clear objectives and often require a leader from outside the organization. Balancing collaboration with operational independence from the mother entity is crucial. Other popular modes of engagement are for corporations to pitch their problems to startups, asking for solutions, and offer themselves as early customers so as to gain insights into emerging technologies and guide their product evolution processes.
There are two examples from Germany that have been in the news recently: Bayer, with its focused programme to engage digital health startups called Grants4Apps, and BMW’s Start-Up Garage programme, which offers startups an opportunity to gain BMW as an early client.
Interestingly though, India’s corporate houses don’t seem to have responded with the same level of urgency as their foreign counterparts. Nasscom’s report suggests that 90% of the corporate investors who are active in equity funding are global multinational corporations. Further, while there were about 35 acquisitions in 2018 and 2019, it appears that it is mainly Reliance Industries that has increased its acquisitions this year.
Also, some casual research on participation from Nasscom’s original member firms, such as the big five Indian information technology (IT) service providers, throws up interesting findings. These stack up quite differently from the efforts of Big Tech firms.
In addition to Bayer and BMW, Microsoft, Google and Amazon are extremely active in the space. All three of these Big Tech firms actively provide credits to startups to use their colossal cloud computing environments. They also provide financial assistance via investment through corporate venture funding arms, in addition to assistance via joint go-to-market and sales enablement. For a startup focused on a business-to-business (B2B) technology value proposition, a joint go-to-market offer from a firm like Microsoft, which has an almost unassailable market share for its Windows products, can prove irresistible. The Redmond, Washington-based tech behemoth, is willing to provide over $120,000 in credits for the use of its Azure cloud platform for qualified startups to boot.
By contrast, IT services players such as Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys primarily engage startups via financial assistance through corporate venture capital and by granting them access to their client network. They lack the extra cloud operation platforms that are critical to getting startups up and running in the first place. These IT firms may risk getting left behind, given the attractiveness of Big Tech’s value propositions to B2B startups. It might be time for many companies to rethink their engagement of startups, especially in India.

20,2019-11-26,Infosys,"The current legal framework is based on the assumption that whistle-blowing is always done for good reason

The allegations made by whistle-blowers against Infosys chief executive officer Salil Parekh have turned the spotlight on rules related to India’s whistle-blower policy. A part of both the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) regulations as well as the Companies Act, 2013, India’s current policy calls for every listed company and companies of certain classes to establish a vigil mechanism and set up an audit committee for any serious complaints related to impropriety and wrongdoing at the management level.
In the Infosys case, two letters from whistle-blowers have surfaced, one of them written by a group calling themselves “ethical employees"". The second letter that recently appeared in the media is quite frivolous in nature and talks about such trivialities as Parekh’s travel expenses on trips made between Mumbai and Bengaluru.
The policy has enough in-built safeguards for the protection of a whistle-blower. Under it, no proceedings can be initiated against the whistle-blower pending an inquiry into allegations made by him or her. The policy has rules that protect the whistle-blower’s anonymity, among other interests.
Having enough safeguards in the system to protect whistle-blowers is a must, and the government and several of its agencies have put considerable thought into making the process foolproof, and rightly so, given that more than half the companies of the Nifty 50 stock market index have got a cumulative 4,552 whistle-blower complaints for 2018-19, almost 30% higher than the previous financial year.
However, when it turns out to be a case of frivolous, motivated or mala fide complaints, the policy does not provide enough justice to secure the interests of India Inc. The rules and consequences in the policy are not very clear in such cases. The current rules may even go against the very interests of companies, especially if they are multinational and listed on bourses.
Even if rare, a whistle-blower could have mala fide intentions, such as manipulating the company stock or settling a personal vendetta, or even playing into the hands of former related parties. It is well-understood that corporations are likely to be prone to motivated agendas. The whistle-blower, as defined under the law, could be anyone—a current employee of the company, an ex-employee, a current or a former contractor, shareholder, an auditor, a lawyer, or even someone from the media.
Section 177 of the Companies Act, 2013, which deals with the vigil mechanism/whistle-blower policy, says that in case of repeated frivolous complaints being filed by a director or an employee, the audit committee may take suitable action against the concerned director or employee, including a reprimand. The Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2014, says if a complaint is proven to be frivolous, the complainant can face a jail term of up to two years.
However, this is all in theory. In reality, if it is an anonymous compliant, there is no mechanism in place that can identify the complainant. Even if he is identified, the law does not provide for penal provisions that are stringent enough to act as a deterrent.
Other than the two-year jail term, the Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2014, has an almost negligible fine that a person has to pay if his or her complaint is established as frivolous, and the Companies Act merely says that the management can take suitable action in such cases, with nothing spelt very clearly or defined in detail. The rules prescribed by Sebi do not offer any clarity either.
The cost that a company pays even if a complaint turns out to be mala fide or frivolous could be humongous. Not only does it entail the loss of goodwill for the company and its top brass, but for an entity that is listed, it could also wipe billions of dollars off its market value and impact its overall order book. And all of this might happen even before the investigation is completed and while the jury is still out.
The Infosys stock was down 16% on the day the first whistle-blower letter was leaked to the media. Another point one must understand here is that whenever such material appears in the media, it is usually followed by a lot of speculative angles in newspapers and TV channels which further undermine the position of company. At the same time, it stifles the day-to-day functioning of the organization. Unfortunately, the impact of ill-motivated complaints on the corporate world has not yet adequately been debated and addressed, nor has it been a priority for any government body dealing with issues related to corporate governance.
The current law does not provide any remedy for companies if the allegations levelled are found false. It wouldn’t be inaccurate to say that India’s whistle-blower policy mechanism doesn’t work in a well balanced way. It is tilted in favour of whistle-blowers. It seems to be based on the assumption that whistle-blowing is always done for good reason, and is rarely motivated or frivolous.
The government needs to think about this, as the ramifications of such instances could be devastating for companies and go as far as capital markets taking a hit. There are several existing committees and panels, both within the Sebi framework and the ministry of corporate affairs, that could take this up and clear the air. A lot is at stake for companies. In the past, the government has been quite proactive in dealing with the larger policy issues that have affected India Inc. This matter deserves attention too.

BENGALURU :
Account aggregators will see “dramatic consumption"" in the next 2-3 years in India, Nandan Nilekani, chairman of Infosys Ltd and former chairperson of Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) said at the ongoing Global Technology Summit in Bengaluru.
In 2016, the central bank had approved a new class of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) called account aggregators which would facilitate consented sharing of financial information in real time. It is like a broker taking user permission to access their financial accounts and aggregate and organise all their financial information in one place.
Till date, seven account aggregators have in-principle approval from the central bank while one of them is on the final stages of going live, Nilekani said.
“The account aggregator is a data access fiduciary. They cannot read or resell consumer data. They enable consumers to selectively share or even revoke data once shared. They have a fiduciary duty to consumers,"" Nilekani said.
For India, rapid adoption of the account aggregator framework could be an opportunity to be a global leader in the digital economy, Nilekani said. “At least 20 other countries are looking to adopt this framework.""
In the long run, account aggregators are intended to make credit accessible to people who are currently not part of the credit ecosystem and help them become part of the formal financial system.
The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Personal Data Protection Bill which is expected to lay down a framework that will include processing of personal and private data by public and private entities, among others."

15,2019-12-10,Infosys,"Talent crunch in new technologies and management changes accelerated attrition at InfosysWith the IT services firm’s investments ebbing, it is well placed to absorb the impact

Infosys Ltd’s shares have recovered about 60% from the lows of  ₹635 apiece touched after news of a whistleblower complaint surfaced. While none of the charges have been substantiated, investors are still hedging some of their bets.
Meanwhile, news reports suggest the company is fighting another battle—high attrition among its employees. A news report in the Business Standard said Infosys is offering special incentives to top performers to check attrition.
Attrition has remained steadfastly high at the company. From less than 17% at the beginning of FY18, annualized attrition rose to 20% in Q1 of FY19 and remained at that level ever since.
Given that the payouts are confined to less than 3-4% of the employee base, the incremental impact on the wage bill should not be more than 30 basis points, says an analyst, on condition of anonymity. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. In any case, the cost of salaries to offshore employees is only about 20% of revenue.
Further, with recent measures beginning to yield results—reflective in sequential improvement in operating margins in Q2—Infosys can afford to share the benefits with the employees, says the analyst.
In a post-earnings call with analysts in October, chief executive officer Salil Parekh said the investments made by the company after his appointment are complete. The focus on cost and operational improvement measures are yielding benefits. Although Infosys refrained from providing guidance beyond the current fiscal year, it alluded to better profitability in the second half of FY20. “(In) H1 we are (at) 21.1%, we are within the (guidance) band and I think this is a good place to grow from here and that is what we are looking at,"" the management told analysts.
The commentary on investments and near-term profitability has led to the belief that profitability is on the mend at Infosys. “We reckon that margin bottomed out in 1QFY20 and expect a steady trajectory as the investments start yielding results,"" HDFC Securities Institutional Research said in a note last month.
As the company stepped up investments, operating profit margins dropped from 24.7% at the end of FY18 to 20.5% in June this year (Q1 FY20). In the September quarter, they improved to 21.7%.
The recent recalibration towards digital technologies and pressure on traditional business impacted profitability across firms. But the impact was more pronounced at Infosys. Industry leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd saw a margin impact of less than 1.5 percentage points from end-FY18 to June quarter this year.
While high attrition may warrant elevated payouts from Infosys, as pointed earlier, the impact on overall costs will be contained as only a small proportion of employees will be covered. The worry is whether the recent happenings at the company with regards to the whistleblower complaint result in some churn at the top. While there is no evidence of this happening, investors appear to be hedging their bets, suggests the Infosys stock.
More clarity will emerge when the company releases the current quarter’s earnings."

LOS ANGELES :
The Schall Law Firm, a shareholder rights litigation firm based in Los Angeles has announced the filing of a class action lawsuit against Infosys Limited.
According to the complaint, Infosys made false and misleading statements to the market and used improper recognition of revenue to boost short-term profits.
This comes months after a whistleblower complained against Infosys and its CEO Salil Parekh on the similar lines. However, the company later after an investigation said it could not find the evidence.
The complaint in the US said CEO Parekh skipped standard reviews of large deals to avoid accounting scrutiny. In fact, the company's finance team was pressured to hide details of these deals and other accounting matters from auditors and the company's Board of Directors.
""Based on these facts, the company's public statements were false and materially misleading throughout the class period. When the market learned the truth about Infosys, investors suffered damages"", a statement by the law firm said.
Schall said it encourages investors with losses in excess of $100,000 to contact the firm.
The class action lawsuit against Infosys Limited listed on NYSE for violations of 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

However, the central bank removed an earlier reference to “uncertainties"" and said that it will continue to monitor the implications of data for the economic outlook “including global developments and muted inflation pressures.

WASHINGTON :
Infosys, India's top IT major, has agreed to pay $800,000 to settle allegations of misclassification of foreign workers and tax fraud, officials announced Tuesday.
Infosys will pay California USD 800,000 (nearly  ₹56 crore) to resolve allegations that between 2006 and 2017, approximately 500 Infosys employees were working in the State on Infosys-sponsored B-1 visas rather than H-1B visas, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said.
This misclassification resulted in Infosys avoiding California payroll taxes such as the unemployment insurance, disability insurance, and employment training taxes.
H-1B visas also require employers to pay workers at the local prevailing wage, an official statement said.
""Today’s settlement shows that attempting to evade California law doesn't pay. Infosys brought in workers on the wrong visas in order to underpay them and avoid paying taxes. With this settlement, California has been made whole,"" Becca said.
In the settlement, Infosys, however, denied the allegations and asserted of no wrongdoings.
In 2017, Infosys had agreed to pay the State of New York USD 1 million to settle allegations of submitting wrong documents to federal authorities.
The Californian settlement that was carried out in November was released to the media on Tuesday.
California initiated legal actions against Infosys after a compliant was filed by whistleblower Jack ""Jay"" Palmer, a former Infosys employee.

Infosys currently has five functional CDCs that offer managed security services to its global clients. Pune, Hyderabad and Bucharest (Romania) have a centre each and there are two in Bengaluru.
“Our global CDCs are powered with cyber next platform and delivering 24x7 next-gen managed security services with a combined capacity of 1,000+ seats,"" Salvi said.
Cyber security skills are in “huge demand"" and therefore it’s a “zero bench situation"" as far as cyber skills are concerned, Salvi said. “The investments in cyber security controls are on a rise year-on-year and that is because, organisations are considering cyber security investments very strategic for their current and future business.""
Then, reskilling is done through “training, certification and constant development of skills in specific technology and domains like IDAM (identity and access management), infrastructure security, SIEM (security information and event management), SOAR (security orchestration, automation and response), etc,"" Salvi said.
Finally, constant upskilling is done on niche technology training and enablement such as cloud, operational technology/internet of things, blockchain, and 5G, Salvi said. “We partner with 50+ global technology partners in cyber security with whom we create constant learning and development calendar.""
Traditionally demand for Infosys’ cyber security solutions came mainly from the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector, but the trend is changing.
According to Salvi, “cyber security is not priority of any one particular segment anymore.""
“Due to the indiscriminate nature of ransomware attacks, we have seen an exponential rise in manufacturing, healthcare, mining, retail etc. and now all the investments are on par across all the industries,"" he added.
While Infosys doesn’t classify cyber security as a separate business vertical, its revenues are reported under the digital business which grew 38.4% year-on-year to $1.23 billion (38.3% of total revenue)."

BENGALURU :
It is not the first time that global software major Infosys has opted for out-of-court settlements in lawsuits on alleged violation of federal laws or visa rules.
On Tuesday, the IT behemoth made an out-of-court settlement for $800,000 ( ₹5.7 crore) with the California Attorney General on charges related to alleged violation of B-1 visa rules by it.
The charges include employing about 500 Infosys staff in California on B-1 visas rather than H-1B visas between 2006 and 2017.
According to California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, the gross violation of federal laws resulted in Infosys avoiding the western state's payroll taxes such as unemployment insurance, disability insurance and employment training taxes.
""H-1B visas also require employers to pay workers at the local prevailing wage,"" said Becerra in a statement accessed by IANS.
""Two years ago, Infosys paid $1 million in settlement for systematically abusing US visa rules in placing foreign workers at client sites in New York state,"" former New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman had said in June 2017.
The former state prosecutor had alleged that the city-based outsourcing firm did not pay wages to its workers it placed in New York jobs and skipped paying the taxes owed on them.
""The outsourcing firm has significant presence in the New York state, offering consulting and outsourcing services to several financial sector clients and other industries,"" recalled Schneiderman.
""Infosys gave instructions to its employees on B-1 visas on how to deceive the US consulate, customs and border protection officers. It also created a 'dos and don'ts' list for its techies to hoodwink the US authorities and avoid talking about what they were doing,"" Schneiderman pointed out.
Similarly, six years ago, the US Department of Justice in the Eastern District of Texas issued a statement on October 30, 2013 that Infosys paid a record $34 million to settle systemic visa fraud and immigration processes abuse.
The US Attorney John Bales in the Department of Justice in Plano, Texas, said the Indian firm was cognisant of unlawfully deploying non-US workers under the B-1 visa category to perform skilled labour, reserved for US nationals or legitimate H1-B visa holders.
""Infosys resorted to such unlawful actions to increase profits, minimise costs of securing visas, increase flexibility of employee movement, obtain an unfair advantage over competitors, and avoid tax liabilities,"" Bales had alleged in a statement then.
According to the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), B-1 visa is issued to temporary business visitors for participating in business activities of commercial or professional nature.
The short-term visa offers 1-6 months of initial period of stay in the US, which can be extended by another 6 months.
Way back, in a sexual harassment case, the company had struck an out-of-court settlement for $3 million in 2003 to settle a lawsuit against its former board director Phaneesh Murthy.
In that settlement, Infosys contributed $1.5 million while its insurers coughed up the balance amount ($1.5-million) under the directors' and officers' liability insurance cover.
The $3 million settlement was entered into with Bulgarian American national Reka Maximovitch, Murthy's executive secretary, on April 25, 2003 after she sued him for sexual harassment and wrongful termination of employment.
The Murthy-Maximovitch case also played out in California, in which the insurers chipped in with 80 per cent of the $9,00,000 legal fees the company incurred."

Leading a Nifty rally, three among these advanced 38 to 50 per cent in the last one year. Market participants are now guessing who would be the next set of stocks leading the rally.
A section of traders is betting on SALMAN -- SBI, Axis Bank, Larsen and Toubro, Maruti Suzuki, Adani Ports and National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) -- to lead the next rally.
The Brokerages have maintained 'BUY' on SBI, betting on a recovery in India's growth momentum. Nomura had said SBI's Q2 asset quality beat its estimates. SBI gained over 12 per cent in the past one year, and closed on Friday at  ₹337.25 a share.
The asset quality of the bank improved with gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio coming in at 7.19 per cent, down 276 bps yearly and 34 bps sequentially.
Axis Bank, has also been traders and brokerages favourite. The index heavyweight along with RIL, ICICI Bank and HDFC were the preferred pick by the brokerage house CLSA. The bank had reported a consolidated Interest Income of  ₹12,183.88 crore, up 3.89 per cent from last quarter. Axis Bank has gained over 15 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹739 a piece.
The NTPC has also been on the rise after the foreign financial firm Morgan Stanley upgraded the company's shares to 'Overweight' from 'Equal-Weight' earlier. This came on the back of the government's decision to approve strategic disinvestment in the power major.
It had, however, fallen 23.53 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹114.55 a share on Friday.
JPMorgan had recently reiterated 'overweight' rating on Maruti Suzuki and also raised its target price. The largest car manufacturer in India has, however, declined 8.58 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹7,255 a share.
Larsen and Toubro had recently downgraded by Credit Suisse to 'neutral' from outperform and revised target price down to  ₹1460 from  ₹1750. The brokerage has downgraded the stock as macro continues to remain hostile in terms of gap in government finances from tax shortfall and continuing credit growth deceleration.
It has fallen 8.64 per cent in the past year and closed at  ₹1,310.75 a share.
Global brokerage houses are also bullish on Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone despite its quarterly results falling short of market expectations. Macquarie has also raised its target price on Adani. Adani Ports lost a little over one per cent in the last one year of trade and closed at  ₹371.65 a share on Friday."

1,2019-12-29,Infosys,"Banking, financial services, insurance and retail verticals will drag revenue growthRevenue growth of IT services companies in FY21 will decelerate to about 7.5%, according to ICICI Securities

BENGALURU :
Top Indian software services companies are expected to have a tough year in FY21 amid continued weakness in demand from the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) and retail verticals.
“With continued challenges in the capital markets segment and large banks in US/Europe, and heightened volatility in the retail vertical, we clearly expect revenue growth to decelerate in FY21 to about 7.5% in constant currency terms for our large cap coverage,"" ICICI Securities said in a 15 December note. The BFSI sector has been relatively weak for the past few quarters. Tata Consultancy Services’ (TCS’) BFSI vertical witnessed slow single digit growth at 8% year-on-year for the quarter ended September.
For Infosys, BFSI revenue grew slightly higher at 10.3% year-on-year in constant currency terms, which is “pretty decent"", according to an equity analyst. However, he said that “one should also consider that this includes the impact of the Stater acquisition, which obviously boosts growth."" Infosys, which acquired 75% shareholding in ABN AMRO Bank’s wholly owned Stater NV in May, aims to strengthen its position in the mortgage services value chain.
“The financial services vertical continued its growth momentum aided by the recent Stater acquisition,"" U.B. Pravin Rao, chief operating officer, Infosys, said during the September quarter post-earnings call with investors.
“We expect performance in the vertical to be affected in the next couple of quarters driven by seasonality, sluggishness in capital markets and the European banking space. The recent reduction in interest rates in major geographies can have an impact on client revenues, which may also impact their IT spending,"" he said.
Harit Shah, a former equity analyst with Reliance Securities, corroborated Rao’s views. “BFSI spending is seeing some softness mainly in the capital markets segment. With interest rates at very low levels, the impact of trade wars likely to be felt, slowing gross domestic product growth, and overall macro challenges, it is likely that the BFSI spend will remain soft in the near term,"" Shah said.
Revenue from retail grew in single digits across TCS, Infosys, and Wipro at 4.8%, 1.1%, and 6.1%, respectively year-on-year on a constant currency basis for the September quarter. “Retail segment performance was muted as clients turned cautious because of an increase in perceived risks stemming from trade wars and geopolitical developments,"" Rao said about the Q2 earnings of Infosys.
Analysts believe retail will continue to be a drag in the coming quarters. “The IT companies’ commentaries have been soft on the retail sector because of factors such as the US consumer confidence index going down quarter on quarter. Also, the retail sector is creating pricing pressure for IT services firms, especially for the managed services which includes mandatory services such as application development and maintenance,"" said Anmol Garg, equity research analyst, Motilal Oswal Securities.
The digital business will follow the trend in 2019 and continue to drive growth for IT services companies as clients will invest in emerging technologies despite a flat budget. “The IT budget is expected to remain almost flat globally in 2020 for many organizations (based on a survey conducted in 991 organisations globally),"" said D.D. Mishra, senior director analyst, Gartner. However, he said that “net investment in certain areas such as analytics, data and information strategy, application support, and end user computing, across verticals is expected to increase.""
Banks will continue to invest in new technology as part of their digital transformation initiatives, according to a Deloitte Insights report. North American banks are expected to spend 40% of their total IT budget on new technologies in 2020, while European banks would spend about 29%. This number would increase to 48% and 33%, respectively for American and European banks in 2022."
0,2019-12-30,Infosys,"Performance over the past year shows IT companies are withstanding the market changes betterOutperformance of the NSE IT index waned since September, partly because the govt’s tax cuts did not benefit IT firms

The outperformance of the NSE IT index waned in 2019 since September, partly because the government’s tax cuts did not benefit software services companies. But investors are also concerned about the moderation in revenue growth during the year. The NSE IT index had gained 24% in 2018, while the Nifty had risen 4%. So far in 2019, the NSE IT index has risen 9%, whereas the Nifty gained 12%.
The year-on-year constant currency revenue growth of industry leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd dropped to single-digits in the September quarter. Growth at Wipro Ltd remained sluggish. Infosys Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd kept up the momentum during the quarter. But many doubt if the one-off large deals that have powered Indian IT in the past year will be replicated in 2020.
The reasons are partly cyclical. Uncertainty on government spending, taxation and regulation ahead of the US presidential elections in November 2020 can delay decision-making at clients’ end, some fear.
“Besides inherent immigration rhetoric, we find that slow, delayed decision-making by clients in election years (FY09, FY13, FY17) has translated into cyclical growth moderation for the IT services industry,"" BOB Capital Markets Ltd said in a note.
There are structural headwinds as well. Sluggish economic activity and low bond yields in Europe are hurting spends in the key banking and financial services segment. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities warned that if spends of clients facing disruption in their respective industries can take a hit.
“While maturity of digital spends augurs well for medium-term growth delays/decline in spends of challenged clients can create near-term headwinds. Tier 1 IT has provided cautious outlook on near-term growth in spends from the (retail) vertical,"" analysts at Kotak said in a note.
Separately, an analysis of the client financials by Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd shows a steady state at the US banking, financial services, insurance and consumer verticals. But troubles in retail, softness in oil and gas, manufacturing, in Europe means a large part of the IT companies’ target market is facing growth headwinds.
Of course, it is not all gloom and doom. Performance over the past year shows IT companies are withstanding the market challenges better. Digital and new-age services, which are seeing strong client spends, now constitute a large part of the IT companies’ revenues. In the September quarter, more than 38% of Infosys’s revenue came from digital. For TCS, the share stood at 33%.
With deal sizes also increasing, digital has become a key growth driver for Indian IT. However, the rapid expansion of this business has caught companies off-guard on the human resources side. Companies rushing to recruit employees with required skillsets is driving up costs, and hurting profitability. The trajectory of margins is another aspect investors will keenly track in 2020."
