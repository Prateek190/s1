The Mumbai-based company will partner with Japan’s JFE Holdings Inc., which holds a 15% stake in JSW Steel, and other investors to bid for the assets, Sajjan Jindal, chairman of JSW Group, said in an interview with BloombergQuint at the World Economic Forum’s meeting in Davos. The acquired companies would be standalone assets and not part of JSW Steel to begin with, he said.
“The idea is to manage the show, the idea is to run the business profitably and once they turn around, then we will merge them and thereby control the company,"" he said. “So right now, we are not looking to have the majority.""
India’s insolvency law has set off a contest for more than $26 billion of steel assets, spurring interest from metals giants such as ArcelorMittal and Vedanta Resources Plc. Bidders are being lured by buoyant steel prices and the prospect of rising demand, powered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s investment program to upgrade India’s infrastructure.
JFE said last week it’s discussing possible expansion in India with its partner, although no decision had been made to bid for Bhushan Steel or other assets.
“India has a long way to go to build this country and steel is the basic material which is needed for building the nation, building the infrastructure,"" Jindal said. The sector will see a lot of consolidation as bigger players buy up smaller mills, which haven’t been very efficient in the past, he said.
Thursday marks the deadline for bids for Bhushan Steel. JSW Group is also eyeing the assets of Binani Cement Ltd and the power business of Jaypee Associates Ltd, Jindal said. Bloomberg"

Mumbai: JSW Steel Ltd., India’s largest producer, saw its profit more than double to a record during the third quarter, helped by buoyant steel prices and rising volumes and boosting prospects for the company looking to expand capacity by snapping up some ailing domestic mills.
JSW, in the race for at least three of the five steel assets on the block under the insolvency resolution process, is betting that India’s steel use is likely to grow at a strong pace on the back of government’s infrastructure spending and strengthening consumer demand, joint managing director Seshagiri Rao said in Mumbai.
Net income jumped to Rs1,750 crore ($274 million) in the three months to 31 December, from Rs730 crore a year earlier, the producer said in a statement on Wednesday. That compares with a forecast of Rs1,140 crore from 11 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales advanced 17% to Rs17,860 crore.
Global mills are looking at bumper profits as benchmark steel prices in China climbed to the highest in five years in December amid a cutback in capacity, reducing exports to the world market. Last week, South Korea’s top maker Posco posted a more than 60% surge in annual profit to the biggest since 2011 and Maanshan Iron & Steel Co. expects 2017 net income to jump 237% on year.
Declining steel exports from China have “eased the supply pressure across various global markets, lending a support to price"" amid improving demand, Rao said. Global growth is also firming and is positive for the sector, he said.
In India, where the government plans to spend trillions of dollars to upgrade its infrastructure, mills are scrambling to raise capacity to meet potential demand. JSW is interested in assets of Bhushan Steel Ltd. and Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd., and will seek to partner with other investors, including JFE Holdings Inc., to bid for the assets, chairman Sajjan Jindal said last week.
The acquisitions, coupled with a planned expansion at existing plants, would help the steelmaker inch closer to its aim of reaching a capacity of 40 million metric tons by 2030 from 18 million tons now. Bloomberg"

New Delhi: The committee of creditors (COC) has rejected the bid of UK-based Liberty House to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd, leaving Tata Steel and JSW Steel in the race for taking over the assets of the bankrupt firm, a person in the know said. 
“Committee of creditors (COC) in a meeting today has rejected the bids of Liberty House (of the UK) because the company submitted the bids after the last date of submission date which was February 8,"" a person privy to the development said. 
Liberty House had submitted the bid on Tuesday, he said. In Wednesday’s COC meeting the bids of Tata Steel and JSW Steel were disclosed and now the process as well as legal advisors evaluate them, the person said. 
The detailed terms and conditions of the bids were disclosed to the lenders at the meeting, the person said. Bhushan Power and Steel owes about Rs45,000 crore to its lenders. When contacted, resolution professional (RP) Mahender Kumar Khandelwal declined to comment on the developments.
The person in the know said that while Tata Steel offered Rs17,000 crore to the lenders as upfront amount and Rs7,200 crore for operations of Bhushan, JSW made an offer of Rs11,000 crore to the lenders and Rs2,000 crore for the operations of the beleaguered power firm.
The COC will now meet on 6 March to take the process forward, including declaration of the highest bidder. Bhushan Steel and Power was among the 12 non-performing accounts referred by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) proceedings. 
The insolvency process was filed by State Bank of India (SBI), the lead bank of the consortium of lenders, in the case of Bhushan Steel while a similar plea was filed by Punjab National Bank (PNB) against Bhushan Power and Steel."

New Delhi: Private steel maker JSW Steel is close to acquire Italy-based Aferpi steel firm for Rs600 crore, a person in the know of the matter said. 
“The deal is almost finalised. Most probably by the end of March or beginning of April, it will be final,"" the person in the know said, adding that the deal is worth about Rs600 crore. Aferpi makes specialty long products for railways, bars for auto industry parts, earthmoving vehicles, among others and is the second largest steel maker in Italy. 
An email query sent to JSW Steel remained unanswered. The plan is to cater to the automobile customers of Europe. Hot rolled coils will be sent from India and further finished products will be sold to the customers there. The company has been for long trying to have a facility in the European region. 
JSW Steel had earlier also tried to acquire Italian property in 2014 when it was known as Lucchini. But Algerian conglomerate Cevital acquired Lucchini and renamed it Aferpi. PTI"

New Delhi: Fitch Ratings on Thursday said that it has revised the outlook on JSW Steel Ltd to ‘stable’ from ‘negative’.  
New Delhi: Fitch Ratings on Thursday said that it has revised the outlook on JSW Steel Ltd to ‘stable’ from ‘negative’. 
“Fitch Ratings has revised the outlook on JSW Steel Ltd’s long-term issuer default rating (IDR) to stable from negative and affirmed the rating at ‘BB’,"" the rating agency said in a statement. The agency has also affirmed the company’s senior unsecured rating and the rating on its senior unsecured notes at ‘BB’.
‘BB’ ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to default risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic conditions over time; however, business or financial flexibility exists that supports the servicing of financial commitments. “The outlook revision reflects our view that robust profitability from improved industry fundamentals and a measured approach to capacity expansion will enable JSWS (JSW Steel) to deleverage steadily over the next few years,"" the statement said.
“We estimate that the company’s leverage will remain relatively high, with funds from operations (FFO) adjusted gross leverage at over 4.0x over the next two years, but risks are partly offset by JSWS’s healthy EBITDAR margin, which should stay at over 20 per cent to be well above the median for ‘BB’ rated steel companies,"" it said. 
The company benefits from efficient operations that cater to structural demand growth in India amid the industry’s better demand-supply balance following Chinese capacity cuts, the statement said. 
Shares of JSW Steel were trading 0.51% lower at Rs310.50 apiece on BSE."
140,2018-03-06,JSW,"The upgrade to Ba2 reflects the expectation that JSW will continue to show improving credit metrics, says Kaustubh Chaubal, a Moody's VP and senior analyst

New Delhi: Moody’s Investors Service has upgraded JSW Steel’s corporate family rating (CFR) and senior unsecured bond rating to Ba2 from Ba3. 
New Delhi: Moody’s Investors Service has upgraded JSW Steel’s corporate family rating (CFR) and senior unsecured bond rating to Ba2 from Ba3.
Last week, Fitch Ratings also revised its outlook on JSW Steel to ‘stable’ from ‘negative’. The Ba2 CFR reflects the company’s large scale, strong market shares in west and south India, and competitive conversion costs, with the last factor supported by JSW’s wide range of furnace technology and the coastal locations of its operations, Moody’s said. 
The strengths are counter balanced by the cyclical nature of the steel industry and JSW’s lack of raw material integration. Both factors increase supply and price risks, it said in a statement. These risks are partly mitigated by JSW’s recent addition of five iron-ore mining licenses, even though when fully operational, these mines will cater to less than 15% of the company’s total iron ore requirement, it added. 
“The upgrade to Ba2 reflects our expectation that JSW will continue to show improving credit metrics,"" said Kaustubh Chaubal, a Moody’s vice president and senior analyst. JSW’s likely better results will be due to the benign operating environment, and higher steel sales from the company’s brownfield expansion, catering to India’s growing steel demand, he said. 
Moody’s expects that India’s steel consumption will continue to grow in the range of 5.5-6.5 per cent on the back of government’s push for infrastructure projects, construction — including affordable housing — power transmission and railway investments as also improving demand from the automotive sector. 
“Indian steel producers are consolidating their operations, with five stressed assets—that account for an estimated 17 per cent of the country’s crude steel capacity — likely to find suitable buyers within the next 12 months,"" said Chaubal, who is also Moody’s lead analyst for JSW. 
He said such a situation augurs well for large established players such as JSW. Rising domestic demand, a wide slate of long and flat products, and an increasing proportion of value-added products will help JSW in preserving its market share in India, Moody’s said.
These factors, along with a favourable pricing environment, will improve the company’s earnings growth, but capital expenditure to develop a 5 million tonnes per annum brownfield expansion at JSW’s Dolvi plant will likely lead to a prolonged negative free cash flow situation, it said. Looking ahead, JSW’s product mix demonstrates a higher proportion of value-added products versus its steel manufacturing peers in India, which should preserve EBITDA/tonne at Rs8,500-9,000, it added."

New Delhi: Moody’s Investors Service on Monday assigned a Ba2 rating to JSW Steel’s proposed senior unsecured bonds with stable outlook. 
Ba2 rating means that this instrument has substantial credit risk.
“Moody’s Investors Service has assigned a Ba2 rating to JSW Steel’s (JSW) proposed senior unsecured bonds. The rating outlook is stable,"" Moody’s said in a statement. 
“The bond rating is the same as JSW’s Ba2 corporate family rating (CFR) and the Ba2 rating on the company’s existing senior unsecured notes. The proposed bonds rank pari-passu to the company’s existing senior unsecured notes,"" the statement said.
JSW’s Ba2 corporate family rating reflects the company’s large scale, strong market shares in west and south India, and competitive conversion costs, with the last factor supported by the company’s wide range of furnace technologies and the coastal locations of its operations."

Mumbai: JSW Steel Ltd may bid in Essar Steel auction after lenders to the bankrupt steel maker rejected the two bids that had been received and invited fresh bids for the distressed asset, two people aware of the company’s plans said.
On Wednesday, the committee of creditors (CoC) to Essar Steel at its meeting rejected the resolution plans submitted by steel major ArcelorMittal India and Numetal Mauritius.
Essar Steel is now headed for a new round of bidding, opening up the possibility for newer bidders such as Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Steel to enter the fray.
However, according to the first person cited above, JSW Steel’s entry is contingent on the committee of creditors allowing new bidders, who had not participated in the expression of interest (EoI) phase, to participate in the new bidding round. 
“While JSW Steel is keen to enter the new round of bidding, they need clarity on whether the lenders will allow new parties to bid, those which had not submitted an EoI when the current round of bidding had started. The lenders are right now divided over this issue,"" he said. 
The committee is expected to meet in a day or two to take a call on this, he added. 
Five firms had submitted resolution plans for Essar Steel.
Apart from ArcelorMittal and Numetal, the other firms which participated in the first round of bidding were Nippon Steel, Tata Steel and Vedanta Group.
Emails sent to JSW Steel did not elicit any response until press time. 
If JSW Steel enters the new round of bidding for Essar Steel, it will be the fourth distressed steel asset that the Sajjan Jindal-led company has set its eyes on since the debt resolution process under the insolvency and bankruptcy code began.
JSW Steel has partnered with at least two private equity funds, Aion Capital and Bain-Piramal fund, to bid for distressed steel assets.

Mumbai: Sajjan Jindal, chairman and managing director of JSW Group, on Monday said his company was not allowed to place a bid for Essar Steel Ltd as the lenders did not want to re-open bids and give out “advertisements in the newspapers"".
“In their discretion, they thought they do not want to give a new entrant a chance. If they do not want more money then it is up to them,"" Jindal said.
On Wednesday, lenders to Essar Steel decided to re-open bidding for the debt-ridden steel maker after declaring ArcelorMittal and Numetal Mauritius Ltd ineligible. However, they decided to restrict this to the six firms that had submitted expressions of interest. 
“In this case (Essar Steel), we wanted to re-enter and wanted to give a very good competition... and the creditors would have got more money if we were involved. Then they (CoC) felt that if we were given an opportunity, they would have to advertise in newspapers and will have to call for bids again. People may ask for the data room to be opened. So, we gave in writing to the CoC that we do not need any time. We are willing to participate (on an) as-is basis and with whatever information we have. In their thought process, discretion, they thought they do not want to give a new entrant a chance,"" he added.
Jindal said his company did not bid for Essar Steel in the beginning because it was in the race to buy Bhushan Steel, which it identified as a “prime asset"". JSW lost out to Tata Steel, which is said to have quoted a higher valuation. The Bombay House company now needs approval from India’s competition watchdog and National Company Law Tribunal.
Jindal on Monday also reacted strongly against lobbying being done in the favour of an amendment in the insolvency and bankruptcy code to allow bankrupt promoters to bid for the assets. 
“Somebody who is a promoter and has defaulted should not participate in the IBC process. Now, I am told that there have been instances where promoters have sold their stock, just to be eligible to participate and fulfil the obligations that he is no more a promoter. In the spirit of law, it is not fair. I will be very surprised if that kind of a thing will be permitted in this country,"" Jindal said.
 Separately, JSW Steel’s US unit is planning to invest up to $500 million in Texas to expand its steelmaking operations. The firm wants to use the funds for backward integration, to create the first melt, and manufacture contiguous plate and pipe facility. 
The investment by JSW USA will be used to spruce up capabilities of its facility plate and pipe mill in Baytown, Texas in which the company has already started to invest $150 million. The rest will be spent to set up a hot-end facility to melt and manufacture steel."

Mumbai/Ahmedabad: The battle for Essar Steel Ltd Monday saw the surprise entry of Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Steel Ltd, which has formed a tie-up with Numetal Mauritius, which is already in fray.  
Mumbai/Ahmedabad: The battle for Essar Steel Ltd Monday saw the surprise entry of Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Steel Ltd, which has formed a tie-up with Numetal Mauritius, which is already in fray. 
Monday’s auction of Essar Steel Ltd also saw bids from ArcelorMittal Netherlands NV-Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corporation (NSSMC) duo, and Vedanta Plc submitting their bids for the debt-ridden steel firm. Vedanta, which had submitted expression of interest earlier, is a new entrant as well. 
On 21 March, the committee of creditors (CoC) for Essar Steel had announced a second round of bidding for Essar Steel after rejecting the only bids received from ArcelorMittal and Numetal, citing the related party clause under the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC). While the resolution professional for the distressed steel company received expressions of interest (EoIs) from six entities in the first round, only two firms—ArcelorMittal and Numetal participated in the bidding process. 
The second round was open only to firms that had submitted EoIs in the first round, blocking new entrants from submitting resolution plans. 
Numetal had been disqualified due to Aurora Enterprises Ltd’s shareholding in the firm. During the first round of bidding Aurora Enterprises, a firm controlled by a trust owned by Rewant Ruia, held a minority stake in NuMetal. Rewant Ruia is son of Ravi Ruia, vice-chairman of Essar Group. Numetal had suggested that it was willing to drop Aurora, if required, as a corrective measure. It could not be immediately ascertained if Aurora’s stake has been bought out by existing shareholders or JSW Steel. However, a person close to the development on condition of anonymity said that JSW Steel had bought out Rewant Ruia's stake.   
Even as JSW Steel could not participate in the bidding process on a standalone basis (since it had not submitted an EoI), it decided to pair up with Numetal to submit a resolution plan. The two firms submitted a joint bid on Monday. 
“Considering the lenders had allowed only those firms who had submitted EOIs in the first round to bid, we had limited options. So, we decided to partner with Numetal as they were willing to tie up with us,"" Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director and group chief financial officer at JSW Steel told Mint over phone. Rao added that considering that Arcelor had already tied up with Nippon, possibilities to tie up with other applicants, considering their strategic interests in the assets, were limited for JSW . Numetal spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. Rao declined to comment on whether JSW Steel has bought out Ruia's stake.
A spokesperson for ArcelorMittal said that JSW and Numetal coming together will be detrimental to competition. “JSW joining Numetal is clearly a defensive move—they don’t want competition…India has an ambitious target to increase its steel production to 300 million tonnes. It needs new firms to achieve that. We continue to believe that ArcelorMittal -Nippon is the strongest possible partner for Essar,"" he said. ArcelorMittal has formed a joint venture with Nippon to jointly acquire the assets of Essar Steel. 
Meanwhile, Numetal has challenged the disqualification of its previous bid in the Ahmedabad National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). It has also asked the tribunal to defer the opening of bids unless the tribunal decides its eligibility in the first round. The court has deferred the opening of bids till 4 April. On the same day, NCLT Ahmedabad will also hear petitions filed by NuMetal and ArcelorMittal challenging their disqualification in round one.
As on 31 March 2016, Essar Steel owed around Rs45,000 crore to lenders. State Bank of India is the lead bank and Satish Kumar Gupta is the resolution professional. Gupta declined to comment on the matter."

“The consortium has accepted the terms of the LoI. The closure of the transaction shall be subject to obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, including from the National Company Law Tribunal and the Competition Commission of India,"" JSW Steel said. 
The insolvency resolution process of the company began on 18 July, 2017. The resolution plan, submitted jointly by JSW Steel and AION Capital, was the only offer that Monnet Ispat and Energy received on 23 December—the last date for the submission of the bids. 
Monnet Ispat & Energy was the first stressed company to get resolution plans from prospective bidders. It was among the 12 NPAs referred by the Reserve Bank of India for insolvency proceedings. 
The company owes more than Rs10,000 crore to its lenders. Besides MIEL, JSW Steel along with NuMetal had submitted bids for Essar Steel, another steel firm under insolvency proceedings, on 2 April.

Mumbai: JSW Steel Ltd, which is bidding for debt-ridden Essar Steel Ltd in alliance with Numetal Mauritius, may sell some of its stake to a private equity partner if it wins the auction, a top company executive said.
ArcelorMittal and Numetal were finalists in the Essar Steel bankruptcy auction, but the bankruptcy resolution professional disqualified both bids.
The firms moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which allowed a second round of auction, while directing that the bids not be opened until the bench decides on the case. 
If the resolution plan submitted is approved by the committee of creditors, JSW Steel will invest in the step down subsidiary of Numetal.
“If the court decides lenders can go on with the second round of bidding (in Essar Steel) and Numetal becomes a successful bidder, we’ll see what can be done in the later stage, whether we bring in another investor,"" Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director and group chief financial officer, JSW Steel, said in an interview.
In an earlier interaction, Rao had said JSW Steel could not enter the bidding process as a standalone bidder because it did not originally offer an expression of interest (EoI). “Considering the lenders had allowed only those firms who had submitted EOIs in the first round to bid, we had limited options. So we decided to partner with Numetal as they were willing to tie up with us,"" Rao had said. 
The company aims to reach a capacity of 45 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in the next 20 years. 
That would require looking at stressed assets.
“I don’t think there are any big assets in the second (RBI) list of distressed assets. Maybe there are some in the 1-1.5 mt range. We will look at these firms when they go to insolvency,"" Rao added."

New Delhi: UK-based Liberty House has offered over Rs26,000 crore for acquiring the stressed assets of Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd (BPSL), leading Tata Steel and JSW in the race.
The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has asked BPSL lenders, led by PNB, to consider the bid submitted by Liberty House for the debt-ridden company. It owes about Rs45,000 crore to the lenders.
“In the meeting of Committee of Creditors (CoC) held today, the bid of Liberty House was opened. The consolidated bid amount offered by the UK-based firm for the stressed assets of BPSL was over Rs26,000 crore,"" said a source privy to the development.
Tata Steel had earlier offered Rs17,000 crore to the lenders as upfront amount and Rs7,200 crore for operations of Bhushan.
JSW Steel made an offer of Rs11,000 crore to the lenders and Rs2,000 crore for the operations of the beleaguered power firm.
The CoC will meet again next week and take a call on the rebidding.
Allowing the plea of Liberty House, NCLT had earlier directed the CoC to complete its resolution proceedings by 23 June. The tribunal’s order came over a petition filed by Liberty House, challenging the rejection of its bid by the BPSL’s resolution professional (RP) on account of late submission.
Liberty House had moved the NCLT on 26 February against the rejection. The CoC had in February rejected Liberty House’s bid to acquire BPSL, leaving Tata Steel and JSW Steel in the race.
Liberty House had submitted before the NCLT that RP rejected its bid to acquire BPSL without even opening the seal of its offer.
Bhushan Steel and Power was among the 12 non-performing accounts referred by the Reserve Bank for NCLT proceedings. The insolvency process was filed by SBI, the lead bank of the consortium of lenders, in the case of Bhushan Steel.

New Delhi: JSW Steel Ltd on Wednesday reported a net profit of Rs2,879 crore for the March quarter, nearly triple the Rs1,008 crore it reported year ago on higher demand and better prices.
During the quarter, crude steel production rose 5% year-on-year to 4.31 million tonnes (mt) while sales of saleable steel stood at 4.22mt, up 7% over the same period. 
For the full financial year, the steel-maker reported its highest ever consolidated net profit of Rs6,113 crore, up 76% from Rs3,467 crore the previous year. 
JSW Steel joint managing director and chief financial officer Seshagiri Rao told reporters that alterations to the product and geography mix over the past quarter boosted financial numbers. Sales of value-added and special steel products increased 14% year-on-year and its share of total shipments for the quarter was at 57%. 
The company’s net debt stood at Rs38,019 crore at the end of FY18; net debt-to-equity ratio was 1.38. 
JSW Steel is on track to completing its planned capacity expansion strategy to increase production capacity from the current 18mt to 24.7mt by March 2020, Rao said. “Our capex guideline was Rs26,815 crore; however, we have now increased this by another Rs17,600 crore,"" he said.
“The board of directors has approved key new projects, including enriching product mix with 3.2mt of additional downstream capacity and backward integration projects, like a coke oven plant, which will reduce costs,"" Rao explained. “Some of these projects will be commissioned in FY19; we foresee cost savings of about Rs2,000 crore from these measures this year.""

Mumbai: India’s biggest steelmakers are set to expand production to a record after reporting solid quarterly earnings amid strong steel prices.
JSW Steel Ltd. posted record net income Wednesday and outlined a $6 billion plan to raise output. Tata Steel Ltd., which aims to double domestic capacity, swung to profit, helped by a one-time gain.
Both mills are ramping up to meet an anticipated surge in domestic consumption with the government set to spend trillions of dollars on expanding infrastructure. Paving the way are the best market conditions in years as prices are bolstered by lower exports from China, the world’s biggest producer.
Mills around the world are also benefiting. ArcelorMittal, the biggest, posted its best quarterly profit in six years last week, and Thyssenkrupp AG said earnings at its metal-making division more than doubled.
JSW sees Indian steel consumption rising by as much as 7.5% in the 2019 financial year, supported by a government push for infrastructure projects and strengthening consumer demand, said joint-managing director Seshagiri Rao.
“The medium term demand growth outlook is quite constructive,"" he said.
The Mumbai-based producer aims to boost steelmaking capacity by 37% to 24.7 million metric tons a year by March 2020, the company said in its earnings statement.

Mumbai: JSW Steel Ltd has signed a deal to take over Italy’s second largest steel plant Aferpi for Rs600 crore, the Indian steelmaker said in a filing to the stock exchanges. Aferpi—formerly Lucchini SpA—was owned by Algeria’s Cevital. 
Mumbai: JSW Steel Ltd has signed a deal to take over Italy’s second largest steel plant Aferpi for Rs600 crore, the Indian steelmaker said in a filing to the stock exchanges. Aferpi—formerly Lucchini SpA—was owned by Algeria’s Cevital.
The deal closure is expected to be announced by Saturday, said a person familiar with the development, requesting anonymity.
JSW’s senior officials reached Italy on Friday and an agreement has been signed at Italy’s ministry of economic development, the person said.
The final signing was hurried along by labour union leaders, who wanted Aferpi to enter special administration had the JSW takeover fallen through, reported Platts on 16 May.
Originally owned by Russia’s Severstal, Aferpi has an annual steel production capacity of about 2 million tonnes in Piombino and manufactures special steels used in railway, automobile and earth-moving vehicles, among others.
The acquisition will help JSW Steel to expand its reach in the specialised steel market, especially in the automobile sector.
Aferpi is currently working on projects that involve production of 1 mt of long steel products and revamping of wire rod and bar mills, installation of one electric arc furnace of 1 mt capacity with two continuous casting machines, installation of a new rails- and beams-rolling plant and installation of the second electric arc furnace and the third continuous casting machine.

118,2018-05-18,JSW,"JSW Steel is taking several steps to rein in cost, and i nQ1 FY19, the company expects costs to be lower, as coking coal prices have tapered

The JSW Steel Ltd shares was under pressure on Thursday, a day after its Q4 results were announced. 
The JSW Steel Ltd shares was under pressure on Thursday, a day after its Q4 results were announced.
This was despite the steel maker’s March quarter, or Q4, earnings exceeding analysts’ estimates, buoyed by better-than-expected growth in realizations and robust domestic sales. A lower tax rate and improved subsidiary performance also aided the consolidated entity’s results.
Record production of crude steel and saleable steel during the quarter along with sharp increase in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda)/tonne, were some of the key highlights of the Q4 FY18 results.
Did costs play a spoilsport? A bit of a dampener came from the sequential increase in total cost on a per tonne basis, which was impacted by elevated coking coal prices. Coking coal costs during the quarter increased to $205/tonne from $173/tonne in the December quarter, the management said in a post- earnings conference call.
But the company is taking several steps to rein in costs. These include commissioning of an eight-million-tonne per annum (mtpa) pellet plant, a coke oven plant of 3 mtpa and a waste heat recovery boiler of 175 MW. In the June quarter of the current fiscal year (FY19), the company expects costs to be lower, as coking coal prices have tapered since.
Further, three iron ore mines with volumes of 4 mtpa are expected to start operations by the second half of FY19. They would aid in cost savings in Karnataka by reducing imports and also purchases from Odisha mines. However, the benefits of these cost- reduction measures would take some time to reflect in the JSW Steel’s balance sheet.
Meanwhile, the demand outlook is strong. The management expects steel demand to grow by 7-7.5% year-on-year in FY19 and has guided for steel volumes of 16 MT in FY19 and crude steel production of 16.75 mt.
Why then, in spite of all these positives, are investors skittish about the stock? The answer probably lies in its expansion plans. JSW Steel has approved new projects to augment steel-making capacity to 24.7 mtpa in 2020 from its current 18 mtpa.
For perspective, the company has announced a capital expenditure (capex) of Rs10,000 crore for FY19, Rs15,000 crore for FY20 and Rs14,687 crore for FY21 against its FY18 capex of Rs4,689 crore. Nearly 70% of the capex to be incurred in FY19 will be funded through debt and the balance through equity.
The company’s net FY18 debt/Ebitda ratio—a measure of leverage—stood at 2.57 times, said the management. That is lower than the 3.5 times it was some quarters ago, but the capex plans would stretch the balance sheet and consequently its net debt/Ebitda would surge, caution analysts.
In short, while JSW Steel may perform well operationally, higher debt on the back of increased capex is likely to weigh on the stock’s near-term performance."
116,2018-06-21,JSW,"JSW Steel is expected to make a bid for ArcelorMittal's Galati plant in Romania, potentially competing against Ukraine's Metinvest and Italy's Marcegaglia

London/Mumbai: India’s biggest steelmaker JSW Steel is expected to make a bid for ArcelorMittal’s Galati plant in Romania, three sources told Reuters, potentially competing against Ukraine’s Metinvest and Italy’s Marcegaglia. 
London/Mumbai: India’s biggest steelmaker JSW Steel is expected to make a bid for ArcelorMittal’s Galati plant in Romania, three sources told Reuters, potentially competing against Ukraine’s Metinvest and Italy’s Marcegaglia.
ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker, has had to put six European assets up for sale to get approval from European competition authorities for its purchase of Italy’s giant Ilva plant.
Analysts at investment bank Jefferies estimate the combined value of the assets up for sale is $752-940 million and Galati, the country’s biggest steel plant employing about 5,600 people, is the largest of those assets.
Bank of America-Merrill Lynch is handling the sale, which it aims to complete by the end of 2018. According to the European Commission, ArcelorMittal has agreed to provide an undisclosed amount of financing to the buyer of Galati to ensure that its steel output grows and the plant remains viable and competitive.
ArcelorMittal declined to comment. 
JSW, which wants to expand its steelmaking capacity outside India by 10 million tonnes per annum, also declined to comment.
Bidders line up
Industry sources had previously said that Marcegaglia and Metinvest were planning a joint bid for the plant but a Metinvest spokesman told Reuters the steelmaker would be bidding alone. 
“We do not consider any partnerships or consortiums. Metinvest is a financially strong group (able) to participate on (a) standalone basis in the bid for any of the assets proposed by ArcelorMittal,"" the Metinvest spokesman said.
Marcegaglia did not respond to requests for comment. The steel processor had previously been part of a consortium with ArcelorMittal bidding for the Ilva plant before the European Commission forced it to withdraw.
Galati has crude steelmaking capacity of 3.4 million tonnes per annum and rolling capacity of 6.2 million tonnes. The equivalent figures for Ostrava, the next biggest plant up for sale, are 3.4 million and 3.9 million, respectively. 
The other four assets for sale have no crude capacity, and a combined rolling capacity of 7.4 million tonnes per annum. 
Galati was bought by ArcelorMittal’s former holding for €70 million in 2001, according to Jefferies. Close to a billion euros has since been ploughed into the plant, which turned a profit of $6 million for the first time in 2016, the investment bank said.
Jefferies also said investors have been somewhat unnerved by the disposals ArcelorMittal has had to make to buy Ilva, given the joint crude capacity of the plants it is selling is roughly equal to Ilva’s near 7 million tonne annual production. ArcelorMittal bid €1.8 billion ($2.08 billion) for Ilva and pledged to invest another 2.4 billion cleaning up another plant that has been dogged by charges of corruption and environmental crimes for years - charges that it denies. 
The steelmaker aims to complete the Ilva purchase by the end of June.
As part of its overseas expansion plan, JSW in May agreed to pay €55 million for the Aferpi plant in Piombino, Italy, which has annual capacity of 2.5 million tonnes and was bought by Algeria’s Cevital in 2014. 
In India, it has bid for bankrupt Bhushan Steel, Essar Steel, Monnet Ispat, and has so far got approval for its debt resolution plan for Monnet Ispat. Last year JSW earmarked a billion dollars for acquisitions and expansions."

While the global industry has been roiled this year by tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on some flows of steel into the world’s top economy, mills are still enjoying benign conditions. Worldwide production hit a record in May as capacity utilization climbed, according to the World Steel Association.
Against that backdrop, Mumbai-based JSW has been busy: after announcing a move to triple output at its Texas plant, it snapped up another US facility in Ohio, taking total planned investment in the country to $1 billion.
For Rao, the commercial lure isn’t dependent on the trade moves, which he said are transitory. “The US economy—notwithstanding the trade remedial measures which the US government has taken—is quite buoyant, demand is picking up,"" he said on Tuesday. “It is not because tariffs were introduced in the US or somewhere else, that is why we wanted to invest.""
Still, Ritesh Shah, an analyst at Investec Capital Services Ltd, said JSW’s decisions were sound in the context of the curbs. “It does make sense to have manufacturing bases in US and Europe in an increasingly protectionist world,"" said Shah. “One, it gives JSW Steel access to markets which would otherwise be difficult to get into. Secondly, it ensures you are closer to your customers.""
JSW Steel shares have soared more than 60% over the past year, aided by record output and profit. To meet local demand, the company plans a $6 billion capacity expansion in India. In May, it made an acquisition in Italy, and it has another purchase awaiting approval from India’s company law tribunal.
As part of its trade agenda, Trump imposed a tariff of 25 percent on imported steel aiming to restrict a flood of cheap foreign supplies. While that’s helped to trigger some plant restarts, it’s alienated trading partners, and may spur tit-for-tat moves, with Canada now said to be is preparing its own measures.
JSW’s decision to plow more funds into Ohio caught the attention of US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, one the key architects in the administration for its moves on steel as well as potential curbs on a host of other items. In a tweet, Ross lauded the “investments made in the great state of Ohio"".
US production
US steel output has been picking up. Production in March topped 7.3 million tonnes, the highest monthly total since late 2014, according to World Steel Association data. The economy is about to enter the 10th year of expansion, and growth may reach 4 percent this quarter, the fastest since 2014.
In Europe, ArcelorMittal is selling assets in Italy, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Romania and Macedonia to meet regulatory requirements enabling the world’s top producer to take over Italy’s Ilva SpA, for which a JSW-led consortium had also bid. Rao denied reports the company may make an offer for Arcelor’s Galati plant in Romania, while declining to comment on the others.
JSW Steel produced 15.8 million tonnes of crude steel in the year to March 31, up 26% from a year ago. The company has said it plans to boost capacity by more than a third to about 25 million tonnes a year by March 2020.
“If someone is spending a billion dollars for a million ton, we spend only $500 million,"" Rao said. “On capital-allocation side, if we are cautious—whether I invest in US or Europe—then my returns always remain accretive not withstanding the cycles,"" he said."

Mumbai: JSW Steel on Wednesday announced plans to invest Rs7,500 crore until March 2020 to increase the production capacity at its Vijayanagar facility in Karnataka to 13 million tonnes per annum (mtpa). 
The plant, which currently has a 12mtpa capacity, is the largest single-location steel manufacturing unit in India, the company claimed in a release. “We plan to expand the steel manufacturing capacity of the Vijayanagar unit in Karnataka to 13 mtpa by FY20,"" the release said, adding, the capacity expansion and project upgrades will entail a capital investment of Rs7,500 crore until March 2020. 
JSW Steel said its current project to revamp and upgrade capacity of blast furnace-3 at the Vijayanagar plant is on track, which will improve hot metal availability. It will also modify and enhance capacity of its steel melting shop, the flat and long products mills, along with allied facilities to utilise this additional hot metal. 
The company also plans to set-up a 1.5mtpa coke oven plant in Karnataka to bridge the current and expected gaps in coke availability, which is likely to be commissioned by March 2020, according to the release. 
It expects the coke oven unit to provide significant cost savings over the long term. “With steel consumption in India expected to grow, these capacity enhancement initiatives will ensure our readiness to promptly service emerging customer demand,"" said Vinod Nowal, deputy managing director, JSW Steel. 
Meanwhile, the company also announced that it has commenced operations at Tunga and Nandi iron ore mines in Karnataka, for which it has already received statutory clearances. The cumulative capacity of these two iron ore mines is 0.71mtpa. 
For the remaining three mines of the five acquired by the company last year, JSW Steel expects statutory clearances and approvals during the current financial year. The steel-maker is also expanding the capacity of CRM-1 complex at Vijayanagar works from 0.8mtpa to 1mtpa as well as setting up a 0.3mtpa colour coated line as part of its growth strategy, the release said."

Mumbai: The AION Capital-JSW Steel consortium has agreed to pay small operational creditors of Monnet Ispat after the dedicated bankruptcy court observed that there is nothing for small vendors in the resolution plan and they need to keep them in mind while acquiring an asset at such an attractive valuation.
The lone successful bidder agreed to set aside around  ₹ 25 crore for MSME vendors, which will increase the total acquisition amount to  ₹ 2,875 crore for the AION-JSW Steel consortium.
On Thursday, the division bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai, presided by B.S.V. Prakash Kumar and Ravi Kumar Duraisamy, said that the successful resolution plan doesn’t have anything towards government dues as well as operational creditors and the bidders are getting a prized asset at a very attractive price.
“When you are getting a company for  ₹ 2,850 crore whose fair market value is over  ₹ 4, 000 crore then you should make at least some provision for small operational creditors,"" observed the Mumbai bench of the NCLT while hearing arguments of the AION-JSW application. “You can eliminate big operational creditors that are listed companies or major corporations but you have to think about micro and small enterprises.""

Fredun De Vitre, senior counsel who was appearing for the AION-JSW consortium, said that they are willing to make an allocation of  ₹ 25 crore for such small operational creditors. The counsel further argued that the consortium will have 75% of the equity in the Monnet Ispat.
Monnet Ispat is part of the first lot of 12 large non-performing loans referred by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for early resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) last year.
The company owes lenders  ₹ 10,000 crore and the committee of creditors (CoC) has agreed to take a haircut of around 72% to settle the loan.
So far, a consortium of AION Capital Partners Ltd and JSW Steel Ltd has made a binding offer for Monnet Ispat and is considered to be the front-runner to acquire the asset. AION Capital holds a 70% stake in the consortium while JSW Steel holds the rest."

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Friday gave a go-ahead to the lenders’ meeting of debt-ridden Bhushan Power & Steel, directing them to finalise a bid for the company. Vacating its earlier stay, the appellate tribunal has directed the committee of creditors (CoC) for the company to consider resolution plans submitted by three firms: Tata Steel, Liberty House and JSW Steel.
The NCLAT has also directed the CoC to call all the three bidders, along with operational creditors and suspended board of directors of Bhushan Power & Steel, to the meeting.
“The CoC will call for an urgent meeting to take up the resolution plan for discussion and approval,"" said a two-member bench headed by Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya. “The resolution professional, after consulting the CoC, will invite operational creditors and all three applicants will remain present on the date of consideration of the resolution plan,"" the bench ruled.
The suspended board of directors of Bhushan Power & Steel is also allowed to attend the meeting in which the resolution plan will be considered by the CoC, the NCLAT said in its order.
Earlier, on July 17, the tribunal had stayed the meeting of the CoC when it was about to vote for finalisation of the highest bidder for BPSL.
The tribunal further said that the CoC will place the selected resolution plan before adjudicating authority, which may approve it, but the plan will not come into effect without prior approval of the NCLAT.
During today’s proceedings, resolution professional Mahendra Kumar Khandelwal tendered an unconditional apology to the tribunal for not following its previous orders to allow representatives of operational creditors to attend the meeting.
Moreover, Liberty House has alleged it was not informed about the meeting and on July 11 Khandelwal handed over a 19-page checklist seeking the company’s compliance with Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The section deals with criteria to disqualify bidders.
Earlier, lending banks had rejected the resolution plan submitted by Liberty House citing delay, following which the UK-based group had moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
The NCLT had on April 23 directed the lenders, led by Punjab National Bank, to consider the bid submitted by Liberty House. This order was challenged by Tata Steel, another resolution applicant for Bhushan Power & Steel, before the NCLAT."

Mumbai: Sajjan Jindal believes his company JSW Steel will turn around and merge the bankrupt Monnet Ispat with itself within a year. 
“We will eventually merge Monnet Ispat into JSW Steel and it will be a JSW brand. Our past experience is normally we turn-around in one year, so we hope that will happen,"" Jindal, chairman and managing director of JSW Steel, said on the sidelines of the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday. 
Last week, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved AION-JSW Steel consortium’s  ₹ 2,875 crore takeover proposal for the 1.5 million tonne asset in Chhattisgarh run by Monnet Ispat and Energy. 
Located close to the mineral-rich belts of Chhattisgarh and Odisha, this acquisition will be crucial in extending JSW’s reach in the central and eastern markets. 
JSW has also tossed its hat in the ring for the 10 million tonne steel capacity of Essar Steel. 
Jindal declined to comment on the plan because the eligibility of some bidders is being evaluated by the courts. He also declined to comment on the company’s interest in buying out the specialty steel business of Usha Martin. JSW and Vedanta are believed to be interested in buying out the stressed units of the Kolkata-based Usha Martin.
In his speech to shareholders, Jindal said that JSW delivered a record performance in FY 2017-18. “During the year, we have achieved the highest-ever production, shipments, revenues, and EBITDA. As a result, the net profit after tax grew by 76% YoY to  ₹ 6,113 crore. With a 16% return on capital employed, JSW Steel is amongst the top 5 steel companies globally.""
In his outlook for FY19 he said, “with a 93% capacity utilisation targeted for the current year, there is a limited headroom to deliver volume growth till we complete our expansion projects by March 2020. Nevertheless, there are a number of other strategic levers which will help us to continue to improve our profitability over the next two years."" These include operationalising the remaining 3 of the 5 captive iron ore mines the company has in Karnataka. With this, JSW expects to meet approximately 20% of the total iron ore requirement at Vijayanagar. The company is also working on starting mining at the Moitra coking coal mine in Jharkhand by next year.
JSW is investing  ₹ 45,000 crore over a four-year period from FY2017-18 to FY2020-21 to expand its steel making capacities and to modernise and expand capacities of its downstream businesses. On completion, the company’s overall capacity will rise from currently 18 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to 24.7 mtpa by March 2020."

JSW Steel Ltd Wednesday said net profit in the June quarter rose 275% from a year ago to  ₹ 2,339 crore on higher domestic volumes, beating street expectations.
The increase in domestic sales was primarily to the automotive sector, which grew 57% year-on-year.
Crude steel production at India’s second largest steel-maker for the quarter was 4.11 million tonnes (mt) while revenue from operations rose 23% year-on-year to  ₹ 18,964 crore. Despite higher costs of key inputs like iron ore, coal, ferro alloys and natural gas, operating EBITDA for the quarter stood at  ₹ 4822 crore and EBITDA margin was 25.4%.
The company’s net debt increased  ₹ 1070 crore, primarily due to  ₹ 865 crore mark-to-market impact on rupee depreciation.
Protectionist measures by the US and Europe to safeguard their domestic steel industries, restricting imports into their jurisdictions, is leading to increased imports into India. “We have started the dialogue,"" Seshagiri Rao, Joint MD and Group CFO, JSW Steel, told the media on Wednesday after announcing the company’s first quarter results. “The industry will be making representation to the government, asking for a safeguard duty or fixed price mechanism from reference price mechanism as imports from the FTA (free trade agreement) countries has been higher than any other country.""
“Steel imports during the quarter increased by 15% year on year. After a gap of three years, India has become a net importer in the first quarter,"" said Rao. Imports from South Korea and Japan increased by 31 percent year on year and constituted 52 percent of total imports into the country. India has free trade agreements with these countries.
Steel demand in Q1 grew at 9.2% year-on-year. However, with imports growing 15% over the same period, the steel industry is asking for import duties on par with those being implemented in the US and across Europe. 
Shares of JSW Steel closed at  ₹ 316.65, down 0.52% on the BSE on Wednesday.

With demand improving, can supply be far behind? India’s steel consumption rose by 8.4% in the June quarter (Q1). JSW Steel Ltd sold more in its home market, with volume sales rising by 27% over a year ago compared to 11% overall sales growth. This shift was due to trade tensions sparked by the US decision to impose import tariffs on steel. Domestic sales had outpaced exports in the March quarter also.

This shift was due to trade tensions sparked by the US decision to impose import tariffs on steel. Domestic sales had outpaced exports in the March quarter also.
But imports have increased too, from countries such as China, South Korea and Japan, prompting the company to seek trade measures to limit the influx. India’s large and growing steel market will be a magnet for exporting countries.
For JSW Steel, the going has been good so far. Steel prices increased in the June quarter, blended realizations were up by 6% sequentially. Its Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin improved slightly. Sales did decline sequentially, but the June quarter is a seasonally weak one.
In FY19, steel prices may be range-bound for the next few quarters till clarity emerges on international steel trade flows. While India’s demand growth could sustain, JSW Steel’s domestic performance depends chiefly on product mix, price change and costs because its domestic capacity expansion will happen only by FY20. The company plans to merge Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd, the distressed asset it acquired in partnership with AION. This will add to domestic volume growth.
The bigger story at JSW Steel is on the overseas acquisition front. The company’s acquisitions in the US and Europe will reflect in its performance in the coming quarters. As a result, higher output will support sales growth, but these acquisitions may affect margins till JSW Steel is able to improve their performance. The main risks are from a fall in steel prices, either due to a global slide, rising imports into India or escalation of trade tensions. The effect of financing costs on its profit is another factor to watch for."

The two-judge NCLAT bench headed by Justice S.J. Mukhopadhyaya said that the tribunal was not going to pass any order as the matter was pending before the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Tata Steel moved the Supreme Court challenging the NCLAT’s order that allowed revision of bids for Bhushan Power and sought an urgent hearing on the matter as lenders might take a decision on resolution plans.
However, the three-judge panel headed by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra refused urgent hearing of Tata Steel’s plea and scheduled the matter for 10 August.
On Wednesday, the NCLAT directed the committee of creditors (CoC) to decide on the revised bids and keep it in a sealed cover after its submission on 6 August.
The bench said only the financial part of the bids could be changed.
The move came as a big blow for Tata Steel, which had been declared the highest qualified bidder for the second time by the CoC on Tuesday.
On 20 July, the NCLAT had directed the CoC to consider resolution plans submitted by Tata Steel, Liberty House and JSW Steel. It had also directed the CoC to call all the three bidders, along with operational creditors and the suspended board of directors of Bhushan Power and Steel, to the meeting.
JSW Steel has revised its offer from  ₹  11,000 crore to  ₹  18,000 crore, while Tata Steel’s offer stands at  ₹ 17,000 crore and Liberty House’s at  ₹ 18,600 crore.

“At that time when the second round of bidding was happening JSW Steel was looking at submitting the bid alone. We were not permitted. So, we have to see what view CoC and RP will take in the light of the Supreme Court judgement,"" he said.
The Supreme Court had on 4 October directed Numetal to clear all outstanding dues of not only Essar Steel but also bad debts of over one year of other Essar Group entities to be eligible to bid for the debt-laden steel maker. ArcelorMittal was also allowed by the court to submit revised resolution plans for Essar Steel provided it clears debtor dues within two weeks. ArcelorMittal has to clear  ₹  7,000 crore dues of Uttam Galva Steels and KSS Petron.
The two companies are required to submit their resolution plans in eight weeks thereafter.

Mumbai: Creditors of Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd, a major debt-laden Indian mill, are poised to name JSW Steel Ltd as the preferred bidder in a sale seen as a key test of the country’s new bankruptcy law, people familiar with the matter said.
A majority of Bhushan Power’s lenders selected the JSW proposal as the best offer, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. JSW bid about 196 billion rupees ($2.7 billion), higher than rivals Tata Steel Ltd. and Liberty House Group, Bloomberg News reported in August.
Bhushan Power, one of the first 12 assets shortlisted by the central bank to be sold through the insolvency resolution process, had claims of about 485 billion rupees admitted by the bankruptcy court. The resolution plan submitted by JSW Steel needs approval from Indian courts for the deal to be finalized, and the bidding process remains the subject of legal challenges.
A representative for JSW Steel declined to comment, while an email sent to the resolution professional overseeing the insolvency process wasn’t immediately answered.

Mumbai: JSW Steel Ltd may not pursue its interest in buying out bankrupt Essar Steel if it wins the stressed Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd instead, said two people close to the development. According to a few members of Bhushan Power and Steel’s committee of creditors (CoC) that Mint spoke to, bankers are overwhelmingly in favour of JSW Steel’s offer for the stressed plant. 
Mumbai: JSW Steel Ltd may not pursue its interest in buying out bankrupt Essar Steel if it wins the stressed Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd instead, said two people close to the development. According to a few members of Bhushan Power and Steel’s committee of creditors (CoC) that Mint spoke to, bankers are overwhelmingly in favour of JSW Steel’s offer for the stressed plant.
One banker that Mint spoke to, who did not wish to be named because the voting results are not yet public, said that JSW Steel’s offer of  ₹ 19,700 crore for the stressed plant has won the approval of more than 67% of the voting CoC members, the minimum threshold that the winning resolution plan should cross.
The final decision can only be announced by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), but banks are keen to go with the highest offer, the banker said.
Bhushan Power and Steel, under its earlier promoter Sanjay Singhal, had accumulated debts of over  ₹ 47,000 crore until it was forced into bankruptcy under the Reserve bank of India’s (RBI’s) first “dirty dozen"" list of NPA accounts.
In the initial round of bidding, Bhushan Power and Steel had got bids of  ₹ 11,000 crore from JSW Steel,  ₹ 17,000 crore from Tata Steel and  ₹ 18,500 crore from Liberty House.
JSW Steel had subsequently revised its bid to  ₹ 19,700 crore, which has now won the lenders’ approval.
Bhushan Power and Steel operates a 3.5 million tonne (mt) steel plant in Odisha.
“This is a much better strategic fit for JSW Steel, given its proximity to JSW’s flagship plant in Vijaynagar, Karnataka,"" said one person close to the development, requesting anonymity.
“If JSW wins this, it doesn’t make sense to pursue Essar Steel, which is much larger at 10mt, costs much more and is on the west coast.""
On 9 October, Press Trust of India had reported that JSW Steel was seeking a legal opinion on whether it could bid solo for Essar Steel. JSW had initially teamed up with Numetal Mauritius consortium in the second round of bids for Essar Steel, but the Supreme Court had deemed the consortium invalid if it failed to pay dues in connected bankrupt companies.
The Essar Steel case is stuck in a legal quagmire of its own, where both leading contenders for the assets—ArcelorMittal and Numetal Mauritius—required to pay vast amounts of debt in connected companies before qualifying to bid for it. Even so, the highest offer for Essar Steel, so far, has been from ArcelorMittal at  ₹ 42,000 crore, a bid that JSW Steel would find difficult to match.
On Wednesday, ArcelorMittal said it will pay  ₹ 7,469 crore to the financial creditors of Uttam Galva Steels Ltd and KSS Petron Pvt. Ltd to become eligible to bid for Essar Steel.
Meanwhile, a final decision on the fate of Bhushan Power and Steel hinges on the NCLAT hearing a plea from Tata Steel on 22 October, seeking to disqualify both Liberty House’s and JSW Steel’s bids.
Tata Steel has pointed out that Liberty had missed the deadline for submission of its offer, while JSW had changed the basic parameters of its bid when it revised it.
Even if the NCLAT respects the CoC’s decision to back JSW Steel’s offer, Mint could not independently confirm if Tata Steel would be willing to outbid the offer.

When contacted, a Tata Steel spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.

 Mumbai: The entry of ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, into the Indian market will force existing private sector players to increase efficiency and control costs, analysts say. A third steel producer, after Tata Steel Ltd and JSW Steel Ltd, with both financial heft and expertise, is expected to be good for the domestic market. 
 Mumbai: The entry of ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, into the Indian market will force existing private sector players to increase efficiency and control costs, analysts say. A third steel producer, after Tata Steel Ltd and JSW Steel Ltd, with both financial heft and expertise, is expected to be good for the domestic market.
On Friday, lenders to bankrupt Essar Steel declared that the highest bid was from the joint venture (JV) of Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal, promoted by Lakshmi Mittal, and Japan’s Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp. The joint venture had cleared off the  ₹ 7,469 crore of outstanding dues of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron—the bankrupt companies connected to Mittal—and had tabled a resolution plan that offered  ₹ 42,000 crore to buy out Essar Steel’s assets, which had accumulated debt of over  ₹ 49,000 crore.
Essar steel has a 10 million tonne (mt) per annum mill in Hazira, Gujarat. The company is a fully-integrated flat steel manufacturer with ore beneficiation, pellet making, iron making, steel making, and downstream facilities, including cold rolling mill, galvanizing, pre-coated facility, steel processing facility, extra wide plate mill and a pipe mill. In its FY17 annual report, the firm had said that it was the only private steel mill in the country which was allowed to supply steel for warships, submarines, battle tanks and armoured vehicles.
With Friday’s announcement, the joiint venture led by ArcelorMittal is inching towards closing the Essar Steel deal. Mittal is known to have built his career on buying out stressed steel mills across the world—in Mexico, Romania, South Africa, and the US—and turning them into profitable ventures, usually by ramping up volumes just in time for the upward steel cycle and controlling costs.
Even as ArcelorMittal battles to gain control of Essar Steel in India, it is simultaneously acquiring Italy’s Ilva, Europe’s largest steelmaker by capacity.
“ArcelorMittal is very good at turnarounds, at taking businesses in bad shape and making them profitable,"" said Atanu Mukherjee, president of global metals and energy consultant M.N. Dastur. “They bought the Calvert facility in US (from Thyssenkrupp AG) and it is now a world-class auto-grade steel manufacturing facility.""
“Traditionally, India has had a very fragmented steel market with a lot of secondary producers,"" he added. “This is a problem because it doesn’t give you economies of scale or the pricing power, and doesn’t help cost structure. With concentration happening among 3-4 larger players and some niche players in the value-added segment supporting them, India will have a more mature steel market without creating monopolies. The steel concentration ratio is moving up faster here than in any other country, but that is good for India."" The acquisition of Arcelor by Mittal Steel in 2005 weighed the new entity’s balance sheet down with debt of $35 billion.
Mittal had made several attempts to get his foot in the door in India, notably with projects planned in Odisha and Jharkhand, but neither took shape. With Essar Steel, he’s coming in not with just ready capacity to reckon with, but also at a time when India’s steel consumption is taking off. India currently has per-capita steel consumption of only 70kg a year, less than half the average of other developing nations. The World Steel Association expects Indian steel demand to climb 5.5% in 2018 and 6% in 2019, making us the fastest-growing market among the world’s top 10 steel consuming countries.
“For ArcelorMittal, the opportunity is huge,"" Mukherjee of M.N. Dastur said. “The other markets that they are in—mostly in Europe, US—those are saturating. The Essar Steel plant will really lay the foundation for expansion into India. They could, in fact, even increase capacity from the current 10mt to 20-25mt over the next decade. I don’t think that’s isn’t inconceivable.""
Despite nameplate capacity of 10mt, the Essar Steel mill at Hazira operates at 6-6.5mt. The bulk of its capacity is fuelled by expensive imported natural gas, unlike its competitors, who use coking coal as feedstock.
“ArcelorMittal might need to invest  ₹ 2,000-2,500 crore to de-bottleneck the plant, convert some of the direct reduction - arc furnace production to potentially blast furnace - basic oxygen route, and achieve full capacity utilisation of 10mt,"" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage firm. “If you look at Arcelor’s balance sheet, its debt-ebitda ratio is 1.2, or 1.3. It is now in a much better position to mobilise funds for the acquisition and operation of the plant. Making this investment is far more viable in terms of cost and time of setting up a greenfield project.""
Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
With automobile demand set to rise over the next decade in India, ArcelorMittal will leverage its partner Nippon Steel’s capabilities in creating high-end auto-grade flat steel.
“This will be the differentiator between ArcelorMittal, and Tata Steel and JSW in India,"" Mukherjee said. “The latter two are very good, and have partnerships with Nippon Steel and JFE Holdings, respectively. But ArcelorMittal has a long storied history in building steel for automobiles, in AHSS (advanced high-strength steels). This is where Arcelor is the best in the business."""

 New Delhi: Tata Steel Ltd on Monday objected to lenders of debt-laden Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL) finalizing a bid of its rival JSW Steel Ltd. The lenders allowed JSW Steel to change the basic parameters of its bid after having previously declared Tata Steel as the highest bidder, according to a plea filed by Tata Steel at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). 
On Monday, NCLAT heard the arguments made by the counsel appearing for Tata Steel and adjourned the hearing of the matter to 1 November.
Last week, more than two-thirds of lenders to BPSL voted in favour of a revised offer by JSW Steel, turning on the heat in a contest for an asset that is also being pursued by Tata Steel and UK’s Liberty House.
In the initial round of bidding, BPSL received bids of  ₹ 11,000 crore from JSW Steel,  ₹ 17,000 crore from Tata Steel and  ₹ 18,500 crore from Liberty House. Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW Steel subsequently revised its bid to  ₹ 19,700 crore, which has now won the lenders’ approval. 
A two-member NCLAT bench headed by Chairperson Justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya directed the counsel appearing for Tata Steel to complete arguments on the matter in the next hearing.
“Either complete the arguments or we’ll ask them (committee of creditors) to consider the revised plan (of JSW Steel),"" said the NCLAT bench.
“Because it’s the committee of creditors (CoC), it cannot allow changes after changes.... Six bids have been allowed by the CoC to JSW Steel,"" said senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing on behalf of Tata Steel.
The NCLAT had, in an interim order on 6 August, allowed all three contenders—Tata Steel, Liberty House and JSW—to file additional unconditional “resolution plans"" by 13 August 2018, improving their financial offer without compromising the basic parameters of the ‘resolution plans’ already submitted by them. But the committee of creditors allowed JSW to change basic parameters of its resolution plans.

In a recent interaction with Mint, Jayant Acharya, director (commercial and marketing) of JSW Steel, said apart from adding volume, the company is focusing on creating value-added products linked to segments and sectors which are growing, like automobile and consumer appliances.
JSW Steel is among India’s largest integrated steel producers with 18 million tonnes per annum of installed capacity and has announced a capital expenditure plan of  ₹ 44,415 crore to increase this to 24.7 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by FY21. Despite lacking captive raw material resource, JSW Steel is one of the most efficient producers of steel globally.
“When we add capacities at the hot strip mill in Dolvi (Maharashtra), we are putting up a line which is all with degassing facilities which can produce steel which is extremely clean for the automotive industry and for various high strength applications,"" Acharya said.
Dolvi is the second largest facility of JSW Steel. Currently at 5mtpa production capacity, the plant is undergoing a ramp-up, and in the next three years, this capacity will double to 10.7mtpa. “We are putting in downstream capacities for colour-coated steel at Vasind, Tarapur and Kalmeshwar, for the consumer appliance industry, and a wire rod mill in Vijayanagar to again cater to some of the long product demands which are coming in,"" he added.
“By FY21, after capacity expansion and the Monnet Ispat acquisition (of 1.5mtpa), we should be somewhere in the vicinity of 26mtpa,"" Acharya explained.
“But apart from adding only volume, we are also adding value-added products in our product portfolio. For instance, when we saw the automotive pipeline growing a few years back, we put in advanced high-strength steel capabilities in Vijayanagar which basically makes outer body panels or various parts for the auto industry, both for cold rolled and galvanized. We got in the technology of producing advanced high-strength steels for the automotive industry.
“Both our automotive and appliance lines are fully loaded today. If you look at general construction side, we put in products like TMT because we thought infrastructure will pick up over a period of the next few years. So, today, for TMT we have 3.5mtpa of capacity. We’re going into roofing and cladding, colour-coated roofing as in rural India, aspirations change from thatched and asbestos roofs to coloured roofs.
“We’ve gone into electrical steel for example, using technology from (Tokyo-based) JFE. Before this, electrical steel was imported for pumps, fans, motors, generators, etc. for all these but now, our electrical steel line is also fully loaded.
“So, apart from growing volumes, what we have done is that we have grown our portfolio of products in the specials in a very structured format,"" Acharya said. “We have tried to link it with the growth in economy in India and seeing which are the sectors coming up and we’re putting in our facilities to meet the demand of those sectors.

Mumbai: India’s two biggest private sector steel companies JSW Steel Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd are banking on their diversified product mix to take on steel giant ArcelorMittal SA as it gears up to enter the country.
In October, creditors of bankrupt Essar Steel approved a  ₹ 50,000 crore joint offer by ArcelorMittal and Japan’s Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal for Essar’s assets, paving the way for the first major foreign bets on steel manufacturing in India.
Both JSW Steel and Tata Steel, during separate meetings with media on Tuesday, said the entry of the global giant in India’s fast growing steel market would be good for competition.
However, the companies said their customer relationships, array of value-added products and customisation would help them retain and grow market share and take on competition.
“Obviously from Tata Steel point of view, we will continue to up the ante,"" T.V. Narendran, chief executive and managing director of Tata Steel said on Tuesday. “We have the technology and the product lines that are required.""
ArcelorMittal’s entry into India comes at a time when Indian steel demand is growing at the fastest pace in the world.

ArcelorMittal plans to increase capacity of Essar’s plant to 15 million tonnes from 10 million tonnes now, and produce higher grades of products. Owned by billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, ArcelorMittal is the world’s biggest steel company with a total tonnage of 97.03 million tonnes in 2017.
Analysts feel ArcelorMittal’s foray will force major Indian steelmakers to innovate, despite them downplaying the impact. “ArcelorMittal’s entry would spur a shift from steel capacity expansion to product/technology evolution by incumbents,"" said domestic broking firm Edelweiss in a report.

“The next set of assets is either downstream or very small capacities. So, if it makes sense to our downstream integration strategy. We will evaluate the asset and pursue,"" Rao said.
The investment in downstream capabilities by JSW Steel is aimed at capitalising the incremental demand expected to be generated across sectors for specialised steel. While 300 million tonnes (MT) of steel consumption is expected to come in, the steel intensity across applications is coming down.
“This is where the demand for very high value steel products is rising. Circular economy is becoming very active,"" Rao said.
Jayant Acharya, Director Commercial - Marketing and Strategy, JSW Steel, said, the company will “reduce focus in commodity space and enter into alloy steel and special steel space to make the business more sustainable in the long term. Our aim is to look at more and more de-competitive business segment as a key indicator of focusing more on special steel categories"".
As part of its long-term play, the company is depriortising its focus on commodity steel space.
According to Rao, while overall capacity of JSW Steel will grow by 40% over the next three years, the downstream capacity will increase by 60%, colour coated capacity will go up by 140% and tinplate capacity will increase six-folds.
The company expects special steel products to contribute 40% of its future volumes while customisation products will add the rest 60%.
“We are not going to produce commodity. Basis our very customised steel portfolio and high-end value-added product mix, the business will become less volatile,"" Rao said. JSW Steel believes that it is unperturbed about new competition from global steel players.
“We think there is enough space for growth and healthy competition is good. If you look at competition earlier, certain companies which were stressed were at times forced to sell materials at lower prices to generate cash flows whereas with healthy competitors that problem will be eliminated to some extent,"" Acharya said. The company said that it sees the Indian steel landscape becoming more mature from a competition perspective. “We see our growth potential with respect to India across short, medium and long term. I don’t think we need to worry about the competitive landscape,"" he added.

90,2018-11-26,JSW,"JSW Steel Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd are banking on their diversified product mix to take on ArcelorMittal SA as it gears up to enter India post the Essar Steel acquisition

Mumbai: India’s two biggest private sector steel companies JSW Steel Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd are banking on their diversified product mix to take on steel giant ArcelorMittal SA as it gears up to enter the country. In October, creditors of bankrupt Essar Steel India approved a  ₹ 50,000 crore joint offer by ArcelorMittal and Japan’s Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal for Essar Steel’s assets, paving the way for the first major foreign bets on steel manufacturing in India. 
Mumbai: India’s two biggest private sector steel companies JSW Steel Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd are banking on their diversified product mix to take on steel giant ArcelorMittal SA as it gears up to enter the country. In October, creditors of bankrupt Essar Steel India approved a  ₹ 50,000 crore joint offer by ArcelorMittal and Japan’s Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal for Essar Steel’s assets, paving the way for the first major foreign bets on steel manufacturing in India.
Both JSW Steel and Tata Steel, during separate meetings with media on 13 November, said the entry of the global giant in India’s fast growing steel market would be good for competition.
However, the companies said their customer relationships, array of value-added products and customisation would help them retain and grow market share and take on competition.
“Obviously from Tata Steel point of view, we will continue to up the ante,"" T.V. Narendran, chief executive and managing director of Tata Steel said. “We have the technology and the product lines that are required.""
ArcelorMittal’s entry into India comes at a time when Indian steel demand is growing at the fastest pace in the world. India is expected to overtake the United States in steel consumption in 2019 to become the second biggest market behind China, global steel body World Steel Association said in a report last month.
ArcelorMittal plans to increase capacity of Essar Steel’s plant to 15 million tonnes from 10 million tonnes now, and produce higher grades of products. Owned by billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, ArcelorMittal is the world’s biggest steel company with a total tonnage of 97.03 million tonnes in 2017.
Analysts feel ArcelorMittal’s foray will force major Indian steelmakers to innovate, despite them downplaying the impact.
“ArcelorMittal’s entry would spur a shift from steel capacity expansion to product/technology evolution by incumbents,"" said domestic broking firm Edelweiss in a report.
Indian steelmakers say this is already in the works. 
“Each one of us in my view has enough space,"" Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director of JSW Steel, said on 13 September, referring to India’s growing steel market.
Rao said in-line with global trends JSW Steel had already started to move from “volumes to value"" to secure its profitability and market share in the future.
JSW Steel is spending up to  ₹ 6,000 crore to expand its value-added offerings like automotive steel, electrical steel, and galvanised products by over 60% over the next three years, out of a total spend of  ₹ 4,500 crore on expansions.
“We will completely transform JSW Steel...and also align the company in-line with what the market demands,"" he said."
89,2018-12-10,JSW,"JSW Steel is the lone stock that's set to end in the green in the 10-member S&P BSE Metal Index, which lost nearly a quarter of its value in 2018

Mumbai: Metal stocks in India are feeling unloved by investors, with one exception: the country’s top steelmaker JSW Steel Ltd. 
Mumbai: Metal stocks in India are feeling unloved by investors, with one exception: the country’s top steelmaker JSW Steel Ltd.
While demand for metals has been accelerating as the South Asian nation plans major investments to overhaul its creaking infrastructure, shares of most producers have slumped this year. JSW Steel is the lone stock that’s set to end in the green in the 10-member S&P BSE Metal Index, which lost nearly a quarter of its value in 2018. The index is set for its first annual decline in three years, while the country’s benchmark index is edging toward its third year of gains.
The Sajjan Jindal-led mill has risen about 12% this year. That compares with a 26% drop in rival Tata Steel Ltd and a 45% decline in state-run Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL). Among base metal producers, Vedanta Ltd has lost 41%.
A fall in global metal prices on trade tensions between the US and China amid higher raw material costs has weighed on the sector. China’s steelmakers are facing their biggest test in three years, as the intensifying trade standoff has added to the pressures on the economy—including the parts that consume most steel. Steel futures in China have fallen over 20% since reaching a seven-year high in August, while the LME Index has fallen about 16% this year, led by declines in zinc, lead and copper.
Bright outlook
Still, the outlook for India’s steel sector remains bright as the spreads between raw material prices and finished products haven’t fallen compared with other regions and domestic demand growth is expected to remain the highest in the world, Amit Dixit, an analyst at Edelweiss Securities Ltd., said a 3 December report.
India is set to overtake the US as the world’s second-largest consumer of steel soon and demand is estimated to grow by 7% in the near- to medium-term driven by the government’s infrastructure spending. Copper usage is expected to accelerate by 10% this fiscal year, while aluminium consumption is estimated to rise 5%.
JSW Steel remains the top pick among metal companies as other firms grapple with elevated debt, high employee costs and non-performing overseas assets, Bhavesh Chauhan, an analyst at IDBI Capital Markets & Securities Ltd, said by phone from Mumbai.
“JSW in that sense has mainly domestic plants, which have very efficient processes, lowest conversion costs and its volume growth has always been better than others."""

Mumbai: IFCI Ltd, the erstwhile Industrial Finance Corp. of India, has challenged the AION Capital-JSW Steel Ltd resolution plan for Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd, which treats IFCI’s secured loan as unsecured debt, before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). Last April, Monnet Ispat’s committee of creditors (CoC) had approved the resolution plan to revive the distressed steel manufacturer.
 Subsequently, the resolution professional (RP) had submitted the AION-JSW resolution plan to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for approval. In July 2018, the tribunal had approved the  ₹ 2,875-crore plan by the AION-JSW Steel consortium, which was the sole bidder for the assets.
Monnet Ispat’s debt stood at  ₹ 11,000 crore.
“One of the grounds taken by the appellant is that the resolution plan discriminates between Monnet Ispat’s financial creditors and, thereby, is against the ratio laid down by this appellate tribunal in the Binani Industries Ltd vs Bank of Baroda case,"" said the division bench of justices S.J. Mukhopadhaya and Bansi Lal Bhat in its ruling on 10 January. Monnet Ispat owes around  ₹ 158 crore to IFCI.
In the Binani Industries case, while striking down the resolution plan submitted by Dalmia Bharat Pvt. Ltd-owned Rajputana Properties Pvt. Ltd, the NCLAT had ruled that discriminating between different categories of financial creditors is unlawful.
The NCLAT has directed the resolution applicants (AION-JSW) to either modify the financial matrix of the resolution plan or to argue on its legality at the next hearing. It will next hear the matter on 29 January.
The AION-JSW Steel consortium has also sought the appellate tribunal’s permission to hear their side of the argument.
“The issue arises out of the fact that the plan has prescribed different treatment to different categories of financial creditors, between secured and unsecured financial creditors, and also treats IFCI’s secured debt as an unsecured debt,"" argued IFCI lawyers in the court.
N.P.S. Chawla, associate partner of law firm Vaish Associates, which is representing IFCI in the NCLAT, confirmed the development, but refused to divulge further details since the matter is subjudice.
An email query to Monnet Ispat and Energy remained unanswered.
Monnet Ispat is among the major stressed assets from the so-called first list of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which were taken up under the resolution process.
Bharat Heavy Enterprises Ltd (BHEL) has also approached the NCLAT challenging the CoC’s decision, arguing that it has assigned nil liquidation value to its operational dues."
87,2019-01-24,JSW,"JSW Steel will be an equity partner with the Ruias’ Essar group, along with foreign financial investorsThe Ruias have offered to repay almost all of Essar Steel’s debt of  ₹54,550 crore

JSW Steel Ltd will support the Ruia family in its bid to win back control of Essar Steel Ltd, if a bankruptcy court approves the family’s offer to repay all outstanding debt of the insolvent steel maker.
JSW will be an equity partner with the Ruias’ Essar group, along with foreign financial investors, according to two people aware of talks between the two promoter groups.
The Ruias have offered to repay almost all of Essar Steel’s debt of  ₹54,550 crore, topping the  ₹42,000 crore bid by ArcelorMittal that was approved by the bankrupt steel maker’s committee of lenders. The Ruias’ offer, however, faces a formidable legal hurdle as India’s bankruptcy code bars promoters of insolvent companies from bidding for such assets.
The resolution of Essar Steel, a 10 million tonne per annum steel mill, has tied up creditors, prospective buyers and courts in knots. Prashant Ruia, chief executive of Essar group, told reporters on 16 January that he was confident both creditors and courts would back his group’s higher bid of  ₹54,389 crore, allowing it to win the steel mill back.
“We have equity partners who are backing the bid,"" Ruia said, without naming the investors.
Now, it appears JSW Steel is keen to back the Ruia offer. “The Jindals may be unwilling to come out publicly to support them right away,"" a person aware of talks between the two promoter families said. “But if the Ruias succeed in convincing the court of their argument, I believe JSW will then come in as an equity partner.""
The Ruias have also tied up with a few foreign partners to back its offer. JSW, on its part, may also vie for operational control of the plant, which will give it a foothold in western India.
In fact, JSW Steel unsuccessfully tried to be part of Essar Steel’s resolution process in its early stages. In April 2018, JSW acquired 26% in the Indian subsidiary of Numetal Mauritius, in effect taking the place of Essar family member Rewant Ruia, who was part of an earlier avatar of the Numetal consortium that bid for Essar Steel. When that bid failed, JSW Steel toyed with the idea of submitting a lone bid, but abandoned the plan when it became clear that it would not pass muster in court.
JSW is currently implementing a massive capacity expansion at its existing steel plants, with a target to reach 24.7 million tonnes a year by FY21. Despite lacking captive raw material resource, JSW Steel is one of the most efficient producers of steel globally. Even partial control of the Essar steel mill will add significantly to its heft in the domestic steel market, leaving competitors such as Tata Steel Ltd and public sector firm Steel Authority of India Ltd far behind.
“Allowing the Ruias to stay on gives JSW the added advantage of keeping ArcelorMittal out,"" another person said on condition of anonymity. “Even if ArcelorMittal chooses to match the Ruia bid and pay all creditors in full, their cost of acquisition will be so high that the plant will take several years before it can be financially sustainable.""
A spokesperson for JSW Steel said it doesn’t comment on market speculation. An email sent to a spokesperson for Essar group remained unanswered till press time.
BloombergQuint reported on Tuesday that Sajjan Jindal is of the view that the Ruias should be a given a chance to take control of Essar Steel despite the legal restrictions as they are offering to repay the entire debt.
In response to Sajjan Jindal’s comments supporting the Ruias, a spokesperson for ArcelorMittal said: “It appears there are certain parties in India who would like that the IBC not be implemented according to the law. The IBC was introduced for a very serious reason—to address a major problem with bad loans. If the law is not implemented correctly and the rules are flouted, as suggested by some, this sends a negative signal about the certainty of India as an investment destination… ArcelorMittal has followed the process from the start. We fully expect the process to continue to be implemented correctly and as per the law and that statements attempting to convince otherwise not be given any credibility.""
Either way, a decision has to be taken soon. On Wednesday, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) directed the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to pass an order on the insolvency case filed against Essar Steel (India) Ltd. “We allow the designated authority (NCLT) to pass appropriate orders by the next date, failing which this appellate tribunal will decide,"" said a two-member NCLAT bench headed by its chairperson, Justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya. If the Ahmedabad bench of NCLT does not pass any order by 31 January, NCLAT would pass an order accordingly on the next date of hearing, the bench added.
The Essar Steel case is mired in several rounds of litigation and counter-litigation, filed by the Essar Group, prospective bidders and operational creditors unhappy with certain aspects of the resolution. A lawyer, who is party to one of the several cases involving Essar Steel, said: “The NCLAT is concerned about the approval of ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan and the objections against it. However, NCLT will have to take everything into consideration, including the application by Ruias for approval of their resolution plan, while deciding on the matter. If the resolution plan by ArcelorMittal is approved, then automatically the Ruia’s appeal stands cancelled.""

86,2019-01-29,JSW,"JSW plans to expand steelmaking capacity by 2030 to between 44 million tonnes and 45 million tonnes A $600 million dollar deal would equate to about 1 million tonnes of steel supply

London: Indian conglomerate JSW Steel and global trading firm Duferco are in advanced talks on a five-year cash-for-steel prepayment deal, four sources familiar with the matter said, in a rare move for the industry.
JSW, India's biggest steelmaker, and Duferco had a prepayment deal in 2006 for $150 million in upfront cash that would be repaid over seven years with steel cargoes, but the scale of the proposed new deal is much larger.
Two sources said the deal, expected to be signed this quarter, would be worth about $600 million. Switzerland-based Duferco, backed by banks, would provide the cash to be repaid with physical steel.
Duferco, one of the world's largest steel trading firms, declined to comment. JSW did not confirm the value of the deal, but said it has a longstanding relationship with Duferco that involves financing arrangements.
One of the sources said JSW was looking for alternate sources of funding while, for Duferco, the deal would lock in future sales of steel with its clients.
Jeff Kabel, chairman of the International Steel Trade Association (ISTA), said the deal would represent ""a great move forward"" for an industry that has seen few such arrangements to date.
Steel derivatives, which allow buyers and sellers to lock in future prices, are still in their infancy, making trade houses wary of pre-paying for large tonnages and risk prices moving against them in the future.
Such deals are frequent in commodities such as oil, with liquid derivatives markets that allow for hedging future sales.
A $600 million dollar deal would equate to about 1 million tonnes of steel supply.
""Its rather innovative. The only thing steel companies usually do is pre-export finance and not that big a number,"" said Kabel, referring to financing options that do not involve repayments in physical cargoes.
In 2013, as banks increasingly withdrew from Europes steel sector, Duferco moved to offer its clients trade financing, though these deals typically involved it acting as a bank, not taking delivery of steel.
JSW plans to expand steelmaking capacity by 2030 to between 44 million tonnes and 45 million tonnes from 19 million tonnes currently.
In 2017 it earmarked $1 billion for acquisitions and expansion but has had to proceed more cautiously this year as steel prices have fallen to their lowest in nearly a year and there are growing concerns the upcycle might reverse.
Duferco, controlled by state-owned Hebei Iron and Steel Group (Hesteel), China's largest steelmaker, has activities in more than 120 countries and sales of about 20 million tonnes of steel and raw materials a year.

MUMBAI :
Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW Energy reported a 3-fold jump in net profit in the December 2018 quarter at  ₹147.08 crore, up from  ₹50.55 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal. The management attributed the company's performance to higher generation, better recoveries and lower interest costs in the quarter.
Generation at its flagship coal-fired Vijayanagar and Ratnagiri plants was at 57% and 83.7%, respectively, increasing significantly from 51.2% and 77.8% the previous year. The lignite-fed Barmer plant had an average deemed PLF of 79.5% whike the hydro electric plant in Baspa achieved an average PLF of 24.2%. As prices in the merchant power market pick up - they averaged at  ₹4.28 a unit in the December quarter -- JSW Energy's sales on the spot market have also improved. Power sales are now split 80.5% and 19.5% between fixed power purchase agreements and open market sales, the company said in a press conference.
The company is also resuming its construction of the 240MW hydro power project in Kutehr in Himachal Pradesh and is currently in advanced negotiations with power distributors to tie-up its capacity in long-term fixed PPAs.
Income from operations for the quarter rose to  ₹2,491 crore, from  ₹2,081 crore while expenses rose to  ₹2,271 crore from  ₹1,989 crore. EBITDA for the quarter was at  ₹809 crore against  ₹673 crore in the previous period. The company paid off debt  ₹296 crore with net debt now stood at  ₹10,686 crore.
The company, which has plans to enter the electric vehicle segment by manufacturing electric passenger vehicles at a total project cost of  ₹6,500 crore, said progress on this front has been faster than expected but stopped short of giving a launch date. ""We are still working towards a launch in 2020 but the business will take 3-4 years before complete quarry. You can expect some announcements from the company in the current quarter,"" Prashant Jain, joint MD and CEO, JSW Energy said.
However, Jain added that the company's strategy in this segment has changed from its earlier stance of providing for the EV ecosystem - through vehicles, charging points and energy storage -- to now only building passenger vehicles.
The company also has an outstanding loan facility  ₹481 crore to Jindal Steel and Power, owned by Naveen Jindal, younger brother to JSW group chairman Sajjan Jindal. The company is also working on a resolution to its outstanding exposure of  ₹752 crore made to Jaiprakash Power Ventures Ltd for a proposed acquisition of a thermal power plant.

NEW DELHI :
Tata Steel Ltd suffered a setback on Monday when the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) dismissed a petition by the steel giant that alleged that the committee of creditors (CoC) for Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL) allowed rival JSW Steel Ltd to change the basic parameters of its bid despite Tata Steel having been declared the highest bidder.
“We hold that this appeal preferred by Tata Steel Limited is premature, uncalled for, in absence of any final decision taken by the adjudicating authority under Section 31,"" said a two-member NCLAT bench headed by chairperson Justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya.
The appellate tribunal also upheld the CoC’s right to change, update, supplement, add to, delay or otherwise annul or cease the resolution process at any time.
“Thus, the resolution plan can be modified as per dates or other terms and conditions set out in the process document,"" the bench said.
The judgement by the appellate tribunal comes one-and-a-half months after it finished hearing arguments on the plea. BPSL, which operates a 3.5 million tonne (mt) steel plant in Odisha, owes more than  ₹ 48,500 crore to a group of lenders led by Punjab National Bank. It is one of the 12 large companies identified by the Reserve Bank of India for early resolution.
In October, more than two-thirds of BPSL’s lenders voted in favour of a revised offer by JSW Steel, turning up the heat in a contest for an asset that is also being pursued by Tata Steel and UK’s Liberty House.
In the initial round of bidding, BPSL received bids of  ₹11,000 crore from JSW Steel,  ₹17,000 crore from Tata Steel and  ₹18,500 crore from Liberty House. However, Liberty House failed to participate and provide necessary documents, including confidentiality affidavit within the time lines as provided by the resolution professional. Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW Steel subsequently revised its bid, which won the lenders’ approval.
NCLAT had, in an interim order on 6 August, allowed all three contenders—Tata Steel, Liberty House and JSW—to file additional unconditional “resolution plans"" by 13 August 2018, improving their financial offer without compromising the basic parameters of the resolution plans already submitted by them. However, the committee of creditors allowed JSW to change the basic parameters of its resolution plans, according to Tata Steel.
“In fact, 97.12% voting shares of members being present in the meeting of the committee of creditors and all of them have casted vote in favour of JSW Steel, we hold the resolution plan submitted by JSW Steel’ as been approved with 100% voting shares,"" the bench said on Monday and directed the resolution professional to immediately place the approved resolution plan before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Delhi for its order.
NCLAT also asked NCLT Delhi to ensure no discrimination is made between the financial creditors and operational creditors while approving the resolution plan. In case, such an observation is made with respect to JSW Steel’s plan, then “it (NCLT Delhi) may give opportunity to JSW Steel to improve its plan and by substituting the approved resolution plan with such improvement,"" the bench said.
The NCLAT also ordered the period of pendency of the appeal (from 7 May 2018 till date) to be excluded for the purpose of counting of the period of 270 days. Under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, a resolution plan has to be arrived at within 270 days, failing which the firm goes into liquidation."
83,2019-02-05,JSW,"Local producers are suffering from the double whammy of a rise in cheap imports and low domestic steel pricesIndia's top four steelmakers are the key companies who have complained

MUMBAI :
Indian steel firms are putting pressure on the government to impose higher duties on imports as trade disputes and a global economic slowdown divert surplus Asian steel stocks to India, industry executives and government sources said.
Local producers are suffering from the double whammy of a rise in cheap imports and low domestic steel prices, which threatens to wipeout the healthy profits made in the past couple of years.
The steel companies have approached the ministry multiple times over the past few months, alleging China, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam are dumping various grades of low-cost steel into the Indian market and stealing market share as a result, three government sources said.
India's top four steelmakers - JSW Steel Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd, state-owned Steel Authority of India Ltd and Jindal Steel and Power Ltd - who together control over 45% of India's total steel production, are the key companies who have complained, the sources said.
The ministry has given various indications that some measures might be taken, the sources added. However, they are more likely to be non-tariff measures as India has already suffered defeat in a dispute with Japan at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on charges that New Delhi unfairly imposed import duties in 2016 to safeguard its steel industry.
The WTO upheld Japan's complaint in November but India is planning to appeal.
The steel ministry did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comment.
RISING IMPORTS
Imports of various grades of steel into India rose by around 8% in the April-December 2018 period, compared with a year earlier, government data showed.
During the same period, exports from India fell by more than 17%, making the country a net importer of steel, mainly because the U.S., one of India's biggest markets, imposed additional duties last year on steel coming from some Asian countries, including India.
As a result, the nation's steel imports from countries such as Japan, South Korea and Indonesia surged. Chinese imports also climbed in the final quarter of 2018, Indian companies say.
According to government figures, for the April-September 2018 period imports from South Korea rose 29% from the year-earlier period, Japanese imports increased 35%, and Indonesian imports by 106%.
""The worry is imports,"" said Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director at JSW Steel, India's biggest steel company based on local production. He said the government had to ""ensure that our borders are protected and goods will not come into India and hurt the domestic steel industry.""
The price of steel in India dropped by an average of more than 10% between October and December, according to government data.
Domestic brokerage firm Edelweiss Securities said that they see earnings at metals companies ""going downhill"" after the third quarter.
Anil Kumar Chaudhary, chairman of SAIL, and Rao from JSW Steel, told Reuters they have both told the government of their concerns about imports.
Tata Steel and JSPL did not reply to an email seeking comment.
EXISTING MEASURES
India has been monitoring the impact of imported cheaper steel from China on domestic industry, the government said last month.
In a bid to support use of locally made steel, the ministry has urged automakers to cut imports from Japan and Korea. That has led to a dispute between the government and automakers who claim local producers are unable to make the high-quality steel they need.
India has already imposed stricter quality controls on more than 85% of steel products and it is expanding the list of locally made steel that must be used in government infrastructure projects, two government sources said. It is unclear if any low quality shipments have been turned back.
India's steel minister Chaudhary Birender Singh told Reuters earlier this month that the government wants to expand the quality control regime to all steel products very soon.
The government is also considering imposing higher duties on the import of iron ore, a key raw material, to help state-owned miner NMDC Ltd, the sources said. While this could hurt JSW Steel, other steel majors have their own captive iron ore mines which shields them from price volatility.
Abhyuday Jindal, managing director of Jindal Stainless, the country's largest stainless steel producer, said the company had asked the government review import duty on raw materials, as well as the impact of free trade agreements with the likes of Japan, South Korea and southeast Asian countries.

JSW Steel Ltd on Wednesday reported 10% fall in the third quarter net profit, despite higher revenues, thanks to depreciation and higher interest expenses at two of its overseas subsidiaries.
The Sajjan Jindal-promoted company reported consolidated net profit of  ₹1,603 crore, 10% below the  ₹1,774 crore reported a year ago.
Revenue from operations rose 11% to  ₹20,318 crore from  ₹18,264 crore in Q3FY18, while operating Ebitda rose 17% to  ₹4,501 crore. Operating margin during the quarter was 22.2%.
Steel sales fell 7% in volumes in the December quarter to 3.68 million tonnes (mt) primarily because of a 70% fall in exports. Because of poor global demand and weak international prices, exports contributed to only 10% of total sales in Q3. However, exports are expected to pick up in Q4, as global prices for steel improve and demand rebounds after the Chinese New Year.
The company may miss its FY19 sales guidance of 16mt by 2-3%, the management indicated, since the first three quarters fetched sales volumes of only 71.6% of the full-year target. The lost volumes may not be recouped in the fourth quarter, it added.
With unsold inventory built up to 300,000 tonnes, “we will focus in Q4 on trying to reduce inventory and achieving maximum possible sales,"" said Seshagiri Rao M.V.S., joint managing director and group chief financial officer, JSW Steel Ltd.
At the end of December 2018, the company’s net debt stood at  ₹46,000 crore, up  ₹1,200 crore from the preceding quarter. The debt to Ebitda ratio was 2.32.

Mumbai: The committee of creditors of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd have issued a letter of intent to India's largest private steelmaker JSW Steel Ltd, thus approving the latter's resolution plan for the distressed steel mill. JSW Steel will now pay Rs19,700 crore in upfront cash to Bhushan Power and Steel's lenders and infuse  ₹350 crore in the steelmaker to revive it. 
Bhushan Power and Steel is the second insolvent firm acquired by Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Steel after Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd last year.
Bhushan Power and Steel operates a 3.5 million tonne (mt) steel plant in Odisha. Under its earlier promoter Sanjay Singhal, the company had accumulated debt of more than  ₹47,000 crore. It was one of firms in Reserve Bank of India's ""dirty dozen"" list of NPA accounts referred to the bankruptcy courts under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
In the initial round of bidding, Bhushan Power and Steel received bids of  ₹11,000 crore from JSW Steel,  ₹17,000 crore from Tata Steel Ltd and  ₹18,500 crore from Liberty House. JSW Steel subsequently revised its bid to  ₹19,700 crore.
Tata Steel had challenged the validity of Liberty House's and JSW Steel's bid in court, which it lost. Subsequently, on Monday, JSW Steel received the letter of intent from lenders. Now, the resolution plan needs to be approved by NCLT Delhi before JSW Steel can complete the acquisition, the company said in a filing to the stock exchanges.
JSW Steel had in the past said that if it were to win Bhushan Power and Steel, the buy would be partly funded by an equity rights issue of  ₹5,000 crore and a new investor could also be brought in."
79,2019-02-19,JSW,"Reliance Industries, HCL Technologies, Wipro and JSW Steel are among the firms that haven't yet split the CMD postA third of the firms that have not complied with the rule so far are public sector enterprises or state-run banks

New Delhi: More than two-thirds of India’s top publicly-traded companies have separated the positions of chairman and managing director (CMD), although the deadline to comply with the rules is more than 13 months away.
That leaves just 156 of the BSE 500 companies to still untangle the role of CMD as of 15 February, compared with 291 in July last year, according to Prime Database, a primary market research tracking firm.
The idea behind the separation of the two positions is to bolster corporate governance. The separation of powers, according to some experts, increases the effectiveness of the board’s oversight role.
A third of the companies that have not complied with the rule so far are public sector enterprises or state-run banks. Although companies still have time to meet the April 2020 deadline, most firms, save for some family-run and government-controlled firms, have started the process of splitting the two positions.
India’s most valuable company, Reliance Industries Ltd, the country’s third and fourth largest information technology services firms, HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd, respectively, and JSW Steel Ltd are among the companies that need to comply with the new rules.
The four, along with 90 of India’s largest publicly traded companies, have members of the promoter group holding both the chairman and MD titles.
“Promoters still appear to be looking at how else they can retain maximum power over their firms and so a perceived reluctance on their part to split the titles,"" said the head of a proxy advisory firm, on condition of anonymity.
But most companies have initiated efforts to comply with the rules. One of the most recent examples is Persistent Systems Ltd, a software services company based in Pune. Chairman and MD Anand Deshpande last week decided to relinquish his role as MD. Christopher O’Connor will take over as chief executive on 26 February. “The transition will take at least six months. So we decided to start the process a year in advance,"" said Deshpande. At Persistent, Deshpande will transfer his CEO responsibilities to O’Connor, who joins the company on 25 February, over the next three quarters.
Persistent and Tata Coffee Ltd are some of the 135 companies that have, over the past seven months, separated the CMD role. This was after the Securities and Exchange Board of India approved many of the recommendations made by a 25-member panel led by Uday Kotak, chief executive of Kotak Mahindra Bank.
One of these recommendations was the contentious issue of a company splitting the role of CMD.
More companies of the remaining 156 in the list could split the CMD roles during the annual general meetings later this year. “I expect that during the July-August period when most companies hold their AGMs (annual general meetings), more companies will put this proposal of splitting the role of chairman and managing director before their shareholders,"" said Shriram Subramanian, founder and MD of proxy advisory firm InGovern Research."

MUMBAI :
JSW Cement, a part of the Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Group, plans to invest around  ₹2,000 crore to achieve the target of 20 million tonne annual capacity by December 2020, a top company official said Tuesday.
The city-based company is also likely to begin the work on the much-awaited initial public offer from this December and hopes to launch the issue before March 2021, the official said.
""With the commissioning of enhanced capacity at the Dolvi plant in Maharashtra from 1 mtpa to 2.2 mtpa, our installed capacity has increased to 12.6 mtpa and we hope that by the end of this fiscal year, we will reach 14 mtpa as we will be commissioning the Jajpur unit in Odisha soon,"" JSW Cement managing director Parth Jindal told reporters.
The junior Jindal said the company, which has grown from 6 mtpa three years ago to 12.6 mtpa now, is hopeful of reaching an installed capacity of 20 mtpa by December 2020.
""We have a capex plan of around  ₹2,000 crore to achieve the target and we are looking at both organic and inorganic opportunities,"" he said, adding they are also evaluating a few stressed assets but in the short-to medium term, the focus will be execution as there are lots of opportunities in brownfield expansion.
The company is looking at a 70:30 debt-equity ratio the expansion. The company has  ₹2,400 crore debt in its books now.
""We've been strategically acquiring limestone mines in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Gujarat. This, coupled with our expansion in Fujairah in the UAE, will give us enough clinker security along with limestone,"" Jindal said, adding the Fujairah facility is expected to be operational by March 2020.
He further said the company will be spending a significant amount on advertising and marketing as it is entering Odisha and Rajasthan, among other new markets.
Asked about the size of the proposed IPO, he said, ""it's a little bit early to speak about the issue size, but I think we are looking at an enterprise value of  ₹25,000- 30,000 crore.""
He further said initially the company would be looking at a 15 percent promoter share dilution and another 5-10 percent over the next few years.
""But if we go in for a more aggressive expansion, then we will dilute more, but if we choose to be conservative, we would dilute less. Initially 15 percent is the target that we have,"" Jindal added.
The company hopes to ramp up its capacity further to 30 mtpa after going public with the addition of 5 mtpa each in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.

Mumbai: JSW Steel Ltd will not be able to seek an equity partner in the initial stage of its acquisition of bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL), said a senior company executive.
Recent rulings by courts under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) state that the structure of a resolution applicant, whether as an individual or a consortium, has to be maintained from the time of submitting an expression of interest till the completion of the deal, M.V.S. Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director and group chief financial officer, JSW Steel said in an interview last week.
JSW Steel made the highest bid for BPSL, with an upfront cash payment of  ₹19,350 crore to the lenders of BPSL, and an equity infusion of  ₹350 crore to revive the steel mill’s operations. In early February, JSW Steel received the Letter of Intent from the resolution professional, recommending the sale of the distressed plant to the Sajjan Jindal-promoted steel major. The transaction is awaiting the approval of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)
“When Bhushan Power was initially referred to the NCLT, we thought the transaction would close by 31 March, but the way the hearings have been going on, it has been very slow,"" Rao said on the sidelines of Mint India Investment Summit which concluded on 1 March.
“Initially, it will not be possible to bring a partner in the way we were saying earlier, since we had submitted the bid on our own. We will have to complete the transaction...maybe afterwards, we can bring somebody in.""
On 25 October, directors of JSW Steel approved in-principle a rights issue of up to  ₹5,000 crore to fund the potential acquisition of BPSL. Besides, the management had indicated that were it to win the asset, it would bring in a financial partner to partly finance the acquisition cost. However, now it seems that JSW Steel will have to fork out the entire cost of acquisition on its own.
BPSL operates a 3.5 million tonne plant in Odisha. 
Bhushan Power will be JSW’s second acquisition of a steel mill under the IBC.
Last July, JSW Steel bagged 1.5 million tonnes of Monnet Ispat’s steel-making capacity in Chattisgarh for  ₹2,875 crore. An additional  ₹1,000 crore was pledged as equity and working capital infusion. The acquisition was made through a 30:70 joint venture between JSW Steel and Aion Capital.
In a separate development, on Saturday, JSW Steel announced that the company has closed a $700 million, five-year advance payment and supply agreement with steel trading firm Duferco International Trading Holding SA, which would offer JSW Steel a committed export market for its products."
76,2019-03-05,JSW,"Local producers are suffering from the double whammy of a rise in cheap imports and low domestic steel pricesThe ministry has given various indications that some measures might be taken, the sources added

MUMBAI :
Indian steel firms are putting pressure on the government to impose higher duties on imports as trade disputes and a global economic slowdown divert surplus Asian steel stocks to India, industry executives and government sources said.
Local producers are suffering from the double whammy of a rise in cheap imports and low domestic steel prices, which threatens to wipeout the healthy profits made in the past couple of years.
The steel companies have approached the ministry multiple times over the past few months, alleging China, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam are dumping various grades of low-cost steel into the Indian market and stealing market share as a result, three government sources said.
India's top four steelmakers - JSW Steel Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd, state-owned Steel Authority of India Ltd and Jindal Steel and Power Ltd - who together control over 45 percent of India's total steel production, are the key companies who have complained, the sources said.
The ministry has given various indications that some measures might be taken, the sources added. However, they are more likely to be non-tariff measures as India has already suffered defeat in a dispute with Japan at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on charges that New Delhi unfairly imposed import duties in 2016 to safeguard its steel industry.
The WTO upheld Japan's complaint in November but India is planning to appeal.
The steel ministry did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comment.
RISING IMPORTS
Imports of various grades of steel into India rose by around 8 percent in the April-December 2018 period, compared with a year earlier, government data showed.
During the same period, exports from India fell by more than 17 percent, making the country a net importer of steel, mainly because the U.S., one of India's biggest markets, imposed additional duties last year on steel coming from some Asian countries, including India.
As a result, the nation's steel imports from countries such as Japan, South Korea and Indonesia surged. Chinese imports also climbed in the final quarter of 2018, Indian companies say.
According to government figures, for the April-September 2018 period imports from South Korea rose 29 percent from the year-earlier period, Japanese imports increased 35 percent, and Indonesian imports by 106 percent.
""The worry is imports,"" said Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director at JSW Steel, India's biggest steel company based on local production. He said the government had to ""ensure that our borders are protected and goods will not come into India and hurt the domestic steel industry.""
The price of steel in India dropped by an average of more than 10 percent between October and December, according to government data.
Domestic brokerage firm Edelweiss Securities said that they see earnings at metals companies ""going downhill"" after the third quarter.
Anil Kumar Chaudhary, chairman of SAIL, and Rao from JSW Steel, told Reuters they have both told the government of their concerns about imports.
Tata Steel and JSPL did not reply to an email seeking comment.
EXISTING MEASURES
India has been monitoring the impact of imported cheaper steel from China on domestic industry, the government said last month.
In a bid to support use of locally made steel, the ministry has urged automakers to cut imports from Japan and Korea. That has led to a dispute between the government and automakers who claim local producers are unable to make the high-quality steel they need.
India has already imposed stricter quality controls on more than 85 percent of steel products and it is expanding the list of locally made steel that must be used in government infrastructure projects, two government sources said. It is unclear if any low quality shipments have been turned back.
India's steel minister Chaudhary Birender Singh told Reuters earlier this month that the government wants to expand the quality control regime to all steel products very soon.
The government is also considering imposing higher duties on the import of iron ore, a key raw material, to help state-owned miner NMDC Ltd, the sources said. While this could hurt JSW Steel, other steel majors have their own captive iron ore mines which shields them from price volatility.
Abhyuday Jindal, managing director of Jindal Stainless, the country's largest stainless steel producer, said the company had asked the government review import duty on raw materials, as well as the impact of free trade agreements with the likes of Japan, South Korea and southeast Asian countries.

75,2019-03-07,JSW,"There’s more room for big reforms in corporate governance, banking sector and credit markets, say participants at the Mint India Investment SummitIndia also needs to look at the role of group governance, where we need audit committees at the group level

MUMBAI :
India needs huge reforms in different areas, from corporate governance and responsibility, to reducing the cost of doing business in the country. These issues were thrashed out at a panel discussion on The India quotient: Is there room for more reforms?, moderated by Rajrishi Singhal of Mint.
“India needs to enhance its corporate governance norms,"" said Arun Kumar, chairman and chief executive officer, KPMG in India. “We need to emphasize the importance of boards and identify that their key purpose is in creating value and protecting minority shareholders.""
“India also needs to look at the role of group governance, where we need audit committees at the group level, and independent directors, who bring skills and value and prevent the board from becoming an echo chamber are important. For example, Microsoft published the list of independent directors and their areas of expertise. Thinking on these terms is an important aspect of corporate governance. A certain amount of regulations is necessary, but we need to be watchful of the right level of regulation,"" said Kumar.
Seshagiri Rao, group chief financial officer, JSW Steel, said there was a need to encourage private investment in the country to fund growth. “There is a huge demand in India. We’re going to be a $10 trillion economy in the coming years and the private sector needs to lead the way in making investments to meet this demand and drive growth. But if you can’t fully convert currency and given that there are so many restrictions in raising capital, it hinders the capability of the private sector to invest. New regulations say we have to diversify sources of funding from banks to the markets. Sebi says listed companies must raise money from the market but the truth is that there are not enough suppliers of money in the market. Regulations are pushing you to the market but the banking sector isn’t able to finance this demand.""
“The rupee is not convertible and there are a lot of restrictions in raising money, in terms of tenor, from whom you can raise, what is the end-use of funds, so it’s not always possible to tap the international market. So availability of capital to create infrastructure in India is an important reform,"" Rao said.
Rashesh Shah, chairman and chief executive officer, Edelweiss group, agreed: “We have to encourage capital formation. Interestingly we are a capital surplus country with $700-750 billion in savings every year, while FIIs and FPIs bring in only about $40-50 billion a year. We are a country of savers with no idea how to convert this to investment. Our equity markets have grown tremendously in the last two decades, we settle on a T+2 basis now, our markets are always open. All these are big achievements.""
“So, while this equity market infrastructure is as good as anywhere else in the world, our credit markets are still backward because of historic dependence on the banking system. But we’re seeing this change slowly. I believe that every crisis—the NPAs, the IBC—I’ve learnt they make markets stronger. I think the same thing is happening in the debt market as well,"" said Rao.
Saugata Bhattacharya, chief economist, Axis Bank, expects the majority of capital formation to come from states. “I see that capital formation will happen in states, while the centre will play an enabling role. Actual reforms going forward will come from the states. We need to fix agriculture first, and that is almost 100% in the domain on states. For instance, farm sector distress is very real and we need to figure out ways to smoothen food prices.""
“India has been losing market share in exports. So we have to find out what is it about competitiveness that we need to consider, at productivity, fixing details at the last mile. Sector by sector, we have to see what are the microstructure issues that hinder us,"" Bhattacharya said.
Forest development taxes and state cesses have a cascading effect on exports, Rao said. “We hear a lot about duty drawbacks but in reality, state taxes remain. This affects our competitiveness in exports,"" Rao said.
Bhattacharya said that the whole gamut of education needs to be reformed, from primary to higher education.
“You’ve seen the way that China has moved ahead in establishing world class universities. This is one area we need to focus on, which leads to our poor investment so far in research and development. My worry is that on one side you have the moon rover mission and at the other end you have jugaad and in the middle nothing. This is the missing middle,"" he said.
To Singhal’s question on the future of technology in India and the need for regulation to encourage and control it, Kumar said: “There is a huge future for India to progress through entrepreneurship. But there are many wrinkles to be ironed out. For instance the new tax structure on angel investors. There is plenty of infrastructure developing for all kinds of innovation. But innovation is not just tech. The other area is infrastructure, where there are certain projects that are at points of inflection. Like the bullet train and hyperloop..you don’t think about it as innovation but it is one way of thinking differently. We’re seeing success in highways, airports and look at how PPP investors sees that balance of risk between public and private is appropriate."""

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) Friday directed the Delhi bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to decide on JSW Steel Ltd's bid for the debt-ridden Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd by 31 March.
A two-member NCLAT bench, headed by chairman justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya, has also directed NCLT Delhi to hear the representatives of operational creditors, promoters as well as dissenting banks.
""We expect adjudicating authority (NCLT) to decide the case at an early date to ensure that the matter is decided before the end of this financial year,"" the appellate tribunal said. During the proceedings, Bhushan Power promoter Sanjay Singal through his counsel offered to settle all dues of the lenders.
On this, the appellate tribunal directed NCLT to also take a decision over Singal's offer to settle. ""Liberty is given to adjudicating authority to decide who should be heard as representative of operational creditors or promoters or dissenting financial creditors, if any,"" it said.
On 4 February, NCLAT dismissed Tata Steel Ltd's plea and upheld lenders' decision to approve resolution plan of JSW Steel for Bhushan Power and Steel.
Tata Steel had challenged an NCLT order that allowed Bhushan Power's committee of creditors to accept the resolution plan submitted by Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty House. Tata Steel had contended that NCLT cannot provide numerous opportunities at the belated stage. The NCLAT had said the CoC's decision was well within its rights to negotiate better terms with resolution applicants.
JSW Steel had revised its offer for Bhushan Power from  ₹11,000 crore to  ₹18,000 crore and later to over  ₹19,000 crore, whereas Tata Steel's last offer was at  ₹17,000 crore and it refused to revise its bid."
74,2019-03-09,JSW,"ArcelorMittal, which has been seeking to acquire Essar Steel since 2017, had made a  ₹50,000 crore bid for the bankrupt firmWhile ArcelorMittal welcomed NCLT Ahmedabad's order, Essar Steel says its settlement proposal of  ₹54,389 crore is 'most compelling'

Mumbai: More than a decade after his first abortive bid, steel baron Lakshmi Niwas Mittal moved closer to his plans to enter the Indian steel industry on Friday. Indian-born Mittal’s steel company, ArcelorMittal SA, is the world’s largest by volume but, ironically, doesn’t have a steel plant to its name in India.
After over a year of legal wrangles with bidders, courts and banks, the Ahmedabad bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Friday approved ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan for debt-laden Essar Steel Ltd.
ArcelorMittal, in a joint venture with Japan’s Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp., has offered an upfront cash settlement of  ₹42,000 crore to lenders and a  ₹8,000 crore capital infusion. ArcelorMittal is also planning a  ₹18,697 crore capital expenditure programme for the asset till 2024, according to its 2018 annual report.
In its order, the NCLT, however, asked ArcelorMittal to offer 15% of the upfront cash settlement of  ₹42,000 crore, or  ₹6,300 crore, to operational creditors. The original resolution plan only offered  ₹196 crore to operational creditors against claims of  ₹4,976 crore. The NCLT order means financial creditors—the banks—will have to take a deeper haircut on the asset.
The approval comes after the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on 28 February directed NCLT Ahmedabad to take a decision on ArcelorMittal’s offer for Essar Steel plan by 8 March.
On 29 January, NCLT Ahmedabad had rejected a full debt settlement proposal of  ₹54,389 crore from the shareholders of Essar Steel. The tribunal ruled that the offer violates Section 12A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), which says the promoters can retrieve a company from bankruptcy proceedings by paying full settlement but not after other parties have submitted their expressions of interest.
“We welcome today’s pronouncement by the NCLT Ahmedabad. While we will need to review the full written order once it becomes available, we hope to complete the transaction as soon as possible,"" said a spokesperson for ArcelorMittal.
An Essar spokesperson said: “We continue to believe that our settlement offer of  ₹54,389 crore is the most compelling one available to Essar Steel creditors and fulfils IBC’s declared overriding objective of value maximization, which has been established time and again by courts at all levels. We are also confident of the legal validity of our said offer made under Section 12A, which provides for the withdrawal from the IBC process by making full payment to the creditors. We are awaiting a copy of the NCLT order and will take a call on next steps after examining the same.""
The Essar Steel acquisition will give ArcelorMittal control of India’s largest single-location flat steel mill in Hazira, Gujarat, with a nameplate capacity of 10 million tonnes per annum. However, the plant is operating at much lower capacities and will need significant investment to run at full capacity. The asset also has two iron ore pelletisation plants, at Visakhapatnam and Paradip, and a downstream steel hub in Pune, close to a automobile manufacturing hub.
While ArcelorMittal has proven expertise in turning around sick steel units and driving down costs till the plants turn viable, Essar Steel's turnaround will be its most ambitious yet.
“The Essar Steel plant has always been the highest-cost flat producer in the country,"" Atanu Mukherjee, president at M.N. Dastur and Co., a global metals and energy consultant, said in an interview two weeks ago. “Its products are generally priced at $480-490 a tonne on the cost curve, while competitors JSW Steel and Tata Steel, with much lower costs of production, cash in on high margins as the highest cost producer sets the price ,"" he said.
If ArcelorMittal enters India and sets the sick Essar Steel unit right, it will “flatten the cost curve"" through investments and operations management, thus eating into the margins of competitors. That’s one reason steel producers would prefer a struggling steel plant on India’s western coast rather than one that is up and running, Mukherjee said. “The ensuing competition that ArcelorMittal is going to force on incumbent players could thus be intense,"" he said.
Also read: The great battle for Indian steel
ArcelorMittal is the world’s leading steel and mining company, with a presence in 60 countries and an industrial footprint in 18 countries.
Mittal made several attempts to get his foot in the door in India, notably with projects planned in Odisha and Jharkhand in 2005 and 2006, but none took shape. In 2010, the company signed an agreement with the Karnataka government to set up a 6 million tonne per annum capacity, but the land acquisition process for this project has only just been completed.
The bulk of Essar Steel’s steelmaking capacity is built to run on natural gas. Operations at the plant ran into trouble in March 2011 when the then government changed its gas allocation policy and cut off the supply to the company after categorizing the steel sector to “non-core"" from “priority"". The company has said in the past that it had to bear a loss of approximately  ₹26,000 crore between 2011 and March 2016 due to non-supply of gas.
In May 2017, Essar Steel’s lenders—with the State Bank of India as the consortium leader—had come close to finalizing a restructuring proposal for the company. However, in June, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) identified the asset as among its ""dirty dozen"" for immediate resolution at the bankrutpcy courts."
72,2019-03-12,JSW,"Companies are complaining about the endless host of litigation that they face under IBC codeOperational creditors, who are unhappy with the settlements, often stall the insolvency process

Mumbai: Now that two years have passed since the first major acquisitions under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), several players—buyers, investment bankers and dissatisfied creditors—are slowly opening up about what they see as chinks in India's bankruptcy law.
These include repeated litigation—both during and after the process—missing physical assets in plants, the lack of judges and questions over the integrity of promoters of distressed businesses and resolution professionals.
The cracks in the resolution process are evident from the following developments:
■ After acquisition of Monnet Ispat by JSW Steel Ltd in September 2018, operational creditor Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) and unsecured creditor IFCI Ltd have challenged the resolution plan.
■ The bidders for Amtek Auto and its unit Metalyst Forgings—London-based Liberty House and US-based hedge fund Deccan Value Investors, respectively—are challenging the information provided to them by the resolution professional during the bidding process. While Deccan Value Investors has asked NCLT to cancel its resolution plan, Liberty house has alleged in court that the contents of a forensic audit conducted by EY into Amtek Auto were not revealed to it.
“Often, resolution professionals are ill-equipped to fully oversee operations at companies. In other cases, there are serious integrity issues among resolution professionals and promoters,"" an investment banker said on condition of anonymity. “We know of cases where equipment has been stolen from plants during the resolution process. In some cases, promoters litigate to draw out the resolution process while we hear of money being siphoned away from the company during this period."" 
Mahesh Singh, founder and managing director, Singhi Advisors, said sometimes assets do go missing at the time of closure of the deal. “Buyers should get a chance to do the closing due diligence. Even so, there are legal remedies for when assets are missing because there is always a lag between selling a business and finally getting possession.""
Godrej Group chairman Adi Godrej said: “The bankruptcy code has been very poorly implemented because there have been so many cases of bankruptcy which have not been finalized. We allow them to go from one court to another and then we give them stay order. Our judicial process is very slow. “It (IBC) is not being implemented as well as it could have been. That is not perhaps for lack of trying but it is also our legal system and legislation.""
JSW Steel's joint managing director, M.V.S. Seshagiri Rao said in a recent interview: “Under IBC, once a case in admitted, whatever cases are pending against a company, there is a moratorium on them. But once the resolution plan is approved, all of these spring up again. We are seeing this in several forums, in all companies that have been acquired, not just ours. I think some clarity is required here so winning bidders feel more comfortable that once the settlement is paid, everything else is extinguished.""
The major acquisitions under IBC were those of Bhushan Steel by Tata Steel Ltd; Binani Cement Ltd by UltraTech Cement Ltd; and Monnet Ispat by JSW Steel-AION Capital.
Kalpesh Kikani, managing director and senior partner, AION Capital, said at the Mint Investment Summit in Mumbai on 1 March: “First, the challenge is getting to know what the true price for the asset is. Step 2 is who gets how much among various financial creditors, be it secured, unsecured, secured with guarantee, unsecured with guarantee, and then you have some operational creditors who believe they are equal to financial creditors and others who believe they are better than financial creditors in terms of supplying (goods to a company even during distress). This Stage 2 of who gets how much is an integral part of IBC and will be the subject matter of litigation—and as a bidder this is something we always factor into our bids."""
71,2019-03-13,JSW,"A slowdown in steel demand from auto and real estate sector raises questions on sustained steel production growthThe slowdown in large user industries can make it tough for Indian steel producers to pass on price hikes

After a slow start to the year, steel production in India picked up in February, rising 5.7% from a year ago. Data from the joint plant committee compiled by SBICAP Securities Ltd also shows a healthy growth in steel demand, with consumption increasing by 8.6% last month. However, amid the mounting evidence of demand slowdown in user industries such as automobiles and real estate, questions about the sustainability of the rebound in steel production refuse to go away.
Towards the end of last year, customers had reduced purchases, anticipating a further fall in steel prices. Responding to this, steel producers had tempered production. However, as the turn of the calendar year triggered new purchase cycles at the customers’ end, companies stepped up production. The rebound this time is aided by a disruption in iron ore production in Brazil and a subsequent rise in steel prices. The price rise appears to have prompted restocking by customers.
However, beyond cyclical factors, such as inventory restocking and advance purchases to hedge against the likelihood of a price rise, there is little evidence of a firm rebound in demand. Rather, the slowdown in large user industries can make it tough for the steel producers to pass on price hikes.
The automobiles industry, for instance, is a major user of flat steel products and the slowdown in vehicle sales is resulting in discounts by auto firms to reduce inventories. “Passenger vehicles and two wheelers demand continues to remain weak. Hence, not surprisingly, incentives are back. Channel inventory, which also had been in correction mode, has jumped to 60 days,"" add analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd.
The slowdown in project launches in the real estate sector, a user of long steel products, will not help either. Launches in the 12 months to December 2018 are down 10% in the real estate sector, according to Kotak Institutional Equities Research.
The impact can be mitigated by sustained government-led spending in the infrastructure sector. Even so, the subdued demand conditions in key user industries remain a concern. Further, elevated prices of other raw materials such as coking coal, intensify profitability challenges, especially if cost increases are not fully passed on."

MUMBAI :
JSW Steel Ltd has emerged as the sole bidder for Asian Colour Coated Ispat Ltd (ACCIL), forcing the lenders to consider more steps to garner a robust response for selling the assets of the bankrupt downstream steel company.
Sajjan Jindal-led JSW is the only company to have submitted a resolution plan for ACCIL, said two people familiar with the matter. Bidders had until 8 March to submit their offers.
The committee of creditors (CoC) of ACCIL is considering extending the deadline or starting a second round so as to invite more bids, a member of the CoC and one of the two people cited above said.
JSW is believed to have placed a bid in the  ₹800-1,000 crore range, the second person said. ACCIL has outstanding debt of more than  ₹5,000 crore.
“We’re disappointed with the number of bidders and the bid amount,"" the second person said. “Banks are hoping to recover at least half of the outstanding dues through the NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) process. The CoC will take a decision soon on what the next step shall be.""
ArcelorMittal is likely to show interest in ACCIL if its acquisition of Essar Steel goes through, the first person said.
NCLT Ahmedabad has approved ArcelorMittal’s bid for Essar Steel. This is currently being challenged by the erstwhile promoters of Essar Steel in higher courts. JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co. Ltd, which had submitted an expression of interest for ACCIL initially, did not submit a final bid either.
Spokespersons for ArcelorMittal and JSW Steel declined to comment. JM Financial did not respond to emailed queries.
Kuldip Kumar Bassi of KK Bassi and Associates, the resolution professional for ACCIL, did not respond to emailed queries on whether there will be a second round of bidding.
ACCIL was part of the Reserve Bank of India’s second list of 28 defaulters that banks were to refer to insolvency court."

Mumbai: Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW Steel is in the market to raise up to $1 billion in dollar-denominated non-convertible bonds, the company informed stock exchanges on Friday.
The company did not say in the notice how the funds will be used, but JSW Steel is expanding capacity at its flagship Vijayanagar steel plant from 13 million tonnes per annum to 18mtpa.
The company will meet with investors and conduct roadshows in Hong Kong, Singapore, and London next week, the note said. Deutsche Bank will be the lead banker in the fund-raising.
JSW Steel is one of the largest producers of steel products in India, with an installed steelmaking capacity of 18 million tonnes per annum.
The company’s net debt stood at  ₹46,000 crore, at the end of December 2018. The debt to Ebitda ratio was 2.32. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. JSW Steel had earlier announced a capital expenditure plan of  ₹44,415 crore to increase its total capacity to 24.7mtpa by FY21, by way of brownfield expansion and acquisitions.
Moody’s has assigned a Ba2 rating to JSW Steel’s proposed bond issue, with positive outlook, the credit rating agency said. The proposed notes are rated Ba2 and rank pari passu to the company’s $500 million senior unsecured notes maturing in November 2019 and the $500 million senior unsecured bonds maturing in April 2022.
“The Ba2 rating continues to reflect JSW’s large scale and strong position in its key markets, good product and end-market diversification, and increasing focus on value-added products and retail sales,"" said Kaustubh Chaubal, a Moody’s vice president and senior credit officer. “The company’s credit metrics retain their improving trajectory, principally due to competitive and efficient production costs, solid domestic demand conditions and a supportive price environment, even as input costs register a slight increase,"" Chaubal said.
JSW Steel is also close to acquiring bankrupt steel firm Bhushan Power and Steel for an upfront cash payment of Rs19,350 crore and an equity infusion of Rs350 crore to revive the steel mill’s operations. In March, the company closed a $700 million, five-year advance payment and supply agreement with steel trading firm Duferco International Trading Holding SA, which would offer JSW Steel a committed export market for its products."

Tata Steel Ltd.’s Indian steel output rose to a record in its latest financial year thanks to its 2018 acquisition of Bhushan Steel Ltd. assets, potentially making Tata the country’s biggest producer.
Production rose 35% to 16.79 million tons in the year ended March 31, as Bhushan Steel added 4.2 million tons to output, the Mumbai-based company said in a statement Saturday. Tata’s volumes are a tad higher than the 16.75 million tons targeted by JSW Steel Ltd., which was India’s biggest steel mill in the previous fiscal year. JSW has yet to release its final number for the latest 12 month period.
Tata Steel has been shifting its focus to India, where demand is growing due to a government-led emphasis on building new infrastructure. The state-run Steel Authority of India Ltd. also reported a record production of 16.3 million tons earlier this week.
However, steel production at Tata’s Europe division fell 3.7 percent to 10.3 million tons during the 12 months to March, the company said. The European Commission is reviewing a plan by Tata to merge its European operations with those of Thyssenkrupp AG.L.P."

MUMBAI :
The country's largest private sector steel-maker JSW Steel Wednesday raised USD 500 million through an international bond issue.
The five-year dollar money sale saw high demand from investors across Europe and Asia, and had attracted bids worth USD 1.75 billion, merchant banking sources said.
The company, which is rated one notch below the investment grade, managed a coupon of 5.95 percent, they said. The issue had received Ba2 rating with a positive outlook by global ratings agency Moody's.
The fund raising was in line with a May 2017 board resolution to raise up to USD 1 billion in one or more tranches of international bond sales, the company informed the exchanges.

Demand for steel has been resilient. Compared to the global slowdown, Indian demand has shown resilience. Provisional figures compiled by analysts show a 7.5% rise in FY19 sales, making India one of the fastest-growing steel markets among large economies. Even though this is marginally lower, it still compares well with a 7.9% rise in FY18. Contrastingly, global steel demand is projected to slow to 1.4% in 2019, more than halving from the 3% increase in 2018.
Data from Joint Plant Committee showed a 7.8% rise in steel consumption from April 2018 to January 2019. According to SBICAP Securities Ltd, demand in the subsequent two months increased 7.7% and 8.8%, respectively. This pegs consumption growth during January-March (Q4 FY19) at 6.4%, points out Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, notably better than the December quarter when demand decelerated.
Inventory restocking and the seasonal upswing in demand have driven volumes in the last three months. Tata Steel Ltd’s India operations reported a 56% jump in sales volume last quarter. The growth was partly aided by capacity expansion following its acquisition of Bhushan Steel Ltd last year. Even so, higher volumes should help mitigate the impact of subdued prices.
The recent increase in prices notwithstanding, domestic hot-rolled coil prices on average were down around 4% year-on-year in the last quarter.
“After almost two years of a strong steel cycle, aided by disciplined Chinese production/exports, steel prices globally slumped toward the end of Q3 FY19, with impacts visible in Q4 FY19. However, producers took advantage of the seasonally strong demand to recoup part of the fall,"" Emkay said in a note.
Tracking the sales trends of notable steel producers, Tata Steel and JSW Steel Ltd recouped from their lows in January. But in FY20, all eyes are on demand recovery in China and India.
Demand in India is largely being driven by the infrastructure sector. According to SBICAP Securities, demand for long steel products increased 9.6% during the April 2018-February 2019 period. Comparatively, demand for flat products, which largely emanates from the automobile sector, is up 4.8%. With automobile sales decelerating further in recent months, the fear is that a prolonged slowdown could impact steel demand in the coming months. According to Edelweiss Securities Ltd, about 20% of total steel in India is consumed by the automobile sector.
Another challenge is the slowdown in China. This demand slowdown in China is driving imports to India. The sharp fall in international prices increased imports to India, weighing on domestic prices.
The rise in iron ore prices due to supply disruption in Brazil pushed up global steel prices, benefiting producers such as Tata Steel. But with iron ore supplies rising in the home market, this advantage is expected to erode, making demand recovery in global markets crucial for Indian producers.
“Though there has been some progress in trade talks between the US and China, global demand concerns still pose significant headwinds,"" said analysts at Edelweiss."
64,2019-04-12,JSW,"JSW is raising $500 million through five-year overseas bonds to expand capacityJSW had expressed interest in buying Bhushan Steel and Usha Martin, both of which were snapped up by Tata Steel

Delays in the sale of assets under India’s bankruptcy law are becoming a key challenge for bidders who “cannot wait indefinitely"" because of funding constraints, according to JSW Steel Ltd.
The Sajjan Jindal-run mill, which has bid for many companies under the insolvency law since sales of distressed firms began in 2017, is among bidders who have faced repeated delays in their attempts to buy indebted assets. A bidder has to tie up the capital for investing in an asset when submitting a resolution plan and “it is not possible for any company, big or small, to keep the funding ready forever,"" said Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director of the steel mill.
“When I tie up the funding, I am incurring a cost,"" Rao said in an interview Wednesday. “That cost can’t be incurred indefinitely with so many uncertainties.""
Since the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code was passed in the Indian parliament in 2016, the resolution process has been slowed as courts are inundated with appeals from founders, administrators, lenders and bidders. Lenders to the first 12 companies brought to the insolvency court have lost out on 40 billion rupees ($580 million) in additional income due to delays in the resolution process beyond the time mandated by law, according to rating company ICRA.
JSW took over Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd. in July after multiple company law tribunal hearings despite being the only bidder for the asset. It has also emerged as the sole bidder for another stressed steel products maker Asian Colour Coated Ispat Ltd., but the lenders and the professional in charge of the sale process have reportedly sought an extension of the deadline for submission of bids.
“It is surprising to us that the date for submission of resolution plans was extended several times,"" said Rao. “We are not able to understand that when there is a valid resolution plan, what is the need for seeking extension?""
Reshaping the Steel Sector
The mill has also been selected as the preferred bidder for Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd. and is awaiting the final nod from the tribunal. JSW had expressed interest in buying Bhushan Steel Ltd. and Usha Martin Ltd., both of which were snapped up by Tata Steel Ltd. It also belatedly attempted to enter the race for Essar Steel India Ltd., when a second round of bids were called.
India’s insolvency process is reshaping its steel industry. Five companies from the sector were among the 12 large debtors -- the so-called dirty dozen -- ordered into bankruptcy court in 2017. Tata Steel’s bet on snapping up the assets of bankrupt mill Bhushan Steel has paid off as it overtook JSW as India’s biggest producer last year. ArcelorMittal is inching closer to opening shop in the South Asian nation as its offer to buy Essar Steel was approved after months of court battles.
Economic growth is driving steel demand and pushing producers to scale up capacity. India’s steel demand is forecast to grow 7 percent to 7.5 percent this year, Rao said, driven by government expenditure on metro stations, water pipelines, bridges and affordable housing.
Expanding Capacity
JSW expects to expand crude steel capacity to 24 million tons by March 2020 from 18 million tons now, and value-added capacity by 80 percent to 9 million tons, he said, adding that “we are in the market to raise money"" to complete all these projects.
JSW is raising $500 million through five-year overseas bonds to expand capacity. The company is tapping global markets as long tenure instruments in the Indian market are difficult unless the bond market matures, Rao said.
“It is a forced option,"" he said. As JSW continues to expand capacity, the company will keep tapping global markets either through external commercial borrowing, export credit agencies or bonds to meet fund requirements in future, he said.

Parth Jindal, heir to the $13-billion JSW Group, believes in his ability to create great companies, much like his father, group promoter Sajjan Jindal, did. But he wants to face consumers and build retail empires—be it in sports, cement, or now paints. He says his success, or failure, will depend on how these companies grow. Edited excerpts from an interview:
In the last year, JSW has spoken of entering the electric vehicles space (now shelved), steel furniture and now paints. Can you explain the shift to consumer-facing business from being a thorough industrials company?
At the core of JSW, we realize that steel is our main business and we focus on how to continue to remain the leading steel company in India. Over the last 20-25 years, the company has been able to stand for something, and more and more people recognize us. My personal interest is in sales and marketing, so that’s why the businesses I look after—whether it’s cement or paints or even sports—have a big consumer element to them.
What do you think will be the challenges in making this change? You’re also entering businesses that face formidable competition.
It’s very clear that my father and his core team are focused on steel, power and infrastructure, which are the bedrock of the group in the last 30 years. We’re not deviating talent from there into the other businesses. These are fresh businesses that we have started. The one dabble we did with auto has been called off and I am all for that decision to call it off because I felt it was a distraction. The onus is on me to set up my own team and management. My companies are completely separate and whether I am successful or not will depend on how these companies grow.
Here, the culture is different. An FMCG company like paints or quasi-FMCG like cement requires a different culture than a steel or power company. I’ve been trying to create this culture within the confines of the group, making sure our culture, our incentives, our policies mirror those of FMCG companies and not large B2B companies. I don’t think any industry player fazes us. If we are bringing a value proposition, then we can succeed. It doesn’t matter whether we are fighting Tata Steel or UltraTech Cement or Asian Paints. These are all great companies and we also have the right to be a great company. I’m only 28. I can take time to build these businesses.
The launch of the paints business was expected last year.
We had challenges in completing our factories. We were planning on launching last November and we have been pushed back by six months. The paint industry is highly prone to fire, so there are lots of safety regulations to conform with, lots of intricacies in putting up the plant and there are very few skilled contractors to set up paints plants and they were busy commissioning Asian Paints’ plants in Vizag and Mysore. We used that time instead to increase our network penetration.
What’s the game plan with paints?
We have two plants, at Vasind for industrials with 25,000 kilolitre (kl) per annum capacity and Vijayanagar for decorative paints with 100,000 kl but it has been built for 200,000 kl. We looked at inorganic opportunities to enter the industry but given the valuations in paint and the earnings multiple that they command, the build-versus-buy decision was very simple. Buying is extremely expensive. Once we have critical mass, if an acquisition looks attractive, then we will think of buying something. There’s  ₹250 crore of equity and about  ₹350 crore of debt. Axis Bank is the sole banker. The investment is for 125,000 kl capacity. We will need another investment of  ₹400 crore to increase this to 225,000 kl. We have launched now in Hubli and Bengaluru and every month from now, we will launch in a southern city. This year we are targeting revenue of  ₹600 crore, next year we want to double it and then reach  ₹2,000 crore by FY22."

59,2019-05-14,JSW,"This, after the US raised tariffs on Chinese products due to the escalating trade warIndian steel is vulnerable to displaced exports as a result of US-China trade dispute

India fears China could soon start flooding excess steel into its market after the United States raised tariffs on Chinese products due to the escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies, according to three government sources and four industry officials.
As a result, the Indian steel industry has asked the Indian government to put in so-called safeguard duties of as much as 25% to protect it from growing imports. These would be imposed on steel that the government determines has been dumped in India at prices below the cost of production.
Since last year, China and the United States have been locked in a trade conflict as Washington seeks to fix the trade balance, currently tilted in favour of Beijing. The two nations have raised or threatened to raise tariffs on each other's goods, moves that could re-draw trade flows and that have threatened to derail the global economy.
""China has excess (steel) capacity and there is a concern they could re-route it through other countries like Vietnam and Cambodia into India,"" an Indian government source with direct knowledge of the matter said.
""Steel sector is vulnerable,"" the source said, declining to be identified due to the sensitive nature of discussions.
India, the world's second-largest steel producer, turned net importer in the year ended March 31, 2019 after a gap of three years. That is because the country lacks the capability to produce high-quality steel and has lost some of its global clients to cheaper exports from China, Japan and South Korea.
""China, Japan, Korea which are major exporters to U.S., Europe and Canada, because of trade actions, they are also diverting steel into India,"" Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director at JSW Steel Ltd, told Reuters.
Demanded safeguarded duties
""It is very much essential for government of India to increase the safeguard duty to 25% as soon as possible,"" said Rao. Currently, there are a range of such duty levels.
Last month, steel companies JSW, Steel Authority of India, Tata Steel, Jindal Steel and Power - controlling over 45% of India's total steel production - met with government officials to ask for safeguards, according to a source who attended the meeting.
During the meeting, Steel Secretary Binoy Kumar, the top bureaucrat in the Ministry of Steel, also said that the steel industry was at risk from global excess capacity, the source said.
Kumar said India need to act soon to protect its fragile steel industry from predatory imports as it would be difficult to revive it if the situation was allowed to deteriorate for three-to-four years. However, he said a decision on safeguard duties has not yet been taken.
The steel ministry did not respond to Reuters' emails and phone calls seeking comments. Neither did SAIL, Tata and JSPL.
""What we are seeing is that part of displaced exports is already making inroads,"" said Arnab Kumar Hazra, assistant secretary general at the Indian Steel Association, which represents major steel producers. There was therefore every reason to argue for safeguard duties given the perceived threat, he said.
India had imposed a slew of safeguards in 2015-2017 on several steel products to curb cheaper imports and protect local industry, prompting Japan to refer India's behaviour to the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute panel.
India's trade deficit with China jumped more than a nine fold over the past decade to $63.05 billion in the year ending March 2018.
With the latest U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, India fears Beijing could also re-route exports of electronic items, toys, furniture and organic chemicals to India through other Southeast Asian nations.
New Delhi and Beijing have been negotiating over greater market access as China wants to exports milk products and apples to India while New Delhi wants to sell China bovine meat, sources said.

On the cost front, while coking coal prices remained largely stable at $213/tonne, price cuts taken by NMDC during the December-February period were partially reversed towards the end of February due to the impact of Vale Dam collapse, leading to a surge in global iron prices. Steel volumes are likely to sequentially recover in 4QFY19, with an increase in exports enabling the company to broadly achieve FY19 guidance of 16 million tonnes, Antique said. “Due to capacity constraints, JSW is unlikely to benefit from a healthy domestic demand in FY20 while the acquisition of Bhushan Power & Steel (BPSL) at rich valuations will remain an overhang.""
JSW Steel’s proposal to acquire Bhushan Power and Steel (BPSL) is awaiting approval from the National Company Law Tribunal. BPSL currently possesses a crude steel capacity of about 1.8 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) and a finished steel capacity of 3.4 mtpa, which makes the acquisition expensive, according to Antique. “Consolidated net debt stood at  ₹460 billion at the end of Q3FY19 (excluding acceptances of $1.5 billion), increasing from  ₹449 billion sequentially, primarily due to an increase in working capital with increase in inventory and build-up of receivables from the government."""

56,2019-05-25,JSW,"Consolidated revenue for the March quarter stays flat at  ₹19,264 croreFor FY19, JSW Steel reports a net profit of  ₹7,524 crore, up 23% year-on-year from  ₹6,113 crore in FY18

MUMBAI :
Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW Steel, India’s second largest private sector steel producer, reported that profits nearly halved in the March quarter on account of mounting costs and low realizations.
Consolidated net profit fell 48% from the  ₹2,879 crore it had reported in the three months ended March 2018, to  ₹1,495 crore, as costs of key inputs such as power, fuel and consumables rose due to rupee depreciation and higher electrode and refractory costs. Consolidated revenue for the same period stayed flat at  ₹19,264 crore.
Crude steel production fell 3% this quarter from the year earlier to 4.17 million tonnes (mt). Stand-alone steel sales rose 2% from 4.22mt to 4.29mt during the period under consideration. Operating Ebitda (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for the quarter declined 14% year-on-year to  ₹4,341 crore and the Ebitda margin stood at 22.03%. Ebitda per tonne was  ₹10,302 for the quarter. While sales to the auto sector flattened out for the quarter, growth in retail sales and sales of value-added products picked up.
For the full year, it posted net profit of  ₹7,524 crore, up 23% year-on-year from  ₹6,113 in FY18. Revenue from operations for the same period rose 16% to  ₹84,757 crore. Net debt rose to  ₹45,969 crore, up from  ₹38,000 crore at the end of FY18. JSW Steel, which is currently implementing a massive capital expenditure programme, has decided to raise its capex programme by  ₹5,700 crore to  ₹48,715 crore. Out of this,  ₹1,000 crore will go into downstream investment,  ₹2,200 crore into cost-saving projects and  ₹2,000 crore into mining and sustenance capex. Of this total, the company will spend  ₹34,300 crore over FY20 and FY21.
The planned blast furnace (BF3) shutdown, which would have expanded capacity by 1.7mt, has now been postponed. Once the capital expenditure programme at Dolvi steel mill is complete, it will again be taken up, said M.V.S. Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director and group CFO, JSW Steel.
For FY20, the company’s crude steel production guidance stood at 16.95mt and saleable steel sales at 16mt, an increase of 1.5% on the actual numbers for FY19. This would translate into 95% capacity utilisation for JSW Steel. While the World Steel Association’s guidance for 2019 was 1.3% growth in global demand, Rao said demand in India will grow by 6.5-7%.
At the board meeting, the company’s management passed a resolution to raise up to  ₹14,000 crore through either debt or equity instruments through a qualified institutional placement process."
55,2019-05-26,JSW,"The erosion of earnings can compel the firm to take up more debt, a key factor investors should watch out for

JSW Steel Ltd’s shares have withstood the turbulence in commodity prices much better than other metal producers. While the Nifty Metal Index has fallen 16.8% in the past year, JSW Steel shares have declined 9%. The company’s March quarter results should reinforce this trend.
Despite input cost pressures and soft product prices, JSW Steel expanded its consolidated revenues 10% sequentially. Operating profit fell 1.4%. But the quantum of drop is lower than Street estimates. This was possible through higher volumes, which at 4.3 million tonnes (mt) exceeded estimates.
Sales volumes of the stand-alone entity were 4.29 mt, higher than the 3.68 mt in the December quarter, and the 4 mt estimated by the Street. Higher volumes drove up stand-alone revenues by 7%. So, even as profitability has taken a notable hit (down two percentage points), the fall in operating profit was confined to 2% sequentially.
Earnings may not be growing, but it is important to note that JSW Steel has mitigated the impact of soft product prices. The company is busy expanding capacity, and plans to invest about  ₹34,300 crore over the next two years through a mix of debt and internal accruals.
The erosion of earnings due to soft product prices can compel the company to take up more debt and grow volumes, a key factor investors should watch out for. The ongoing investments are already pushing up the company’s leverage. Net debt to Ebitda of the consolidated entity rose from 2.32 times at the end of the December quarter to 2.43 times in the March quarter. Though it is lower than the 2.57 times at the end of FY18, the ratio can deteriorate, impacting the credit metrics, if earnings from existing operations shrink. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
The outlook on raw material, especially iron ore and coking coal, is benign. Elevated production in Odisha is keeping iron ore prices in check. Coking coal prices are stable and analysts do not see major changes due to subdued global demand.
The outlook for steel demand, however, is not very positive. There is tough competition, especially from imports. While this is weighing on product prices, the recent deceleration in the automobile sector, from which JSW Steel derives a sizeable portion of its revenues, is adding to the concerns.
The company forecasts 1.5% growth in sales volumes in FY20. But achieving this target hinges on how fast the economy recovers."

Kolkata: Buoyed by the Central government's continued focus on infrastructure projects, India's steel demand is expected grow by about 7% during the current fiscal, experts said on Tuesday.
""The Central government has been focusing on infrastructure projects like Sagarmala, Smart Cities and the new government would stick to its focus. I think steel demand is expected to grow by 7- 8% in the 2019-20,"" Institute for Steel Development and Growth (INSDAG) Director General Sushim Banerjee said.
Echoing him, JSW Steel President (Operations) Partha Sengupta also said the sector remains bullish on its outlook and steel consumption during the current fiscal would grow in the range of 6-7%.
Addressing the Metals Conclave here organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Tata Steel Managing Director (Processing and Distribution) Abraham Stephanos said: ""The opportunity in India for steel has tremendous potential as we become more and more urbanised.""
""Steel industry in India is affected by structural inefficiencies,"" he added.
State-run NMDC's former Chairman Rana Som said steel companies in the country should expand and grow on the basis of equity capital rather than debt fund.
""The government should pull land available with public sector companies to set up steel plants, otherwise setting up of greenfield steel would be excessively difficult after the implementation of the current land acquisition act,"" he said,
Som also pointed out that many steel plants had been set up at locations from where imports became more feasible than sourcing raw materials from domestic mines.
""This is not a sustainable system as domestic raw materials are worked out to be cheaper than imported ones,"" he said, adding that the government should go back to the iron ore pricing system based on export parity and discard the existing import parity-based pricing system."
53,2019-05-30,JSW,"Steelmakers’ strong performance was a result of relatively strong domestic finished steel consumption growthFitch expects lower margins may result into some increase in leverage ratios for JSW Steel and Tata Steel in FY20

Mumbai: After reporting robust operating margins in FY19, which allowed Indian steelmakers to maintain a healthy debt profile, margins are expected to contract this fiscal, Fitch Ratings said in a note on Thursday.
""Global steel prices have corrected again in May 2019 in the absence of a resolution in trade disputes between the US and China, after recovering since the start of the year. CRU forecasts further price declines with slower industrial growth and weaker underlying demand for steel in multiple regions. As a result, steel prices will continue to be unable to properly reflect higher-priced iron ore"", Fitch said in a report.
""However, we do not anticipate an abrupt squeeze for the sector such as that seen in FY16 with restrained exports from China likely to be a key support for the global steel sector"", the report said.
Fitch expects lower margins may result into some increase in leverage ratios for JSW Steel and Tata Steel in FY20. JSW's increase is likely to be higher due to the significant rise in its capital expenditure as capacity expansion and other projects near completion.
JSW Steel Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd reported 28% and 40% increase, respectively, in their earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for fiscal 2019.
Fitch said Indian steelmakers’ strong performance was a result of relatively strong domestic finished steel consumption growth of 7.5% (6.8 million tonnes) during FY19. Imports increased by 4.7% (0.4 million tonnes), much slower than what the market had feared last year in the wake of the imposition of steel import tariffs by the US. However, domestic flat-steel prices followed the downward trend in global steel prices as the threshold at which anti-dumping duties kick in are lower."

51,2019-06-06,JSW,"The steelmaker is examining a proposal by the UK firm’s liquidation advisor EY, but is yet to make an offerJSW is unlikely to make a bid for all the assets of British Steel and may cherrypick a few, analysts say

MUMBAI :
Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW Steel Ltd is weighing options for British Steel Ltd after the UK company’s liquidation advisor EY reached out to it, a person aware of the development said.
A team from JSW Steel, India’s second largest private steelmaker, has started looking at the company and its prospects, the person cited above said on condition of anonymity. The company is examining the liquidation advisor’s proposal but is yet to put in a formal bid.
British Steel, which produces products used in construction and rail networks, went into administration last month following the collapse of talks between Greybull Capital, the private equity owner of British Steel, and the UK government for a £30-million loan.
British Steel has 3 million tonnes of steel-making capacity in Scunthorpe, UK, and rolling mills specializing in rail, construction steel, special steel and wire rod across the UK, France and the Netherlands.
On 5 June, Reuters, quoting unnamed sources, reported that British Steel’s liquidation advisor EY has contacted European steelmakers, including Italy’s Marcegaglia Group, AFV Beltrame Group and Acciaierie Venete, and international players such as JSW Group and Posco Steel.
When contacted, a spokesperson for JSW Steel said, “The company does not comment on market rumour and speculation.""
For British Steel, JSW’s possible interest will be a second dalliance with an Indian firm.
The UK steel mill used to be owned by Tata Steel for nearly a decade as part of the Corus acquisition in 2007. After several write-downs, Tata Steel sold the loss-making Scunthorpe facility and related long steel entities in Europe to Greybull Capital in 2016 for a token amount of GBP 1.
An industry analyst said on condition of anonymity: “It’s unlikely that JSW will bid for all the assets of British Steel; maybe they’ll cherry-pick a few if they get a good valuation. British Steel produces advanced high-quality long products, but costs of operations in the UK are very high. Besides, once Brexit is triggered, there’s going to be a lot of uncertainty for businesses in the UK and for UK’s traditional trade partners.
“JSW is also highly leveraged now; they are investing a lot in capital expenditure and they’ve picked up some expensive assets in India and the US. I don’t think they’ll commit a lot to taking a bet in the UK,"" he added.
JSW Steel has made a spate of acquisitions both in India and abroad in the last 12 months. In May 2018, it bought Italy’s second largest steel plant Aferpi for  ₹600 crore and in June, it committed nearly  ₹3,400 crore to acquire and upgrade US-based integrated steel plant Acero Junction. Back home, JSW Steel acquired Monnet Ispat through the insolvency courts for  ₹2,875 crore in a consortium with AION Investments. The company’s bid of  ₹19,700 crore for Bhushan Power and Steel, another insolvent firm, is awaiting court approval.It has also made a  ₹1,500-crore offer for Asian Colour Coated Ispat Ltd to the bankrupt firm’s committee of creditors.
British Steel is the UK’s second largest steel company and employs about 5,000 people directly. News reports indicate that the company’s liquidation could put another 20,000 jobs in the supply chain at risk. On 28 May, the BBC reported that the official receiver of British Steel had contacted more than 80 potential purchasers, 60 of whom were sent non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). The deadline for bids is 30 June, Financial Times has reported. Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance, through its subsidiary Liberty House, and Greybull Capital itself are among bidders interested in British Steel, according to a Reuters report.
For JSW Steel, which is focused on its India business and investing massively in capacity expansion here, a possible bid for British Steel would be a contrarian bet. Steel manufactured in the UK is uncompetitive because of high energy and environment costs and high wages. In fact, senior executives at Tata Steel, which is looking to sell its Port Talbot steel plant in the UK, have said in the past that the energy costs of operating in the UK made steel production prohibitive."

49,2019-06-25,JSW,"Investors are evidently turning wary of the sector’s immediate prospectsDomestic production remains firm in which will continue to keep the lid of steel price upticks

Mumbai: This year’s recovery in the steel sector is turning out to be short-lived. A recent correction in steel prices, which has seen hot rolled coils down about 10% this past year, has resulted in several steel producer stocks ending up in the red.
Stocks of Tata Steel Ltd, Jindal Steel and Power Ltd, Steel Authority of India Ltd, JSW Steel Ltd were down 1.9% to 4.4% on Monday, and have recovered only marginally on Tuesday. Investors are evidently turning wary of the sector’s immediate prospects.
Perhaps rightly so. The knock-on effect of the trade wars has been keeping pressures on steel prices across the globe. Global trade volumes have slumped for the first time in nine years. As a result, exports are slowing down leading to a rise in domestic inventory buildup.
“We see risks for steel players as 1) exports have declined by 30% YoY to 0.7mt due to a demand slowdown in traditional markets of South East Asia; 2) weakness in re-rollers’ segment owing to auto slowdown; and 3) inventory build-up of 0.5mt. We believe lower exports volume is likely to intensify competition in the domestic market and impact export-heavy companies,"" said Edelweiss Securities Ltd in a note to clients.
Besides, domestic production remains firm in which will continue to keep the lid of steel price upticks. On the flipside, iron prices have remained firm due to supply disruptions. The rise in Chinese iron ore prices on a year on year basis of 85.27% to $110.44 starkly contrasts with the fall in Chinese hot-rolled prices by about 10% in the past year. This will add to the margin pressures on steel producers.
To top it, demand from one of the largest consumers of flat steel, the automobile sector, is likely to be curtailed going forward. Auto sales have been contracting which is leading to an inventory build-up in the auto sector.
“Weak automotive demand, coupled with a rising threat from imports and unattractive export markets have put flat steel producers at higher risk compared to long producers. TATA and JSTL – India’s top two flat producers accounting for the majority sales to the auto segment – are likely to be impacted negatively,"" noted HSBC Securities and Capital Markets India (Private) Ltd in a note to clients.
Besides, analysts also don’t rule out the possibility of higher imports which could further dampen domestic prices. “Despite relatively healthy domestic consumption growth, we see challenging times ahead for the steel sector due to potentially higher imports and pressure on domestic realisation,"" said Edelweiss.
For now, much of the sector’s prospects hinge on how the domestic market shapes up. In the near term, though, there’s not much of a steel demand recovery in sight."

47,2019-07-09,JSW,"Irrespective of the insolvency case, lenders can raise issue of liability of promoters, if fraud is found to have happenedPNB’s peers are also now likely to undertake their own forensic audits

Over the weekend, Punjab National Bank (PNB) declared the now bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel as a fraud account. The company owes PNB a little over  ₹4,000 crore and the lender has reported to Reserve Bank of India a fraud of  ₹3,805 crore by the company, based on a forensic audit it did.
In all, the defunct steelmaker owes the banking system a whopping  ₹47,150 crore. The account is in the final stages of being resolved through insolvency proceedings.
There are multiple outcomes from this fraud declaration by PNB.
On an immediate basis, the provisioning hit would be felt by the lender during the July-September quarter. PNB has provided only 50% towards the loan so far, and regulatory rules require 100% provisioning in case of fraud.
PNB’s peers would also now want to undertake their own forensic audit to ascertain what part of their exposure is kosher. A report in The Economic Times in April said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a first information report (FIR) against Bhushan Power and Steel and stated that accounts of IDBI Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce and UCO Bank were also found to have fraudulent transactions.
To be sure, fraud declaration is one way of making promoters pay up as it becomes a financial crime. Irrespective of insolvency proceedings, lenders can raise the issue of the liability of promoters, if fraud is found to have happened. PNB, in its release, said it is confident of a good recovery from the account.
The bigger question, however, is whether JSW Steel would back out now or at the very least refuse to cough up the  ₹19,350 crore it had bid to buy the company.
“They have the option to pull out. At the very least, they can request for a relook on the price and lower it now in light of this new information,"" said a banking expert requesting anonymity.
It is not clear whether JSW Steel’s own due diligence raised some red flags for Bhushan Power and Steel when it decided to bid for the assets. Some lenders such as Bank of Baroda got frustrated with the delays in resolution and sold off the exposure.
Meanwhile, investors have punished PNB as the fraud declaration means its provisioning will rise manifold. The stock fell over 11% and soured the mood for other public sector banks too."

New Delhi: JSW Steel on Monday told the National Company Law Tribunal that the company is not backing out from the ongoing resolution process of Bhushan Power & Steel despite reports of alleged fraud by its former promoters.
During the proceedings in NCLT, counsel appearing for JSW Steel informed the tribunal that it was anxious about the alleged fraud reports and needs to know what is going inside Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd (BPSL).
A two member NCLT bench headed by the President Justice M M Kumar asked the Resolution Professional (RP) of BPSL to hand over a copy of the forensic report to JSW Steel.
NCLT said that alleged fraud reports will not have any impact on the insolvency resolution process and JSW's resolution plan for BPSL.
NCLT has to take a decision over the lenders' approval of the resolution plan of JSW Steel for BPSL.
Earlier on February 4, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had dismissed the plea of Tata Steel and upheld the Committee of Creditors (CoC) decision to approve JSW Steel's bid.
The NCLAT had said the CoC decision was well within its rights to negotiate better terms with resolution applicants and has had asked NCLT to decide over JSW Steel's bid by March 31, 2019.
However, the judgement is still pending before the Principal bench of NCLT.
JSW Steel had revised its offer from  ₹11,000 crore to  ₹18,000 crore and later to over  ₹19,000 crore, whereas Tata Steel's last offer was at  ₹17,000 crore after it had refused to revise its bid.
Last week, state-owned lender Allahabad Bank had reported fraud of over  ₹1,774 crore by BPSL to the Reserve Bank of India.
Earlier, PNB reported a fraud worth  ₹3,805.15 crore by BPSL by misappropriating bank funds and manipulating its books of accounts.
Around 85 per cent of PNB's  ₹4,399 crore exposure to the company had been siphoned off.
Investigate agency CBI has already registered complaint in April names several other lenders.

44,2019-07-19,JSW,"The company has invested close to  ₹1,000 crore in its Tarapur unit in Maharashtra to roll out JSW PlatinaOnce all units are operational, JSW Steel will have an installed tinplate capacity of 600,000 tonnes

Mumbai: JSW Steel, India’s second largest private steel manufacturer, has redoubled efforts to boost tinplate manufacturing. The company said it has invested close to  ₹1,000 crore at its Tarapur unit in Maharashtra to roll out JSW Platina, premium tinplate, to tap the growing demand from the local packaging industry.
The investment is part of the group's ongoing  ₹45,000 crore capital expenditure programme.
“The demand for tinplate in India is at about 700,000 tonnes today,"" Jayant Acharya, director - Commercial, Marketing & Strategy, JSW Steel said. “It’s growing at 6.5% per year and I think this will rise as alternative packaging picks up. India has about 1 million tonne of installed capacity but less than half of it is operational. India imports about 300,000 tonnes a year, but 55-60% of this is secondary material that doesn’t qualify for use in the developed world. “
“For the first line at Tarapur, we’ve set up 250,000 tonne capacity with an investment of  ₹575 crore,"" Acharya added. “In the second line, we’re adding another 250,000 tonnes with an investment of  ₹490 crore. We expect the product to deliver better margins than general operations."" Once both lines are operational, JSW Steel will have installed tinplate capacity of 600,000 tonnes, including an existing 100,000 tonnes as part of a joint venture with Vallabh Tinplate in Punjab, called JSW Vallabh Tinplate Pvt Ltd. They will overtake Tata Steel as the largest tinplate manufacturer in India, with an existing capacity of 380,000 tonnes a year.
Domestic tinplate production has been growing so far at compound average growth rate of 7.4% since FY10, while demand over the same period has grown at 6.4%. Tinplate is used for packaging in the consumables industry for edible oil and fruit pulp, as beverage cans, and in cans for paint and solvent, as a replacement for plastic.
The domestic market for tinplate is estimated to be approximately  ₹5,500 to 6,000 crore in value terms, Acharya said. “Demand for this product will grow over a period of time in India. We anticipate a lot of aspirational demand from smaller cities, where there is a need for off-the-shelf products like this.""
Acharya said JSW is the first in India to manufacture tinplate through a continuous annealing furnace, that creates a better product in terms of “hardness and temper, which is needed for non-oil cans, and a smaller grain size that makes the material tougher""."
43,2019-07-25,JSW,"However, the company's CFO said it is seeking immunity on litigations on Bhushan Power purchase CFO Seshagiri Rao said JSW Steel will turnaround Monnet Ispat in two years from date of purchase

Mumbai: JSW Steel is committed to acquiring bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel, despite the investigations of fraud at the company and the undue delay in lenders to the sick steel mill turning over control to JSW. At the annual shareholder’s meeting, Sajjan Jindal, Chairman, JSW Steel, told reporters, “Our intent to take over Bhushan Power and Steel hasn’t changed. The resolution is taking unduly long but we are still keen. I see news reports on JSW pulling out of Bhushan or reducing the bid; we won’t do that.""
However, MVS Seshagiri Rao, Joint MD and Group CFO, told reporters that JSW Steel has asked the NCLT for protection from litigation on the BPSL asset after control has changed hands. “Today, under the IBC, we only see a discussion on the rights of lenders. We also need to look at the rights of resolution applicants. In many cases, there is a lot of litigation coming in after control has changed hands. But applicant often has to face future litigation that can come from anybody. There is a disturbing judgement from the Delhi High Court which says that the Prevention of Money Laundering Act gets precedence over the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
“We expect a clean company,"" Rao said. “In BPSL, we approached the NCLT for protection that the assets after change in control will not be accessed through any litigation. We have to see if NCLT will give that relief or not.“
JSW Steel acquired another bankrupt steel mill, Monnet Ispat, last September as part of a consortium with AION Capital. They are currently working on turning around the company. Rao said that the turnaround plan will be completed within the scheduled two years.
“We’re converting the integrated operations at Monnet Ispat to produce alloy steel, instead of TMT. We won’t supply to the construction industry but to the forging and automotive industries. This is outside the traditional commodity-grade steel so we will produce better products for better prices. Today we are operating the DRI and pellets units at 100% capacity but we are working on the integrated operations,"" he said.
Rao also said, at the sidelines of the shareholder meet, the cost of financing for industry has gone up and that the company is looking at newer avenues to find cheap debt. “The spreads between G-Securities and AA/AAA rated bonds is widening and the cost of financing (for corporates) is higher. We did a $700 million funding tranche in March at Libor+ 2%. It’s a great instrument for long-term capital expenditure. These are the kind of products we will explore."""

Indian markets are expected to be wobbly today, bogged down by weak corporate earnings by key companies like Tata Motors. Asian shares opened a tad lower today on mixed US earnings reports and the euro held above two-year lows struck overnight after the European Central Bank held interest rates steady, though officials said a cut was certain in September.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.15% while Japan's Nikkei dipped 0.3%.
Wall Street shares fell from record highs on Thursday, with the S&P 500 losing 0.53%, following a flurry of downbeat quarterly results from Ford Motor and other companies.
Back home, shares of Tata Motors Ltd are likely to be in focus on Friday as it has nearly doubled its consolidated net loss in the June quarter, weighed down by woes at its Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) unit and a slowdown in the automobile industry in India. It posted a net loss of  ₹3,680 crore in the three months ended 30 June, compared with a year-earlier loss of  ₹1,863 crore. Consolidated revenue from operations fell 8% year-on-year (y-o-y) and 29% sequentially to  ₹60,830 crore.
TPG Capital’s Indian private equity arm and buyout firm Advent International Corp. are among institutional investors that will infuse fresh capital into Yes Bank Ltd, according to a Mint report.
Key companies which are going to announce June quarter earnings today are Maruti Suzuki India, Bajaj Auto, Punjab National Bank, Vedanta, JSW Steel, ABB India, Vodafone Idea, Bajaj Holdings and Mahindra Lifespace Developers.
Meanwhile, a rally in global bonds ran out of steam after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi cautioned about pulling the trigger too quickly even though he signaled another round of monetary easing.
The 10-year German government bond yield initially hit a record low of minus 0.463% but ended the day up slightly at minus 0.407 percent.
The U.S. 10-year Treasuries yield also rose 3 basis points to 2.079% on Thursday and traded at 2.107% in the following Asian session. Also helping to stem falls in bond yields, new orders for key US-made capital goods surged in June, suggesting some improvement in business investment.
In the currency market, the euro bounced back to at $1.11465 in Asian trade, after sinking to $1.1101 on Thursday, its lowest since May 2017. The yen was little changed against the dollar at 108.67 yen per dollar.
Oil prices held firm on rising tensions between the West and Iran and a big decline in US crude stockpiles, though gains were held in check by worries about slowing growth in major economies.

41,2019-07-26,JSW,"Lower steel prices and poor demand hit profitThe company, however, remained optimistic about government spending reviving in the second half of the financial year

Mumbai: With a sluggish economy and muted government spending contributing to softening demand, India’s second largest private steel producer JSW Steel Ltd, on Friday reported yet another poor quarter of earnings.
Consolidated net profit for the integrated steel maker fell 57% year-on-year to  ₹1,008 crore in the June quarter, pushed down by lower steel prices and poor demand.
Despite the dismal quarter, the company is optimistic about government spending reviving in the second half of the financial year. “July-September is generally sluggish for the steel sector because of the monsoon. We’re waiting for the government thrust in public infrastructure to pick up in the third quarter,"" M.V.S. Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director and group chief financial officer, JSW Steel, told reporters. “We believe we’ve seen steel prices bottom out.""
Rao maintained the full year’s guidance of 16.95 million tonnes (mt) of steel production and 16mt in sales.
Consolidated revenue from operations fell 3.5% during the quarter to  ₹19,812 crore from  ₹20,519 crore a year ago. Steel sales fell 2% to 3.75mt, even as the company kept production up. Crude steel rose 3% year-on-year to 4.24mt.
As a result, JSW’s steel inventory (unsold products) rose by 300,000 tonnes on a year-on-year basis, with a total inventory of 1.2mt.
Operating Ebitda fell 27% from  ₹5,105 crore a year earlier to  ₹3,716 crore in the June quarter. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, margin was at 21.3%. The company increased its share of exports by 34% year-on-year to 620,000 tonnes. Exports accounted for 17% of total shipments.
“Private expenditure will take a while to pick up, but we expect the public infra space investments to pick up,"" Jayant Acharya, director - marketing, JSW Steel said. “Projects like the Mumbai-Nagpur highway and the related townships, the bullet train project, bulk water transmission projects...we’re seeing allocations to this happen and government keen on implementing this."""
40,2019-07-28,JSW,"Coking coal prices were lower, but the company could not gain from this because of high iron ore pricesSteel sales dipped to 3.66 million tonnes (mt) in the June quarter, 3% lower than a year-ago

JSW Steel Ltd disappointed with its first-quarter earnings, missing expectations, thanks to sharply lower sales.
Steel sales dipped to 3.66 million tonnes (mt) in the June quarter, 3% lower than a year-ago. In the immediately preceding quarter of March 2019, steel sales stood at 4.31 mt.
Earlier this year, the management guided to a sales volume of 16 mt for the full year FY20. This translates to about 4 mt of sales per quarter. On that front, the first quarter’s sales volume disappointed, falling short of the target by about 0.34 mt.
In the post-result conference call, the management indicated that a widespread global downturn kept steel demand and prices weak. Additionally, a credit squeeze led to a sharper slowdown in the domestic market.
That squeezed steel demand domestically impacted realizations. The company’s revenues declined 0.7% year-on-year in the first quarter to  ₹19,812 crore. That may not seem like much, but compared to the immediately preceding quarter, revenues slipped by 11% in the June quarter.
Sales wise, flats account for a larger share of volumes. Growth here moderated by about 2.2% year-on-year in the June quarter, while sales of long products increased to 0.93 mt year-on-year.
To an extent, rising exports buoyed revenue growth. Exports increased by about 34% year-on-year, accounting for about 17% of total sales. This was higher than the 12% exports clocked in the same quarter a year ago.
However, JSW Steel could not derive much gain from its captive iron ore plants. Due to a sharp rise in iron ore prices, raw material costs went up by about 57% in the June quarter as compared to 53% a year ago.
Coking coal prices were lower, but the company could not gain from this because of high iron ore prices.
As a result, Ebitda margins contracted to 18.75% in the June quarter. In the year-ago quarter, Ebitda margins were substantially higher at 25.6%. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
The company’s expansion plans are on course. Any faster progress here could help improve operating leverage and overall performance. But on the balance-sheet front, rising debt levels are worrying. JSW Steel’s net debt-to-Ebitda ratio increased to 2.72 times as against 2.43 times in Q4 FY19.
A turnaround in the steel cycle seems unlikely in the near future. Demand conditions continue to remain weak. As such, the company’s volume target of 16 mt could still remain elusive in the coming three quarters. For now, it seems like the JSW Steel stock hardly offers any positives for investors."
38,2019-08-06,JSW,"Metal producers in India have taken a hit to their earningsVedanta plans to double alumina capacity at its refinery in the eastern state of Odisha

Mumbai: India’s biggest aluminum producer Vedanta Ltd. is prioritizing controlling costs as it embarks on expanding capacity, according to the chief executive officer.
“Any expansion plans, we will do it with the strictest capital discipline and balance sheet focus,"" according to Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, who was the CEO of Johannesburg-based AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. for five years before taking the helm at Vedanta in 2018. “We will control the purse strings quite tightly.""
Vedanta plans to double alumina capacity at its refinery in the eastern state of Odisha to 4 million tons over the next 2.5 years and raise aluminum smelter production capability by 30% to 3 million tons “at an all-in cost of less than $1,500 a ton,"" Venkatakrishnan said in an interview.
“Every business has to earn its right to spend the capital before we spend the capital ,"" he said. “Hence, we said let’s first drive the cost down before we actually go ahead with the expansion.""
Owned by billionaire Anil Agarwal, Vedanta plans to spend  ₹55,000 crore ($7.8 billion) to boost output across its businesses as it seeks to tap into the demand created by India’s ambitions of upgrading its infrastructure. Capital expenditure for the aluminum unit is estimated at $100 million in the year ending March, Venkatakrishnan said.
The company has been able to bring aluminum production expenses from $2,200 a ton last year to about $1,764 largely due to lower alumina prices and higher coal supply security, he said. “We are targeting coal security of around 90% of our requirement from around 72% now and that would see our cost come down.""
Metal producers in India have taken a hit to their earnings as consumption in the South Asian nation slows and companies face mounting strain from a liquidity crisis. That’s been compounded by the impact of the bitter and protracted the US-China trade war on commodities globally. Vedanta reported a slump in profit in the April-June quarter, while net income more than halved at India’s second-biggest steel mill, JSW Steel Ltd.
“I see the current slowdown as an opportunity,"" Venkatakrishnan said. “We will use this opportunity to pull the costs down even further, improve efficiencies and widen margins, so that when the prices start to rally, you can actually cream the extra benefit that comes in and apply a fat chunk of it for a larger purpose.""
The company produces not only aluminum, but also copper, zinc, iron ore, oil and gas, silver and steel. It directly contributed about 0.4% to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal 2017-18 through revenues from its operations, according to the Institute for Competitiveness.

Mumbai: JSW Energy, a part of the Sajjan Jindal group, reported a net profit of  ₹237.27 crore during the third quarter of 2019-20, a marginal improvement from  ₹229.53 crore a year ago. Earnings remained stable an a year-on-year basis as fuel and finance costs fell from the year-ago period.
The company is going to foray into the solar power sector, said Sharad Mahendra, director and chief operating officer, JSW Energy. ""We are examining the environment in solar power and will consider participating in reverse bidding for setting up projects. In the first rush to set up solar plants, there was a lot of dollar-funded private equity investors participating who brought the tariffs down. We believe this has stabilized now and tariffs at  ₹2.60-2.85 per kWh range suit a long-term player like us.""
The company has abandoned its earlier plans to manufacture solar modules in India and will focus only on development, according to Mahendra.
The company has set up JSW Solar, a fully-owned subsidiary, to participate in reverse bidding auctions of intermediaries such as Solar Energy Corporation of India and state distribution companies. The company currently has set up a group captive solar capacity of 10MW at Nandyal and Salboni.
On its coal-fired plants, JSW Energy managed to increase its long-term power purchase agreement tie-up to 81.4% of its generation, while 18.6% is sold on power exchanges. As a result, plant load factors at the Vijaynagar and Ratnagiri units fell to 38.2% and 83.6% (from 55.4% and 85.5%), respectively, due to lower short-term sales. The hydroelectric plant in Himachal Pradesh achieved higher PLF of 66.3% due to better water availability in the Sutlej basin. In total, power generation fell from 6,086 units in the first quarter last financial year to 5,867 units this year. Fuel costs fell 2% year-on-year because of a moderation in the prices of imported coal, while EBITDA rose 2% this quarter to  ₹861 crore, from  ₹844 crore in the previous year.
Last month, JSW Energy announced that it had terminated a  ₹6500-crore deal to acquire a 1000-MW power plant in Raigarh, Chhattisgarh, from Jindal Steel and Power, owned by Sajjan Jindal's younger brother Naveen. JSPL owes  ₹500 crore to JSW Energy and the latter had agreed to acquire the plant instead. However, the date of acquisition (July 31,2019) has passed. JSW Energy said it was in talks with JSPL for new terms to repay the loan.
JSW Energy will submit a renewed bid for incomplete thermal plant in Odisha, owned by the Ind Bharat group. The first round saw bids from JSW and Vedanta, but both were below the company's liquidation value. Lenders have now called for second round of bids for the 700-MW project.
The company said board had approved raising  ₹2,500 crore through issuing non-convertible debentures through private placement. The company has a net debt of  ₹10,221 crore as of June 30."
37,2019-08-15,JSW,"Odisha will auction eight mines with total reserves of 573 million tonnes later this monthSteel companies unlikely to bid high for Odisha iron ore mines

MUMBAI :
Upcoming iron ore mine auctions in Odisha might see muted participation from steel makers worried about high bid expectations, company executives said. The state will auction eight mines with total reserves of 573 million tonnes (mt) later this month, according to reports.
Top steel makers will need additional ore since they are all expanding and buying insolvent assets, said Pankaj Satija, chief of regulatory affairs, Tata Steel, and chairperson, raw materials sub-committee, Indian Steel Association. Tata Steel itself is expanding its Kalinganagar plant in Odisha and needs more ore for Bhushan Steel Ltd that it recently acquired.
Odisha produced around 114mt of ore in 2018-19, more than half of India’s total output. “So, the Odisha auctions are going to play a major role in meeting the current and future iron ore requirements for the large steel companies. Going by the past records of auctions for iron ore blocks in India, we have seen the lease being acquired for a premium of 44.35% and the highest offer in subsequent rounds touching as high as 275%. The average bid price in 2016 for iron ore blocks in India was 86.5%, which increased to 93.6% in 2017 and 100.2% in 2018. In 2019, if you look at the recent auctions of Karnataka and Maharashtra, average bid price comes to 85.92%.
The impending auction of iron ore blocks in Odisha will not be much different and companies will try to ensure raw material security for long-term sustenance,"" Satija said. There are also concerns on how quickly the new lessee can start production, he added.
The bid premium is a percentage of the average monthly price of grades of iron ore, published by Indian Bureau of Mines. The mine is awarded to the highest bid premium offer.
“Steel demand has slowed down and the economy is on shaky ground,"" a JSW Steel Ltd official said on condition of anonymity. “JSW Steel will not be aggressively participating in the Odisha auctions and we are not willing to pay an excessive premium for the mines, unlike what we did for the Karnataka blocks. I don’t think we will cross at 25-30% bid premium threshold.""
The company recently acquired three mines in Karnataka, with an average bid premium of 78.88%.
A JSW Steel spokesperson declined to comment.
“When we bid, we only go up to an extent,"" said Manish Kharbanda, executive director, Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL). “We make sure that whatever we take, we operate. We have 6mtpa (million tonnes per annum) capacity in Angul, which we want to scale up to 12mtpa. For this, we do require captive iron ore. We also have a 9mtpa pellet plant in Odisha and 3mtpa of integrated steel production. We will look at 2-3 large mines but we will be pragmatic in our bidding.""
“Mines in Odisha will attract higher bid premiums because of the state’s better quality of ore,"" said Hetal Gandhi, director, Crisil Research. “Since more than half of India’s crude steel-making capacity is based in the eastern belt, we expect significant participation from large steel makers in the region, smaller sponge iron and pellet makers and merchant miners. In the last two years, we saw Bhushan Steel pay a 100% bid premium in Odisha, Bhushan Power and Steel bid at 87% while Essar Steel won offering 44%,"" Gandhi said.
“The capital cost for developing iron ore mines in Odisha is much higher compared to other states due to the imposition of the recommendations by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) which prescribes setting up of slurry pipeline or railway siding or conveyor for mines that produce more than 5 million tonnes,"" the JSW official cited earlier said. “Almost every mine in Odisha has a production capacity of more than 5 mtpa. This calls for not only huge capital investment but also execution risks apart from logistics constraints in Odisha.""
“We’re also concerned on how soon the new lessee can start production once the licence is awarded,"" Satija of Tata Steel said. “The current non-captive licences expire in March 2020, but what’s the guarantee that the new lessees can start production from April 1? You cannot start production unless you have environment and forest clearances. In the past, we have seen cases where production couldn’t start for at least four years after the licence was awarded. If this process takes as long this time around, we will see a quarter of the iron ore supply getting disrupted, impacting steel production. We are hopeful that the central and state governments would facilitate to the extent possible to make the transition as seamless as possible with positive policy interventions.""

35,2019-09-05,JSW,"JSW may seek further indemnities from liabilities of Bhushan PowerJSW has offered upfront cash payment of  ₹19,700 crore to Bhushan Power and Steel’s lenders

Mumbai: A bankruptcy court on Thursday approved JSW Steel Ltd’s  ₹20,000 crore bid to take over bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd, marking the second successful resolution of a major steel asset under the insolvency code.
Bhushan Power was part of the original dirty dozen cases identified by the Reserve Bank of India to be referred to bankruptcy courts.
JSW Steel is, however, not entirely pleased with the verdict of the Delhi bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and may appeal the order before an appellate tribunal, seeking further indemnities from liabilities of Bhushan Power, two people familiar with the internal deliberations said, requesting anonymity.
JSW Steel has offered an upfront cash payment of  ₹19,700 crore to Bhushan Power’s lenders, besides infusing  ₹350 crore into the steelmaker to revive it. JSW Steel had also approached the NCLT seeking protection from litigation, considering that a forensic audit of the company’s finances had revealed potential fraud and siphoning off of money by its erstwhile promoters. The allegations are being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation. JSW Steel had also asked the court for relief from statutory dues under the Income Tax Act, Department of Registration and Stamps, Ministry of Corporate Affairs and RBI, among others.
In its judgment, the NCLT said: “We do not feel persuaded to accept the prayer made in the resolution plan, yet the resolution applicant may file appropriate actions before the competent (statutory) authorities.""
JSW also sought clarity on the distribution of profits earned by the company during the two-year long resolution period, and whether this accrues to JSW Steel or will be distributed among creditors.
In July, M.V.S. Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director and Group chief financial officer, JSW Steel, said it would request the NCLT for a “clean company"". “We also need to look at the rights of resolution applicants. In many cases, there is a lot of litigation coming in after control has changed hands. There is a disturbing judgment from the Delhi high court which says that the Prevention of Money Laundering Act gets precedence over the IBC. In Bhushan Power, we approached the NCLT for protection that the assets after change in control will not be accessed through any litigation. We have to see if NCLT will give that relief or not.""
A JSW Steel spokesperson, while answering Mint’s queries on whether it approach a higher court for further relief, said: “We are going through the judgment and, as per our legal inputs, we will take a call tomorrow (Friday).""
A member of Bhushan Power’s committee of creditors said, requesting anonymity, that the lenders were happy with the development, but there maybe further delays as JSW Steel may ask for further relief. They have a 30-day timeline within which they can take a call.""
Sitesh Mukherjee, Partner and Head of Disputes Practice, Trilegal told Mint: ““I think the idea behind the IBC is to provide a clean slate to the resolution applicant. Where statutory dues are concerned, the position in the waterfall is clear that they come last, after financial and operational creditors and all other dues are paid. So once a resolution plan is approved, what is left in the end is only what they are entitled to. Section 31 says resolution plan shall be binding on all stakeholders including central or state government authorities to whom a debt in respect of the payment of dues is owed.""
Mukherjee added: “Under Section 30 (4), the committee of creditors can now take into account the order of priority amongst creditors while approving the manner of distribution of proceeds under the resolution plan. It is clear that the IBC route settles all monetary claims on a company. With regard to the retention of profits, the profits that accrue during the resolution period are an asset to the company and stay within the company and when a resolution applicant takes over the company, it by default goes to the resolution applicant. If the lenders wanted a claim on these profits, they should have insisted on these terms at the time when they accepted the resolution plan.""
BPSL operates a 3.5 million tonne (mt) steel plant in Odisha. Under its earlier promoter Sanjay Singhal, the company had accumulated debt of more than  ₹47,000 crore, of which the principal outstanding to banks was  ₹42,100 crore. BPSL was one of firms in Reserve Bank of India’s “dirty dozen"" list of NPA accounts referred to the bankruptcy courts under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in June 2017.
Through its nearly 800-day long resolution process, the case has seen several twists and turns. At the time of submission of bids, the potential ownership of the BPSL assets had been hotly contested between Tata Steel, India’s largest steel manufacturer, and its fierce rival, JSW Steel. UK-based Liberty House had thrown its hat in the ring as well, but JSW Steel upped its bid at the last minute to beat both of them. The resolution process itself meandered along even as there were successive changes made to the IBC, altering how the resolution amount shall be paid to different classes of creditors. Finally, earlier this year, the details of the CBI investigation in the Singhal family , that owned BPSL. NCLT said in its judgement that the criminal proceedings initiated against the previous board members shall continue even after the company has changed hands."
36,2019-09-05,JSW,"Bhushan Power will add 3.5 million tons a year of capacity to the Sajjan Jindal-led mill’s operationsJSW bid about  ₹19,700 crore, higher than rivals Tata Steel and Liberty House Group

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) today approved JSW Steel Ltd.’s $2.7 billion bid for Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd., the second major steel asset the mill has bagged under the nation’s new insolvency process.
The NCLT approved the offer while stating that profits made by Bhushan Power during the insolvency period must be distributed to creditors, in accordance with a ruling by a higher tribunal in a case involving ArcelorMittal-Essar Steel India Ltd.
Bhushan Power will add 3.5 million tons a year of capacity to the Sajjan Jindal-led mill’s operations and establish the Mumbai-based company’s footprint in the eastern part of the country. JSW bid about  ₹19,700 crore, higher than rivals Tata Steel Ltd. and Liberty House Group.
JSW wasn’t dissuaded in its pursuit of Bhushan Power by a string of accounting frauds, including those totaling about  ₹5,600 crore reported by Allahabad Bank Ltd. and Punjab National Bank. The sale won’t be affected by criminal proceedings against the former founders of Bhushan Power on the alleged siphoning off of funds, the court said Thursday. The court also appointed a monitoring panel to oversee implementation of JSW’s resolution plan.
Steel Restructure
India’s steel industry has been a major beneficiary of a new bankruptcy process implemented by the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Global players like ArcelorMittal and domestic producers have bid aggressively for stressed assets hoping to gain plants that would immediately contribute to profits.
Apart from JSW, the bankruptcy process has aided the purchase by billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd. of Electrosteel Steels Ltd. and boosted Tata Steel Ltd.’s capacity with the acquisition of Bhushan Steel Ltd. ArcelorMittal has won the biggest steel plant under the insolvency process, Essar Steel India Ltd., but is yet to get control due to legal challenges.
Shares of JSW Steel pared gains of as much as 3.5% in Mumbai after the court’s decision and were trading 0.3% higher at 2:32 p.m. local time.
In July 2018, JSW and partner, the Apollo Global Management LLC-backed Aion Capital Partners, bought Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd. under the new bankruptcy process. JSW plans to look for a partner for Bhushan Power, as it did for Monnet, once the deal is completed. Bhushan Power owes financial creditors 471 billion rupees.
Adding Bhushan Power would allow JSW to reach its goal of increasing capacity to 45 million tons in India and have overseas capacity of 10 million tons by 2031.

Banks are trying to improve the final terms for JSW Steel, which had made two key demands, but were not entertained by the Delhi bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
BPSL’s committee of creditors (CoC) met top company executives this week to arrive at the final terms of the takeover, two people aware of the development said, requesting anonymity.
On 5 September, Mint reported that JSW Steel, India’s second-largest private steelmaker, had sought concessions, including protection from the consequences of a fraud investigation into BPSL and discharging statutory liabilities.
JSW can challenge the NCLT decision in higher courts, but that would delay the resolution process further. A member of the CoC, one of the two cited above, said that banks were keen to receive the upfront payment of  ₹19,700 crore within 30 days of the NCLT order.
“We’re holding meetings with the company to see what can be worked out,"" he said. “JSW primarily wants its assets protected from the CBI investigation, and that is something the CoC cannot offer. But we want the resolution process to close at the earliest.""
JSW Steel has offered  ₹19,700 crore in upfront cash to BPSL’s lenders and has agreed to infuse  ₹350 crore in the steelmaker to revive it. While the offer was accepted by the NCLT, Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Steel also wanted protection from litigation after the change in control.
JSW had sought protection after a forensic audit revealed potential fraud and diversion of money by its erstwhile promoters. The allegations are being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation.
The NCLT also ruled that the operating profits that BPSL earned during its two-year-long resolution period be distributed among the company’s financial and operational creditors. JSW believes, instead, that these profits were part of the company’s assets and should stay with BPSL.
Financial creditors of BPSL, led by the State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and Bank of India, prefer to finalize the terms that are agreeable to all parties rather than run the risk of more litigation, the second person said.
When contacted, a JSW Steel official said: “We are going through the judgment and, as per our legal input, we will take a call after reviewing the order.""
BPSL operates a 3.5 million tonne (mt) steel plant in Odisha. Under its earlier promoter, Sanjay Singal, the company had accumulated debt of over  ₹47,000 crore, including a principal amount of  ₹42,100 crore. BPSL was among the Reserve Bank of India’s first list of 12 non-performing accounts referred to the bankruptcy courts under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in June 2017. The resolution process has taken over 800 days. On 5 April, the CBI had pegged the BPSL fraud at  ₹2,348 crore. After the details of the CBI investigation emerged, PNB informed stock exchanges that the bank’s loans had been misappropriated and the company’s books of accounts manipulated."

Trump’s delay of additional tariffs on Chinese goods comes one day after China said it would exempt 16 types of US products from import tariffs. The world’s two largest economies have been locked in a year-long battle over Beijing’s trade practices that has threatened to push other economies into recession. The gestures of goodwill raise hopes both sides can narrow their differences before working-level resume talks in mid-September and high-level trade negotiations that are expected in October.
Any easing of concerns about the bruising trade war is likely to help equities extend their rally this month after a tumultuous August. Investors also await an ECB meeting later on Thursday to see how far policymakers will go to support a flagging economy, given the risks posed by Britain’s divorce from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit.

The euro held steady at $1.1013 but traded near a one-week low. The ECB is set to unveil fresh stimulus measures on Thursday but its exact moves are far from certain. Germany is at risk of falling into recession and inflation expectations sliding, but ECB President Mario Draghi, who hands over the leadership of the central bank to Christine Lagarde at the end of October, will face resistance to aggressive easing from more conservative ECB members.
Oil prices rose in Asia, rebounding from a tumble on Wednesday, on hopes OPEC members will cut output to support prices. US crude ticked up 0.77% to $56.18 in Asia on Thursday. Futures tumbled more than 2% on Wednesday following a report that Trump is considering easing sanctions on Iran, which could potentially boost oil supplies. Asian traders were likely focused on OPEC’s decision on Wednesday to cut its forecast for global oil demand in 2020. OPEC also said all producers have a shared responsibility to support the oil market.

JSW Steel has filed an appeal at the National Company Law Tribunal, contesting the conditions of its takeover of bankrupt steel mill Bhushan Power and Steel (BPSL). The appeal is expected to come up for hearing on Monday.
In a filing with stock exchanges, JSW Steel said: “In continuation of our earlier disclosure dated September 06, 2019 and pursuant to the provisions of Regulation 30 of the LODR (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, we hereby inform you that on detailed examination of the terms and conditions of the NCLT order approving the resolution plan, it has come to our notice that the approval contains certain modifications. Further, certain important reliefs sought by the company have also not been granted. The company has therefore appealed against the said order dated September 5, 2019 before the relevant judicial forum.""
On September 5, Mint was the first to report that JSW Steel was unhappy with the conditions of its takeover of BPSL under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. JSW Steel, which has offered an upfront cash payment of  ₹19,700 crore to BPSL’s lenders, was the highest bidders for the stressed steel plant. However, as conditions of its takeover, JSW Steel had approached the NCLT seeking protection from future litigation, considering that a forensic audit of the company’s finances had revealed potential fraud and siphoning off of money by its erstwhile promoters. The allegations are being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation.
The Delhi bench of the NCLT, which passed the order approving the sale of BPSL’s assets to JSW Steel, also ruled that the operating profits that BPSL earned during its two-year-long resolution period should be distributed among the company’s financial and operational creditors. JSW believes, however, that these profits were part of the company’s assets and should stay with BPSL.
A person aware of JSW Steel’s appeal at NCLAT said that the company will make these two key requests – for protection of its assets after the takeover from possible action under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and for the operating profits to remain within the company and not be redistributed to lenders.
Over this past week, the financial creditors of BPSL, led by the State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and Bank of India, have held a series of meetings with the top management of Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW Steel to try to discourage them from appealing the NCLT decision. Mint reported on 11 September that the BPSL’s committee of creditors preferred to finalize terms of a takeover that were agreeable to all parties rather than run the risk of more litigation, which would drag on the resolution process. The resolution process for BPSL has already lasted over 800 days, against the 330-day deadline mandated by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code."
31,2019-09-17,JSW,"Higher iron ore prices, weak demand have forced many firms to trim output since AugustSteel prices fell below  ₹40,000 per tonne in July, the first time since December 2017

A slowdown in India’s steel sector is spreading to medium and small enterprises, with several companies cutting production in response to lower demand.
Such units make up about one-half of India’s total steel production but higher iron ore prices and weak demand have forced many to trim output since August. In some cases, production has been halved.
The steel companies are facing the heat from the slowdown in one of their biggest clients, the automotive industry. Demand for real estate has also been falling in a slowing economy and a liquidity crunch.
“There are no buyers in the market today. Sales are not happening,"" said R.K. Goyal, managing director, Kalyani Steel, a Pune-based producer of auto grade steel. The company, which has an installed capacity of 250,000 tonnes per year, has cut production by 25-40% in the last 15 days, Goyal said.
Ludhiana-based auto grade steel manufacturer Vardhman Special Steels plans to start cutting production from October, said vice chairman and managing director Sachit Jain. “We were lucky because we already had a scheduled plant shutdown,"" Jain said. “The plant has restarted now. We will be producing less than what we anticipated, maybe we will cut by about 30% but I guess we will be cutting less than our competitors.""
An unprecedented slowdown has engulfed India’s automobile industry, the world’s fourth-largest, since July last year forcing automakers and their vendors to cut jobs. Passenger vehicle sales in India plunged 32% year-on-year in August, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). It was the 10th straight monthly drop in passenger vehicle sales and the worst since Siam began compiling monthly sales data in 1997-98./
Steel prices fell below  ₹40,000 per tonne in July, the first time since December 2017. Jefferies cited this to weak demand led by a slowdown in key sectors (automotives, real estate) and de-stocking by steel mills, pushing them to sell at an 8% discount to imports. In a report, the brokerage also found that inventory at steel mills are now at 14.6 million tonnes (45 days), much higher than the usual 20 days.
“We’ve reduced production over the last 2-3 months. Some people are doing maintenance shutdowns at plants even when it’s not needed. Salaries are being delayed by about 2 months after we started cutting production in July,"" said P.V.S. Rao, president, Karnataka Sponge Iron Manufacturers Association, which represents 64 units that depend on iron ore supply from Karnataka.
Rao said that despite a weak market, iron ore prices of state-run NMDC and private miners have remained stubbornly high which is also one of the reasons several sponge iron producers have chosen to scale back production.
“We do about 10,000 tonnes a day of sponge iron production and we’ve reduced it by about 30% in the last two months,"" he said.
Even large steelmakers are choosing to cut production.
In August, JSW Steel, the second largest private steelmaker, cut crude steel output by more than 13% from a year ago to 1.25 million tonnes (Mt). JSW attributed the drop in steel production to a planned shutdown at its Vijayanagar plant. In the June quarter, Steel Authority of India Ltd also saw its sales realisations fall despite stable volumes. Sail had to contend with higher raw material prices and rising expenses hurting margins.
Large producers likes JSW are banking on exports to meet their sales targets. To clear their inventories, Indian mills have exported aggressively in August, with exports rising 37% year-on-year, according to Jefferies.
In an interview with Bloomberg last Friday, Seshagiri Rao, Joint MD and Group CFO, JSW Steel, said the company expects to exceed its export target of 2.2 million to 2.4 million tons for the fiscal year as a response to the slowdown in the domestic sector. But small and medium companies, which traditionally supply to the domestic market, are left in the lurch.
Rao, who represents the sponge iron businesses in Karnataka, said that he expects more steel mills to decide by September on whether they should cut production."
30,2019-09-19,JSW,"Debt was repaid by 3 promoter entities—JSW Techno, Sahyog Holdings and Vividh Finvest—that got their pledged shares releasedPercentage of pledged promoter holdings declined to 2.47% of total promoter holdings in the June quarter

MUMBAI :
Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Steel Ltd. on Thursday said it has repaid debt of  ₹1,148.59 crore to take a release of 5.07 crore of its pledged shares. This represents about 2.09% of its share capital, according to the company’s filing with stock exchanges.
The debt was repaid by three promoter entities that got their pledged shares released. These were, JSW Techno Projects Ltd. that repaid about  ₹500 crore to release 2.2 crore encumbered shares, Sahyog Holdings Pvt. Ltd. repaid  ₹391 crore and released 1.73 crore pledged shares and Vividh Finvest Pvt. Ltd. release of 1.14 crore shares for  ₹258 crore.
As of quarter ended 30 June, JSW Steel had pledged about half of its 42.27% holding in the company by pledging about 50 crore shares. Of this, JSW Techno Projects had pledged 77.7% of its 10.23% stake in the firm, Sahyog Holdings had also created lien on 77.5% of its 4.6% holding and Vividh Fivest had encumbered 48% of its 5.9% stake in JSW Steel.
Promoters pledging shares with banks as collateral for loans is common practice in India. According to a Kotak Institutional Equities analysis of pledged holdings of BSE-500 stocks, the percentage of pledged promoter (majority shareholder) holdings by value has come down in the June quarter in comparison to the preceding three months.
The percentage of pledged promoter holdings declined to 2.47% of total promoter holdings in the June quarter, compared with 2.83% in the March quarter. Outstanding promoter pledged shares were  ₹1.73 trillion, which is about 1.21% of the total BSE-500 Index’s market capitalization at the end of June.
The brokerage noted that pledging shares does not necessarily imply that a company or a promoter is under financial stress; lenders could have sought additional security in the form of promoter shares too.
In February, Adani Ports repaid  ₹1397 crore to Catalyst Trusteeship Ltd. to get a release on 4.20 crore shares pledged by the company’s promoters – Gautam Adani and Rajesh Adani on behalf of SB Adani Family Trust.
However, there have also been cases in the recent past of promoters forced to sell assets or exit their companies under financial duress because of high pledge ratios. This week, private equity firm KKR enforced its pledges in CG Power and Industrial Solutions, in exchange for substantial control of the company. Lenders to CG Power now control the firm and have ousted former promoter Gautam Thapar. The Subhash Chandra-led Essel group is also in dire straits and has sold considerable stake in its flagship firm – Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd – to release promoter pledges of up to  ₹13,000 crore."

27,2019-09-25,JSW,"Despite ongoing talks between the US and China, the situation at the metals exchanges is one of cautionIn the metal sector, the implications of the cut vary among companies

Stocks of metal companies undershot the Nifty 500 index last year. That may not change even with the recent corporate tax cut. The Nifty Metals index has been one of the worst performers so far in 2019, losing about 20%.
Last week, the government reduced the corporate tax rate from 30% to 22% on the condition that companies would avail no exemptions. The effective tax rate, along with surcharges, stands reduced to 25.17% from 34.94%.
In the metal sector, the implications of the cut vary among companies. Some avail additional state-level exemptions, depending on the states they operate in. Ergo, such companies may have to forgo these exemptions in order to qualify for the lower tax rate.
As such, companies with a more significant proportion of domestic earnings with lower exemptions stand to gain. Tata Steel Ltd, JSW Steel, NMDC Ltd and Nalco Ltd are expected to see an increase of 13-17% in their earnings per share. Others, such as Vedanta Ltd, Hindustan Zinc Ltd, and Jindal Steel and Power Ltd, will not see much change. Much of this will depend on how companies reassess their tax planning.
Considering that there won’t be a sizeable impact on earnings, metal stocks are expected to remain muted. “Lower tax is not a re-rating event as drivers lie elsewhere; the value lies only in selected stocks. Lower taxes will not drive significant change in the balance sheets of metals companies and concerns regarding high leverage persist,"" said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a recent client note.
A bigger worry for companies is sluggish prices of metals and weakening demand, which endures.
Domestic steel prices have fallen 10% in the current quarter. Auto and construction sectors continue to see weak demand.
Internationally, copper and zinc prices have slipped about 7-8% each so far this year. Aluminium prices, though, are bucking the trend and have risen about 14% on the London Metal Exchange.
A slow-growing global economy is not helping. Despite ongoing talks between the US and China, the situation at the metals exchanges is one of caution. One positive is that central banks, globally, are loosening monetary policies, and this could contain downward pressure on metal prices."
25,2019-10-06,JSW,"Since the past few quarters, the steel sector has been hit badly due to the slowdown in real estate, auto and infrastructure sectorsThe long and extended monsoon season also played a large role in dampening demand.

MUMBAI :
The post-budget measures announced by the government and the ongoing festive season have renewed the hopes of alloy major JSW Steel of better days ahead, though it still remains cautious on investing in new mines.
Since the past few quarters, the steel sector has been hit badly due to the slowdown in real estate, auto and infrastructure sectors. The long and extended monsoon season also played a large role in dampening demand.
""Demand slump is quite evident from the numbers given by the joint plant committee for the first half of the fiscal and it has been going down month after month. We are seeing demand slump not only from the auto industry but also from other key sectors like realty, infrastructure and general engineering,"" JSW Steel joint managing director and group chief financial officer Seshagiri Rao told PTI.
However, he is hopeful that the series of initiatives announced by the government since the budget that roiled the sentiment for almost every sector, and the ongoing festive season can improve the sentiment, and thus the second half should be better.
Rao also blames the extended and heavy rains for the demand slowdown as the construction sector has come to a standstill.
""Given the recent government initiatives coupled with the Reserve Bank slashing key rates for the fifth time in a row, the second half should be better. However so far we have not seen anything moving on the ground due to the extended monsoons,"" Rao says.
He, however, notes that though the sentiment may improve, the credit flow into the system will take some more time.
Welcoming the recent NMDC decision to renew the leases of the Donimalai mines in Karnataka, he says this will augment iron ore supply to the raw material starved steel plants in the state. The company has one of its largest facilities in the state.
""We see this as a positive move as it will enhance the supply benefitting the iron ore starved sponge iron/ pellet/steel plants in Karnataka,"" he says.
Asked if the company is changing its strategy towards the upcoming Odisha mine auctions, he said that ""we will continue to be cautious and not aggressive in our bidding.""
""We have given a guidance of 1.5 per cent growth this year so we haven't anticipated a big growth in our production or sales numbers,"" he says when asked whether they will revisit its production targets and guidance for the fiscal.
The company has set a target to increase its crude steel production and saleable steel sales to 16.95 million tonne and 16 million tonne, a rise of 1.5 per cent over FY2018-19, respectively.

New Delhi: Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may remain in focus today:
TCS: The IT major will kick start the earnings season for the September quarter on Thursday. This is likely to set the tone and steer the Indian equity market this week. Equity markets will be closed on Tuesday for Dussehra. Along with TCS Ltd, Infosys Ltd will also announce its earnings this week. Global factors such as crude oil prices and investment by overseas investors will drive the markets.
Bosch: The company, one of the leading automotive component suppliers, said it will observe no production days ranging upto 10 days per month per plant belonging to its powertrain solutions division during Q3FY2020. Bosch Ltd wants to align its production with sales requirements. The company had in August suspended production operations to avoid inventory build up.
Glenmark Pharma: The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning letter to the company’s manufacturing plant in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh. This after the regulator made adverse observations during an inspection in April. The company does not expect a significant financial hit from the warning letter, as there are no major pending product approvals from the facility in the next 12 months.
Zee Entertainment: Essel Group-owned Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL), at a conference call on Saturday, told investors that none of ZEEL’s shares were pledged to Russian media conglomerate VTB Capital Plc, in the structured loan arrangement inked between the firms in September 2017. Additionally, ZEEL Chief Executive Officer told investors that VTB Capital has not invoked any of those pledged shares.
Yes Bank: The bank is in talks with three top technology companies, including Microsoft Corp, to induct one of them as a strategic shareholder as part of the bank’s strategy to get fresh capital infusion and augment its digital ambitions. In another development, the bank filed a complaint with Mumbai Police and cyber cell against circulation of fake news and spreading of rumours about the bank’s financial credibility.
Pharma stocks: The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is examining a proposal to change effluent treatment norms for pharmaceutical companies after a submission by an industry body sought tweaks to existing regulations that are acting as hurdles for manufacturing. The government also plans to hold a consultation with various stakeholders to discuss ways of reducing the time taken for environment approval.
JSW Steel: The company is positive that the post-budget measures announced by the government and the ongoing festival season will boost demand sentiment, leading to better days ahead for the alloy major. Metal stocks have been under pressure due to slowdown in real estate, auto and infrastructure sectors. The company, however, remains cautious in investing in new mines.
BPCL: For a hassle-free privatisation of the state-owned firm, the government has quietly repealed the legislation that had nationalised the company, doing away with the need to seek Parliament nod before selling its off to private and foreign firms. The government has proposed to entirely sell its 53.3% stake in Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL).
Auto Stocks: Shares may remain under pressure as the sector is grappling with weakening demand. Toyota Kirloskar Motor Vice-Chairman Vikram Kirloskar said Indian auto industry is facing a big structural issue with affordability becoming one of the most serious challenges due to several factors, including headwinds created by government policies.
HDIL: The company may remain in focus as investigations in alleged financial irregularities by promoters—Sarang and Rakesh Wadhawan—will continue in the Punjab and Maharashtra (PMC) Bank case. The Economic Offenders Wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police arrested the two promoters last week for non-cooperation with officials in probe.

23,2019-10-13,JSW,"ED's a move could scupper the debt-ridden firm's sale to JSW Steel LtdED said Bhushan Power's land, building, plant and machinery were among the assets now associated with an ongoing banking fraud investigation into the firm's former owners

India's financial fraud agency said on Saturday assets worth  ₹4,025 crore ($567.60 million) of Bhushan Power & Steel Limited were connected with a money-laundering probe, a move that could scupper the debt-ridden firm's sale to JSW Steel Ltd
The Enforcement Directorate said on Twitter that Bhushan Power's land, building, plant and machinery were among the assets now associated with an ongoing banking fraud investigation into the firm's former owners.
In a statement late on Saturday, JSW Steel said the agency's move ""vindicates"" its position to seek legal immunity against the seizure of Bhushan Power's assets.
JSW Steel, which has the largest steel capacity in India, received the go-ahead last month from the National Company Law Tribunal to buy Bhushan Power in a deal that would give it access to steel and power plants in eastern India, where its rivals are stronger.
But the tribunal order did not provide JSW Steel legal immunity from the probe into Bhushan Steel. JSW has appealed to a higher court against that court order.
A source close to the development told Reuters on Saturday that JSW Steel was prepared to go to the highest court in the country to secure that immunity.
""Anything which happened in past should not come to haunt the new company management later and hence it has sought immunity from future litigations,"" said the source, requesting anonymity.
Saturday's order means Bhushan Steel's assets could be at risk and may hinder the sale to JSW Steel.
Bhushan Power runs a 3.5 million tonne steel plant in eastern India's Odisha state, as well as a 500 megawatt power plant for internal use."

JSW Steel had in September moved National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) seeking immunity from criminal proceedings in the ongoing bank fraud investigation against erstwhile promoter of BPSL. The appellate tribunal will hear JSW Steel’s plea on Monday
“It vindicates JSW Steel stand of seeking immunity from attachment of properties of corporate debtor (BPSL). This may happen even in cases where the control is changed under IBC,"" the company’s joint managing director and group chief financial officer Seshagiri Rao said in a statement.
ED on Saturday attached assets worth  ₹4,025 crore of BPSL in connection with an alleged bank loan fraud, which is undergoing investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.
JSW Steel had in September acquired debt-ridden BPSL under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) with an offer of  ₹19,700 crore. While financial creditors will recover  ₹19,350 crore, or 41% of their total admitted claims of  ₹47,158 crore. Operational creditors will get  ₹350 crore of their admitted claims of  ₹734 crore.
Approving JSW Steels’s bid for BPSL, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had said criminal proceedings against the erstwhile promoter of BPSL, Sanjay Singhal, would not impact the implementation of JSW Steel’s resolution proposal.
Despite NCLT’s assurance, ED has attached the assets of BPSL where erstwhile promoter has been allegedly involved in siphoning off funds amounting to  ₹5,600 crore as reported by state-owned Punjab National Bank and Allahabad Bank.
The probe agency said it has attached immovable properties--land, building, plant and machinery--of BPSL located in Odisha. While this is the first such attachment in the probe, the agency is likely to continue further attachment of assets."

20,2019-10-14,JSW,"NCLAT stayed transfer of JSW Steel’s payment to BPSL creditor till probe into fraud by former owners is overAfter winning the bid for BPSL, JSW Steel had approached NCLT seeking protection from litigation

Mumbai: A bankruptcy appeals court on Monday halted the transfer of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL) to JSW Steel Ltd and stayed the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) move to attach assets of the insolvent steel maker, scuttling hopes of a swift resolution of the distressed asset.
The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) stayed the transfer of the payment by JSW Steel to the creditors of BPSL till investigation into allegations of fraud and money laundering by the former owners of the steel mill is decided. NCLAT will issue final orders on 25 October.
The tribunal’s ruling could have far-reaching implications, especially for BPSL’s lenders, as the resolution process has lingered on for more than two years. Swift resolution of distressed assets such as BPSL is key to the government’s effort to free up bank capital and revive credit growth.
Mahendra Khandelwal, resolution professional in the BPSL case, however, remained hopeful of a quick resolution. “I expect everything to be sorted out at the next hearing. The NCLAT has addressed all of JSW Steel’s concerns. The ministry of corporate affairs has called for a meeting of officials from all departments of financial services and all government agencies. This includes the ED too,"" he said.
The government too is keen to settle soon the question of fraud affecting resolution. In court, Sanjay Shorey, director (legal prosecution)at the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA), argued that ED has no jurisdiction to attach the property of BPSL, which is undergoing corporate insolvency resolution process. MCA argued that the rights of secured financial creditors (banks) are to be protected through the resolution process.
“Once a resolution plan is approved, it is binding on all stakeholders, including government agencies,"" MCA’s submission reads in the stay order from NCLAT.
On 5 September, after a two-year-long resolution process, NCLAT finally approved the sale of the stressed steel plant to Sajjan Jindal’s JSW Steel for  ₹19,700 crore.
A person privy to discussions within JSW Steel indicated that if the ED attachment on BPSL’s assets holds firm, then the value of JSW Steel’s bid will also fall proportionately, forcing a much larger haircut on bankers in their  ₹47,000 crore exposure to the bad loan. The spokesperson for JSW Steel did not respond to queries seeking comment. Officials of two of BPSL’s creditors declined to comment.
The action by ED is related to an alleged bank loan fraud being investigated under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. Investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation, the Serious Fraud Investigation Office and ED were a result of a forensic audit by the Punjab National Bank, one of the lenders to BPSL that detected that 85% of its exposure to the bankrupt steel mill had been siphoned off and that the company had misappropriated bank funds and manipulated account books.
After winning the bid for BPSL, JSW Steel had approached NCLT seeking protection from litigation, considering that a forensic audit of BPSL’s finances had revealed potential fraud and siphoning off of money by its erstwhile promoters, the Singhal family. However, the court refused to grant these protections to JSW Steel at the time.
After ED moved to attach BPSL’s assets on Saturday, Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director and group chief financial officer of JSW Steel, said: “It vindicates JSW Steel’s stand of seeking immunity from attachment of properties of corporate debtor (BPSL). This may happen even in cases where the control is changed under IBC.""
“For a buyer of distressed assets, this (move by ED) creates major uncertainty,"" said Sudip Mahapatra, partner at law firm S and R Associates. “If you don’t know the potential liabilities, how do you factor them in your resolution plan and that will make the bidding process more uncertain and unattractive.
“The BPSL case is now likely to be resolved at the Supreme Court stating that when a resolution plan is approved, you cannot hold the company responsible for financial crimes committed by past promoters or management or if the government brings an ordinance to provide that protection,"" Mahapatra said.
“The government has been receptive to issues surrounding the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code given the large sums involved. This issue can impact resolution of approximately  ₹70,000-90,000 crore worth of stressed assets. I expect that in the next two-three months, we should see some definitive steps being taken on resolving this issue,"" he said."
16,2019-10-15,JSW,"Sajjan Jindal-led group releases pledged promoter shares of JSW Steel and JSW Energy worth  ₹2,500 crPromoters pledging shares with banks as collateral for loans is common practice in India

Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Group on Tuesday said it has released  ₹2,500 crore worth of pledged promoter shares of JSW Steel Ltd and JSW Energy Ltd by repaying loans worth  ₹1,200 crore taken by promoter firms.
Two promoter entities of JSW Energy released 118.8 million pledged shares, which represent a 7.24% stake in the company.
For JSW Steel, promoter firms JSW Holdings Ltd, JSW Techno Projects Management Ltd, Sahyog Holdings Pvt. Ltd and Vividh Finvest Pvt. Ltd released 70.1 million encumbered shares of JSW Steel, or 2.9% of the paid-up equity capital of the company.
The latest reduction in promoter pledged shares follows a similar debt repayment by the JSW promoter group in September to release pledged shares.
In September, JSW Steel’s three promoter group companies released 50.7 million of its pledged shares of the company, representing about 2.09% of its share capital, repaying loans worth  ₹1,148.59 crore.
As of 30 June, JSW Steel promoters pledged about half of its 42.27% holding in the company by pledging about 500 million shares. JSW Energy promoter firms also pledged more than half of its 75% holding in the firm.
Promoters pledging shares with banks as collateral for loans is common practice in India. According to a Kotak Institutional Equities analysis of pledged holdings of BSE-500 stocks, the percentage of pledged promoter (majority shareholder) holdings by value has come down in the June quarter in comparison to the preceding three months.
The percentage of pledged promoter holdings declined to 2.47% of total promoter holdings in the June quarter, from 2.83% in the March quarter. Outstanding promoter pledged shares were worth  ₹1.73 trillion as of June 30, which is about 1.21% of the total BSE-500 Index’s market capitalization at the end of June.
The brokerage noted that pledging shares does not necessarily imply that a company or a promoter is under financial stress; lenders could have sought additional security in the form of promoter shares too.
However, there have also been cases in the recent past of promoters being forced to sell assets or exit their companies under financial duress because of high pledge ratios.
Recently, private equity firm KKR and other lenders enforced their pledges in CG Power and Industrial Solutions to take control of the company.
The Subhash Chandra-led Essel group is also facing pressure from lenders and recently sold a considerable stake in its flagship firm—Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd—to release promoter pledges.
Other promoter groups who have focused on repaying promoter level loans to reduce pledged shares include the promoters of Apollo Hospitals Group, who recently sold a 3.6% stake in their flagship company to pare debt and are in the process of selling their insurance JV Apollo Munich Health Insurance Co Ltd. Promoters of Emami group sold 20% stake in their flagship company, Emami Ltd, to bring down promoter debt and pledges."

Paytm to raise $2 billion at a valuation of $15 billion
Financial services firm Paytm is set to raise $2 billion from a group of existing investors at a valuation of $15 billion, Mint reported citing a person close to the development. The identity of the investors could not be ascertained independently, but financial news service Bloomberg reported on Monday that the existing investors include Ant Financial and Japan’s SoftBank Group. The valuation of $15 billion is the same as when some of Paytm’s employees had sold their shares to investors earlier this year. In August, Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma said the company’s employees sold employee stock ownership plans worth $150 million at a valuation of $15 billion. Paytm was valued at $12 billion last year when Warren Buffett-controlled Berkshire Hathaway Inc. invested an undisclosed sum in the company. Although One97 Communications Ltd, the owner of Paytm, had not disclosed details of the deal, regulatory documents sourced from Paper.vc showed Berkshire had invested $300 million. The $2 billion that Paytm is set to raise is likely to help it fend off rivals across various segments of its business. The financial services firm is facing stiff competition from Google Pay, Amazon Pay, BHIM, and others in its payments operations. It is behind Flipkart and Amazon in its e-commerce business housed under Paytm Mall.
Air India to raise  ₹2,500 crore via short-term loan to repay vendors
Debt-laden Air India Ltd plans to raise up to  ₹2,500 crore through a short-term loan (STL) from domestic lenders by the end of this month, Mint reported citing a senior airline official. Proceeds of the loan would be utilized to repay a portion of the dues the airline owes its vendors, including oil marketing companies (OMCs). The loan would carry a sovereign guarantee. State-run fuel retailers Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd had on 10 October informed Air India that they will suspend jet fuel supplies at six airports if the airline does not clear pending fuel bills by 18 October. The national carrier owes about  ₹4,000 crore in dues to the fuel retailers and is unlikely to meet the deadline. The fuel retailers had on 22 August stopped fuel supplies to Air India at six airports—Kochi, Mohali, Pune, Patna, Ranchi and Visakhapatnam—over payment defaults. They resumed supplies as part of a deal that allowed the oil companies to receive at least a total of  ₹100 crore from Air India, every month, from September.

Mumbai: JSW Steel, the country’s second largest private steel manufacturer, is likely to report a steep fall in its September quarter earnings largely because of poor domestic demand. A Bloomberg poll of 12 analysts has estimated the company’s consolidated net profit for Q2 at  ₹517.8 crore, down nearly 75% year-on-year, while consolidated revenue is seen falling 17% to  ₹17,881.2 crore.
In the corresponding period a year ago, the company had reported a net profit of  ₹2,087 crore, and consolidated revenue of  ₹21,608 crore.
The steel maker is scheduled to announce its earnings on Wednesday.
The domestic steel industry has been battered by a slump in demand, pulling down prices to a 34-month low in October. Declining input cost, such as that of coking coal, has failed to boost margins for firms. In the second week of October, prices of domestic hot-rolled coil (HRC) fell to  ₹34,250 per tonne - below the threshold of  ₹34,719 per tonne ($489 per tonne), the price which invites anti-dumping duty on steel imports.
Foreign brokerage firm Jefferies has placed an ‘underperform’ call on the three large domestic steelmakers, including JSW Steel. In an October 21 report, it said “Domestic steel demand was flat year-on-year in September (5% year-to-date in FY20). Exports surged 2 times to about 1 million tonnes in September, helping mills clear inventories, but at 50 day, this still appears elevated. Seasonally demand improves after monsoon, but with two key end-use sectors autos (about 10% of demand) and property (about 40%) likely to stay weak (cyclical auto slowdown, real estate stress), seasonal restock and demand pick up could disappoint.""
The difference between domestic and imported HRC prices has widened in recent months, with domestic prices trading at a discount of 13% to landed prices. China’s export HRC prices were hovering at $420 per tonne at the time of imposition of the anti-dumping duty, a level slightly lower than the current Chinese HRC price of about $430.
With the widening of the gap between domestic and landed steel prices in recent months, Indian steelmakers have been focussing more on export markets, and steel exports have consequently risen in the last two months. “However, a 12% fall in Chinese export HRC prices since August 2019 could act as a fresh challenge for domestic steelmakers looking to augment exports amidst depressed domestic demand conditions,"" Jayanta Roy, senior vice-president & group head, Corporate Sector Ratings, ICRA, said."

MUMBAI :
Caught between weak demand and muted spending, JSW Steel Ltd, the country’s second largest private sector steel producer, has decided to shave off  ₹4,700 crore of its capital expenditure programme for the fiscal year.
Reflecting the grim operating environment, the company, presenting its September quarter report on Wednesday, also said that it will miss its production and sales guidance for FY20 by 3%.
The company reported consolidated net profit of  ₹2,536 crore for Q2FY20, up 21.5% from the corresponding period of last year. However, it benefitted from an exceptional deferred tax provision write-back of  ₹1,976 crore. Profit before tax was at  ₹688 crore for the quarter, down 77.2% year-on-year.
JSW Steel has decided to continue with its existing minimum alternative tax (MAT) regime and reverse its deferred tax provisions over the coming quarters instead of switching to the new 22% corporate income tax structure that the government introduced this fiscal year. Two wholly-owned subsidiaries—JSW Steel Coated Products Ltd and JSW Industrial Gases Pvt. Ltd—have shifted to lower corporate tax rates this quarter. The company did not give a timeline for the switch to the new tax rate by the primary listed entity, but said that it will be done after the tax liability reversals are exhausted.
Revenue from operations for the June-September quarter was at  ₹17,572 crore, down 18.5% year-on-year. Here, too, the company saw its profit boosted by a recognition of value-added tax/goods and services tax grant income of  ₹466 crore pertaining to earlier years.
The capital expenditure plan for the fiscal year has been cut from  ₹15,708 crore to  ₹11,000 crore. The original sales guidance was 16.95 million tonnes (mt) in steel production and 16mt of sales.
“We feel that we will be able to meet 97% of the guidance,"" M.V.S. Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director and group chief financial officer, JSW Steel, said at a press conference.
“Even if we perform in the second half of this fiscal as well as we did last year, we will not be able to make up for the losses incurred in the first half.""
For the quarter, crude steel production stood at 3.84mt, down 8% year-on-year, while saleable steel sales fell 9% to 3.6mt in the quarter, from 3.96% in the corresponding period of last year.
The company’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) on a per tonne basis was at  ₹7,768, down from  ₹12,118 in the last quarter. The Ebitda margin was 18.01%.
Net debt stood at  ₹49,640 crore for the quarter, up by about  ₹3,000 crore during the quarter. Stand-alone revenue stood at  ₹15,520 crore, falling 21% year-on-year, primarily due to lower sales realizations and volumes. The company said realizations, linked to steel prices, fell 16% year-on-year.
JSW Steel said weaker automotive sales and consumer durables sales in recent months was a matter of concern.
“However, a modest recovery is expected on the back of festive demand and various initiatives of the government to facilitate credit availability,"" the company said in a statement.
To partially mitigate weak domestic demand, the company increased exports in the quarter to 1.09mt, up 68% year-on-year, which accounted for 31% of consolidated steel sales. JSW Steel exports to markets in Asia, the Middle East and South America.
The firm expects steel demand to grow 5% in FY20. “A better than normal monsoon bodes well for farm income and potential uptick in rural demand. Supportive fiscal and monetary measures are likely to spur investment and consumer demand over the medium term,"" the company said in a statement."

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI :
India's biggest steelmakers may be suffering from buyer's remorse as assets they bought from bankrupt rivals stretch their bottom lines while market conditions have worsened.
Less than 18 months after scooping up these distressed assets in the hopes of extracting value and boosting market share, the steelmakers are struggling to meet sales and production targets because of a slowdown in the key construction and auto sectors.
Tata Steel Ltd, JSW Steel Ltd and others are also wrestling with falling revenues amid high debt loads.
""The operating environment has changed from when they bid for these plants,"" said Amit Dixit, senior steel analyst with brokerage firm Edelweiss Financial Services. ""So their payback period obviously gets elongated now.""
Steel prices were high and demand was booming then. Now, confronted with falling prices and slower consumption, steelmakers are facing the risk of credit downgrades, job losses and cuts in capital expenditure.
Arnab Kumar Hazra, assistant secretary general at the Indian Steel Association, an industry group that also represents major steel producers, noted companies would take a longer time to turn their assets around in the current environment.
A deepening credit crunch in India's shadow banking industry following the collapse of a major infrastructure lender in 2018 has sharply dented spending on cars and real estate in India.
Domestic steel consumption in September was at its lowest since the start of the fiscal year 2019/20, according to official data.
A synchronised global economic slowdown amid the U.S.-China trade war has compounded the problem, quashing global steel consumption and intensifying competition among exporters.
JSW Steel Ltd, which bought Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd in September last year, had promised to turn it around within a year but now says it will take another year.
The company will also miss its sales and production target for 2019/20 by 3% and has had to cut its capital expenditure by a third, said Seshagiri Rao, JSW's joint managing director and group chief financial officer.
""There is a credit squeeze, there is prolonged monsoon, a weaker government expenditure and fall in consumer demand,"" Rao said.
Tata Steel, which bought specialty steel firm Usha Martin Ltd in April, told Reuters the turnaround of the company would be delayed.
Tata Steel and JSW are not alone.
The world's biggest steelmaker ArcelorMittal and partner Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp, which committed $6 billion to acquire a 10 million tonne steel plant in India, will face similar issues, analysts have said.
PRESSURE BUILDING
The problems afflicting the steel majors, which together control over half the country's total steel production, have already surfaced among mid-sized firms.
""Inventory is high, debtor days have extended, and most mid-level steel companies are now contemplating job cuts,"" said R.K. Goyal, managing director of Kalyani Steels Ltd which relies heavily on the automotive sector for steel orders.
The credit crunch and slowdown in autos and real estate pushed India's GDP growth to a six-year low of 5% in the April-June quarter, in a troubling sign for the steel sector whose fortunes are closely tied to the broader economy.
The extent of the slowdown is prompting companies to revise capital expenditure plans and others to question the ability of companies to achieve debt reduction goals.
Despite Tata Steel's move to partially defer expenditure on expansions, IIFL analyst Anupam Gupta said its plans to cut debt by $1 billion this fiscal year look ambitious, given weakening profitability across India and Europe.
Brokerage firm Edelweiss expects both JSW Steel and Tata Steel to see increases this year in their debt to EBIDTA ratios - a metric that reflects the cash available to companies to pay debts.
And the downward pressure on steelmakers does not look set to reverse soon.

Shares of Indian metal and mining companies—Tata Steel Ltd, JSW Steel Ltd, Vedanta Ltd and Hindalco Industries Ltd—surged on Monday due to optimism over US-China trade deal. While JSW Steel was the top gainer among Nifty 50 constituents, climbing up nearly 6%, Tata Steel and Vedanta rose 4.5% and 3.5% respectively.
According to news reports, US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross on Sunday said he was “quite optimistic"" that challenges related to the first phase of the US-China trade talks will be resolved soon. Ross also said leaders of both the nations are still scheduled to meet later this month.
US president Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are set to meet in November, Ross said, adding that the venue of the meeting was a “work in progress"". The clarification comes as the Chilean government last week cancelled the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, summit amid political unrest in the country. The summit was scheduled for 16-17 November in Santiago.
The US is the world’s largest steel importer, importing more than 25 million tonne of the alloy. Though India is a minor exporter of steel to the US, a higher tariff is likely to have affected 50% of total imports to the US, triggering a global glut and slump in prices.
In the case of China, the largest producer and exporter of steel in the world, investors fear that the Asian nation would end up having excess capacity that would need a new market.
The US and China are the world’s largest economies and hence also the largest consumers. A protracted trade war between the two have already dented outlook for most commodities, including metals, and hence any likelihood of a breakthrough in talks is a welcome sign.
In July 2018, tensions between Washington and Beijing came to the fore when Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China for its alleged unfair trade practices. The US so far has slapped tariffs on $550 billion worth of Chinese products. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on $185 billion worth of US goods.
Both sides have also threatened qualitative measures that affect US businesses operating in China. Leaders of the two nations, in various attempts, have tried negotiating and reaching a common ground but have so far failed."

Yes Bank: The stock was the top gainer among Nifty 50 companies in early deals and traded up nearly 3% due to optimism over prospects of the private lender receiving offers from potential investors for fund raising. Separately, ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala buying 12.95 million of the bank’s shares worth  ₹87 crore has also been supporting the bullish sentiment.
JSW Steel: Shares traded 1% higher as credit ratings agency India Ratings has reaffirmed its long-term issuer rating of IND AA for non-convertible debentures programme. However, the agency revised its outlook for the company’s long-term rating to negative from stable due to fall in per-tonne margins and its impact on the company’s credit profile in the current financial year.
Bank of Baroda: The stock traded 4% higher on the bank of robust financial performance in the September quarter. The bank, after market hours on Friday, reported a five-fold jump in net profit to  ₹736 crore for the quarter ended September due to higher other income, which was buoyed by trading gains of  ₹942 crore in the second quarter of this fiscal compared with  ₹138 crore a year ago.

MUMBAI :
Top steel producers, including Tata Steel Ltd, JSW Steel Ltd and Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL), have cut capital expenditure plans, anticipating weak demand following a depressing second quarter, conserving cash for the long haul.
Tata Steel, India’s largest private steel maker, reported consolidated net profit of  ₹3,302 crore in the second quarter, thanks solely to a one-time favourable tax impact of  ₹4,233 crore. JSW Steel, the second largest, also benefited from a one-time deferred tax provision write-back of  ₹1,976 crore in the quarter.
Profit before tax, for its part, was  ₹688 crore for the quarter, falling 77.2% from a year earlier. Tata Steel, on the other hand, reported a pre-tax loss. JSPL posted a consolidated loss of  ₹399.31 crore for the quarter, against a consolidated net profit of  ₹279.17 crore a year ago.
Bhaskar Basu, an analyst at brokerage Jefferies, has maintained his underperform call on Tata Steel. “Any optimism around margin expansion in Indian operation appears overdone, while European margins will stay under pressure. We expect the net debt levels of Tata Steel to also stay elevated,"" he said.
Profitability plunged as steel prices fell. For Tata Steel India, Ebitda/tonne of steel fell to  ₹9,238 from  ₹16,368 in the year-ago quarter, while on a consolidated basis, it crashed from  ₹12,713 to  ₹6,156 crore. For JSPL, steel sales were down 7% from the preceding quarter, while operating profit per tonne fell by  ₹1,800 to  ₹9,437 per tonne. For JSW, the corresponding figure was  ₹7,768, down from  ₹12,118 per tonne from the last quarter.
Over the last four quarters, operating profit margin of the domestic steel industry have been slipping, narrowing steadily from 22.6% in Q1FY19 to 18.2% in Q1FY20, and production dropped steadily to match this. Sluggish domestic demand from end-user segments, including auto, consumer durable, capital goods, construction and realty sectors, has led to a slowdown in consumption growth.
A Crisil research report from September found that smaller steel mills have undertaken maintenance shut-downs ranging from one week to a few weeks through the second quarter. In a recent interview, R.K. Goyal, managing director of Kalyani Steel, which makes auto grade steel, said: “There are no buyers in the market today. It is not iron ore problems for us, but sales are not happening. We have cut production by 25-40% in the last 15 days.""
JSW has cut capex for 2019-20 from  ₹15,708 crore to  ₹11,000 crore while also trimming its sales forecast from 16.95 million tonnes (mt) for the year to 16mt. “We feel that we will be able to meet 97% of the guidance,"" said M.V.S. Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director and group chief financial officer (CFO), JSW Steel, said. “Even if we perform in the second half of this fiscal as well as we did last year, we will not be able to make up for the losses incurred in the first half.""
Tata Steel had set its FY20 capex at  ₹8,300 crore. In the second quarter, the firm spent  ₹2,325 crore and  ₹4,895 crore so far this fiscal. However, it might consider scaling back if sentiment does not improve. “We are focusing on unlocking value from our capital expenditure plans and not on increasing volumes,"" Koushik Chatterjee, executive director and CFO, Tata Steel, had said. This is the second time this fiscal that Tata Steel has cut its capex guidance, which had stood at  ₹11,000 crore at the start of the year."

2,2019-12-17,JSW,"The ArcelorMittal-Nippon Steel joint venture’s decision under Aditya Mittal’s leadership to ramp up Essar Steel’s capacity may turn out to be well timed if demand rebounds

As far as big decisions go, Aditya Mittal appears to have got off to a blistering start as chairperson of the new ArcelorMittal-Nippon Steel joint venture (JV) in India. The ink on the JV’s official acquisition of Essar Steel had barely dried when it announced a ramp-up of the domestic steelmaker’s capacity by 50%. Though the acquirer has had years to mull over its plans for the Indian market, given the long-winded and litigation-wracked process of bankruptcy resolution that followed its initial bid for the ailing Essar Group company, its push for such a major expansion so quickly still caught many by surprise. This is because of the gloom that seems to have settled over the industry in recent times. Steel consumption, after all, bears a strong correlation with a country’s economic performance, and India’s growth has been on a downtrend. Yet, a closer look shows that ArcelorMittal may not be off the mark in betting on rising sales. It could take a couple of years to expand operations and that is enough time for market demand to perk up.
While domestic steel prices have slid by around 10% since the start of this year amid slowing demand growth, which is estimated to fall to 4-5% this fiscal from the 7.5-8% growth recorded in the previous two years, according to Crisil, most observers expect the sector to at least attain stability next year. Further, if the government goes in for a big infrastructure boost as part of a larger package aimed at spurring economic growth, steel demand could easily rebound over the medium term, as construction uses up mega-tonnes of the metal. ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India Ltd is currently operating well below its installed capacity, but it would expect to roar into the reckoning now that it is part of a global group that has proved how competitive it can be under diverse circumstances. If its furnaces are fired up to peak levels and the planned additions made, it could churn out 15 million tonnes a year. This would make it one of the country’s top steel producers.
India’s total steel capacity is around 140 million tonnes, with no more than 6-7 million tonnes expected to be added over the next two years. This should ensure that capacity utilization rates go up over the next few years from current average levels of around 80%. Tata Steel and JSW Steel have pushed their expansion plans farther down the road, which should again offer the new player comfort. For now, ArcelorMittal has short-term challenges to see off. While its acquisition has iron ore pellet facilities in Odisha as well as a slurry pipeline from there to feed its steel plant in Gujarat’s Hazira, it would probably need to supplement its ore supplies. Mine leases are an option, but given the uncertainty over lease renewals and environment approvals in Odisha, these won’t be easy. Local iron ore prices are expected to firm up. Imports could fill in, but while global prices are off their multi-year highs touched last year, they’re not low. In contrast, rivals such as Tata Steel and the state-run Steel Authority of India Ltd have the advantage of captive mines. As iron ore typically makes up around a third of production costs, it could take a while for the JV to achieve a price edge. How it goes about it would test its mettle."

“The amendment will remove certain ambiguities in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, and ensure smooth implementation of the Code,"" the cabinet said in a statement on Tuesday. 
While ongoing investigations against original promoters will continue, the new promoter would be required to extend all assistance and cooperation to any authority investigating an offence committed prior to the commencement of the corporate insolvency resolution process.
The cabinet had cleared the proposed amendments and introduced the bill in the Lok Sabha earlier in December.
However, Parliament could not clear the bill as the winter session ended on 13 December. The ordinance will now be sent for the approval of the President.
The amendments will also make IBC prevail over other laws including the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
The move will help in the rescue of bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL) by the second-largest private steelmaker in the country, JSW Steel Ltd, a transaction that has been complicated due to a probe by the Enforcement Directorate and the attachment of BPSL’s assets.
The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, which approved a  ₹19,700 crore bid from JSW Steel to take over BPSL, subsequently stayed the transfer of payment by the bidder to the creditors of BPSL, pending an investigation into allegations of fraud and money laundering by the former owners of the steel mill.
Bhushan Power, which had accumulated a debt of  ₹47,000 crore, was part of the original dozen cases identified by the Reserve Bank of India to be referred to bankruptcy courts.
The move will help safeguard corporate debtors, protect last-mile funding, boost investments in financially distressed sectors, speed up the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) and strengthen the overall IBC framework, said D.K. Aggarwal, president of PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
“This will attract more bidders to come forward and bid for stressed assets by boosting their confidence in the IBC process,"" he said.
Speaking at an Assocham event last week, Modi said all business failures are not due to financial crimes. “That’s why our government has focused on giving a better exit route for company promoters. IBC is helping many such companies that are facing failure for some reason. This is an effort from the government to handhold the corporate world so that companies learn from their experiences and do something better in future.""
Under the IBC process, of the 21,136 applications filed so far, 9,653 cases involving a total amount of  ₹3.7 trillion have been disposed of at the pre-admission stage. While 2,838 cases were admitted into CIRP, 306 are closed—either by appeal, review or withdrawal.
In the 161 resolved cases, the realizable amount is  ₹1.6 trillion.
As a result of the implemention IBC, India’s ranking in the World Bank Doing Business report 2020 in “Resolving Insolvency"" pillar jumped to 52 from 108 a year ago."

NEW DELHI :
India’s second-largest private steelmaker, JSW Steel Ltd, may go slow on buying bankrupt Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd, despite the cabinet on Tuesday approving an ordinance to ring fence successful bidders from criminal proceedings for offences committed by previous promoters, three people with knowledge of the matter said, requesting anonymity.
The cabinet’s approval did not give too many details and, as such, JSW steel will wait for further clarifications from the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) when the matter comes up for hearing on 13 January. The ordinance says that ongoing investigations against original promoters will continue and the new owner must attend all proceedings.
“The fine print is not clear on this ordinance yet. JSW will move ahead only when everything is crystal clear because the stakes involved are too high,"" said one of the persons mentioned above.
A JSW Steel spokesman chose not to comment on the matter.
JSW Steel had approached NCLAT for protection from any liabilities or litigation that may arise as the former promoters of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd were accused by banks of a fraud. Without such an assurance, JSW could have been dragged into litigation, which the company was unwilling to take upon itself.
The company had told the tribunal that in the absence of protection from possible attachment of assets and liabilities that may arise from criminal proceedings, it would not be able to implement the resolution plan for BPSL.
NCLAT, which had approved JSW Steel’s  ₹19,700-crore bid to take over BPSL, had subsequently stayed the transaction pending an investigation into fraud and money laundering by the former owners of the debt-ridden company. Bhushan Steel had accumulated a debt of  ₹47,000 crore and was part of the original dozen cases identified by the Reserve Bank of India to be referred to bankruptcy courts.
In July-August, JSW Steel had raised around  ₹15,000 crore in bank loans in anticipation of the buyout, when the NCLAT put a stay on the transaction. The steelmaker is having to service the loan. Now, it plans to raise a fresh loan of  ₹3,000 crore in January from banks to complete the transaction, an executive of a leading bank said.
JSW is likely to complete the purchase of Bhushan Steel and Power by March-end, said another of the persons mentioned above.
Meanwhile, the company hopes there will be a further recovery in steel prices, which would make conditions viable for production. Steel prices had dropped by around 20% between January and September to  ₹32,500 per tonne for the benchmark hot rolled coil products. However, since then, steelmakers have gradually raised their prices by  ₹1,000 per tonne with no adverse impact on demand. All the companies are expected to raise prices by another  ₹700-1,000 in January.
Internationally Steel prices have been going up whereas raw material prices are stable, which is improving profitability.
“It appears that construction demand is picking up and things are brightening up for the steel industry. All that bodes well for the proposed buyout of Bhushan Steel,"" said the third person."
