916,2018-01-01,Reliance,"In January the DoT is expected to sent notices to Tata Teleservices, Telenor, Videocon Telecom, Qaudrant (a Videocon Group firm) and Reliance Jio

New Delhi: The Department of Telecom (DoT) will issue notice to five telecom operators, including Tata Teleservices, Telenor and Reliance Jio, to recover Rs2,578 crore, in the wake of the CAG red-flagging understatement of revenues by the firms. 
New Delhi: The Department of Telecom (DoT) will issue notice to five telecom operators, including Tata Teleservices, Telenor and Reliance Jio, to recover Rs2,578 crore, in the wake of the CAG red-flagging understatement of revenues by the firms.
“The DoT will raise demand of Rs2,578 crore from the five telecom operators as was mentioned by the CAG in its report this month. The demand will be raised after reconciling the accounts,"" an official told PTI. 
As per the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) tabled in Parliament on 19 December, Tata Teleservices, Telenor, Videocon Telecom, Qaudrant (a Videocon Group firm) and Reliance Jio have understated revenues by over Rs14,800 crore, resulting in a shortfall of nearly Rs2,578 crore to the exchequer. 
The CAG report said the government was paid Rs1,015.17 crore less in licence fee, Rs511.53 crore less in spectrum usage charge, and Rs1,052.13 crore less as interest applicable on delay in payment. 
The government collection from Tata Teleservices is short by Rs1,893.6 crore, Telenor - Rs603.75 crore, Videocon - Rs48.08 crore, Quadrant - Rs26.62 crore and Jio - Rs6.78 crore for licence fee, spectrum usage charge (SUC) and applicable interest charges. 
“The notices are expected to be sent to telecom operators in January,"" the official added. The CAG findings are based on the audit of Tata Teleservices and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd from 2010-11 to 2014-15; Quadrant Televentures (2006-07 to 2014- 15); Videocon Telecom (2009-10 to 2014-15); Telenor (2009-10 to 2014-15) and Reliance Jio Infocomm from 2012-13 to 2014-15. Videocon Telecom, Telenor (Telewings) and Tata Teleservices have sold their mobile businesses to Bharti Airtel, while Quadrant has shut down its mobile services. 
CAG observed that telecom operators deducted discounts offered to dealers and customers, free talktime, interest earned from investments and some asset sales from their gross revenue. As per the auditor, these should have been part of the adjusted gross revenue (revenue earned from telecom services) for calculation of licence fee and SUC. 
CAG said these expenses are in the nature of marketing spends and cannot be deducted from revenue meant for calculating the government’s share. The auditor found that Tata Teleservices had written off bad debt that resulted in understatement of its gross revenue by Rs1,026.01 crore. 
Unitech Wireless transferred its mobile business to Telenor’s Indian arm Telewing Communications at a profit of Rs251.5 crore in 2013-14, but this profit was not included for computing revenue share with government. 
Most of the deductions considered by the CAG for computing of revenue of telecom operators are sub-judice matters."

New Delhi: Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on Tuesday granted one more month to customers of Reliance Communications (RCom) to port out of the network of the company, which stopped its 2G services last month. 
New Delhi: Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on Tuesday granted one more month to customers of Reliance Communications (RCom) to port out of the network of the company, which stopped its 2G services last month.
Issuing directions in this regard, Trai has asked Reliance Communications to keep all the unique porting codes that were expiring on 31 December valid until 31 January 2018. A unique porting code (UPC) is issued to mobile subscriber when they place request for mobile number portability to transfer their connection on some other network.
RCom will also have to issue public notice in newspapers regarding extension of the validity of such codes and options available to subscribers to port their mobile numbers to other service providers of their choice till 31 January. 
As per the Trai direction, the company will have to send text messages on the unique porting codes to those subscribers who have neither opted for the 4G data services of Reliance Communications nor able to port out, and also submit weekly compliance report through the month. 
Trai said it has “received large number of complaints from the subscribers of Reliance Communications regarding their inability to port out the mobile number due to non receipt of UPC by them"". 
Trai said that RCom had informed the regulator that the company plans to discontinue 2G GSM services in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, UP, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala service areas, with effect from 1 December. 
The company had also stated that necessary intimation has been sent to all the subscribers to port out their mobile numbers to any other service provider in case they do not wish to continue with 4G data services of the company. 
It may be recalled that the Anil Ambani promoted Reliance Communications last week announced that Reliance Jio will take over its mobile business assets, including spectrum, tower, optical fibre network and other wireless assets. The transaction value is said to be in the range of Rs24,000-25,000 crore."

Mumbai: Reliance Retail, the retail arm of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), is planning to launch cameras, electronic wearables, dongles and tablets under the Reconnect brand, said two  people aware of the development. 
Reliance Retail plans to sell these products through Reliance Digital stores. 
The company already offers a range of electronic products including, computer mouse, mixers, blenders, television sets, speakers, etc. through Reliance Digital stores and online. 
“RIL already has the brand Reconnect in the market and the new products would be launched under the same brand. Tablets are in the pilot phase and are being tested with the employees. Other products are in the launch pipeline,"" said one of the two people aware of the development. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
RIL did not reply to an email sent on 29 December. 
RIL also sells smartphones and smart television sets under the Lyf brand and Jio phones under the Jio brand. The television sets are to work with Jio’s 4G network and content services. 
Last January, Reliance Retail started selling LYF phones through Reliance Digital and Digital Xpress stores and on mylyf.com—the phone’s official website. RIL has four variants of the Lyf phones, namely: Flame, Earth, Water and Wind and the company may launch more variants going forward. 
 According to a joint study by the industry chamber Assocham and NEC Technologies released in June 2017, India’s electronics market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41% for three years to cross $400 billion by 2020.
In 2014-15, India’s share in the world in total electronics hardware production stood at 1.5% or $32.46 billion. 
The second RIL official spoken to said the firm is currently focusing on its latest offering, the Jio Phones, and after meeting demands for the same, other segments would be looked into. “As we go along and as technology evolves, changes will happen in our bouquet of offering. Currently, we have Jio Phones on our mind. Whatever 3G smartphones exist in the market, are upgrading to 4G. But there is a huge market out there which is still 2G feature phones and all those guys are yet to be connected to the world. Jio Phone would also boost our subscriber base,"" said the second RIL official on condition of anonymity.
RIL announced the launch of Jio phone, its feature phone in August. The phone can be bought at Rs1,500, which has a provision of being refunded after three years. It offers a larger screen, access to apps, 4G data and 4G VoLTE calls. Jio Phone users will have to pay Rs153 a month. A weekly plan of Rs54 and a two-day plan of Rs24 is on offer.

Mumbai: Reliance Industries (RIL) on Tuesday commissioned its refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) complex of 1.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) capacity along with downstream plants and utilities. This marks the end of the $16 billion refining and petrochemicals expansion plan that RIL embarked on in 2014.  
Mumbai: Reliance Industries (RIL) on Tuesday commissioned its refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) complex of 1.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) capacity along with downstream plants and utilities. This marks the end of the $16 billion refining and petrochemicals expansion plan that RIL embarked on in 2014. 
“The world’s first ROGC and downstream plants marks a paradigm shift in the profitability and sustainability of RIL’s petrochemicals business,"" Mukesh Ambani, RIL’s chairman and managing director, said in a statement on Tuesday. 
Commissioning of the plant will help RIL double ethylene capacity and enter the league of top five petrochemical producers globally, in addition to lowering its fuel cost and boosting profits. There are nearly 270 ethylene plants globally with a combined capacity of over 170 mtpa. RIL’s combined ethylene capacity is now close to 4 mtpa at five of its manufacturing sites. 
The ROGC complex has a unique configuration as it uses off-gases from RIL’s two refineries at Jamnagar as feedstock. 
“This innovative approach of integration with refineries provides a sustainable cost advantage, making ROGC competitive with respect to the crackers in Middle-East and North America which have feedstock cost advantage,"" the company said.
ROGC is the latest addition to RIL’s existing cracker portfolio, consisting of cracker facilities at Nagothane in Maharashtra and Hazira, Dahej and Vadodara in Gujarat.
“With ROGC and imported ethane, RIL has one of the most competitive and flexible cracker portfolio,"" RIL said."
911,2018-01-03,Reliance,"Reliance Jio had complained to Trai that a majority of calls on its network were failing as Airtel, Vodafone and Idea, among others, were not providing sufficient points of interconnection (PoI)

New Delhi: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has issued new guidelines that require telecom operators to sign an interconnection agreement on a non-discriminatory basis within 30 days of receipt of a network connectivity request from a rival service provider. 
New Delhi: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has issued new guidelines that require telecom operators to sign an interconnection agreement on a non-discriminatory basis within 30 days of receipt of a network connectivity request from a rival service provider.
The new rules formulated by Trai also provide for a penalty of a maximum of Rs1 lakh a day per circle for operators that violate these rules. There are 22 telecom circles in the country and most top operators are now present in all of them.
The regulations, effective 1 February, assume significance since there were no clear guidelines on the time frame for entering into such network connectivity pacts.
In addition, the previous interconnect agreement rules did not provide for any penalties on defaulting operators.
Interconnection means the commercial and technical arrangements under which service providers connect their equipment, network and services for the benefit of customers across their networks.
Point of interconnect (PoI) is a mutually agreed point of demarcation where the exchange of traffic between the two operators takes place.
After it started commercial services in September 2016, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, the telecom arm of Reliance Industries Ltd, complained to the regulator that a majority of calls on its network were failing as rival operators were not providing sufficient PoIs.
The other operators had then said the free voice calls offered by Reliance Jio had led to a “tsunami"" of traffic on their networks.
Trai had in May defended its earlier stand to recommend to the department of telecommunications the imposition of a cumulative fine of Rs3,050 crore on Bharti Airtel Ltd, Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd for allegedly denying PoIs to Reliance Jio.
Trai had recommended this penalty as it believed that the three operators had violated the licence agreement which mandates that the licensee will be responsible for maintaining the quality of service and any violation is liable to be treated as breach of terms and conditions of the licence.
The department of telecommunications is currently meeting Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular and Vodafone India to decide on this matter.
Trai does not have penal powers and can only recommend penalties for violation of regulations.
The new rules also outline a framework for provisioning and augmenting of interconnectivity ports, laying down a step-by-step process for provisioning of such ports.
“For a period of two years from the date of establishment of initial interconnection, the service provider, who made the request for entering into interconnection agreement, shall seek ports at PoI from the other service provider to meet the demand of incoming and outgoing traffic at the PoI,"" Trai said.
“At the end of two years from the date of establishment of initial interconnection or on 1 February, 2018, whichever is later, the total ports existing at a PoI shall be converted for carrying one way traffic in such a manner that the number of ports for sending the outgoing traffic of each service provider to the other service provider are in proportion to their outgoing traffics averaged over a period of preceding three months,"" Trai added."
908,2018-01-03,Reliance,"Reliance Industries is likely to see a big cash-flow boost as projects of over $40 billion start to deliver in full swing this fiscal while capex falls, says CLSA in a report

New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd () is likely to see a big cash-flow boost as projects of over $40 billion start to deliver in full swing this fiscal while capex falls, international brokerage house CLSA said on Wednesday. 
New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd () is likely to see a big cash-flow boost as projects of over $40 billion start to deliver in full swing this fiscal while capex falls, international brokerage house CLSA said on Wednesday.
In a report, CLSA said stabilisation of just-commissioned refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) and petcoke gasification projects would boost EBITDA. The downstream expansions called J3 are likely to fully stabilise in early 2018 and should allow almost a full year of benefit to flow in FY2019.
Reliance, which completed its capital expenditure cycle, on Tuesday announced commissioning of the world’s largest refinery off-gas cracker complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat. ROGC will use refinery process residue to produce feedstock used to make petrochemicals. It is in advanced stage of commissioning petcoke gasification plant, which will convert coal and coke, the lowest-cost fossil fuels, into gas.
CLSA said monetisation of the two plants will boost the operating income of the company but full benefits will come only in the next financial year. “Although it has indicated potential annual benefit of $2-2.5 billion, we model a smaller amount of $1.8 billion from these two projects. Stabilization of these projects would give a big boost to oil and gas earnings over 12-15 months,"" it said.
Reliance’s telecom venture, Reliance Jio, has achieved a critical mass with a subscriber base of around 160 million. It has also cornered nearly 80% of the 4G smartphone base. The 4G smartphone base will expand as users replace their existing smartphones.
“We expect Jio to get to 100 million 4G feature phones by March 2019,"" CLSA said. It expects the company, which stormed the telecom world with its offer of free voice calls and cheap data, to monetize Reliance Jio’s customers by gradually increasing average revenue per user, ramping up 4G feature phones, launch of home broadband and start enterprise solutions.
On Wednesday, shares of Reliance Industries closed 0.54% up at Rs916.35 on BSE, while the Sensex ended 0.06% lower at 33,793.38 points."

906,2018-01-05,Reliance,"New guidelines to help identify if a tariff is 'transparent, non-predatory and non-discriminatory' or not

New Delhi: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is set to introduce within the next two weeks rules that will define whether a particular tariff announced by an operator is transparent, non-predatory and non-discriminatory or not, chairman R.S. Sharma said in an interview. 
New Delhi: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is set to introduce within the next two weeks rules that will define whether a particular tariff announced by an operator is transparent, non-predatory and non-discriminatory or not, chairman R.S. Sharma said in an interview.
“Transparency, non-discrimination and non-predatory, these are three broad principles which have to be adhered to... what will be the hallmarks or attributes of such tariffs, that is what these principles will decide,"" Sharma said.
The proposed regulations are expected to bring an end to the controversy started after the entry of Reliance Jio when the company announced a “welcome offer"" giving free data and voice for three months starting 5 September 2016. Jio on 1 December 2016 announced the extension of these free services till 31 March 2017 under its “Happy New Year"" offer.
Incumbent operators had then contended that existing regulations stated that any promotional offer by a telecom operator must be limited to 90 days. Idea Cellular and Bharti Airtel had, over a year ago, also moved the Telecom Disputes and Settlement Appellate Tribunal against Trai and Jio over the extension of free services by the latter.
“In this case, the arguments are complete. The last hearing was on 22 December and the case is reserved for judgement,"" a lawyer representing a top telecom operator said requesting anonymity.
During that time, Jio had written to the regulator contesting the view of its rivals and had said that its free data offer was not predatory as the company was not a significant market player in the cellular mobile services category.
Moreover, Jio had also told Trai that the second offer can in no way be construed as an extension of the first offer as current regulations consider two plans as distinct even if there is only a small difference in the terms and conditions. The welcome offer was a fully free offer, whereas the Happy New Year Offer had limited free entitlement with the option of paying to avail of unrestricted services, it had said. Bharti Airtel in a post-earnings call on 25 January had said it faced a “tsunami"" of incoming calls on its network due to the “predatory pricing"" of a new operator.
Trai had ruled that Jio’s plans were not violative of current norms, but faced with backlash from operators, the regulator had issued a consultation paper on “Regulatory Principles of Tariff Assessment"" in February, through which it had sought views on the matter, including which tariff offers should qualify as promotional offers and what should be the features of a promotional offer.
Trai had also sought views on whether there was a need to restrict the number of promotional offers that can be launched by a telecom service provider in a calendar year one after another and/or concurrently. It had also sought views on what could be a “relevant market"" and how to define dominance in these relevant markets.
“We have been delayed in some sense. We were looking at the international experience also and what are the principles there,"" Sharma said.
The regulator is also set to meet broadcasters on 12 January and telecom operators on 23 January to come up with a broad agenda for 2018. “We will also review what was decided last year, how much has been completed,"" Sharma said. The regulator will hear the issues faced by players in both sectors during the two meetings."

905,2018-01-09,Reliance,"After RCom's debt-reduction plan, including an asset sale to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, was announced last week, China Development Bank says it was in talks with RCom

Mumbai: China Development Bank (CDB) on Friday withdrew its insolvency petition against Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom). The decision follows the Anil Ambani-led telecom firm announcing a Rs39,000-crore asset monetization plan to pare its debt last month.  
Mumbai: China Development Bank (CDB) on Friday withdrew its insolvency petition against Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom). The decision follows the Anil Ambani-led telecom firm announcing a Rs39,000-crore asset monetization plan to pare its debt last month. 
The lawyer for CDB sought withdrawal of the case as against its dismissal to ensure that the Chinese lender can approach the court at a later date in case the asset monetization plan does not succeed. “All this is dependent on the asset monetization plan, which will take place by March,"" he said. The lender also withdrew its case against Reliance Telecom Ltd, a subsidiary of RCom. 
The beleaguered telecom firm owes around $2 billion to Chinese banks including CDB. The total debt of RCom as on 30 October 2017 stood at Rs45,000 crore, which it plans to bring down to Rs6,000 crore of “serviceable"" debt. 
In the last week of December, Ambani announced that RCom has exited strategic debt restructuring, which was invoked by its lenders in June last year. He said that the company has arrived at a debt reduction plan which includes sale of its fibre, spectrum and tower network along with development of its real estate assets and equity injection by a global strategic partner.
Ambani also said that the lenders have received final binding bids and that the bidding process has been vetted by a committee chaired by S.S. Mundra, former deputy governor at the Reserve Bank of India. The panel had been appointed by the joint lenders forum. 
While CDB, a financial creditor of RCom, has withdrawn the case, the telecom operator’s operational creditor Ericsson India Pvt. Ltd is continuing its fight against the telco for non-payment of dues.
On Friday, Ericsson argued that RCom had defaulted on its payments despite rescheduling of the payment calendar multiple times. The case will be heard by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on 18 January.

902,2018-01-09,Reliance,"Reliance Jio's latest move on tariffs has left analysts scratching their heads

Is Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd scared of losing out to incumbents or does it just want to hurt them some more by keeping tariffs low? The company’s latest move on tariffs has left analysts scratching their heads. Jio had raised tariffs steadily in 2017, which, in large part, supported a huge rally in shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd since October.  
Is Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd scared of losing out to incumbents or does it just want to hurt them some more by keeping tariffs low? The company’s latest move on tariffs has left analysts scratching their heads. Jio had raised tariffs steadily in 2017, which, in large part, supported a huge rally in shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd since October. 
But hopes about pricing discipline have now been dashed. According to news reports, Jio will drop tariffs effective 9 January. What gives? 
It’s difficult to gauge what’s behind Jio’s strategy. But one thing is clear: incumbents’ struggle with profitability will continue and perhaps even worsen in 2018, with their chief adversary keeping tariffs at extremely low levels. 
Jio’s flagship 84-day plan will now cost Rs399, entirely negating the 15% tariff hike in October. Perhaps it is worried of losing subscribers if it pushes tariffs higher than the Rs399 levels. After all, the increase in tariffs in October to Rs459 was accompanied by a cashback scheme, which effectively meant tariffs didn’t really rise. 
This column pointed out last year that Jio and incumbents have been sharing a somewhat peaceful coexistence in 4G handsets, which typically have slots for two SIMs. Customers can afford two connections as long as tariffs are at affordable levels. If Jio increases tariffs beyond a certain threshold, the practice of keeping two SIMs will become unaffordable for many customers. 
For now, Jio’s tariff moves suggest the threshold seems to be around Rs399 for an 84-day plan or Rs145 for a monthly plan. “Recharge stickiness is important for Jio as it hasn’t yet become the primary incoming number of most of its customers yet. This exposes Jio to the risk of losing subscribers at the next recharge, especially given that incumbents have closed the pricing gap versus Jio quite aggressively in the past few months and continue to enhance their LTE network coverage and capacity"", analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients, adding that the above thesis is just a conjecture. 
On the other hand, Jio has led the charts in terms of subscriber additions almost every month, which brings to question its latest pricing move. “Scope for incremental revenue gains from a price cut looks limited, given that Jio already has the lion’s share of the market’s LTE subscribers"", say analysts at Kotak. If Jio doesn’t gain by lowering tariffs, what prompted its move? 
Whatever the intent, the obvious conclusion is that tariffs will remain competitive for some more time to come, which means profitability will be depressed and cash burn will be high. This is particularly worrying for Idea Cellular and Vodafone India Ltd, which have high net debt-Ebitda ratios of over 8 times. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. 
Jio has also introduced new plans, which protects Arpu (average revenue per user), but with higher data allowances. As such, capex can be expected to remain high. “Higher usage instead of higher yields could be central to raising Arpu over time. Yet, while Reliance’s network can easily take higher traffic for now, it also suggests that capital spend on infrastructure, spectrum and content may remain elevated"", analysts at Jefferies India wrote in a note to clients. 
Meanwhile, shares of Idea Cellular and Bharti Airtel had risen by 59% and 33% respectively until last week, largely on the back of hopes about pricing stability and the ongoing consolidation in the industry. With assumptions on tariffs now under question, it isn’t surprising that these stocks corrected sharply on Monday. 
But the biggest beneficiary of gung-ho assumptions about the sector is Reliance Industries Ltd, which now prices in a higher valuation for its telecom subsidiary than the India wireless business of Bharti Airtel. Surprisingly, Reliance shares were trading flat on Monday."

New Delhi: After disrupting the telecom sector with its free offers and hyper-competitive tariffs, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd plans to create its own cyptocurrency, JioCoin. 
New Delhi: After disrupting the telecom sector with its free offers and hyper-competitive tariffs, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd plans to create its own cyptocurrency, JioCoin.
With Mukesh Ambani’s elder son Akash Ambani leading the JioCoin project, Reliance Jio plans to build a 50-member team of young professionals to work on blockchain technology, which can also be used to develop applications such as smart contracts and supply chain management logistics.
“The company plans to hire 50 young professionals with average age of 25 years for Akash Ambani to lead. There are multiple applications of blockchain (for the company). The team would work on various blockchain products,"" a person familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity.
Blockchain is a digital ledger for storing data including, but not limited to, financial transactions. In simple terms, blockchain decentralizes information without it being copied. The information is held on blockchain through a shared database which can be accessed on a real-time basis. This database is not stored on physical servers but on the cloud, which makes it easy to store unlimited data.
The most popular application of the technology has undoubtedly been cryptocurrency, and Reliance Jio also plans to create its own version called JioCoin.
“One (application) is cryptocurrency. We can deploy smart contracts. It can be used in supply chain management logistics. Loyalty points could altogether be based on JioCoin,"" the person cited above said, adding that all of this was “in proposal stage"".
An email sent to Reliance Jio seeking a response remained unanswered till press time.
“Reliance Jio also aspires to get into Internet of Things (IoT). Blockchain technology would come in handy there,"" the person said.
IoT is a network of devices such as smartphones, wearable devices, home appliances and vehicles, connected to the internet, which enables these objects to connect and exchange data. Experts have also pointed out that blockchain could potentially address security risks to IoT as it provides a shield against data tampering by labelling each block of data.
Significantly, the Indian government has cautioned against cryptocurrencies, stating that virtual currencies were not backed by assets and posed risks such as money laundering. On 2 January, finance minister Arun Jaitley told the Rajya Sabha that the government was still studying the issue.
“A committee under the chairmanship of secretary, department of economic affairs, is deliberating over all issues related to cryptocurrencies to propose specific actions to be taken,"" Jaitley said, adding that the government does not consider cryptocurrencies to be legal tender.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have come under the scanner of governments across the world as their soaring prices attracted speculators and unsophisticated retail investors in droves. On Thursday, Bitcoin dropped as much as 12% to $12,801, its lowest since Christmas day, as South Korea’s justice minister reiterated his proposal to ban local cryptocurrency exchanges, Bloomberg reported."
899,2018-01-12,Reliance,"The takeaways for Bollywood from 2017 arethe continued reliance on over-the-top (OTT) video streaming platforms and to continue making films on subjects that hold social and national importance

New Delhi: It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that 2017 was one of the most dismal years for the Hindi film business in recent times. Trade experts estimate annual earnings to be at least 10-15% lower than in most years. In 2016, the industry earned Rs9,980 crore from theatrical releases, according to the FICCI-KPMG India Media and Entertainment Report 2017. 
New Delhi: It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that 2017 was one of the most dismal years for the Hindi film business in recent times. Trade experts estimate annual earnings to be at least 10-15% lower than in most years. In 2016, the industry earned Rs9,980 crore from theatrical releases, according to the FICCI-KPMG India Media and Entertainment Report 2017.
Bollywood saw only two Rs200 crore earners (Golmaal Again and Tiger Zinda Hai) and a few Rs100 crore grossers (Judwaa 2, Toilet-Ek Prem Katha, Raees, Badrinath Ki Dulhania) last year. That’s excluding the Hindi dubbed version of Baahubali: The Conclusion, which earned in excess of Rs500 crore. In 2016, two films earned Rs300 crore grossers and six took in Rs100 crore, according to movie website koimoi.com. But even as theatricals fall, the movie industry is increasingly looking at newer revenue streams in the coming year.
To be sure, the single biggest takeaway from 2017 is the continued reliance on over-the-top (OTT) video streaming platforms and their impact on filmmaking and business. Jyoti Deshpande, group chief executive officer at Eros International, said the studio took a conscious call after the release of its period saga Bajirao Mastani (2015) to move away from big-ticket films and focus on its digital business. Its OTT service, Eros Now, Deshpande said, has grown to 3.7 million subscribers. Meanwhile, Siddharth Roy Kapur’s newly formed production house Roy Kapur Films has just announced a multi-year digital content deal with telecom firm Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd to put together exclusive long- and short-form content across genres termed ‘Jio originals.’
“Technology is enabling people to enjoy entertainment in ways that are more in their control, giving them what they want to watch, when they want to watch it and where they want to watch it,"" Kapur said. “I think it’s our responsibility as content creators to ensure that we leverage the new platforms that are available to us to continue to tell great stories, and if we look at digital in that context, I think we’ll have much more productive, creative and rewarding experiences.""
Over time, making one film for distribution across channels will not work, Deshpande added. So you will need cinematic spectacles like Padmavati to get people into cinemas but in the future, there will be more digital-friendly films than theatre-friendly ones.
Little surprise then that a clutch of filmmakers are also eyeing the video streaming space this year. Kabir Khan, Sujoy Ghosh and Vikram Bhatt are at different stages of planning web series for various digital players currently. 
The 25-plus OTT platforms available in India, including American ones like Amazon Prime and Netflix, are changing the way audiences view and consume content, and binge watching has taken over appointment viewing, said Vijay Singh, chief executive officer, Fox Star Studios.
But while on the one hand digital has opened up a fresh revenue stream for producers and is a big opportunity, it also necessitates new and unique consolidations. In mid-December, the Walt Disney Co. announced its purchase of parts of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox Inc. for about $52.4 billion. The deal could possibly make Disney the biggest broadcaster in India besides resurrecting its local film business.
“The streaming platforms have brought entertainment under one large umbrella; the only way for film studios to give them a tough fight is to consolidate,"" said film distributor and exhibitor Akshaye Rathi. “The recent deal is only the tip of the iceberg, the kind of monetization needed to compete with digital can only come from a combined studio entity.""
But it’s not like the traditional feature film format will disappear any time soon.
The other big trend that industry experts expect to continue in 2018 with the success of films like Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (Rs134.22 crore), Jolly LLB 2 (Rs117 crore) and Newton (Rs22.80 crore), is that of social dramas.
“The biggest learning is (to continue to make) subjects that hold social and national importance, for the education of audiences through the medium of cinema,"" said Prernaa Arora of KriArj Entertainment, co-producer of Toilet: Ek Prem Katha. 
Up next for the production company is Akshay Kumar-starrer Padman, a January release advocating menstrual hygiene, and Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran on the 1998 nuclear bomb tests featuring John Abraham.“You need a social and nationalist message but also entertainment. These movies are not documentaries, audiences go to watch them with their families. But people are trying to make better films now,"" Arora said. “Such films have their own standing in the eyes of the society and the common man who looks to them for hope and inspiration. I want KriArj to be the pioneer in creating such realistic cinema.""
Arora also expects action films to come back in a big way and hopes more special effects-heavy projects will be taken up. While director Rohit Shetty has announced an action comedy titled Simbaa with Ranveer Singh playing a cop scheduled for release on 28 December, 2018, films like Rajinikanth’s science fiction thriller 2.0 and the biopic on Indian astronaut Rakesh Sharma should take this trend forward. The resounding success of the Baahubali franchise has set the bar for VFX in Indian movies very high.
“The spectacles will always have appeal because they will be event films. That whole cinematic experience will get people to go to the big screen but audiences will get picky in terms of how many films they go out for,"" Deshpande said. “I don’t see cinemas closing down but it’s time to reinvent and make content that will draw people back into the theatres."""

New Delhi: India’s Reliance Industries has declared a 30% increase in the installed capacity of its export-focused oil refinery, a government report showed, increasing the size the world’s largest refinery complex. 
New Delhi: India’s Reliance Industries has declared a 30% increase in the installed capacity of its export-focused oil refinery, a government report showed, increasing the size the world’s largest refinery complex.
India’s Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell (PPAC) in its October report showed 35.2 million tonnes a year as the installed capacity of Reliance’s refinery in the special economic zone (SEZ) at Jamnagar, in northwest India. That is up from 27 million tonnes, or 540,000 barrels per day (bpd), as of 1 April that PPAC reported in an August 2017 report.
The new capacity is the equivalent of 704,000 bpd of crude processing.
Reliance built its first refinery at Jamnagar with an installed capacity of 660,000 bpd in 1999. This refinery sells most of its fuels in the local market. The SEZ plant was added in 2008 and turned the entire Jamnagar complex into the world’s largest oil processing site.
Two sources familiar with the matter confirmed that Reliance has declared the increased SEZ capacity, which they said the company attributed to debottlenecking, or a by streamlining the processes at the plant.
“They have declared enhanced capacity,"" said one of the sources by telephone, without provided details on how the company raised the capacity.
Reliance has been consistently operating its export-oriented refinery at a rate higher than the nameplate capacity
Reliance had no immediate comment on the increase when contacted by Reuters.
Although most of the products from the SEZ plant are meant for overseas market, some like cooking gas are sold in local markets.
Reliance’s refineries are among the most complex in the world and have facilities that can maximize the production of diesel and gasoline from so-called heavy, or higher density, crude oil that typically sells for less than other crude grades.
Reliance, in a presentation to India’s Center for High Technology (CHT), said it wanted to raise the capacity of its Jamnagar complex to 100 million tonnes a year by 2030, sources last year told Reuters.
CHT is a unit of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas that evaluates projects and assesses their technological requirements. Reuters."

While one swallow does not a summer make, some analysts say the market share gains of the incumbents could have prompted Reliance Jio to cut tariffs earlier this year. As the accompanying chart shows, Airtel’s market share is now higher than levels prior to Reliance Jio’s launch, and in the case of the Vodafone-Idea combine, the market share is now only slightly lower than pre-Jio levels. As such, Reliance Jio’s market share gains have come entirely on account of the drop in the share of other smaller companies."

New Delhi: Even as the corporate studio structure loses its sheen amid Bollywood’s dwindling business, Anil Ambani’s Reliance Entertainment has just about managed to find its feet. 
With earnings of Rs134.22 crore and Rs205.68 crore, respectively, its 2017 outings Toilet: Ek Prem Katha and Golmaal Again have emerged as two of the year’s biggest hits. Plus, there is the moderate success of action adventure Commando 2 that made Rs25.09 crore.
The joy is fairly new. With dismal failures like Te3n, Hawaizaada and Bobby Jasoos a few years ago, the production and distribution company founded in 2008 had been struggling to save face.
“When we started Reliance’s film business, we were working like any other corporate studio where the idea basically was to acquire films, distribute and market them and, over a period of time, you either make profits or losses,"" said Shibasish Sarkar, chief operating officer, Reliance Entertainment.
The strategy didn’t work.
“We completely changed our business model in the past three years, stopped all acquisitions and started looking at joint ventures with respected Bollywood filmmakers’ companies,"" Sarkar said.
Beginning with Phantom Films, a company formed by Anurag Kashyap, Vikas Bahl, Vikramaditya Motwane and Madhu Mantena, Reliance began its new journey, albeit on a shaky note with Kashyap’s period drama, Bombay Velvet (2015), which was a box office failure. 
Things improved soon though, along with Phantom’s critically acclaimed Masaan (2015) and Udta Punjab (2016). Other fruitful partnerships today include those with Neeraj Pandey, beginning with the Rs127 crore earner Rustom and Rohit Shetty’s blockbuster Golmaal Again.
“The main reason for the change in structure is that this is the only way we get a creative filmmaker as partner. In a corporate role, it is impossible to get creative leadership,"" Sarkar said. Now, he added, the studio gets a sense of the project from its inception and then, both partners take a call on whether they want to sell the film to some other studio with a sensible production profit or retain it and see a big upside.
“The sense of relief comes from knowing that our business model is working. From our perspective, in the new business structure, there is very minimum chance of losing money,"" Sarkar said.
The journey hasn’t been easy. A creative partner expects complete time and devotion from the corporate studio. But long-standing industry entities like Yash Raj Films and Balaji Telefilms show by example that a creative person leading from the front makes a difference, Sarkar said. Reliance’s age-old Hollywood partnership with Steven Spielberg’s DreamWorks Studios has also taught it the efficacy of the model.
“They’ve never had a dearth of resources. But it’s not about money, it’s all about recognizing the importance of working closely with India’s concise talent pool,"" said Utpal Acharya, founder chairman of film company Indian Film Studios. Like any other corporate entity, Acharya said, Reliance took some time to come into its own and understand the game. The evolution is evident in the projects chosen thereafter—Golmaal Again is the only Hindi film not featuring one of the three Khans to cross the Rs200 crore mark. And the future line-up is nothing short of extraordinary.
Starting with Anurag Kashyap’s sports drama Mukkabaaz which released last Friday, Reliance has Neeraj Pandey’s thriller Aiyyary starring Manoj Bajpayee and Sidharth Malhotra scheduled for release on 9 February. Vikramaditya Motwane’s next, tentatively titled Bhavesh Joshi, starring Harshvardhan Kapoor, comes out on 25 May while Vikas Bahl’s biopic on Bihar-based mathematician Anand Kumar, starring Hrithik Roshan, arrives in November. The year closes with Rohit Shetty’s action film Simbaa, starring Ranveer Singh. For 2019, there is already Kabir Khan’s 1983, a biopic on Kapil Dev, also featuring Ranveer.
“There are enough audiences in the country; there should be better films targeting specific categories,"" Sarkar said on the current theatrical crisis. “We need to make more massy commercial films in India. There is a definite audience for the inspirational stories but there are also many single-screen goers in the Hindi hinterland and we are not making decent products for them.""
The top ten leading actors should do more work, Sarkar added. “The Telugu market, for instance, has shown a huge growth in the last few years because for a certain amount of box office, you can depend on the top six or seven actors. In Hindi, apart from Akshay Kumar, nobody makes regular films. An actor makes one film in two years, so there is a huge gap for the consumer. Earlier, the same people would do at least two films a year, even if one worked and the other didn’t, there was a definite section of the audience waiting to watch a big-hero film,"" Sarkar said. “Lastly, of course, it boils down to the story. We need to work on the quality of writers and technicians and cater to what the consumer wants.""
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in the Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case."
894,2018-01-16,Reliance,"After Reliance Jio and Airtel, Vodafone is also rolling out voice calls that will be routed on the 4G network, for better bandwidth that will translate into clearer audio

The next chapter in the battle between the telecom operators in India seems to be well and truly underway. Vodafone announced on Monday that it was starting the rollout of VoLTE services in India, starting with Gujarat—Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Karnataka circles will be added soon. VoLTE, or Voice over Long-Term Evolution, is the method by which mobile service providers utilize the 4G network for voice calls as well, instead of just data.  
The next chapter in the battle between the telecom operators in India seems to be well and truly underway. Vodafone announced on Monday that it was starting the rollout of VoLTE services in India, starting with Gujarat—Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Karnataka circles will be added soon. VoLTE, or Voice over Long-Term Evolution, is the method by which mobile service providers utilize the 4G network for voice calls as well, instead of just data. 
We saw a sneak peek of this late last year, when Airtel announced that it was rolling out VoLTE services in some parts of the country to compete with the VoLTE services offered by Reliance Jio over their 4G network. Airtel currently offers VoLTE in Mumbai, Maharashtra, Goa, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh & Telangana, Karnataka and Chennai circles. 
So, what exactly is VoLTE? Most of us would have upgraded to 4G SIM cards for our phones by now, and taking advantage of perhaps the better speeds available for web browsing, video and music streaming as well as downloads, compared with 3G connections. Till now, the 4G network was used for just that—handling data. In parallel, the voice calls that you made and received were pushed via the 3G or 2G networks. 
The biggest advantage of handling voice calls over the 4G network is that the greater bandwidth allows for better quality voice calls. Operators claim that these are high definition (HD) quality voice calls. There will be lesser call drops, greater voice clarity, and operators also claim that calls get connected significantly faster, in comparison with standard voice calls over 3G and 2G networks. While battery life of the phone you use may somewhat improve as well if you have good 4G connectivity, it will surely have a positive impact overall as the phone will now not have to keep switching from 2G or 3G every time you make a call and back to 4G again when you start using an app or browsing the web. 
There are limitations too. The primary restriction would be on whether both participants in the call have VoLTE connectivity. If the call recipient doesn’t, then the call you make will still remain a standard voice call. 
Then there is the issue of charges. At present, Reliance Jio, Airtel and now Vodafone are not charging separately for VoLTE calls—the calls will be charged as per the existing voice plan and would not consume any additional data. 
Now for the most important question—will your existing phone work with VoLTE, if and when your mobile service provider rolls this option out in your telecom circle? Chances are, yes. Let us look at some examples of phones that are compatible with VoLTE to reaffirm that you may not necessarily need to buy an expensive new phone—the OnePlus 3/3T/5/5T, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4/Mi Max/Mi A1/Redmi Y1/MIX 2, Apple iPhone SE/6/6 Plus/7/7 Plus/8/8 Plus/X, Samsung Galaxy A5/A7/A8/A9/J2/J7/ON8/S6 and the Nokia 2/6/8, to name a few. To get VoLTE to work on your phone, you will need to have a SIM card that is 4G-capable (if you don’t have that already), and activate VoLTE services for your connection. 
VoLTE will be the next big feature that could significantly improve the voice calls experience this year, once the rollout is wide enough and users sign up in large numbers."
893,2018-01-17,Reliance,"Mukesh Ambani says Reliance Industries will invest further Rs5,000 crore in West Bengal in businesses such as petroleum, retail in next three years

Kolkata: As an opposition leader a decade ago, Mamata Banerjee had demonised industry with her often violent protests against land acquisition for factories. When she took office as chief minister in 2011, there was a lot of apprehension and scepticism. 
Kolkata: As an opposition leader a decade ago, Mamata Banerjee had demonised industry with her often violent protests against land acquisition for factories. When she took office as chief minister in 2011, there was a lot of apprehension and scepticism.
Six-and-a-half years on, Banerjee on Monday appealed to people who have sold land for industrial projects to receive investors with love and respect, speaking at Salboni, where JSW Cement Ltd has set up 2.4 million tonne unit. Winds of change are blowing in West Bengal, and fresh investments have started to trickle in.
Rooting for the state, Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), on Tuesday said in Kolkata that two years ago he had committed to investing Rs4,500 crore in West Bengal. His company has invested Rs15,000 crore in West Bengal—more than three times the committed amount, Ambani said.
“Bengal knows that it must prosper,"" Ambani said at the 18-storey Biswa Bangla convention centre where a two-day business conference started on Tuesday. “And this convention centre (which covers an area of 457,000 sq. ft) is an example...it is a testimony to your vision and mission,"" he said, addressing Banerjee.
Ambani said his firm was able to plough in Rs15,000 crore within two years, largely because of “enabling policy infrastructure"". Most of the amount went into building Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s network in the state, creating 100,000 direct and indirect jobs, Ambani said.
He announced plans to invest at least Rs5,000 crore more in “Jio and the entire digital ecosystem, retail and petro retail in the next few years,"" capping seven other commitments he made to the state on Monday.
Jio will expand its optic fibre network and connect every school and hospital in the state. His company is building “state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities"" for consumer devices such as mobile phones and set-top boxes, and will make West Bengal “the hub for innovation"".
The chief minister said the key to the transformation was better handling of industrial disputes. The state had moved ahead of its legacy of labour unrest and strikes, she said, adding that the current administration was firm with all trade unions, even ones backed by the ruling Trinamool Congress.
“Things have changed in Bengal,"" said Sajjan Jindal, chairman of JSW Group, which has set up a cement manufacturing unit at a cost of Rs800 crore. On Tuesday, he committed to plough in Rs10,000 crore over the years by setting up a paint manufacturing plant and a steel processing unit.
His son, Parth Jindal, managing director of JSW Cement Ltd, had on Sunday committed to scale up the Salboni unit’s production capacity by another 1.2 million tonnes and build an 18-megawatt captive power plant at a combined cost of Rs400 crore.
The Jindals are under pressure to justify the huge plot of 4,300 acres granted to them during the Left regime. It is currently using only 134 acres for cement production.
The original plan was to set up steel and power plants, but they did not materialize as the group could not bring in raw materials. “There has already been a huge disappointment because we could not build the steel or power plants,"" Parth Jindal said on Sunday. The group will make sure it delivers what it commits, he said.
Among other smaller commitments made on Tuesday, SpiceJet Ltd chairman Ajay Singh said his company was weighing the option of making West Bengal the hub for seaplanes, or aircraft capable of taking off and landing on water. His company has already placed a large order for seaplanes, he added.
Sanjiv Goenka, chairman of the RP-Sanjiv Goenka group, said he is looking to invest Rs1,000 crore to scale up power distribution and to set up a food processing unit. The group is expanding the Woodlands hospital in Kolkata and scaling up production capacity of its carbon black production facility in Durgapur, he added."

Mumbai: Reliance Industries (RIL) and BP Plc, partners in a gas block in the Krishna-Godavari basin, have started approaching prospective customers to sell gas that will start flowing from their R-series field in 2020, said two people aware of the matter. 
Mumbai: Reliance Industries (RIL) and BP Plc, partners in a gas block in the Krishna-Godavari basin, have started approaching prospective customers to sell gas that will start flowing from their R-series field in 2020, said two people aware of the matter.
The firms will sell gas through India Gas Solutions (IGS), an equal joint venture they formed in 2011 for the sourcing and marketing of gas, the two people said on condition of anonymity.
A BP India spokesperson confirmed the development in an email, saying “IGS is already reaching out to the market and will be evaluating interest in purchase of R-series gas in first half of 2018."" 
The spokesperson added that new gas production from the D6 field in the KG block will flow from 2020 and is expected to bring a total 30-35 million cubic metres of gas a day, phased over 2020-22. 
So far, only the D6 field in KG block is producing gas. The R-Series and other satellite fields are yet to be developed. 
The six satellite fields include D2, 6, 19, 22, 29 and 30, in the KG block. While the development of the six satellite fields would be taken up together, D-34 or R-Series and D-55 (MJ) would be developed separately.
Last June, RIL and BP announced an investment of Rs40,000 crore in their satellite fields, R-Series and MJ gas discoveries, to reverse flagging production from the KG block. This investment will boost production as much as fivefold over the next three to five years. 
“With this development, RIL and BP are confident to provide gas supplies on a sustainable basis in the long term,"" added BP India.
A spokesperson from RIL said in an email, “IGS is constantly evaluating options to supply competitively priced gas to Indian gas customers by leveraging strengths of both BP and RIL. We are not in a position to share any details as of now."" 
Through IGS, the companies are reaching out to the market, assuring customers that these resources will be highly competitive in replacing liquid fuels, especially imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), BP said.
IGS is also pursuing options to import and market LNG into India and looking to pick up stake or administer capacity in LNG regasification facilities and gas transportation pipelines. 
RIL and BP are partners in the KG block, which currently produces around 7-8 million standard cubic metres of gas per day. While RIL holds a 60% stake in the gas block, BP owns 30%. Canada-based Niko Resources Ltd owns the rest.
The D6 field began gas production in April 2009 and was to hit a peak output of 69.43 million standard cubic metres per day in March 2010. However, water and sand ingress forced the closure of some wells, leading to a drop in production.
BP and RIL began their partnership in 2011, when BP picked up a 30% stake in RIL’s 21 oil and gas blocks for $7.2 billion. 
Since 2012, however, RIL and BP have been pruning their portfolio, relinquishing the unviable ones."
878,2018-01-19,Reliance,"Such is the extent of Reliance Jio's savings from the IUC cut that they have even driven profit growth at parent Reliance Industries in Q3

Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai’s) 57% cut in interconnection usage charges (IUC) was always expected to benefit Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which ran a huge bill on this account. So it isn’t entirely surprising that about 90% of the increase in Reliance Jio’s operating profit is on account of savings accruing from the IUC cut. 
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai’s) 57% cut in interconnection usage charges (IUC) was always expected to benefit Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which ran a huge bill on this account. So it isn’t entirely surprising that about 90% of the increase in Reliance Jio’s operating profit is on account of savings accruing from the IUC cut.
But such is the extent of the savings that they have even driven profit growth at parent Reliance Industries Ltd. Consolidated earnings before interest (Ebit) and tax rose by Rs1,706 crore sequentially to Rs15,315 crore in the December quarter. IUC savings amounted to Rs1,058 crore. As such, about 62% of Reliance’s profit growth was on account of IUC savings.
Without these savings, the parent company’s profit would have grown by just 4.8% sequentially, compared to the reported 12.5% growth in Ebit.
Of course, there’s more to Reliance Jio’s results than just the IUC cut. Revenue rose 11.9% sequentially to Rs6,879 crore, which is a welcome sign for the company’s investors. The pace of subscriber additions was brisk and improved over the September quarter.
On the other hand, the company continues to capitalize some expenses, since all of its businesses haven’t been commercially launched. As such, its profit and loss statement still doesn’t provide a full picture of profitability.
On Thursday, Bharti Airtel Ltd reported a sequential decline of Rs700 crore in its Ebitda, half of which was on account of the IUC cut impacting its revenues and profit. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
The other major contributor to Reliance Industries’s profit growth last quarter was the petrochemicals division, which reported a 16% increase in Ebit to Rs5,753 crore."

Reliance Jio swung to a profit of Rs504 crore ($78.97 million) in the third quarter from a loss of Rs271 crore in the second quarter.
Reliance Jio, launched late in 2016, sparked a price war in India’s cut-throat telecoms sector, driving down margins and forcing consolidation. Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd, two of the top three telecom companies in India, have agreed to merge. Bharti Airtel, India’s biggest telecom service provider, has reported falling profits for six straight quarters.
Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL’s) profit on a standalone basis, which includes the company’s refining, petrochemicals and oil and gas exploration businesses, but primarily excludes retail and telecom operations, stood at Rs8,454 crore in the quarter ended 31 December, up from Rs8,022 crore a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a standalone profit of Rs8,394 crore, Thomson Reuters Eikon data showed.
Gross refining margin, the profit earned on each barrel of crude processed, was $11.6 per barrel for the quarter, outperforming the benchmark Singapore complex margins by $4.4 per barrel.
On a consolidated basis, which also includes Reliance Industries’s US shale gas, retail, telecom and other operations, profit came in at Rs9,423 crore, the company said in a statement on Friday."

Reliance Jio profits: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is likely to report a profit when it announces results for the December quarter, on the back of a sharp cut in interconnection usage charges (IUC), increasing subscriber count and stability in pricing, said analysts. The street will primarily watch out for Jio’s revenue, pricing strategy and capex plan in upcoming results.
Gross refining margins: RIL’s gross refining margins (GRMs) may decline sequentially or stay flat, in line with Singapore complex refining margins. Nomura expects Reliance’s GRM to moderate from very strong $12 per barrel to $11.5 per barrel.
Better petchem volumes: Goldman Sachs expects RIL’s earnings growth to be driven primarily by the petchem division on improving throughput and lower opex as new capacities reach higher utilization rates, while margins may stay resilient despite higher oil prices due to the diversified feed mix. In a note on 15 January, Goldman Sachs said that petchem margins have been resilient despite rising oil prices and it expects petchem margins to remain flattish for RIL in the December quarter.

Mumbai: India’s public cloud market is likely to rise by more than 53% to $4 billion by 2020 as the world’s fastest growing economy becomes more digitised, said Akash Ambani, Director Reliance Jio Infocomm. 
Making his first solo appearance at a public event, Akash, the eldest son of billionaire Mukesh Ambani, spoke about open source, artifical intelligence, blockchain and OpenStack. 
“India’s public cloud market is estimated to be $2.6 billion in 2018 and over $4 billion by 2020,"" he said at the India Digital Open Summit here today. 
Gartner Inc. had estimated the public cloud services market in India at $1.81 billion in 2017. Public cloud computing uses cloud computing technologies to support customers that are external to the provider’s organisation. 
Using public cloud services generates the types of economies of scale and sharing of resources that can reduce costs and increase choices of technologies, Gartner said. 
Ambani, who is a director on the fast growing 4G telecom service provider Jio, said open source is very important for his company, which is participating in many projects including ONAP. 
The Open Network Automation Platform (ONAP) is a open source networking automation standard, revolutionising the way future networks will work. 
Stating that the Open Source community helps drive the technology progression for areas of interest globally, Ambani said Artifical Intelligence is becoming mainstream for all. 
AI projects have leveraged Open Source to enable continuous innovation, he said, adding that along with broadband, one of the key technology enabling infrastructures is Cloud. 
He said OpenStack - the world’s largest fully open source cloud project, is being leveraged for more and more projects/ enterprises—powering over 60 data centers public and private clouds around the world—including Reliance Jio. 
Last year was the tipping point globally for AR/VR (augmented reality and virtual reality). 
“In India, AR/VR is still in the initial stages of adoption, but market will register a compounded annual growth rate of more than 50% in the next five years,"" Ambani said. 
Also, 2017 was the year of Blockchain and Digital Currency, highlighted by all the buzz surrounding Bitcoin. “Beyond crptocurrency Blockchain at its core provides an open source platform for enabling transaction secured with a distributed ledger system,"" he said. 
Besides Bitcoin, it also finds utility in banks/fintech, healthcare, real estate, eductation, 5G and IOT and agriculture. 
“These all areas that I believe that can impact every Indian in a profound way, improving their day to day lives, Jio is committed more than anything else to impact positively the lives of a billion Indians by providing access to these cutting edge technology platforms, to every single customer,"" he said. 
Jio is committed to contributing and using open source technologies to improve consumer experience, he added."

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd’s quarterly profit plunged 39%, missing analysts’ estimates, as India’s telecom regulator more than halved interconnection fees and a pricing war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd continued unabated.
Net profit fell to Rs306 crore in the three months ended 31 December from Rs504 crore in the year earlier, India’s largest telecom operator said in a statement on Thursday. That compares with the Rs398 crore profit estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.
Telecom operators, already reeling from a fierce price war that started with the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016, were hit hard by the telecom regulator’s decision to slash interconnection usage charges (IUC) levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) cut IUC from 14 paise a minute to 6 paise effective 1 October.
“Although the company faced pressure from Reliance Jio, the impact of the IUC cut is the biggest hit,"" a Mumbai-based telecom analyst said on condition of anonymity. “With consolidation in the sector, it is still the best placed among all operators.""
Revenue dropped 12.9% to Rs20,319 crore in the December quarter from Rs23,335 crore in the year earlier. Pricing pressure is evident from the fact that Airtel’s mobile data traffic rose more than five-fold to 1.18 billion megabytes (MBs) in the quarter.
“Regulatory fiat in the form of a cut in domestic IUC rates has exacerbated the industry ARPU (average revenue per user) decline in Q3’18. The recent announcement of reduction in international termination rates will further accentuate this decline and benefit foreign operators with no commensurate benefit to customers,"" Gopal Vittal, managing director and chief executive officer (India and South Asia) at Bharti Airtel, said in a statement.
The IUC cut has worsened the already strained health of telecom operators. Things started souring after Reliance Jio started commercial services in September 2016 with six months of free services, followed by rock-bottom tariffs. Airtel has since recorded a fall in net profit for five straight quarters as it cut tariffs to take on Jio.
Consolidated Ebitda fell 11.5% year-on-year to Rs7,587 crore in the quarter ended December, Airtel said. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Airtel’s December quarter revenues from India fell 11.3% year on year to Rs15,294 crore on an underlying basis, adjusted for the impact in reduction of domestic termination rates, primarily led by a drop in the mobile segment, the company said.
Airtel’s monthly ARPU (in India) fell sharply to Rs123 in the December quarter from Rs172 a year ago. The number of minutes spent on calls on its network, however, grew 49.8% in India during the quarter while the total data consumed on its network rose more than six-fold.
Performance of the company’s Africa unit has saved the company some blushes. In constant currency terms, Africa revenues grew by 5.3% year-on-year, led by strong growth in data and Airtel Money transactions, the company said."

Bharti Airtel Ltd’s December quarter results show its India wireless business ran up losses after accounting for all expenses. The chief culprit: a 57% cut in the interconnection usage charge (IUC) by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India effective 1 October. Idea Cellular Ltd has already been reporting losses for some time now, and they are expected to expand in the three months ended 31 December thanks to the IUC cut. 
Bharti Airtel Ltd’s December quarter results show its India wireless business ran up losses after accounting for all expenses.

Idea Cellular Ltd has already been reporting losses for some time now, and they are expected to expand in the three months ended 31 December thanks to the IUC cut.
Airtel’s India wireless business reported earnings before interest and tax of Rs167 crore in the quarter. But around 60% of the company’s finance cost of Rs2,088 crore is attributable to the India wireless business, according to analysts. As a result, pre-tax losses would be more than Rs1,000 crore.
Ironically, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which started operations a little over a year ago, is expected to report profits for the quarter. Analysts at Jefferies India, Kotak Institutional Equities and Nomura Research have estimated profits for Reliance Industries Ltd’s telco business, citing the sharp cut in the IUC, increasing subscriber count and stability in pricing. Because there are far more outgoing calls from Jio’s network than incoming calls, it gains from a cut in the IUC.
Another major reason is that the company may still be capitalizing some of its expenses. As such, it makes sense to look at measures other than just reported profits. 
A far more important metric would be cash flow, given the fact that each of these firms already operates with high debt. If cash outflow sustains at high levels, debt can reach unwieldy levels. Airtel’s India wireless business reported a negative free cash flow of Rs1,427 crore in the December quarter.
Jio’s revenues in the September quarter were about half of its cash outflows of Rs11,700 crore in the form of operating and capital expenditure. In rough terms, therefore, it had a huge net cash outflow in that quarter. “Patience may be tested on free cash flow, which we expect to lag Street estimates"", Jefferies India analysts said in a December quarter preview note."

The 2016 upstart, known as Jio, dislodged rivals and has emerged as the nation’s No. 4 carrier. A Jio spokesman didn’t immediately answer an email with questions about the Moody’s estimate. Reliance Industries is scheduled to report quarterly earnings, including Jio’s financials, on 19 January.
The next leg of capital spending for the carrier will probably cover fiber-to-home, digital TV and the enterprise business in addition to improving mobile phone services, Vikas Halan, a Singapore-based Moody’s analyst said in an e-mail response to questions. Some of the money will also be spent on the company’s fourth-generation feature phones and associated network costs, he said.
Jio is also gearing up for newer data-heavy services that can connect homes, businesses and cars to the Internet. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s venture has already triggered a bruising tariff war in the mobile-carrier segment after offering call services free for life and data transmission at no charge for an introductory period. He took another swing at rivals in July by unveiling a data-enabled feature phone advertised to sell at the equivalent of $23. Bloomberg"
889,2018-01-19,Reliance,"HDFC Bank is the third Indian company to cross Rs5 trillion market cap, after TCS and Reliance Industries

Mumbai: India’s most-valued lender HDFC Bank Ltd on Thursday crossed Rs5 trillion market capitalisation for the first time, making it only the third Indian company to achieve this milestone. 
Mumbai: India’s most-valued lender HDFC Bank Ltd on Thursday crossed Rs5 trillion market capitalisation for the first time, making it only the third Indian company to achieve this milestone.
In intraday trade, the stock touched a fresh record high of Rs1,53.75 on the BSE, up 3.31% from its previous close. The scrip closed at Rs1,931.80, up 2.15% with a market cap of Rs5 trillion. The Sensex index closed higher by 0.51% to 35,260.29 points.
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) are the other two companies which crossed market capitalisation of Rs5 trillion. RIL remained the most-valued company with a market cap of Rs5.82 trillion, followed by TCS with a market cap of Rs5.57 trillion.
HDFC Bank’s steady 20% profit growth quarter-after-quarter as well as its immunity to the bad loans crises has helped the stock.
The bank also reports bad loan ratio below 1%, the lowest among Indian lenders. Thus, investors continued to buy the stocks despite high valuation of close to 4.8 times its expected book value for this fiscal.
The recent gains in the stock along with other banking shares was due to news report on government mulling 100% foreign direct investment in the banking sector.
Brokerage firm Jefferies India expects that the this is sentiment positive, but the magnitude of impact should be marginal as the gap between current foreign institutional investor (FII) shareholding and upper limit is wide for most banks barring HDFC Bank.
In the last 12 months, the stock has gained 42.34%, while the S&P Bankex, the broader gauge of banking stocks, advanced 36.62%.
The bank will report its December quarter earnings on 19 January. According to 16 Bloomberg analysts’ estimates, the bank may report a net profit of Rs4,652.90 crore.
“HDFC Bank’s earnings growth should get a boost from recovering loan demand as disruption from the 2017 implementation of India’s goods and services tax wanes,"" said a 16 January Bloomberg Intelligence report.
“Strong exposure to retail should promote loan growth. Margin may struggle to expand further, but should stay above 4%. Credit costs could rise from last year’s low base, but will still stay under control, as HDFC Bank has lower exposure to stressed borrowers than other corporate lenders. Investors may closely monitor digital banking initiatives,"" the report added.
Among the analysts covering the HDFC Bank stock, 50 have a “buy"" rating, three have a “hold"" rating, while two has a “sell"" rating, according to Bloomberg data."
882,2018-01-20,Reliance,"Reliance Industries's Q3 profit rose 25% to Rs9,423 crore on the back of higher refining margins and its telecom arm Reliance Jio logging profit

New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) reported a 25% increase in quarterly profit, beating analysts’ estimates, as its telecom unit swung to a profit and the petrochemical business posted strong gains. 
New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) reported a 25% increase in quarterly profit, beating analysts’ estimates, as its telecom unit swung to a profit and the petrochemical business posted strong gains.
Consolidated net profit rose to Rs9,423 crore in the quarter ended December from Rs7,533 crore a year earlier, said the country’s biggest company by market value. Revenue rose to Rs1.1 trillion, an increase of 30.5% from Rs84,189 crore a year ago, thanks to doubling of sales in retail operations and the addition of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s numbers.
According to a Bloomberg survey, RIL was expected to post a net profit of Rs8,496.5 crore for the three months ended 31 December on net sales of Rs1.03 trillion.
Jio, the company’s telecom unit, reported a net profit of Rs504 crore in just its second quarter of operations as it benefited from the telecom regulator’s decision to halve interconnection usage charges (IUC) effective 1 October and as it added subscribers. That compares with a loss of Rs271 crore in the September quarter. 
The telecom business added a net 21.5 million subscribers in the three months ended December, compared with 15.3 million users in the September quarter. At the end of December, Jio had a total of 160.1 million subscribers.
“Profitability is coming from more subscribers coming on the network and the efficiencies of scale,"" said Anshuman Thakur, head of strategy and planning at RIL. 
Jio has signed an agreement to acquire some assets from Reliance Communications Ltd but officials declined to disclose the purchase value. The company incurred a capital expenditure of Rs7,000 crore on Jio in the December quarter.
RIL is investing in expanding its telecom business at a time when it is making record profits in the petrochemical and refining businesses.
The petrochemical business reported record earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit), a measure of operating profitability, of Rs5,753 crore, an increase of 73% from a year ago. That was owing to strong volume growth and higher margins for some products.
The quarter marked the culmination of RIL’s expansion in its petrochemical business, said chairman Mukesh Ambani. RIL reported petrochemical production of 8 million tonnes (mt) in the December quarter, up from 7.5 mt in the three months ended September, as a new factory came on-stream. The segment’s operating margin widened 2.5 percentage points to 17.1% from a year ago.
At the Ebit level, the petrochemical business accounted for 57% of RIL’s jump in profit from a year ago. 
“The GRM (gross refining margin) is slightly lower than we have done (in the past). The story really is in Ebit for the petrochemical business,"" said Srikanth Venkatachari, the company’s joint chief financial officer. 
RIL’s GRM, or what the company earns from turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel, was higher than expected at $11.6 per barrel. That was a premium of $4.4 per barrel to Singapore’s benchmark margin. Analysts had expected RIL to post a GRM of $11.5. 
Average Brent crude price during the quarter was up 16.21% from last year at $66.87 per barrel.
The retail business reported a near-doubling of revenues and profits before interest and tax. 
“The core business could see volume-led and margin-led growth in the coming quarters as capacity additions in petrochemicals are almost complete and gross refining margins could improve due to changes in feedstock,"" said Deven Choksey, managing director of KR Choksey Shares and Securities. “Jio numbers show that it is the beginning of a big success story. Retail segment is also likely to perform well. Though the stock price has moved up, there is further room for upside because valuations of Jio and retail are not fully priced in currently.""
RIL shares closed at Rs929.35 on Friday, up 1.09% on the BSE, while the Sensex gained 0.71% to 35,511.58 points. The firm reported results after the end of trading.

877,2018-01-22,Reliance,"Fitch Ratings has called the current low telecom tariffs as 'unsustainable' and expects them to rise in 2018, as Reliance Jio switches gear from gaining customers to making returns from its investments

New Delhi: India’s largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel Ltd’s weak earnings may have marked a low point for Indian telecom firms, but some bit of pressure could lift this year as Reliance Jio-triggered market competition starts to ease, according to Fitch Ratings. 
New Delhi: India’s largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel Ltd’s weak earnings may have marked a low point for Indian telecom firms, but some bit of pressure could lift this year as Reliance Jio-triggered market competition starts to ease, according to Fitch Ratings.
The statement comes after Airtel last week posted over 39% fall in consolidated net profit to about Rs306 crore for the third quarter ended 31 December 2017. Fitch termed the current low industry tariffs as “unsustainable"" and said it expects them to rise in 2018, as Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd switches gear from gaining customers to making reasonable returns on its investments in the sector.
“Bharti Airtel’s rating headroom will narrow due to lower cash generation and high capex requirements in the financial year ending March 2018 (FY18),"" Fitch Ratings said in a statement. That said, Fitch pointed out that pressure on Bharti and other incumbent Indian telcos “should begin to fade this year"" as the competition triggered by Reliance Jio’s 2016 market entry begins to ease.
It noted that Bharti is committed to maintaining an investment-grade rating and intends to sell a larger stake in its telecom tower arm, Bharti Infratel Ltd, in FY19. In the last one year, it has sold 18.5% in Bharti Infratel for about $1.9 billion.
“We forecast annual negative free cash flow $600 million-$800 million during FY18-19, as Bharti’s cash flow from operations will be insufficient to fund large capex requirements,"" Fitch said.
Stating that the company has raised its capex guidance to bolster its 4G network, Fitch said that the proposal to allow telecom firms more time to pay for the spectrum they bought in auctions would “only partially ease cash flow pressures"".
Fitch predicts that Airtel’s revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will “rebound"" in FY19 driven by a likely improvement in the blended average revenue per user in the Indian mobile sector as data usage and tariffs rise.
Fitch said that the outlook for the Indian telecom sector is “improving"" and that the results in just-concluded quarter could have been the a low point for Bharti and other established players.
“We revised the sector outlook to stable in 2018 from negative in 2017, as we expect competition to ease now that industry consolidation is all but completed,"" it said. The industry revenue growth is likely to be in the mid- single-digits, after a decline in 2017."
876,2018-01-23,Reliance,"Reliance Jio reported a revenue of Rs6,879 crore for the December quarter, while Idea Cellular is expected to report a revenue of Rs6,700 crore

It’s been only 16 months since Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launched commercial operations, but it may have already overtaken Idea Cellular Ltd on revenue. The new entrant reported revenue of Rs6,879 crore for the December quarter. In comparison, Idea Cellular is expected to report revenue of around Rs6,700 crore, based on consensus Street estimates.  
It’s been only 16 months since Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launched commercial operations, but it may have already overtaken Idea Cellular Ltd on revenue. The new entrant reported revenue of Rs6,879 crore for the December quarter. In comparison, Idea Cellular is expected to report revenue of around Rs6,700 crore, based on consensus Street estimates. 
Idea Cellular had launched operations in 1997 and it wasn’t until 2014 that it reached a similar size in revenues terms. In other words, what took Idea Cellular 17 years to accomplish, Reliance Jio has done in 16 months. Even Bharti Airtel Ltd took around 13 years before its revenues reached Jio’s annual run-rate of around Rs28,000 crore in 2008. 
Of course, the incumbents started slow in the mid-1990s, when tariffs were prohibitive and volumes were low. It wasn’t until 2002-03, when the government started encouraging competition by granting new licences, that growth picked up. 
As such, some may argue that it’s not fair to compare Jio’s growth with that of incumbents. Besides, in the third quarter (Q3) an important revenue source for incumbents was hit, after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India cut interconnect usage charges (IUC) by 57%. Airtel’s India wireless revenues fell 12.2% sequentially, over two-thirds of which was on account of the IUC cut. 
Even so, that doesn’t take away from the fast-paced growth at Jio. Its investments—Rs2.15 trillion and counting—are far higher than that of Idea’s gross invested capital of around Rs1.25 trillion. They are even higher than Airtel’s cumulative investments of Rs2.03 trillion. 
The high investments have made it clear for some time now that Jio is in a hurry to capture market share. 
Still, its pace of growth has taken almost everyone by surprise. “Jio’s revenue outperformance was driven completely by higher-than-expected Arpu (average revenue per user) of Rs154/month. This was on the back of the October 2017 price increase and an increase in the proportion of subscribers opting for higher-allowance/Arpu plans,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients. 
Data volumes handled by the company are higher than all other telcos combined, analysts at JPMorgan India pointed out in a note to clients. “(This is something) we think must worry Bharti Airtel and the others... Jio’s data traffic of 4.31 billion GB in Q3 is nearly four times Bharti’s data traffic (1.1 billion GB), despite the latter having a subscriber base that’s 1.8 times higher,"" they wrote in the note. 
Jio told analysts in a post-results conference that the data and voice usage on its network shows that it is the primary SIM for most of its subscribers. 
Of course, it’s also true that large incumbents have maintained their subscriber market share despite Jio’s onslaught, which means that the new entrant hasn’t yet been able to wean away their subscribers yet . 
The company’s next stage of growth might depend on its success in dislodging these subscribers from incumbents’ networks. After all, while growth in Arpu helped Jio in Q3, this might not continue. 
Jio’s tariff cut in January and the many cashback vouchers it has issued since October 2017 may mean Arpu remains flat this year. Growth then has to be driven by increasing subscriber count. 
How Jio goes about this task is anybody’s guess. One thing’s for certain though: as Kotak’s note puts it, there’ll never be a dull moment with Jio around."
875,2018-01-23,Reliance,"Reliance Jio has enhanced validity by two weeks of its flagship Rs399 plan with 20% more data effective 9 January, it has also enhanced 1GB packs with 50% more data or with Rs50 discount

New Delhi: A recovery in India’s telecom industry, which showed some pricing discipline in the second half of 2017 after a bruising year-long tariff war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, could still be some way off. The company owned by Mukesh Ambani has returned to its earlier aggression in pricing to grab market share. 
New Delhi: A recovery in India’s telecom industry, which showed some pricing discipline in the second half of 2017 after a bruising year-long tariff war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, could still be some way off. The company owned by Mukesh Ambani has returned to its earlier aggression in pricing to grab market share.
While consumers would continue to enjoy cheap tariffs, older telecom operators, which are in the midst of a consolidation drive, would continue to see pressure on revenues and profitability.
“Incumbents’ move from a selective market share defence mode to a more aggressive one was met with an expression of displeasure from Jio in the form of fresh price cuts,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report dated 20 January.
“RIL (Reliance Industries Ltd, parent of Reliance Jio), in its third quarter analyst meet, was quite explicit about the thought process behind the price cut move—it will not let incumbents get close on the price-value equation and any such effort by the incumbents would be met with similar cuts,"" the brokerage said.
Reliance Jio, which offered free services for the first seven months of operations and started charging for its services in April, effected tariff hikes in July and October 2017, which led many to believe that the worst was over for the industry.
Earlier this month, Reliance Jio, however, enhanced the validity by two weeks of its flagship Rs399 pack with 20% more data effective 9 January. It also enhanced all 1GB packs with 50% more data or with a Rs50 discount.
“On our tariffs being reduced, people have missed the fact that it was in response to some of our competitors reducing prices. This has been very consistent with what we said — if someone matched our prices we will give 20% more value,"" Srikanth Venkatachari, joint chief financial officer at RIL, told reporters on Friday after the company announced its financial results for the December quarter.
RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani had said in February last year that Reliance Jio would monitor all publicly announced plans from all operators and not only match the highest selling tariffs but also provide 20% more data in each of these plans.
In the fight for market share, bigger rival Bharti Airtel too has clearly outlined its strategy. “The company will aim to get a disproportionate share of the 4G SIM slots in the market,"" Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal said in a post-earnings call with analysts on Friday. Pricing continues to remain depressed in the fight for market share driven by the new entrant, Vittal added.
Bharti Airtel’s quarterly net profit plunged 39% to Rs306 crore in the three months ended 31 December from Rs504 crore in the year earlier as it was hit hard by the telecom regulator’s decision to slash interconnection usage charges (IUC) levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks. Reliance Jio, on the other hand, benefited from the IUC cut, and reported a profit of Rs504 crore in the December quarter, a first for the company, from a loss of Rs271 crore in the preceding quarter.
Reliance Jio added a net 21.5 million subscribers in the three months ended December, compared with 15.3 million users in the September quarter. At the end of December, Reliance Jio had a total of 160.1 million subscribers.
“India’s market is price sensitive and has a low percentage of users who consume data. Given that operators would want to expand that market it is impossible to do that without more competitive pricing. Cut-throat pricing is here to stay and it will continue to be tough going for the industry. A serious revival of the sector could be a little distant,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India.
According to data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), as of 30 September, Bharti Airtel had 23.84% of the wireless subscriber base followed by Vodafone India Ltd with 17.53% and Idea Cellular Ltd at 16.07%. Reliance Jio’s market share is 11.72%.
If data prices remain at these levels, this would also mean that operators would have to look at other ways to augment their revenue streams.
“The current prices are the new normal. Operators can’t just rely on selling bytes and have to now look for more revenue sources such as content, Internet of Things, etc,"" Cellular Operators Association of India director general Rajan S. Mathews said, adding that “we don’t see another round of price war because tariffs are already at rock-bottom. The revival of the sector is at least 3-4 quarters away,"" Mathews added."
874,2018-01-24,Reliance,"Reliance AIF to raise Rs1,000 crore across both funds

Mumbai: Reliance AIF Asset Management Co. Ltd has launched two new equity-focused alternative investment funds (AIFs) across which it plans to raise Rs1,000 crore, a company executive said. 
Mumbai: Reliance AIF Asset Management Co. Ltd has launched two new equity-focused alternative investment funds (AIFs) across which it plans to raise Rs1,000 crore, a company executive said.
Reliance AIF is a unit of Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd.
The two new funds—Reliance Equity Opportunities AIF-Scheme 2 and Reliance Equity Opportunities AIF-Scheme 3—will invest in opportunities in the growing financial services sector of the country and opportunities generated by the large and working age millennial population in the country, respectively.
The two new funds follow the first Rs500 crore equity-focused fund raised last year by Reliance AIF.
“We achieved strong closing in ‘Scheme 1’ and based on the strong response we have received to our first scheme, we have launched the two new offerings. When we do a new theme, in our minds what is important is that it should be a secular story, a story that you have seen play out over the last, say, 10 years and which you believe will play out over the next very many years,"" said Shahzad Madon, head of portfolio management services and alternative assets at Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd.
The first theme that the firm tapped was about the move from unorganized to organized sector, a move which has happened over the last many years and will continue to happen over the next many years, he said. One of themes that Reliance AIF wants to focus on this time is the opportunity created by a large, working age, earning millennial population through its Reliance Equity Opportunities AIF - Scheme 3 fund.
“Twenty per cent of world’s millennials live in India and they form 46% of India’s workforce. So it’s a key demographic segment in our population as well as our labour force. And it is a large demographic segment that makes both decisions on consumption purchase and investments,"" said Madon.
The fund will target three key opportunity sets.
“One of themes is aspirational consumption across automobiles, housing, education, lifestyle, media. Second one is what we call financing, investing and protecting. Retail financing has boomed in the country and it is going to grow further. So are life insurance, AMCs and wealth management. Third is the fulfilment ecosystem. People want things ‘here and now’ and so investing in businesses that make that possible, which is digital backbone infrastructure, fintech, logistics and transportation,"" said Madon.
The millennial-focused fund is a multicap fund, closed ended with a duration of 3.5 years. Reliance AIF is targeting to raise Rs500 crore for the fund, with a green shoe option of another Rs500 crore.
“We have already started marketing this fund. We intend to do our first close by end of this month,"" said Madon.
The other fund launched by Reliance AIF—Reliance Equity Opportunities AIF-Scheme 2—will look to invest in opportunities in the financial services space.
“India is the best performing market over the last 20 years. Since 2004, the financial services benchmark has started. Since then the financial services benchmark has delivered 6% per annum outperformance relative to Nifty, which means that since 2004 it is 10.3x up versus 5.6x up for Nifty. Which means a very wonderful performing index has been outperformed by the financial services index,"" said Madon.
The firm intends to tap four major trends in the financial services space through this fund.
“One is democratization of banking services due to Aadhaar and the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana. This we believe will drive huge growth in retail and MSME credit. Second is creeping privatization, where we believe that private sector banks will continue to take more market share. Third is financial savings boom that will drive AMCs, insurance and wealth management businesses and lastly, housing for all, which will create huge demand for housing loans,"" said Madon.
Reliance AIF currently has assets under management of a little under Rs2,500 crore.
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in the Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case."

Mumbai: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), India’s largest software services firm, on Wednesday became the second Indian company to cross Rs6 trillion in market capitalization after a 17% rally in its share prices so far this year. 
Mumbai: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), India’s largest software services firm, on Wednesday became the second Indian company to cross Rs6 trillion in market capitalization after a 17% rally in its share prices so far this year.
On Wednesday, TCS share price touched a record high of Rs3,254.80 on the BSE, and gained as much as 4.89% in intraday trading. It closed at Rs3,174.60, up 2.3% from its previous close. TCS’s market capitalization is now Rs6.07 trillion. Since the start of this year, the stock has added nearly Rs1 trillion to its market capitalization.
Oil and retail-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd is the country’s first company to cross the Rs6 trillion market cap mark.
TCS is way behind global technology firms in terms of market capitalization. It holds the 17th position among the most valuable international technology firms.
Apple Inc. is the biggest tech company by market capitalization at $900.41 billion, followed by Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd with $814.89 billion, $708.97 billion, $656.57 billion and $573.94 billion, respectively.
Among all listed companies the world over, Reliance Industries is at 118th place while TCS ranks 119th in terms of market capitalization.
The recent surge in TCS shares was triggered by three large new orders won by the company since it announced its December quarter earnings.
The company said this month that it had won a $690-million, 10-year contract from a unit of British insurer Prudential Plc. It won two more than $2 billion, multi-year outsourcing contracts from television ratings measurement firm Nielsen and Transamerica Life Insurance Co., a unit of Dutch insurer Aegon NV, in December and earlier this month, respectively.
“The announcement of three big business deals is positively impacting investor sentiment,"" said Satish Kumar, research analyst at the fundamental research desk of Choice Broking.
“In addition to that, IT is only among the few sectors which offers value in this bull run with stretched valuations of many sectors. Further, IT companies are also likely to remain beneficiaries of the big tax cut in the US. All these factors have increased interest of investors towards the IT sector and a leader like TCS will attract customers,"" Kumar added.
IT stocks have been gaining since the start of the year after brokerage firm Morgan Stanley Research predicted that Indian IT services stocks may be set for a turnaround in 2018.
So far this year, TCS has advanced 17.56%, Infosys Ltd has risen 14%, Wipro Ltd 0.11%, HCL Technologies Ltd 14.4%, Tech Mahindra Ltd 19.35%, Mindtree Ltd 23.68%, Mastek Ltd 30.15% and Cyient Ltd 11%.
“Large cap stocks have underperformed the Sensex for the last three years. Valuations are at or below long-term averages and an improving global macro could spur tech spending, which could re-rate stocks, in our view,"" said a Morgan Stanley report dated 15 January.
The brokerage house has upgraded Infosys, Tech Mahindra Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd to “overweight"" as valuations are at or below long-term averages. The firm expects that an improvement in banking, financial services and insurance and retail verticals will help TCS and hence it upgraded it to “equal-weight"".
Of the 50 brokers tracking the TCS stock on Bloomberg, as many as 12 have a “buy"" rating, 28 have a “hold"" rating and 10 asked investors to sell the stock.
On 11 January, TCS reported dollar revenue of $4.79 billion in the quarter ended December, a 1% rise from the preceding three months and up 9.1% from the year-ago period. Profit rose 1.1% sequentially to $1.01 billion (Rs6,531 crore), up 1.2% from $1 billion in the year-ago period."

Recently, Reliance Jio also decided to offer 500 MB extra data to its subscribers using 1GB and 1.5GB per day data packs with effect from 26 January. Mobile data rates will see a further drop to as low as Rs2.7 per GB with Reliance Jio announcing extra 500 MB data for its users of select plans as part of ‘Republic Day offer’, as per a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report. 
Jio’s closest rival Bharti Airtel data cost per GB has dropped to Rs4 under its new schemes. The tariff of Rs2.7 per GB data is about 99% lower compared to Rs249-259 per GB charged by established big operators till August 2016—before commercial launch of Jio services."

New Delhi: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has moved the Supreme Court, challenging an order of the Bombay high court setting aside a probe against Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd, on complaints of cartelisation by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. 
New Delhi: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has moved the Supreme Court, challenging an order of the Bombay high court setting aside a probe against Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd, on complaints of cartelisation by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
The matter will come up for hearing before a bench headed by justice Rohinton F. Nariman on Thursday.
On 21 September, the Bombay high court had ruled that the CCI had no jurisdiction to interpret contract conditions or policies of the telecom sector, which was governed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) Act, 1997.
The order was passed on a plea by Idea, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) seeking quashing of the CCI order directing an investigation into allegations of cartelisation made by Reliance Jio.
Reliance Jio had questioned the jurisdiction of the Bombay high court and said the case must be heard by the Delhi high court since the CCI order was passed in Delhi. This was rejected by the court.

869,2018-01-25,Reliance,"Idea Cellular may have raised the white flag, but it's another matter if this will help, as the big boys, Reliance Jio and Airtel, need to call a truce

Among the telecom companies that have survived the relentless onslaught of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, Idea Cellular Ltd is the most precariously placed. Its pre-tax loss rose to 32% of revenue in the December quarter, and its Ebitda of Rs1,223 crore was barely enough to take care of financing costs (Rs1,149 crore). 
Among the telecom companies that have survived the relentless onslaught of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, Idea Cellular Ltd is the most precariously placed. Its pre-tax loss rose to 32% of revenue in the December quarter, and its Ebitda of Rs1,223 crore was barely enough to take care of financing costs (Rs1,149 crore).
Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. 
So it wasn’t entirely surprising when Idea Cellular’s management suggested on a call with analysts that it wants nothing to do with the latest downward tariff revisions. “We do not want to be a price warrior,"" Himanshu Kapania, managing director of Idea, said on the call. 
Explaining its latest tariff revisions, Jio said last week that if competitors matched its tariffs, it would give its customers 20% more value. Some incumbents had tried to match the company’s tariffs in the December quarter. 
A moot question is what happens if incumbents keep trying to match Jio’s tariffs. Almost as if he were addressing the question, Kapania said on the call, “We will keep a reasonable distance...we will be competitive, but we will not be a discount warrior."" 
Idea may have raised the white flag, but it’s another matter if this will help. The big boys, Jio and Bharti Airtel Ltd, need to call a truce. 
Meanwhile, relatively smaller companies such as Idea are caught between the proverbial devil and the deep sea. 
If they cut tariffs, it will lead to Arpu (average revenue per user) erosion and impact profitability further. If they don’t match prevailing tariffs, there can be subscriber and revenue loss, which will again result in profit erosion. 
In short, it’s clearly premature to call the December quarter as a bottom. Apart from the impact of Jio’s latest price revisions, incumbents will also be hit by a reduction in international termination rates. 
Idea’s only hope is that things reverse quickly on the tariff front. “We believe this is a minor aberration and should correct itself in a short period of time,"" Kapania said on the call. 
But it’s far more important what Jio thinks. “Investors believe Jio can out-invest its competition, expand the lead on data capacity and leverage its position to drive revenue-share,"" analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a 24 January note to clients. 
Jio spent Rs7,000 crore in capital expenditure in the December quarter alone, which amounts to Idea’s annual capex. 
Thus far, absorbing high levels of cash burn has been part of Jio’s strategy, and there seems to be no end in sight to this strategy. 
In fact, some analysts are wondering what exactly is driving Jio’s pricing strategy, considering that it is now the market leader in the mobile broadband category. Every pricing change in bundled voice and data plans impacts it the most. Whatever Jio’s motivation, the fact remains that highly leveraged companies such as Idea will be the worst hit by the tariff war. 
The company’s merger agreement with Vodafone India Ltd includes a clause that each company can only bring a reasonable pre-agreed level of debt (or a maximum leverage ratio, to be precise) into the merged company. 
With profits eroding at a fast clip, leverage ratios have gone haywire, and it remains to be seen how the two companies tackle this dilemma. 
Against this backdrop, it’s little wonder Idea is desperate for peace and wants the price war to end."

867,2018-01-26,Reliance,"Reliance Jio's new plan exclusively for Jio Phone users offers free voice calls and unlimited data at Rs49 for a validity of 28 days

New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd on Thursday announced a new plan exclusively for its Jio Phone users, offering free voice calls and unlimited data at Rs49 for a validity of 28 days. 
New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd on Thursday announced a new plan exclusively for its Jio Phone users, offering free voice calls and unlimited data at Rs49 for a validity of 28 days.
The new plan will be introduced on 26 January, the company said in a statement. Reliance Jio will also introduce add-on data packs for Rs11, Rs21, Rs51 and Rs101.
“Under the Rs49 pack, the user will get unlimited data out of which 1GB will be at high speed, after which speed will fall to 64 kbps,"" a person familiar with the development said, requesting anonymity.
“This (feature phone) market is primarily a voice market and does not consume a lot of data,"" the person said, adding that this tariff is likely to boost sales of Jio Phone, which has already crossed 12 million units.
Reliance Jio entered the telecom sector in September 2016 and has taken it by storm—first through its free services, followed by cut-price tariffs and then through Jio Phone, which the company marketed as an “effectively free"" 4G phone for a one-time refundable deposit of Rs1,500 and unlimited data and voice for Rs153 a month.
“Demand for Jio Phone continues to be very strong. All first bookings (6 million) have been supplied. We faced some supply constraints when we started out and we have overcome them. We’ll push the phones much more,"" Anshuman Thakur, head of strategy and planning at Reliance Jio, told reporters after the announcement of its financial results on 19 January.
Analysts say that this will spark a new round of tariff war in the feature phone market and will put pressure on other operators which are already witnessing stress on their revenue streams after Reliance Jio’s entry.
Idea Cellular’s quarterly loss more than tripled to Rs1,285.6 crore as the nation’s telecom regulator halved interconnection usage charges (IUC) and a tariff war sparked by new entrant Reliance Jio showed no signs of abating. Bharti Airtel also reported a 39% fall in December quarter profit to Rs306 crore.
Reliance Jio, on the other hand, benefited from the IUC cut as more calls originate from its network than terminate, and reported a profit of Rs504 crore in the December quarter, a first for the company, from a loss of Rs271 crore in the preceding quarter.
Reliance Jio added a net 21.5 million subscribers in the three months ended December, compared with 15.3 million users in the September quarter. At the end of December, Reliance Jio had a total of 160.1 million subscribers.
“Reliance Jio now seems to be aggressive in targeting the voice market. It attracted the top end of the market that is the data users in the beginning and will now attract voice users with this new tariff. This will hit Airtel and Idea, which have a chunk of customers in the low-end subscriber market, and were trying to get their users to move to higher-value packs,"" an analyst said on the condition of anonymity.
According to data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), as of 30 September, Bharti Airtel had 23.84% of the wireless subscriber base followed by Vodafone India Ltd with 17.53% and Idea Cellular Ltd at 16.07%. Reliance Jio’s market share is 11.72%.
After the Jio Phone launch by Reliance Jio, companies in the sector too joined the bandwagon with Bharti Airtel announcing bundled devices in partnership with device manufacturers such as Intex Technologies, Karbonn Mobiles and Celkon while Vodafone India tied up with Micromax to offer phones bundled with its mobile services.
“The only catch is that customers still have to pay Rs1,500 upfront for the Jio Phone. The company will have to look at reducing this amount if it truly wants the phone sales to pick up and meet the target of 500 million subscribers,"" the analyst cited above said."
865,2018-01-29,Reliance,"Reliance Jio will receive funding support from parent firm RIL, and Jio's fundraising plans may be finalized in the next few weeks

Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd will raise as much as $2.2 billion in foreign currency debt to fund the purchase of Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom)’s wireless assets, according to two people directly aware of the company’s discussions with lenders.  
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd will raise as much as $2.2 billion in foreign currency debt to fund the purchase of Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom)’s wireless assets, according to two people directly aware of the company’s discussions with lenders. 
While Reliance Jio hasn’t disclosed the value of the transaction to purchase RCom’s assets, the people cited above said that the deal would be funded through a mix of debt and internal accruals. 
Reliance Jio, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), will receive funding support from the parent, said one of the two people cited above. “The modality of the fundraising is being worked out and no decision has been made yet.""
While requests for comments sent to RIL remained unanswered until press time, a senior company official who did not wish to be named said that all necessary approvals for the RCom deal were in place and the fundraising plans will be finalized in the next few weeks. 
In December, Jio agreed to buy RCom’s wireless spectrum, media convergence node assets, 43,000 towers, and around 178,000km of fibre network for an undisclosed sum. The deal involves primarily cash payment and an assumption of the deferred spectrum payment liabilities of RCom to the telecom department. 
In a January report, rating agency Icra Ltd said that any additional debt due to the acquisition will not impact Reliance Jio’s credit profile given the strong backing of its parent. 
Till 31 March 2017, RIL had invested Rs45,000 crore as equity and Rs33,785 crore as non-cumulative optionally convertible preference shares in Reliance Jio. It has also guaranteed Rs19,232 crore of Reliance Jio’s outstanding debt in the period. RIL owns 99.44% in Reliance Jio. 
Reliance Jio turned profitable in the quarter ended 31 December, about a year after it started services in September 2016. It reported a profit of Rs504 crore in the fiscal third quarter. 
“Jio’s profitability is to a large extent related to its low costs since Jio needs to maintain a single 4G network, while its competitors have to manage 2G and 3G networks along with 4G offerings. Going forward, Jio will also benefit from the recent reduction in call termination charges by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India since a vast majority of calls terminate in rival networks,"" said Mahesh Uppal, founder, ComFirst consultancy, a telecom sector advisory firm.
In December, Anil Ambani-led RCom had announced a new asset monetization plan and its exit from the strategic debt restructuring programme. 
Ambani said that his company had agreed to a new debt resolution plan that will see RCom sell its assets—spectrum, fibre, telecom towers and real estate, apart from Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City—and does not entail lenders and bond-holders writing off dues or converting it into equity. Through this process, he hoped to cut RCom’s debt by Rs39,000 crore from the Rs45,000 crore it owed lenders at the end of October, Mint reported in December.

864,2018-01-29,Reliance,"For the third quarter ended December, Reliance Communications reported a net loss of Rs1.30 billion ($20.45 million), smaller than Rs5.31 billion a year ago

Bengaluru: Indian telecoms company Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) reported a narrower quarterly loss on Monday, as its move out of consumer business helped cut losses.  
Bengaluru: Indian telecoms company Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) reported a narrower quarterly loss on Monday, as its move out of consumer business helped cut losses. 
RCom, controlled by businessman Anil Ambani and once India’s second-biggest phone carrier, has faced a string of bankruptcy proceedings in recent months over unpaid dues. 
It owed banks $7 billion as of March 2017 when it last made public its debt numbers, and more to vendors.
To raise funds and help repay what it owes, RCom announced plans to sell most of its wireless assets to another carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd owned by Mukesh Ambani—India’s richest person and Anil Ambani’s older brother.
That sale is expected to be completed by March, leaving RCom focusing on its enterprise business of data centres and undersea cabling. 
RCom chairman Anil Amabani said on Monday the exit from consumer business has helped the firm narrow its net loss and the company expected to deliver better results in the future.
For the third quarter ended December, RCom reported a net loss of Rs1.30 billion ($20.45 million), smaller than Rs5.31 billion a year ago.
Competition from Jio had shaken up the Indian telecoms landscape with it cut-price offerings when it began operations in September 2016, that pushed RCom deeper into the red at a time it was already reeling under heavy debt.
China Development Bank, which along with other Chinese lenders is owed about $2 billion, agreed to withdraw a petition seeking insolvency proceedings against RCom after the asset sales deal with Jio was announced last month.Reuters.

New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Tuesday asked the Centre to respond to Reliance Power Limited’s plea seeking permission to mine coal from its two coal blocs in Moher and Moher-Amlohri in excess of the approved 17 million tonne per annum (MTPA) cap to run its 3,960 megawatt Sasan Ultra Mega Power Project in Madhya Pradesh.  
New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Tuesday asked the Centre to respond to Reliance Power Limited’s plea seeking permission to mine coal from its two coal blocs in Moher and Moher-Amlohri in excess of the approved 17 million tonne per annum (MTPA) cap to run its 3,960 megawatt Sasan Ultra Mega Power Project in Madhya Pradesh. 
Reliance Power argued that present cap was not enough to carry out operations till the end of this financial year and an additional 2 MTPA should be allowed tto avoid the “threat of a shutdown"". 
Sasan stated in its application that this additional mining would also help it to maintain an additional stock 1.25 million tonne of coal for meeting any exigency which might disrupt coal production, PTI reported. The application also claimed that a shutdown of the power project would result in a loss of around Rs130 crore for the company, while the discoms would have to shell out more than Rs200 crore to purchase power from other sellers to provide electricity to its consumers. 
The application was part of a writ petition filed by Reliance Power in 2015, challenging the Centre’s decision to cancel one of the three coal blocs, Chhatrasal coal block in Madhya Pradesh, allocated to Sasan. 
Comprising six units of 669 MW each, Sasan UMPP is the world’s largest integrated power generation and coal mining project, and Reliance Power’s flagship project. The power project aims at providing reliable and low cost power for 25 years to more than 42 crore people in seven states. 
The matter is listed for further hearing on 7 February before a bench comprising acting chief justice Gita Mittal and justice C. Hari Shankar.

863,2018-01-30,Reliance,"Reliance Jio appears to be going for the kill by trying to capture as much share of the market as possible within the quickest possible time

Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s latest tariff revision is the unkindest cut of all. The company is offering an unlimited voice plan to its feature phone users, with 1GB of data thrown in, at just Rs49 for a 28-day billing cycle. It had earlier unveiled a similar plan for smartphone users, with 2GB of data usage, at Rs98.  
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s latest tariff revision is the unkindest cut of all. The company is offering an unlimited voice plan to its feature phone users, with 1GB of data thrown in, at just Rs49 for a 28-day billing cycle. It had earlier unveiled a similar plan for smartphone users, with 2GB of data usage, at Rs98. 
Less than a week ago, Idea Cellular Ltd had suggested on a conference call with analysts that it will ring-fence customers who mainly use voice services and are light data users. But with the new entrant now targeting this very segment with extremely low tariffs, another bastion is set to fall for the incumbents.
Idea and Vodafone India Ltd are particularly vulnerable, as the former’s December quarter results show. And given their added burden of completing a mega merger, Jio appears to be going for the kill by trying to capture as much share of the market as possible within the quickest possible time.
An analyst who attended Idea’s conference call says, “You almost got the impression Idea was pleading with Jio and Bharti Airtel Ltd to end the tariff war."" But leave alone ending the price war, Jio is opening up new fronts. 
All this is happening at a time when Idea, in particular, is in a very precarious position. Its net debt-to-Ebitda ratio rose to an unwieldy 11 times in the December quarter, and while a sale of equity shares to promoters will help bring it down a bit, the company’s chief financial officer said on the call that leverage ratios will come to reasonable levels only when Ebitda is repaired. But now, Idea’s profitability will be wrecked rather than repaired. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities estimated in a 25 January note that the Idea-Vodafone combine’s Ebitda will decline by around 45% in fiscal year 2019, versus an earlier estimate of growth of about 20% predicated on rising tariffs. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. 
In fact, with Jio’s latest disruption, Idea may even struggle with its plans of selling additional shares worth Rs3,500 crore. And with incumbents expected to bleed much longer, it stands to reason that valuations of tower companies, an ancillary industry, will suffer. As such, the expected relief from the Indus Towers Ltd sale may also be limited.
In short, Idea and Vodafone seem to be cornered with high leverage, relatively low liquidity and cash flow limiting their ability to fight effectively and retain market share.
It’s important to note that while Jio is inflicting great pain on incumbents, it is doing this at a great cost to itself.
“This development (Jio’s latest tariff revision) smashes our earlier theses of Jio not launching plans below a certain monthly commitment,"" Kotak’s analysts wrote in a note to clients. Jio reported Arpu (average revenue per user) of Rs154 in the December quarter. Customers who avail of the latest plans will generate Arpus that are at a 71% and 41.5% discount to the current company average. And that’s not all. It has both lowered tariffs and increased data allowance for heavy data users. All other things remaining the same, this will impact Ebitda of Jio’s smartphone segment by around 37% vis-à-vis December quarter levels, analysts at Jefferies India pointed out in a note to clients.
In short, no cost seems to be too high in Jio’s quest to capture a majority share of India’s wireless market."

861,2018-01-30,Reliance,"Over the past six years, Reliance Industries has hired many expats to innovate and differentiate at the world's fastest-growing telco

Ask any Reliance Jio insider and you will be told Building TC-22 at the Jio headquarters in Navi Mumbai is where the action is. On the seventh floor is Mukesh Ambani’s desk— four feet wide, bare and with a telephone on it—one among 200 other workstations on the floor. 
Ask any Reliance Jio insider and you will be told Building TC-22 at the Jio headquarters in Navi Mumbai is where the action is. On the seventh floor is Mukesh Ambani’s desk— four feet wide, bare and with a telephone on it—one among 200 other workstations on the floor.
“MDA spends a couple of hours every Wednesday here,"" says a Jio executive. MDA is Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, India’s richest man and the chairman of the Reliance Industries group of companies. “I personally thought that this wouldn’t work for long. But it has. There is no hierarchy and it is a totally flat organization, very different from the refinery business,"" says the executive.
Why the open-plan office, especially for Ambani who spent most of his career in offices where business was conducted behind closed doors? “To retain talent,"" says a second person, a senior Reliance Industries executive. “As MDA often says, we are a start-up. We have to behave like one.""
Jio started operations just about 16 months ago. It sees itself in the digital business, not as a telco. Most of its people are in their 20s and 30s. And, its staff—with an unusual proportion of foreigners—are pushed to disrupt every aspect of a telco’s operations: the network, building security systems, devices, branding, consumer behaviour, etc.
This is the story of those expats and how they changed Jio’s fortunes and the Indian telecom business. Most of them were personally hired by Ambani and his lieutenants signing on the talent from across industries and the globe in the last seven years.
The second person cited earlier confirms that as much as 15% of the 20,000 people working at the Jio Navi Mumbai campus are expats—many of them in key roles. For the two months that FactorDaily worked on this story, Jio turned down its requests for meetings with any of its expats and attempts to contact them individually were mostly unsuccessful.
First, a quick list of the senior expats. Jio’s chief product and innovation officer is former Deutsche Telekom executive Rainer Deutschmann. Networks is headed by ex-Sprint chief technology officer Mathew Oommen, an American with Indian roots. Stratos Davlos, hired from Apple, heads platform and engineering and was instrumental in developing the Hello Jio voice assistant. Jordanian Tareq Amin leads tech development and automation. Caroline Seifert was its chief brand and design officer for a year. Janina Anjuli Schmidt worked closely with Seifert and now leads design. Chinese Shuming Li looks after all of Jio’s wifi rollouts. Marcus Brackebusch was one of the brains behind platforms and systems (Jan 2015 to May 2017). And Nikola Sucevic, a Swedish data scientist, leads data analytics development in area of radio coverage and capacity, machine learning, and telecom data mining.
This is just at the top. “There is a significant number of people at a variety of levels… from super senior most people reporting directly to MDA, to straight down,"" says keen Jio watcher Kunal Bajaj, a former director at Paytm and ex-India head of consultant Analysys Mason.
To be sure, this is not the first time Reliance Industries is working with expats. Even in Jamnagar, its refinery was set up by foreign experts with long years in the petroleum business. “The group has always worked with international people. With digital, it has grown further,"" says the second person.
FactorDaily interviewed nearly a dozen people within and outside Jio to get an understanding of how Ambani’s team of expats works and how it helped build the fastest growing telecom company in the world with some 146 million subscribers.
When Ambani decided to build Jio in 2011, he knew it had to be different from the very beginning if it was to disrupt incumbents. This meant going to the core of a telecom business operation: its network. For the first time, any telecom operator in India had decided to build a 4G network, primarily focussed on data. Even calls on Jio’s network would run on data.
Network fury
In a country just embracing 3G technology, Jio’s punt on 4G was amusing to many. Airtel, Vodafone India, Idea Cellular among others were still rolling out the 3G network and waiting for people to taste internet on 2 or 2.5G networks. To be sure, globally, companies such as Vodafone, China Telecom, and Verizon had started building 4G networks. But, nowhere in the world had a telecom company built an LTE-only network from scratch.
Jio did.
“Jio came in late, but it had an advantage of setting up a network that was futuristic. The Jio network is 5G ready,"" says telecom veteran T.V. Ramachandran. “Jio went on with deployment of 4G equipment, others thought Ambani was doing a mistake.""
India didn’t have much talent to build this network. Ramachandran explains that apart from makers of telecom equipment like Ericsson, Nokia and Huawei, no one was spending on building R&D around networks. “When you don’t have people in India doing that, the best thing is to get people from abroad to set it up,"" he says, adding that BT (the erstwhile British Telecom)—and now Jio—is the rare telco that does network R&D.
Ambani handpicked Oommen, who was earlier the chief technology officer of Sprint, responsible for network and technology development, systems architecture, and device development. 
Oommen had worked with Reliance Infocomm—the telecom services business that Ambani had started in 2003 but had to part with in a family business split with brother Anil—and it wasn’t difficult for Jio to get him back to India. “Oommen is one of the top five guys in the world in network technologies,"" says a person, who works closely with him. 
Oommen’s network team is from across the world. Jio has the largest fibre backhaul network; its radio network is wider than anyone else. Oommen helped design a network where everything rides on data, even voice. Hence, voice consumers only use 10-15% of the bandwidth, allowing Jio to utilize more of its network for data.
A senior executive of an incumbent operator says, “While we are deploying LTE network, 50-60% of our network utilisation is still for voice. Jio’s is much less.""
The network is key to Jio’s strategy and one of the four top differentiators it has to grab customer market share; the other three being cheap devices, a large family of apps, and low tariffs—these would be ineffective sans a data-ready network.
Oommen knew that. On the IP-based Jio network, the cost of servicing data and calls is as low as eight paise for a minute. For others, it is about 30 paise, but this includes the contentious 14 paise interconnection usage charge.
He continues to travel for a couple of weeks every couple of months. “He has a team in the US to do a lot of international tie-ups… who work on network innovation. His team here has a lot of expats – mostly people of Indian origin who wanted to come back,"" says the person who works with Oommen.
Once the network was in place, Ambani wanted to tackle the next big hurdle: devices. Even there, he found out that Jio was in a virgin territory.
Affordable=Mass Market
Early in 2003, months before the Reliance Infocomm launch, Ambani had asked colleagues at a meeting: “What is the cheapest cost of communication?"" 
“A postcard!"" he answered his own question. “That costs 40 paise."" The calling rate in an offer called Monsoon Hungama launched July 2003 was set at 40 paise a minute. 
In 2011, Ambani was following the same affordability playbook: 4G smartphones had to be affordable. He and a few others visited China and met with several phone makers. “Half of the world’s devices are made in China,"" says the second person quoted earlier.
Beginning 2012, Jio started sending a lot of people from Mumbai to China to put together the devices strategy and roll it out. The only 4G devices were from Apple and Samsung and they were very expensive and wasn’t fitting into Jio’s plan. “We were always thinking of hundreds of millions of customers and in that context LYF was created,"" says the second source. LYF was the initial crop of custom-readied phones for Jio, which then made way for the JioPhone.
The TC-22 tower was again the hub of Jio’s work on devices. A team of designers was put together from different countries: China, Germany, England, Israel and the US. The team spent an inordinate amount of time in China. Adding an extra band for 4G services to existing phones would make them costlier by Rs2,500-3,000. So, the team started designing a phone from scratch with partners in Europe and China. It took them a year to make it but they could price the LYF phone at Rs4,000.
Within months of launch in the first quarter of 2016, LYF captured 7% market share in smartphones in India, according to data from Counterpoint Research. By the third quarter, the phone was out of stock. “With the commercial launch of Reliance Jio service with attractive introductory offer, the LYF branded smartphones saw a sharp demand with reports of stock-outs at some locations,"" Jaipal Singh, senior market analyst, client devices, IDC, wrote in a report.
Soon, the market followed Jio and LYF and suddenly 4G smartphones were much cheaper. Between September 2016 and September 2017, the 4G smartphone base went up from 86 million to 178 million. Jio gained the most with its first mover advantage—from 16 million to 139 million—during the period.
But it wasn’t easy for the expat designers. “LTE is a very dynamic network. The networks are constantly optimising itself, and there are software-driven networks. There is no human intervention. That interaction with devices is constantly changing,"" says a third Jio executive, who is one of the expats.
A dominant share of new 4G additions was good but Jio realised that to attract a large number of users of feature phones, which typically are voice and SMS only, the Rs4,000 tag for new phones was too high. So, the design team, full of expats, worked on what would be called JioPhone—a smart feature phone. It was not easy. “We are not a devices company, we don’t make phones. But, the team figured the lowest we can go to give a smartphone experience,"" says the second executive mentioned above.
With LYF, Jio had brought down the price of 4G phones to a fourth of prevailing prices. With JioPhone, it further reduced the price to the level of feature phones.
Copycats followed quickly. Soon, every operator partnered with the likes of Micromax, Karbonn, Intex and Lava to make cheap smartphones and bundle them with services—India’s data world was being disrupted.
Disrupting the market
Finding people has become a little bit easier since the September 2016 launch of Jio. One big advantage that really excited a lot of people was the vision of Jio, which made people to come and work here. “MDA and (Manoj) Modi—they were meeting people personally. They have been the HR managers,"" says the second person.
During one such meeting, Jio hired someone from Apple to build the entire customer service and experience. FactorDaily is not certain about this person but it most likely to be Stratos Davlos, the head of platform and engineering.
“The user experience is from someone who has come from Apple. He built his team here and got more people from Apple,"" says the second executive, without saying whether it was Davlos.
Another Jio executive working closely with the team confirmed it is a 20-25 member team. MyJio was the first app that it started to build, which allows users to recharge their phones, track usage, get coupons, and gift vouchers to friends and family. MyJio, the company claims, is the fastest app to get 100 million downloads. The team didn’t stop there—it wanted to extend the same user experience to its cinema and live television apps.
“Unlike other telcos, integration of content and the network started in Jio from the very beginning… which is critical to deliver a seamless customer experience,"" says Mritunjay Kapur, a partner at KPMG India specialising in telecom, among other industries.
Once Jio had its pricing in place, it went after innovative marketing. It knew a single version of a campaign doesn’t fit all of India and so bought technology and language translation licences from SDL, a London-based company. “It was the first time any telecom operator was buying licences for the entire stack,"" says Richard Delanty, who worked closely with Jio and was the senior vice president—sales and operations at SDL.
Soon, SDL was flying people to Mumbai for large integrations. “Jio was running multilingual campaigns, but the entire workflow was automated, which gave Jio the ability to do multi-region rollouts at speed and scale,"" says Delanty. Once a campaign was designed in English, at the press of a button it would go to the translators and would come back after translation. Since the workflow was automated, there were no follow-ups and the campaigns would go to the respective regions. 
Tech: the holy grail
“The size, scale and speed of the network rollout was unprecedented… The availability of talent in the country wasn’t enough for something like this,"" says Kapur of KPMG.
For Reliance, it was important to collect a lot of network data, user insights and monitor the surges of usage. To begin with, Jio decided to get some people from the US, who had worked on analysing tons of data. In July 2015, Jio hired Nikola Sucevic, a ex-Ericsson executive with two decades of experience in telecom and data science. Others—Indians and foreigners— were hired from companies such as Microsoft and boutique data science companies. The data team has some 30 people.
On the network security side, the team is headed by a person from the UK, aided by four other expats. The information security function was headed by hacker Karsten Nohl, famous for exposing flaws in telecom networks potentially affecting millions of users all over the world, for three years until March 2017. 
Young and expat hires have changed Jio and Reliance Industries. About half of the people on the Jio Navi Mumbai premises come to work casually attired, as FactorDaily noticed on a visit to the Jio office late last year. Ambani, who continues to dress in his usual white shirt and black trousers, is often seen huddled with employees in jeans and t-shirts. “If you look at them you can’t make out that they are doing such serious work,"" says the second person, chuckling.
The casual attire was a big change within Reliance, so were Saturday holidays. “Now, even one of the canteens have started serving non-vegetarian food,"" says the second person. Jio employees go out in the evening to the gym or to play tennis and come back to work in shorts. 
Still, there is a problem: most of the expats don’t move with their family, as want to go back after sometime, especially if they are not senior-level executives. 
“The ecosystem for expats isn’t there. The [Reliance] group has a very good school, but then not everyone can be admitted. For expats to come and stay here, their lifestyle needs to be developed,"" says a senior executive at Reliance. “If you want a 25-year-old German to come and stay here, you either need to pay him a lot, otherwise he will struggle here.""
That’s a problem Ambani and Jio will have to deal with. Not everything comes easy when you are building a digital-first telecom services company in India—even if you have spent Rs2 trillion building it. Factordaily"
860,2018-01-30,Reliance,"Equity analysts tracking telecom companies, including Reliance Jio, Airtel and Idea Cellular, say the ongoing price war has made it impossible to fairly value firms

Mumbai: Less than a week after Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launched a Rs49 monthly pack for existing subscribers, equity analysts tracking telecom companies say the ensuing price wars have made it impossible to fairly value firms in their coverage.  
Mumbai: Less than a week after Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launched a Rs49 monthly pack for existing subscribers, equity analysts tracking telecom companies say the ensuing price wars have made it impossible to fairly value firms in their coverage. 
In a note dated 25 January, Kotak Institutional Equities said Jio’s “relentless aggression"" has left analysts with no fair basis on which to value stocks of telecom operators including Bharti Airtel Ltd – India’s largest telecom firm – and Idea Cellular Ltd – which is merging with rival Vodafone Plc.’s India arm. Kotak has dropped its rating on the Airtel stock. 
“At the core of all of the above is the biggest qualitative aspect we have no way of forming a view on, anymore – what does Jio want?,"" Kotak said in the note. “Even as the company’s actions thus far are suggestive of a drive to domination and willingness to be as aggressive as it takes to get there, our challenge is to figure out what level of domination Jio is seeking to achieve. All of this makes Bharti’s fair valuation a more-than-tricky exercise,"" it said. 
Kotak has revised revenue estimates for Bharti Airtel Ltd and Bharti Infratel Ltd, the telecom tower arm of the operator, predicting a drop in revenues of both firms between FY18 and FY19 year on year. 
This comes at a time when Jio is also rolling out 4G data at aggressive prices, undercutting competition in a bid to attract a larger subscriber base. 
“We wonder if the incumbents should seriously consider shutting down their 2G and 3G networks ahead of their current plans,"" the note said. “The ultra-expensive 900 MHz spectrum that the incumbents are using for 2G in several circles would fail the impairment test as 2G spectrum, in our view. This move would, of course, need the incumbents to roll out VoLTE (Voice Over LTE) on a war footing. Even if they don’t, we wonder if there is an economic case to keep the 2G networks running if the JioPhone sees even modest success. The MTR cut has anyway killed the incoming ARPU leg of the 2G network economics.""
This is not the first time that analysts have flagged off the spectre of price wars on the earnings of India’s telecom operators. In a note dated 24 January, equities brokerage firm Nomura said it was putting estimates of Bharti Airtel’s earnings under review, saying the firm’s ARPUs (average revenue per user) is already slipping back to levels seen before October 2017, before the industry took a round of price hikes. Airtel’s new data packs lower the company’s ARPU by nearly 29%, as per Nomura’s note. “Subpar 3QFY18 financials/metrics of the India mobile business and the mobile tariff revisions in January pose a risk to our forecast earnings for Bharti,"" the note said. 
“BHIN (Bharti Infratel Limited) 3QFY18 is expected to be weak with tenancy losses from Rcom’s wireless business exit and shutdown of operations by Aircel in six circles,"" equities brokerage firm HDFC Securities said in a note dated 8 Jan. “Further, as Voda-Idea merge their operations, their overlapping tenancies would get accounted as loading (6-8% rental/tenant) instead of separate tenancies. A potential reduction of 60-65k tenancies is likely from the merged entities. These could impact BHIN’s EBITDA (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization) by ~15% and EPS (earnings per share) by 25%,"" it said. 
“We expect EBITDA to decline further and likely bottom-out in 4Q (quarter ending March 2018),"" said equities brokerage firm JM Financial in a note dated 24 January. “We anticipate a 7-8% cut in our FY18 EBITDA forecast, and expect Idea stock to remain range-bound, because of renewed aggression by Jio (and Bharti). The promoters (AB Group, Voda Plc) may need to ‘signal’ greater commitment in our view, to pre-empt Jio/Bharti from pushing the industry into a war of attrition,"" the note said."

856,2018-02-02,Reliance,"But Reliance Jio failed to comply with the tariff reporting requirements to the Trai in respect of the 'welcome offer', says TDSAT

New Delhi: After proceedings that lasted almost a year, the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) on Thursday ruled that Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s ‘welcome offer’ and ‘happy new year’ offers did not violate rules. 
New Delhi: After proceedings that lasted almost a year, the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) on Thursday ruled that Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s ‘welcome offer’ and ‘happy new year’ offers did not violate rules.
While Reliance Jio’s offers were IUC (interconnect usage charge) compliant, non-discriminatory and non-predatory, the company had failed to comply with the tariff reporting requirements to the regulator in respect of the ‘welcome offer’, the order said.
In the 31-page order issued on Thursday, the tribunal also asked the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to issue a suitable order on benchmarks that can be applied for ascertaining consistency with non-predatory principles.
Trai chairman R.S. Sharma had said in an interview on 4 January that the regulator would soon issue rules that will define whether a particular tariff announced by an operator is transparent, non-predatory and non-discriminatory or not.
“We also observe that ‘all services free’ offer is an extreme form of below cost tariff and therefore rigorous tests must be applied for regulatory compliance. Till Trai issues the required guidelines, we further direct that no ‘all services free’ offer in any manner will be launched by Jio or any other similarly placed telecom service provider without making written submissions to Trai for self-check for consistency with regulatory principles of non-predation,"" the order said. Trai will examine these submissions within one week and convey its approval or disapproval within writing with reasons.
The controversy had started when Jio, which entered the telecom sector in September 2016, announced a ‘welcome offer’ giving free data and voice for three months starting 5 September 2016. Jio on 1 December 2016 announced the extension of these free services till 31 March 2017 under its ‘happy new year’ offer.
Incumbent operators had then contended that existing regulations stated that any promotional offer by a telecom operator must be limited to 90 days. Idea Cellular and Bharti Airtel had, over a year ago, had moved the TDSAT against Trai and Jio over the extension of free services by the latter.
During that time, Jio had written to the regulator contesting the view of its rivals and had said that its free data offer was not predatory as the company was not a significant market player in the cellular mobile services category.
Moreover, Jio had also told Trai that the second offer can in no way be construed as an extension of the first offer as current regulations consider two plans as distinct even if there is only a small difference in the terms and conditions. The ‘welcome offer’ was a fully free offer, whereas the ‘happy new year’ offer had a different data limit with the option of paying to avail of higher speed after exhaustion of the said limit, it had said.
While Trai had then ruled that Jio’s plans were not violative of current norms, it faced a backlash from rival operators. The regulator subsequently issued a consultation paper on “Regulatory Principles of Tariff Assessment"" in February 2016, through which it had sought views on the matter, including which tariff offers should qualify as promotional offers and what should be the features of such an offer, among others.
The TDSAT on Thursday ruled that the two offers—‘welcome offer’ and ‘happy new year’ offer were distinct. “A change in offer which is based on a rational reason (usage pattern in this case) and a rational objective (such as to fine tune data usage to reduce congestion) will distinguish one offer from another,"" it said in the order.
Stating that the reporting requirements by an operator for a tariff is central to regulations on tariff, TDSAT said that it found the reporting of ‘happy new year’ offer in order but Trai’s position on ‘welcome offer’ as untenable.
The tribunal noted that the start date of ‘welcome offer’ was reported to Trai on 1 September 2016 in which Jio listed a base plan with special benefits.
“This tariff which is filed as a plan voucher does not mention ‘welcome offer’...a letter dated 27 September mentions welcome offer but does not specify what it is...in a letter dated 12 October, Jio asked Trai to consider special benefits offered under tariffs filed on 1 September as promotional offer...since Trai accepted this request of Jio made vide letter dated 12 October, the best we can agree is that ‘welcome offer’ came into existence on 12 October,"" the order stated.
Reliance Jio did not meet the reporting requirements in respect of ‘welcome offer’, the tribunal said, directing Trai to take appropriate action for such non-compliance by Jio.
All operators are mandated to file their tariffs with Trai within seven working days from the date of implementation of the tariff. If an operator fails to do so, it is liable to pay Rs5,000 for every day of delay, subject to maximum of Rs2 lakh.
The tribunal also asked Trai to issue clear guidelines for performing self-check for consistency with principles of IUC compliance as open-ended provisions make verification of IUC compliance difficult.
IUC consistency of tariffs implies that the operator should be able to meet IUC expenses on a weighted average basis. Jio had argued that since its tariff composed of voice and data services, post the promotional offers it will be able to recoup the IUC expenses in a short period.
IUC is what an operator pays another to land calls on the latter’s network."

Guwahati: Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani on Saturday announced an investment of Rs2,500 crore in Assam in various sectors, including retail, petroleum, telecom, tourism and sports, creating jobs for at least 80,000 people over the next three years.
“Today I am happy to announce five commitments for Assam over the next three years. Reliance will invest an additional Rs2,500 crore to augment its presence in this market,"" he said at the inaugural function of the Global Investors Summit 2018 in Guwahati.
Under this programme, the company will enhance its retail division’s outlet to 40 from existing two, while the number of petrol depots will be increased to 165 from the existing 27, he added.
“We are also going to open new offices in all 145 tehsil headquarters across Assam. Our approach has always been to create sustainable livelihood opportunities and have generated 20,000 jobs in Assam,"" Ambani said.
 Assam has always been a low priority market for other telecom operators, but it is a ‘Category A’ market for Reliance, he added. “We now target to increase the sustainable livelihood opportunities by five-fold to 1,00,000 jobs,"" Ambani said. 
In the tourism sector, the company’s CSR wing Reliance Foundation will partner with Assam government to set up a centre at an university to promote “wildlife protection and eco-tourism"", he added.
“In football, ISL is a huge success in Assam. We have decided to establish a top class football academy in partnership with Government of Assam to produce global players from the state,"" Ambani said. 
Reliance Industries has become the largest private sector investor in Assam by putting in Rs5,000 crore over the last few years, he said. The company’s telecom arm ‘Jio’ has over 30 lakh users at present and aims to increase it manifold in the coming months, he added.
Complimenting Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal for organising the ‘Advantage Assam - Global Investors Summit 2018’, Ambani said: “Assam’s development potential is limitless. In 50’s, the state was a developed one with its per capital income more than the national average.""
The Global Investors Summit is happening at an appropriate time with the country also “rising under the leadership of a very popular Prime Minister Narendra Modi"", whose thrust on ‘ease of living’ is touching many other countries, he added. 
Ambani also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his government “presenting one of the best budgets in recent times"" by focusing on all segments of the society, including the farmers."

New Delhi: Reliance Communications has opposed the telecom regulator’s directive asking the company to refund unspent balance of mobile subscribers, in the wake of discontinuation of its voice services.  
New Delhi: Reliance Communications has opposed the telecom regulator’s directive asking the company to refund unspent balance of mobile subscribers, in the wake of discontinuation of its voice services. 
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is, however, of the view that the demand on customer refunds is fully justified as it pertains to premature closure of services by an operator, and therefore, cannot not be equated with general network port outs cases. 
A senior Trai official told PTI that since it is the case of a service provider closing services the “customers must get their unspent balance"". 
“The situation is not similar to general port out by a consumer, where consumer chooses the timing of porting out from one network to another network. Here, a service provider has closed services and therefore protection of consumer interest is a must,"" added the official who did not wish to be named. 
Reliance Communications (RCom) declined to respond to an email query on the issue. However, sources familiar with the development said that the service provider has shot off a letter to Trai arguing against the regulator’s 19 January directive on refunds. 
In the letter, RCom has cited the Mobile Number Portablity Regulations 2009 to highlight that the existing rules mention that the balance amount of talktime at the time of porting “shall lapse"", the source pointed out. 
“We regret to say that we are unaware of the exact regulation under which a provision exists for refund of balance amount of talk time on a mobile number being ported out for any reason whatsoever ... we request authority to withdraw the direction ... “ the source said quoting from RCom’s written representation to TRAI. 
Meanwhile, RCom is preparing another follow up letter to Trai where it has further argued that there is no precedence of customer refunds being sought in several other cases of operators closing down services in the Indian telecom market. 
On 19 January, the Trai had directed Reliance Communications (RCom) and Reliance Telecom (RTL) to refund the unused balance of their prepaid customers and security deposits of their post-paid subscribers and report compliance in the coming weeks. 
The direction for refund is “pursuant to closure of 2G/GSM, CDMA services and discontinuation of voice services in all the licensed services areas by Reliance Communications Limited (RCL) and Reliance Telecom Limited"". 
The move comes at a time when RCom has announced plans to sell its spectrum, towers, optical fibre network and other wireless assets to Reliance Jio, the telecom firm of elder brother Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries. 
The industry estimates the blockbuster deal to be valued at Rs24,000- 25,000 crore.

Mumbai: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has emerged as the sole contender to acquire a part of polyester maker JBF Industries Ltd’s operations in a transaction that will include its entire overseas operations and an upcoming plant in Mangalore, two people directly aware of the ongoing negotiations said.  
Mumbai: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has emerged as the sole contender to acquire a part of polyester maker JBF Industries Ltd’s operations in a transaction that will include its entire overseas operations and an upcoming plant in Mangalore, two people directly aware of the ongoing negotiations said. 
Mint had reported on 18 October last year that JBF Industries was in discussions with at least three potential buyers, including RIL, for a stake sale which could lead to a change of management control. The talks were being helmed by private equity fund KKR, which owns close to 20% in the company along with a part of the company’s debt, Mint had reported. Apart from RIL, the Indorama group and The Chatterjee Group (TCG) had also shown initial interest in JBF and conducted a due diligence of the assets, Mint had reported. 
“The contours of the deal have changed since the discussions commenced,"" said one of the two people cited above, requesting anonymity. “If the transaction goes ahead, RIL will acquire a controlling stake in the Singapore subsidiary of JBF, which owns the overseas assets and the Mangalore PTA plant, while the domestic operations of JBF group will remain with the promoters of the company"". 
JBF Industries was founded by Bhagirath Arya as a yarn texturising company in 1982. Since then it has expanded capacities in the polyester value chain. 
JBF group is the second-largest manufacturer of textile-grade chips and third-largest producer of partially-oriented yarn and biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate (BOPET) chips and films domestically. Additionally, JBF group is among the top 10 BOPET chip and film producers globally through its foreign subsidiaries that include JBF RAK LLC, JBF Global Europe BVBA and JBF Bahrain SPC. JBF group has six manufacturing facilities across India, Bahrain, Belgium and the United Arab Emirates.
JBF group is also commissioning a 1.25 MMT per annum capacity PTA (purified terephthalic acid) plant, which will be amongst the largest of its kind in India. For the PTA project, which will cost up to $750 million, JBF has raised external commercial borrowings (ECBs) of $464 million and received investment from private equity firm KKR, which has invested $150 million to complete the project. 
While requests for comment sent to the JBF Industries remained unanswered until press time, a KKR spokesperson declined to comment. An RIL spokesperson said: “As a policy, we do not comment on media speculation and rumours"". “Our company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis"". “We have made and will continue to make necessary disclosures in compliance with our obligations under Securities Exchange Board of India’s (Sebi) regulations and our agreements with the stock exchanges.""
In July last year, JBF began delaying servicing of its domestic debt on account of weakened liquidity position due to losses in overseas operations, higher finance costs and other operational delays in production. 
JBF’s total consolidated debt was at Rs10,848.53 crore as of March 2017. 
In August, a Reuters report said that JBF RAK, the UAE subsidiary of JBF Industries, was in talks to sell its plant in Belgium for up to €250 million ($298 million) in an effort to settle part of its debt. The report said that the proposed sale was one of a number of moves under discussion between the company and banks to renegotiate around 2 billion dirhams ($545 million) in debt."

New Delhi: Reliance Home Finance has posted a 100% increase in its net profit at Rs46 crore for the quarter ended December 2017 on higher income from operations. 
This is the company’s first quarterly earnings post listing on the stock exchanges earlier during this fiscal.

New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd posting a net profit in the December quarter, having launched commercial operations only 15 months earlier, is a bit too good to believe, global investment research firm Sanford C. Bernstein and Co. said in a 2 February note.
Jio’s reported profit is due to a unique approach to depreciation and amortization (D&A), which results in a significantly lower D&A expense than seen elsewhere in the industry and applying ‘normal’ depreciation metrics would imply Jio’s net loss would have been Rs2,410 crore in the December quarter, the research firm said.
The latest entrant in the telecom sector, Reliance Jio, reported a profit of Rs504 crore in the quarter, a first for the firm, as it benefited from the telecom regulator’s decision to slash interconnect usage charges—levied by mobile networks for handling incoming calls from rival networks—as more calls originate from its network than terminate.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had cut IUC to 6 paise a minute from 14 paise effective 1 October."

849,2018-02-09,Reliance,"With the 51% stake in Viacom18, Reliance Industries is now a serious contender in media and entertainment

Last week, TV18 Broadcast Ltd announced that it has taken operational control of Viacom18 Media Pvt. Ltd, an equal joint venture (JV) between TV18 and US-based media firm Viacom Inc. TV18 said it has increased its stake in the company to 51% by acquiring 1% of Viacom18’s equity from Viacom for a cash consideration of $20 million. That is not all. Viacom and Viacom18 have also extended their brand and content licence agreement by 10 years after the original 10-year agreement expired this year. 
Last week, TV18 Broadcast Ltd announced that it has taken operational control of Viacom18 Media Pvt. Ltd, an equal joint venture (JV) between TV18 and US-based media firm Viacom Inc. TV18 said it has increased its stake in the company to 51% by acquiring 1% of Viacom18’s equity from Viacom for a cash consideration of $20 million. That is not all. Viacom and Viacom18 have also extended their brand and content licence agreement by 10 years after the original 10-year agreement expired this year.
Currently, Viacom18 runs 42 channels in seven languages and has interests in television broadcasting, films, digital, merchandising and live events. In India, TV18 and Viacom18 also have a JV called IndiaCast for distribution of TV channels.
In 2016-17, Viacom18 had reported a revenue of Rs3,040.7 crore. Network18 Media and Investments Ltd-owned TV18, which operates news channels CNN-News18 and CNBC-TV18, had recorded a revenue of Rs277.3 crore in the December quarter, up from Rs254.7 crore in the year-ago period, according to a 31 January Mint report.
Interestingly, even senior executives at Viacom18 privately admit that the news of TV18’s stake increase came as a surprise. It was a sudden, albeit pleasant, development as it will have far-reaching implications on the day-to-day operations of Viacom18. An executive at Viacom18, on condition of anonymity, said that the step was a big deal for Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), which owns TV18. RIL now has a majority stake in the venture.
For starters, this means that decision-making at Viacom18 will be speedier. Earlier, for any decision taken by Viacom18, Viacom needed to be consulted as it was an equal JV partner. “Now there is only one driver in the driving seat,"" said the Viacom18 executive. Quicker decision-making may translate into greater efficiency. While TV18 is in the driver’s seat as the majority shareholder, it enjoys the benefits of Viacom’s pedigree, which continues to stay invested as a 49% shareholder and has agreed to share content for another 10 years.
Top Viacom18 officials refuse to share details on how the deal may have come about. However, it is possible that RIL may have asked for a controlling stake as it understands the Indian media and entertainment market better than its American JV partner. In any case, the Indian television channels in the JV, namely Colors, Rishtey, Cineplex and the Colors regional bouquet are outperforming the international brands such as MTV, Nickelodeon and VH1. According to media industry estimates, the Indian channels contribute between 75% and 80% of the total revenue of Viacom18.
As a controlling partner, RIL can fully exploit the synergy with its telecom brand Jio, which will have more content than any other telco. Media experts say that Jio and Viacom18 could script a very successful convergence story. “The two businesses complement each other and offer a strategic advantage. For RIL it is a fantastic decision,"" said the Viacom18 executive quoted above.
Since RIL likes to be a big player in everything it does, it may invest in and scale up the media and entertainment business, too. 
In fact, Viacom18’s expansion plans could get a boost. In an earlier interview, Sudhanshu Vats, group CEO of Viacom18, had said that it will launch a Tamil entertainment channel in the March quarter. Besides it had plans to move some part of its over-the-top video streaming platform Voot behind a paywall. “We will have a dedicated offering for kids—with more content, e-books and light gaming. That will be behind a paywall,"" Vats had said.
Viacom18 is not present in sports broadcasting. Although Vats had said that in India sports is largely cricket and cricket is a very high-investment, long-gestation game, last week he announced a tie-up with DSport, the sports channel of Discovery Communications, whereby it will telecast the Nidahas Trophy 2018 on two of its Hindi entertainment channels—Rishtey Cineplex and Cineplex HD. While DSport will telecast the cricket tri-series between India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka with English commentary, the Viacom18 channels will have the commentary in Hindi. Explaining the rationale behind the partnership, Vats said in a statement: “Sports…represents a sizeable opportunity, but the cost of entry tends to be prohibitive. It has been a white space that we have continuously been evaluating and this association with DSport to air the Nidahas tri-series provides us with a fertile testing ground. As we endeavour to test waters with our very first broadcast of an international sporting property, what better than a cricket tri-series involving the national team.""
With the 51% stake in Viacom18, RIL is now a serious contender in media and entertainment. Currently, among the major TV broadcasters in India such as Star, Zee and Sony, Viacom is last in the pecking order as far as revenue is concerned. But that may soon change.

847,2018-02-09,Reliance,"In Jaipur, a growing team of underprivileged women are driving their way to financial empowerment

Najma Bano’s life in Jaipur used to follow an even path. She would tend to her duties as wife, mother and caretaker of the home, as she had been taught to do. Her world encompassed the colony she lived in, a slum which, as a microcosm of the city, provided her with all she needed by way of emotional and social interaction. 
Najma Bano’s life in Jaipur used to follow an even path. She would tend to her duties as wife, mother and caretaker of the home, as she had been taught to do. Her world encompassed the colony she lived in, a slum which, as a microcosm of the city, provided her with all she needed by way of emotional and social interaction.
Little wonder, then, that she reacted with surprise when Radhika Kumari, who founded the Pink City Rickshaw Co. (PCRC) brigade, and her team of volunteers approached her with an idea. The PCRC is an initiative launched in practice last year by non-profit ACCESS Development Services, which works with women from marginalized backgrounds. 
To Najma’s mind, the idea was outrageous. They wanted her, a woman well past 40, reclusive and unlettered, to not just step out into the world, but drive an electric autorickshaw on the tourist trail.
I heard Najma tell her story in December at a women at work conference in Jaipur, sitting sideways on stage, her face often hidden by her dupatta. Her voice was soft, almost hesitant and shy, but she told us of her journey from reluctant trainee to confident trainer.
Once convinced she could learn what others could, she braved the training programme to master the vehicle that would be her passport to self-reliance. The hurdles of language; of interacting with “white men"" and tourists; of facing the taunts of autorickshaw drivers who felt women had no place in their domain—she overcame these one at a time. As her confidence and expertise grew, Najma was chosen to train newer recruits.
Like Najma, Anita Mahawar also drives tourists around Jaipur for 4 hours a day. Mahawar, who shared the stage with Najma, is in her late 20s, has a master’s degree, and experience of working as a home guard at Amer Fort. She finds her work with the PCRC more lucrative and empowering. “I told myself that if tourists can pay Rs1,100 for an elephant ride, they can pay us for a guided tour,"" she said. She said she could shout right back when taxi drivers hurled taunts at her. And as I heard her on stage, I did not doubt that.
Najma and Mahawar are two of the 50 women who are part of the PCRC brigade. The project has taken time to plan, but it is their first tourist season, so issues are still being ironed out. They are trying to see what to do in the off season, i.e. the summer months.
Radhika Kumari, who heads the organization, is enthusiastic as she talks about the PCRC, an offering she believes can be replicated in other cities. 
The autorickshaws, one of which stood outside the conference hall, are like roomy “convertibles"" that allow the canopy to be folded away on pleasant days. They are noiseless, and don’t emit the smoke or fumes commonly associated with three-wheel vehicles. The rickshaws come with ergonomically designed seats, mechanical improvements for greater safety, a locker for keeping clients’ belongings safe, a mobile charger, a water bottle/newspaper holder and city maps.
The look and specifications was the easy part, Kumari says. Getting the women to wear distinctive uniforms to stand out among other auto-drivers was not. Kumari chipped away at the resistance, taking her trainees to a mall, where they saw women guards in uniform, and realized uniforms could impart both authority and individuality.
It would usually take 10 hours at the wheel for an autorickshaw driver to make a profit. To make it a workable idea for women who had to run homes and would not be able to spare so much time, the PCRC came up with four tourist routes. Four hours on any of these routes would enable the women not only to meet their personal expenses, but make a profit too. ACCESS underwrites the expense on uniforms, battery replacement and other maintenance issues.
The more ambitious ones can do two such trips on some days, adding to their earnings considerably. The profits depend on each woman’s initiative. In addition, as most of their clients are high-end foreign tourists, they automatically get tips of up to 20%.
The women learnt quickly and progressed from using sign language to speaking a smattering of foreign language words, as Najma manages to do. The tourists do their bit too, using language guides, and, by the end of the trip, both driver and rider are happy."

New Delhi: Reliance Infrastructure (RInfra) on Monday said the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has approved sale of its integrated Mumbai power business to Adani Transmission in a Rs18,800 crore deal. 
RInfra and Adani Transmission had signed a definitive binding agreement for 100% stake sale of the integrated business of generation, transmission and distribution of power for Mumbai in December 2017, RInfra said in a statement. 
According to the statement, total consideration value is estimated at Rs18,800 crore. The transaction is expected to be completed by March 2018. RInfra will utilise the proceeds of this transformative transaction entirely to reduce its debt. This is the largest ever debt reducing exercise by any corporate. 
This monetization is a major step in RInfra’s deleveraging strategy for future growth. Reliance Infrastructure’s Mumbai power business (known as Reliance Energy) is India’s largest private sector integrated power utility distributing electricity to nearly 3 million residential, industrial and commercial consumers in the suburbs of Mumbai, covering an area of 400 sq km, it said. 
It caters to a peak demand of over 1,800 MW, with annual revenues of Rs7,500 crore with stable cash flows. RInfra will focus on upcoming opportunities in asset light EPC (engineering procurement and construction) and defence businesses, it added.

844,2018-02-14,Reliance,"About 90% of the increase in Reliance Jio's Q3 profit was on account of a regulatory win and savings from the IUC cut

Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd was in a league of its own in the December quarter (Q3). It reported a 12% sequential increase in revenue, much the opposite of the 12-13% decline in revenues reported by other large telcos. 
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd was in a league of its own in the December quarter (Q3). It reported a 12% sequential increase in revenue, much the opposite of the 12-13% decline in revenues reported by other large telcos.
What’s far more striking is the movement in profit share. While the incumbents—Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd—reported a sequential decline of Rs1,342 crore in Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), Reliance Jio’s operating profit rose by Rs1,185 crore.
Of course, there’s another less charitable league table Reliance Jio has topped—cash burn, but more on that later.
It’s worthwhile noting that about 90% of the increase in Reliance Jio’s operating profit was on account of a regulatory win and the resulting savings in interconnection usage charges (IUC).
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) cut IUC by 57% from 1 October, which also resulted in a sizeable revenue loss for incumbents. “That the incumbents failed to convince Trai on the merits of their stance versus Reliance Jio’s stance on IUC qualifies as a major setback, in our view. In the ultra-competitive battlefield of India wireless, covering all flanks is critical…incumbents’ inability to prevent regulatory shocks is disappointing,"" Rohit Chordia, an analyst at Kotak Institutional Equities, wrote in a note to clients.
Riding piggyback on the IUC cut, Reliance Jio reported a pre-tax profit of Rs772 crore in Q3, compared to a loss of Rs414 crore in the preceding quarter. Airtel’s fortunes swung in the opposite direction. It reported a pre-tax loss of around Rs933 crore for its India wireless business in the December quarter; in Q2, it had made a profit of Rs38 crore. Idea was already deep in the red and its losses expanded to Rs2,067 crore.
Any discussion on Reliance Jio profit must note that the company’s accounting policy differs significantly from peers. The new entrant continues to capitalize some of its expenses, and follows a unique depreciation policy, which analysts point out understates costs.
“Cash flow is probably better to look at and compare with peers; profit and loss statements cannot be compared when cost accounting policies are so different between Jio and peers,"" analysts at JPMorgan said in a note to clients last month. 
On this measure, all telcos are bleeding. But Reliance Jio is burning way more cash than others. The IUC cut helped cut cash outflow from ~Rs6,200 crore in Q2 to ~Rs5,000 crore last quarter. Even so, this is more than the combined cash outflow of around Rs4,200 crore of Airtel and Idea. Both companies cut capex to curtail cash outflow.
Reliance Jio’s high level of cash burn is largely because investments in its network are running ahead of others; but as pointed out earlier, it is also because of capitalization of expenses, which find their way into the cash outflow metrics.
With Reliance Jio having stepped up its aggression on the pricing front in January, the levels of cash burn will worsen for the industry in the March quarter.
Against this gory backdrop, it isn’t surprising that Vodafone and Idea are attempting to appease Reliance Jio with their post-results statements. “We will keep a reasonable distance (from Jio’s tariffs),"" Idea’s management said on a call with analysts, seemingly in response to Jio’s complaints that incumbents had dared to match its tariffs in Q3. Vodafone squarely blamed Airtel for the bloodbath and absolved Reliance Jio. “The competitive environment (in India) remains extremely intense, with the market-leader increasing the competitiveness of its tariffs, despite price rises by the new entrant,"" it told its investors.
Sadly for them, Reliance Jio seems to be in no mood to relent."
843,2018-02-15,Reliance,"An Airtel Africa IPO will monetize telecom firm's operations in the continent, at a time when it is engaged in a bruising battle with Reliance Jio in India

New Delhi: India’s largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel Ltd on Wednesday said the unit managing its Africa operations is considering a potential initial public offering (IPO). 
New Delhi: India’s largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel Ltd on Wednesday said the unit managing its Africa operations is considering a potential initial public offering (IPO).
In a stock exchange filing, Bharti Airtel said the board of Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) BV has authorized the management to begin non-binding exploratory discussions with banks and intermediaries to evaluate the possibility of a public listing.
“The above discussions are at an exploratory/preliminary stage and at this juncture, there is no certainty of any final decision or outcome,"" the company added.
Analysts believe an IPO will monetize Bharti Airtel’s Africa operations, at a time when it is engaged in a bruising battle with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in India.
The company, which is locked in a price war since the launch of Reliance Jio in September 2016, was hit hard when the telecom regulator in September decided to slash interconnection usage charges levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks. As a result, Bharti Airtel’s quarterly profit plunged 39% to Rs306 crore in the December quarter.
While revenues from India operations fell 11.3% year on year to Rs15,294 crore, the performance of its Africa unit saved some blushes. In constant currency terms, Africa revenues grew by 5.3% year-on-year to $783 million during the quarter compared with $744 million a year ago. This was largely led by strong growth in data and Airtel money transaction value.
“They have made Africa business profitable; so, the (company’s) plan is to get value out of it. In most markets in Africa, they are either number one or number two, so the valuation of Africa business will be attractive,"" a Mumbai-based analyst said on the condition of anonymity.
The company’s aggregate customer base in Africa too increased from 84.1 million as of December end from 76.9 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 9.4%. It offers 3G services and Airtel Money across 14 countries in Africa and 4G services in four countries in the continent.
“With sustained competitive pressure from Jio, Bharti Airtel’s EBITDA is expected to see further decline for the next few quarters. If their net debt to EBITDA ratio goes beyond three times, it could risk the chance of a rating downgrade. The valuation of Africa business may insulate the company from a potential rating downgrade,"" the analyst cited above said.
Bharti Airtel entered Africa in 2010 when it purchased Zain’s operations in the continent for $10.7 billion. Over the past few years, it has been trying to capture the African market through local deals. It has made three small-ticket acquisitions in Uganda, Congo Brazzaville and Kenya.
In October, Airtel inked a deal with Millicom, which operates the brand Tigo, to combine their operations in Ghana. After this deal, in December, Airtel’s subsidiary in Rwanda announced the acquisition of Tigo Rwanda Ltd, making Airtel the second largest telecom firm in that country.
“Airtel has taken proactive steps in Africa to consolidate and realign the market structure in the last few remaining countries where its operations are lagging on account of lower market share and presence of too many operators,"" Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal said in a statement on 19 December.
“We are also committed to the long-term viability of our operations in Kenya and Tanzania, to ensure that in 2018, all our 15 operations in Africa start contributing positive margins and cash flows towards a healthy and profitable Airtel Africa,"" Mittal had said then.
In India too, the company is taking steps to reduce debt. On 5 February, the company announced that Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (Singtel) will indirectly raise its stake in Bharti Airtel by investing Rs2,649 crore in Bharti Telecom Ltd, the promoter company of Airtel, through a preferential allotment of shares. The money will be used to reduce debt.
Bharti announced in December that it, along with another group entity, will sell a combined 20% in its DTH arm Bharti Telemedia Ltd to private equity firm Warburg Pincus for $350 million."

836,2018-02-20,Reliance,"Trai's latest order on tariff rules has given a green signal to Reliance Jio to continue with its promotional offers, but it will now face strengthened competitors in Airtel and the Vodafone-Idea combine

New Delhi: In the past 18 months, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has triggered a bloody consolidation in the telecom sector, forcing incumbents to either match Reliance Jio’s offers or exit the market completely.  
New Delhi: In the past 18 months, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has triggered a bloody consolidation in the telecom sector, forcing incumbents to either match Reliance Jio’s offers or exit the market completely. 
Among the last ones to exit the market will be Aircel Ltd, which, according to a report in The Economic Times, plans to file for bankruptcy at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
Reliance Jio’s entry strategy has already worked for Mukesh Ambani, with the latest data made available by the telecom regulator showing that its market share has doubled to 13.71% by December end 2017, from 6.40% a year ago.
Trai’s latest order on tariff rules has given the green signal to Reliance Jio to continue with its promotional offers. But experts say Reliance Jio will now face strengthened competitors in Bharti Airtel Ltd and the Vodafone-Idea combine. 
“Earlier, subscriber additions were equated with the success of the business. Now with consolidation almost over and with the three top players reaching a sizeable market share, the focus now must shift to retaining customers and how to ensure growth,"" said Amresh Nandan, research director at Gartner.
Significantly, Airtel, Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone India have retained their respective market shares, which implies that Reliance Jio has grown partly at the cost of these smaller players and largely by grabbing a chunk of the new subscriber additions to the overall base.
As of 31 December 2017, Airtel had 24.85% of subscriber market share, Vodafone had 18.2%, Idea had 16.83% and Reliance Jio had 13.71%.
“Operators now cannot rely on selling packets of data to individual consumers and will need to focus on ‘solution sales’ for enterprise businesses, apart from looking at 5G use cases—smart city applications such as traffic management, waste management, apart from telemedicine, etc.,"" said Rajan Mathews, director general of COAI.
With the advent of these new offerings, what could also work to Reliance Jio’s advantage is that it is the newest entrant in the sector.
“Networks that were earlier designed to offer primarily voice and data need to be transformed to offer these new products. To that extent, Reliance Jio, with a greenfield network, has an advantage over other operators who need to focus on cost effectiveness, put in investment in infrastructure and be willing to take a hit on Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in the short run to win the long-term battle,"" Nandan said.
This advantage would, however, be short-lived, with incumbent operators such as Airtel looking to monetize their assets, while the Idea-Vodafone combine gets ready to benefit from cost synergies once the merger is completed. Bharti Airtel is already considering a potential initial public offering for its Africa unit.
“A new incumbent always has an edge. But how long can this advantage be sustained? It will quickly be replicated by incumbents. Airtel, Idea and Vodafone, they all are catching up very quickly in the 4G rollouts,"" Mathews said.
What is, however, clear from the recent tariff changes in the past two months is that Reliance Jio will lead other operators in offering cheap tariffs. RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani said in February last year that Reliance Jio would monitor all publicly announced plans from all operators and not only match the highest selling tariffs but also provide 20% more data in each of these plans.
“Reliance Jio has 160 million subscribers today. Its internal target is 500 million. The price war will continue till Reliance Jio gets at least 35% market share. Also, with the latest Trai order on tariff assessment, the regulator has given a green signal to Reliance Jio to go ahead with its aggressive pricing,"" a Mumbai-based analyst said on condition of anonymity.
Trai, in an order issued on 16 February, said there was no need to place restrictions on the number of promotional offers from telecom firms as long as they were transparent, non-predatory and non-discriminatory.
“We expect it (Reliance Jio) to continue with brutal pricing and incumbents to match it,"" the analyst cited above said."
834,2018-02-20,Reliance,"Universal basic income (UBI) cannot come at the cost of existing welfare schemes and exclusive reliance on Aadhaar-linked cash transfers can prove to be short-sighted, says Carnegie India report

New Delhi: A universal basic income (UBI) for Indian citizens cannot come at the cost of withdrawing existing welfare schemes and an exclusive reliance on Aadhaar-linked welfare payments for cash transfers can prove to be short-sighted, says new research. 
New Delhi: A universal basic income (UBI) for Indian citizens cannot come at the cost of withdrawing existing welfare schemes and an exclusive reliance on Aadhaar-linked welfare payments for cash transfers can prove to be short-sighted, says new research.
The central design features proposed in the Economic Survey 2016-17 offers a weak foundation and implementing such a UBI scheme without deeper analysis or large scale experimental evaluations can produce underwhelming results, said the report, titled “India’s Universal Basic Income: Bedeviled by the Details"", by Carnegie India.
Authored by research analyst Saksham Khosla, the report observed that the proposed transfer is more of an income supplement and “the (economic) survey’s calculations incorporate neither the loss of consumption from withdrawing major existing welfare programs to finance a UBI, nor the transaction and transition costs of moving to a welfare system dominated by cash transfers"".
“Taking these factors into account is likely to result in an upward revision of the transfer amount and associated fiscal burden,"" the report said.
Critiquing the Economic Survey’s proposal to present India’s largest welfare schemes as candidates for replacement, the report said that “several such programs are intended to achieve long-term development goals and cannot be simply substituted by cash transfers"".
“India’s national food distribution and public works programs, which the survey singles out for their high levels of misallocation and leakage, have improved significantly over the past decade in terms of their coverage and targeting efficiency,"" it added.
Instead of an exclusive reliance on the survey’s proposed methods for financing, targeting, and distributing a UBI, the report suggested to the government to run one or several large-scale experimental evaluations as done in countries like Canada and Finland.
“By determining the impact on both the government (state and fiscal capacity) and citizens (economic and social outcomes), such trials can generate new empirical evidence to inform the growing UBI debate and reveal the most effective role for unconditional transfers in India’s welfare architecture,"" the report said.
The Economic Survey 2016-17 had estimated that an annual transfer of Rs7,620 per person per year to 75% of India’s population will push all but India’s absolute poorest above the 2011-12 Tendulkar poverty line. True universality will be costly—politically and fiscally—the survey had said, calculating the cost of a targeted UBI (to 75% of the population) at 4.9% of the GDP.
“I think the most important question is whether UBI will be additional to existing schemes or replace them,"" said former rural development secretary N.C. Saxena. “If it is additional, we will need Rs80,000 crore. Where is this going to come from? If it is replacing schemes like food subsidies, the government will have to weigh the consequences because doing away with food subsidy is a big political decision,"" he added."
833,2018-02-20,Reliance,"A plea by Trai to SC, claiming  'exclusive jurisdiction' on telecom sector, has pitched it against the competition panel, escalating a turf war in the sector grappling with uncertainty since the launch of Reliance Jio

New Delhi/Mumbai: Richest Indian Mukesh Ambani’s telecom debut now has the nation’s regulators facing off in the Supreme Court. 
New Delhi/Mumbai: Richest Indian Mukesh Ambani’s telecom debut now has the nation’s regulators facing off in the Supreme Court.
A plea by India’s telecom regulator to the apex court, claiming it has “exclusive jurisdiction"" on the sector, has pitched it against the nation’s antitrust agency, escalating the turf war in a sector grappling with uncertainty since Ambani launched Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. with free offerings in 2016.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) filed the application before the country’s top court to oppose attempts by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to investigate allegations by Reliance Jio against its three largest rivals. The apex court said it will start hearing the case on Tuesday.
The quarrelling regulators risk worsening the disruption in India’s telecom sector, where Jio has stoked a price war since its entry, hurting profits at even the biggest operators while smaller ones have chosen to exit or merge. In the midst of this, Ambani’s telecom unit has emerged as India’s fourth-largest carrier and reported its first-ever quarterly profit within 16 months of starting operations.
Rivals have complained of predatory pricing. Jio, in turn, has accused three incumbent operators — Bharti Airtel Ltd., Vodafone India and Idea Cellular Ltd. — of anti-competitive behaviour aimed at blocking its entry and hindering its services. The fight is so intense that Kotak Securities Ltd. stopped coverage on Bharti last month saying it can’t value the company anymore as it’s not sure how far Jio will go to establish its dominant position.
The Competition Commission moved the Supreme Court in December claiming it has the right to investigate Jio’s allegations. Its probe was last year halted by a lower court.
Any dispute pertaining to anti-competitive practice or abuse of a dominant position in the market fell within its “exclusive domain,"" the antitrust regulator said in its petition to the top court, “regardless of the existence of a sectoral regulator."" Bloomberg"
835,2018-02-21,Reliance,"The move comes after HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius), a minority shareholder in Reliance Infratel, approached NCLT seeking redress

Mumbai: Reliance Infratel Ltd, the telecom tower arm of Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), has agreed to share details of a deal to sell its assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, a firm controlled by elder brother Mukesh Ambani, after minority shareholder HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd approached the National Company Law Tribunal seeking redress.  
Mumbai: Reliance Infratel Ltd, the telecom tower arm of Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), has agreed to share details of a deal to sell its assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, a firm controlled by elder brother Mukesh Ambani, after minority shareholder HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd approached the National Company Law Tribunal seeking redress. 
HSBC Daisy had approached the Mumbai bench of NCLT in October 2016 under sections 397 and 398 over the oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement.
On Monday, the counsels representing Reliance Infratel told the tribunal they are willing to share details of the deal with Reliance Jio with the shareholders, with two caveats. 
One, the investors can’t disclose these details anywhere in any manner, and two, if they wish to argue about deal-related details, they will have to do it in the chamber of the presiding officer rather than in open court.
“They had agreed to keep us informed about any decision they take about the company and now we are here,"" argued Iqbal Chagla, a senior counsel representing HSBC Daisy Investments in the matter. “Earlier, there were four attempts by the firm to either sell the assets or merge it with the RCom. Fairness demands that they need to buy us out at the market rates or give us an exit.""
RCom and Reliance Jio have not disclosed the valuation of the deal.
“When we asked them what happens to the firm where we had invested? It becomes defunct since all those assets will get sold to Reliance Jio. You have taken my money and now you are doing everything because of majority,"" said Chagla.
HSBC Daisy Investment had invested around Rs1,100 crore in July 2007 for about 5% stake in the firm which is now reduced to 4.26%.
Countering this, senior advocate U.K. Chaudhary, who appeared for the Anil Ambani-controlled firm, argued the petitioner is merely arm-twisting the firm. “This is not a loan that needs to be given back, but this is equity infusion which is irretrievable. They are investors and not borrowers and they knew where they are investing. Now, the value of their share is not over Rs400 crore.""
“It’s their commercial investment that has gone wrong and they being 5% equity holder they are suffering, we are also suffering being 95% equity holders,"" argued Chaudhary.
Also, senior counsel Birendra Saraf, appearing for the joint lenders’ forum, argued RCom’s assets, including the tower business, are a pledge and the entire plan was monitored by the lenders; hence, nobody can see any asset in isolation.
Email queries to RCom and Reliance Jio did not elicit any response till the time of filing the report. 
After hearing the arguments from offshore investors, Reliance Infratel as well as the counsel of the joint lender forum, the court posted the matter for 27 February. 
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in the Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case."

Jio, which entered the telecom sector in September 2016 and took the sector by storm with free offerings and rock-bottom tariffs, also fetched the top rank in “Most Innovative Companies in India"", the statement said.
With this, the company joins the list of other leading global companies such as Netflix, Tencent, Amazon, The Washington Post, Marvel Studios, SpaceX, Spotify and Walmart.
The list was curated from Fast Company’s Top 10 lists, which monitors companies across 36 categories.
The Mukesh Ambani-backed company, which, unlike its rivals, offers only 4G services, is already seeing returns from its aggressive pricing strategy with the latest data made available by the telecom regulator showing that its market share has doubled to 13.71% by December 2017, from 6.40% a year ago.
Its rivals in India, however, still have more market share. Airtel had 24.85% of subscriber market share, Vodafone had 18.2% and Idea had 16.83% as of 31 December 2017.
But Jio has still managed to dent margins of other operators. While Idea Cellular Ltd’s loss for the December quarter more than tripled to Rs1,285.6 crore as the nation’s telecom regulator halved interconnection usage charges (IUC) and a tariff war sparked by Reliance Jio showed no signs of abating, Bharti Airtel too reported a 39% fall in December quarter profit to Rs306 crore.
Reliance Jio, on the other hand, benefited from the IUC cut as more calls originate from its network than terminate, and reported a profit of Rs504 crore in the December quarter, a first for the company, from a loss of Rs271 crore in the preceding quarter.
To boost innovation, its parent company Reliance Industries Ltd has also partnered with The World Economic Forum to set up a new centre for the “fourth industrial revolution"" in Mumbai, to create opportunities in areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, internet of things (IoT) and blockchain technology.
The new centre aims to allow policymakers in India to look at new forms of governance and new technology applications, and connect with cutting-edge technology innovators globally, the company said in a statement last month."

New Delhi: The battle in the telecom sector has taken another ugly turn with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd asking industry body Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) to immediately cease and desist from publishing false and defamatory imputations against Reliance Jio and issue a public apology.
This comes after COAI, in a press statement dated 20 February, said that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai’s) recent orders, including the latest tariff order amendment, “seem to be strengthening the ambitions of one particular operator with deep pockets and monopolistic designs at the expense of other operators"".
In a letter dated 22 February and addressed to COAI director general Rajan S.

Reliance Jio also claimed that COAI did not reach out to it for its views on the statement, despite it being a core member, and said “a body which had once emerged as the official voice of the Indian telecom industry, is now reduced to becoming an instrument and mouthpiece of Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea"".
In the letter, Reliance Jio asked COAI and Mathews to issue a public apology and appropriate clarification through a separate press statement within 48 hours of receipt of the letter.
Mathews could not be immediately reached for comment.
Since the entry of Reliance Jio, the telecom sector has been beset with controversy—from operators sparring over network testing norms to provision of points of interconnection (PoIs) and, more recently, the cut in interconnection usage charges (IUC).
The latest war of words erupted after Trai issued new norms on tariffs on 16 February under which the regulator can examine the tariffs of a significant market player, which is an operator holding a share of at least 30% of total activity in a relevant market, to determine the existence of predatory pricing. If the relevant tariff is found predatory, an operator will be liable to pay a penalty of up to Rs50 lakh per tariff plan per licensed service area.
Incumbent operators claim that the change in Trai’s definition of a significant market player will result in an unfair advantage to Reliance Jio. The new definition of “total activity"" is based on any of two parameters—subscriber base and gross revenue—while the earlier definition included subscriber base, turnover, switching capacity and volume of traffic.
“These parameters were a part of Trai’s own criteria in the past. As a result, victims have now been made the perpetrators. In a cruel twist of fate, one operator who by its own admission is the world’s largest data network may be free to offer any sort of predatory tariffs while older operators are now subject to regulation and cannot compete without falling foul of a new definition of what constitutes predatory pricing,"" the statement by COAI said.
According to data from Trai, as of 31 December 2017, Airtel had 24.85% of subscriber market share, Vodafone had 18.2%, Idea Cellular 16.83% and Reliance Jio 13.71%.
As far as revenue market share is concerned, as of 31 December, Airtel had 27.96% of revenue market share, followed by Vodafone India (20.65%), Reliance Jio (19.74%), and Idea Cellular (17.33%), data compiled by BloombergQuint showed.
Under the new Trai rules, the proposed merged entity of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular may result in accounting for more than 30% of the total activity and hence could potentially become a significant market player in a particular relevant market. Reliance Jio, at 13.71% subscriber market share and 19.74% revenue market share is far from the significant market player definition.
“Trai has effectively snatched the operators’ right to compete in the market. In effect, older operators will now be challenged on the basis of revised definition of significant market player so as to be prevented from responding to what may be actual predatory tariff plans,"" COAI said in the letter."
828,2018-02-24,Reliance,"COAI responds to Reliance Jio, says its 'differences' are with Trai's orders, not with a specific operator

New Delhi: Industry body Cellular Operators Association of India’s on Saturday returned fire in the ongoing stand off with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, saying its “differences"" are with regulator Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s orders, not with a specific operator, and it is duty-bound as an association to raise concerns on growth of the sector.  
New Delhi: Industry body Cellular Operators Association of India’s on Saturday returned fire in the ongoing stand off with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, saying its “differences"" are with regulator Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s orders, not with a specific operator, and it is duty-bound as an association to raise concerns on growth of the sector. 
The rebuttal comes after Reliance Jio termed as “defamatory"" and “malicious"" recent allegations by the COAI that indicated that orders by the Trai are favouring the newcomer. “Our differences are with the orders of the regulator and not with any specific operator. Our intention is not to aggrieve any particular operator. Individual operators are free to pursue the interests of their own company vigorously under the framework of the laws of the land,"" COAI director general, Rajan S. Mathews said in a statement.
Incidentally, Jio has demanded that both COAI and Mathews tender public apology within 48 hours over the industry body’s allegations dated 20 February. COAI statement on Saturday further said, “However, the regulator’s role is to ensure the competing claims of companies are appropriately handled in the interest of the entire industry. This is the mandate of the TRAI Act, which specifically tasks it with ensuring the orderly growth of the industry."" 
COAI emphasised that as an industry body it raises concerns over various issues. “ ...we raise our concerns, as any relevant Industry association should, for the growth and development of the sector and in the interest of the nation,"" COAI said. 
The association argued that all its “other"" member operators are unanimous in their support of COAI’s position “with absolutely no exceptions"".
Reliance Jio—which is also a member of COAI—had on Friday claimed it was kept in the dark about the release issued by the trade body. On Friday, billionaire Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Jio had also launched a scathing attack on COAI, saying the body has become a mouthpiece of incumbents like Bharti Airtel Ltd and is issuing “defamatory"" and “malicious"" statements on Trai favouring it. 
COAI issued a “motivated"" press statement earlier this week alleging that the regulator Trai was favouring the new operator, Jio had accused, adding that such remarks were meant to “devalue the esteem, regard and confidence enjoyed by Jio"" and cause injury to its reputation. Jio had warned that it “reserves its rights to initiate criminal and civil defamation proceedings, including damages, against both COAI and incumbent dominant operators (IDOs)"". 
The full-blown war of words has erupted in the sector after COAI alleged that Trai’s regulations, including its rules and definition of predatory pricing, had distorted the market. COAI had also alleged that the orders appeared “to be strengthening the ambitions of one particular operator with deep pockets and monopolistic designs at the expense of other operators"" although it did not name Reliance Jio which has hit the incumbent operators hard by its aggressive pricing of mobile and data services."
827,2018-02-25,Reliance,"Reliance will invest about Rs37,000 crore in an oil and gas venture in Andhra Pradesh and another Rs15,000 crore in an electronics manufacturing plant near Tirupati

Visakhapatnam: Giving a boost to Andhra Pradesh in its efforts to garner big ticket investments that could spur job creation, Reliance Industries Limited on Sunday inked two agreements with the state government promising a total investment of Rs52,000 crore in oil and gas and electronics sectors.  
Visakhapatnam: Giving a boost to Andhra Pradesh in its efforts to garner big ticket investments that could spur job creation, Reliance Industries Limited on Sunday inked two agreements with the state government promising a total investment of Rs52,000 crore in oil and gas and electronics sectors. 
The memorandum of understandings (MoU) were a follow-up action to the meeting Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) chairman Mukesh Ambani had with chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati on 13 February. 
Reliance will invest about $6 billion (Rs37,000 crore) in an oil and gas venture in AP and another Rs15,000 crore in an electronics manufacturing plant near Tirupati. These ventures are expected to create 25,000 jobs over the next few years, the chief minister announced on Sunday. 
The MoUs were signed by Reliance president Kiran Thomas and AP government’s principal secretaries Ajay Jain and K. Vijayanand in the presence of Chandrababu Naidu on the second day of the Partnership Summit in Visakhapatnam. 
Reliance, in association with BP International, plans to develop offshore gas infrastructure in the Krishna-Godavari Basin in East Godavari district. No more details of the proposed projects have been officially announced. Reliance is already into gas exploration from its D6 block in the KG Basin near Kakinada. 
Reliance Jio, on the other hand, will establish an electronics manufacturing park near Tirupati in Chittoor district to manufacture mobile phones and set-top boxes. The Indian industry major will set up the facility on a 150 acre site, a senior official said. As a pre-condition to setting up the electronics manufacturing park, Mukesh Ambani, during his meeting with the chief minister, wanted the state government to promote clusters of educational institutions like ITIs and diploma colleges in the vicinity to create employment right after education, another senior official said.
He also asked the government to develop a workmen housing corridor in the vicinity of Tirupati growth corridor. The state government is yet to respond to Ambani’s requests, the official maintained."

New Delhi: A government oversight panel headed by directorate general of hydrocarbons (DGH) on Monday approved Rs40,000 crore ($4 billion) investment plan of Reliance Industries and BP plc for developing three sets of natural gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal.  
New Delhi: A government oversight panel headed by directorate general of hydrocarbons (DGH) on Monday approved Rs40,000 crore ($4 billion) investment plan of Reliance Industries and BP plc for developing three sets of natural gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal. 
The finds will add around 20 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) of peak production, according to BP. “Managing committee has today approved 3 FDPs (field development plans) in block KG-DWN-98/3 which will bring an envisaged capex investment of around $4 billion (Rs26,000 crore) in the prolific eastern offshore of India,"" the directorate general of hydrocarbons (DGH) tweeted. 
RIL is the operator of block KG-DWN-98/3 or KG-D6 while UK’s BP Plc has 30% interest and Niko Resources of Canada the remaining 10%. Reached for comments, BP India spokesperson said these FDPs pertain to satellite cluster fields and MJ (D55) deep discovery. Separate FDPs for MJ as well as a set of six satellite fields and that for R-Series discovery were approved by the management committee (MC), on which the oil ministry also has a representative. 
The three set of discoveries are ones that the partners are focusing on reviving the flagging output at KG-D6. MC is the final approving authority after which the companies start investing. RIL and BP had in mid-June last year announced investing Rs40,000 crore in the three sets of finds to reverse the flagging production in KG-D6 block. 
These finds were “expected to bring a total 30-35 million cubic metres (1 billion cubic feet) of gas a day new domestic gas production on stream, phased over 2020-2022,"" the BP spokesperson said citing the statement issued in June last year. MJ gas find is located about 2,000 metres directly below the currently producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields in the eastern offshore KG-D6 block and is estimated to hold a minimum of 0.988 Trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of contingent resource. 
People familiar with the matter said a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) will be used to bring the gas to the surface, treat it and pump it to the pipeline system that will take it to the shore. In May 2013, RIL, BP and Niko Resources of Canada had struck a 155-metres thick gas condensate column in the exploration well KGD6-MJ1, which was later named as D55 or MJ-1 discovery. 
Besides MJ-1, four deepsea satellite gas discoveries—D-2, 6, 19 and 22 are planned to be developed together with D29 and D30 finds on the block. The third set is the D-34 or R-Series find. The government had in 2012 approved a $1.529 billion plan to produce 10.36 mmscmd of gas from four satellite fields of block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) by 2016-17. 
The four fields have 617 billion cubic feet of reserves and can produce gas for eight years. However, the companies did not begin the investment citing uncertainty over gas pricing. Now that the government has allowed a higher gas price of $6.3 per million British thermal unit for yet-to-be- developed gas finds in difficult areas like the deep sea, RIL and BP have decided to take up their development. 
This rate compares with $2.89 per mmBtu for currently producing fields. People with knowledge of the matter said these four finds have now been clubbed together with D29 and D30 discoveries, which had been held up over conformity tests. A revised integrated FDP the four satellite and the two other finds was approved by MC. RIL-BP kept the $3.18 billion investment plan for D-34 or R-Series gas field in the same block, which was approved in August 2013. 
About 12.9 mmscmd of gas for 13 years can be produced from D-34 discovery, which is estimated to hold recoverable reserves of 1.4 trillion cubic feet. RIL has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot—were brought into production from April 2009, but output has fallen sharply from 54 mmscmd in March 2010. 
They together with MA oil and gas field, the only field in production, currently produce 4.9 mmscmd. Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production."
825,2018-02-27,Reliance,"Airtel, Idea Cellular and Vodafone are free to match Reliance Jio tariffs in circles where they have a dominant position, and such actions will not be seen as predatory pricing, says Trai

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd, Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd are free to match tariffs offered by newcomer Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in circles where they have a dominant position and such actions will not be seen as predatory, two officials at the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) said. 
New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd, Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd are free to match tariffs offered by newcomer Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in circles where they have a dominant position and such actions will not be seen as predatory, two officials at the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) said.
Trai’s view clears the air on what constitutes predatory pricing. The issue has deepened cracks within the industry, with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio on one side and the rest on the other. Operators on both sides have sparred publicly on issues ranging from points of interconnect to interconnect usage charges since September 2016, when Reliance Jio started commercial services.
“For example, if Airtel is a significant market player in a circle then its actions have to be watched. If Jio comes with an aggressive tariff in that circle then customers will flock to Jio. Any rational service provider will try to match it. The mere act of matching the Jio price cannot be considered predatory because it is reactive,"" one of the two Trai officials cited earlier said, requesting anonymity. “But if you are doing it to drive out competition then it is predatory.""
Trai issued new norms on 16 February under which it will examine tariffs of a significant market player (SMP)—which is an operator holding a share of at least 30% of total activity in a relevant market—to determine the existence of predatory pricing. It will also look at whether the tariff is below the firm’s average variable cost over a certain period. If the tariff is found predatory, an operator will be liable to pay a penalty of up to Rs50 lakh per tariff plan per telecom circle. The definition of “total activity"" is based on any of two parameters—subscriber base and gross revenue.
If you take subscriber base as the parameter, as of 31 December, market leader Bharti Airtel is an SMP in nine circles and the Vodafone-Idea combine is dominant in 12 circles, data compiled by BloombergQuint showed. If you consider gross revenue market share, then Airtel is an SMP in 15 circles and the Vodafone-Idea combined in 13 circles. There are 22 circles, or licence areas, in the country.
Incumbent operators say that the new order takes away the flexibility to compete and retain customers in a circle in which they are SMPs. However, the Trai order also mentions that it will look at evidence of a specific intent to engage in predatory pricing.
“The SMP is free to match a price as long as it can justify it to Trai, that is make a business case with the reasons for bringing down the price. Being an SMP and offering below average variable cost alone would not make your pricing predatory,"" said another official, requesting not to be named.
Incumbent operators also say that the change in Trai’s definition of “total activity"" will result in an unfair advantage to Reliance Jio, which enjoys huge traffic on its network. The new definition of “total activity"" is based on any of two parameters—subscriber base and gross revenue—while an earlier definition included subscriber base, revenue, switching capacity and volume of traffic.
“These parameters were a part of Trai’s own criteria in the past. As a result, victims have now been made the perpetrators. In a cruel twist of fate, one operator, who by its own admission is the world’s largest data network, may be free to offer any sort of predatory tariffs, while older operators are now subject to regulation and cannot compete without falling foul of a new definition of what constitutes predatory pricing,"" Rajan S. Mathews, director general of lobby group COAI (Cellular Operators Association of India), said in a statement on 20 February.
But the regulator claims that the earlier definition was for the purposes of interconnect, while the new definition is for tariff principles. “Earlier definition needed switching capacity and volume of traffic (as parameters) because it was for interconnect...networks have to talk to each other through interconnect points and hence it has to follow some technical criteria. But, this (tariff) is different. Definition has to serve a purpose in a particular context. By taking revenue and subscribers, Trai has not committed anything,"" the first official cited above said.
Meanwhile, Vodafone on Monday termed Trai’s new rules as ‘unfair’, according to a PTI report from Barcelona, where the Mobile World Congress is taking place. When asked if he believes that the latest rule favours new players and if the company will challenge it, Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao responded affirmatively.
COAI too, without naming Reliance Jio, said Trai’s recent orders, including the latest tariff order amendment, “seem to be strengthening the ambitions of one particular operator with deep pockets and monopolistic designs at the expense of other operators"". Responding to this, Jio on 23 February sought a public apology from COAI and asked it to immediately cease and desist from publishing false and defamatory imputations against Reliance Jio.
Reacting to Reliance Jio’s statement, COAI on 24 February, said its differences were with the orders of Trai and not with any specific operator. But, in fresh salvo fired on Monday, Reliance Jio, in a letter to COAI dated 26 February, reiterated its demand for an apology against “defamatory statement"" and stated once again that it reserves rights to initiate appropriate proceedings in accordance with law. Mint has seen a copy of the letter."

Barcelona (Spain): Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio is aiming to cover 99% of the country’s population by this Diwali, said a top company official. As part of its expansion plans, Jio has announced the roll-out of Internet of Things (IoT) services in association with Samsung, which will help consumers and enterprises.  
Barcelona (Spain): Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio is aiming to cover 99% of the country’s population by this Diwali, said a top company official. As part of its expansion plans, Jio has announced the roll-out of Internet of Things (IoT) services in association with Samsung, which will help consumers and enterprises. 
“We are deploying around 8,000 to 10,000 towers every month,"" said Reliance Jio Infocomm president Jyotindra Thacker. He is hopeful that by September or October (Diwali), the company would reach a coverage of 99%. At present, the company has a subscriber base of 160 million paid customers. 
Reliance Jio senior vice-president technology Tareq Amin said: “We talked about acquiring 100 million customers in 170 days last year, which was unprecedented. People really doubted our ability to convert from free to paid customers. Not only have we converted that, we have largest migration of free to paid services in history. Our network today has 160 million paid subscribers in less than 16 months of operation."" 
Through its IoT services, Jio aims to work with the sectors like transportation, weather forecasting and agriculture. It is also exploring the possibility of working with third party developers on IoT. On being asked about as how much time Jio would take to roll out IoT, Amin said, the company needs to create an entire ecosystem for that. Rather than of doing city-by-city launch, we would launch IoT always pan India. We are not waiting for network readiness, but we are awaiting maturity of the IoT platform, he said. Amin further said that Jio’s network would surpass 2G coverage. Our coverage in LTE would surpass 2G coverage. We want to connect every person and every village,"" Amin added. 
India ranked 154th in the world in mobile internet penetration and today it is number one in the data consumption. We believe that today we have the largest data consumption network in the world and largest video consumption network in the world, said Amin at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2018. 
Over switching of Jio’s network from 4G to 5G, he said that it could be done by software upgrade, only saying that it was a network built for the future. “For any network in this world, this migration would be a forklift activity. It’s a nightmare,"" he said. 
In Jio network architecture, we built this software defining network from day zero, he added. Jio Infocomm, which has already introduced IoT services in Mumbai, now has plans to roll out pan India. Yesterday, Jio Infocomm and Samsung Electronics had announced to work together to set up a nationwide IoT network. PTI"

New Delhi: The centre on Tuesday informed the Delhi high court that it has granted permission to Reliance Power Ltd to produce 18 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) coal from its two coal blocks in Moher and Moher-Amlohri for the financial year 2017-18.  
New Delhi: The centre on Tuesday informed the Delhi high court that it has granted permission to Reliance Power Ltd to produce 18 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) coal from its two coal blocks in Moher and Moher-Amlohri for the financial year 2017-18. 
The ministry of coal, through a letter dated 26 February 2018, permitted Reliance Power, as an interim “one-time"" measure, to produce 18 MTPA in excess of the cap of 17 MTPA.
Effectively, Reliance Power was granted permission to produce additional 1 million tonne for the present financial year ending 31 March.
A bench comprising acting chief justice Gita Mittal and justice C. Hari Shankar was hearing Reliance Power’s plea seeking permission to mine coal from its two coal blocks in Moher and Moher-Amlohri in excess of the approved 17 MTPA cap to run its 3,960 megawatt Sasan Ultra Mega Power Project in Madhya Pradesh.
Reliance Power had argued that the present cap was not enough to carry out operations till the end of this financial year and an additional 2 MTPA should be allowed to avoid the “threat of a shutdown"". 
Drawing attention of the court to the “hand-to-mouth"" condition of the power plant, counsel for Reliance Power P. Chidambaram submitted that the permission was granted only with respect to “producing"" coal from the two mines, and not “consumption"".
The Sasan power plant would come to a standstill if the approved cap of 18 MTPA was exhausted before the end of the financial year, as there was no additional stock available with the power plant for such a contingency, he argued. 
“My production uptil 25/02/2018 was 16.56 million tonne, the consumption was 16.36 million tonne. I have 0.2 million tonne as stock. I cannot shut the plant. It runs for 24 hours and provides electricity to many states,"" Chidambaram informed the court, while submitting that a minimum of 1.25 million tonnes was required as additional stock. 
He further sought direction from the court on how the plant would meet its coal requirement in case the approved cap was exhausted on the last day of the financial year. 
“If I touch my cap of 18 MTPA on 31st March, what will I do on 1st April (with no additional stock as my disposal),"" he said. 
Sanjeev Narula, appearing for the centre, argued that the new cap of 18 MTPA was sufficient for the power plant as it would last till 10 April. 
Comprising six units of 669 MW each, Sasan Ultra Mega Power Project is the world’s largest integrated power generation and coal mining project, and Reliance Power’s flagship project. The power project aims to provide reliable and low-cost power for 25 years to more than 42 crore people in seven states.
The matter would be further heard on 13 March.
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in the Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case."

New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is preparing a rural push for Jio Phone, with an assembly facility already operational in Chennai and another coming up in Tirupati. 
New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is preparing a rural push for Jio Phone, with an assembly facility already operational in Chennai and another coming up in Tirupati.
The company, which shipped the initial batch of 6 million feature phones from a vendor in China, recently started assembly operations in Chennai.
“We have already started assembling in Chennai; the capacity is enough to meet current requirement. The Tirupati plant, once the land is allotted, should come up in 12 months. The first batch of Jio Phones from this (Tirupati) plant should be out within 12-18 months,"" a person familiar with the development said, requesting anonymity.
Reliance Industries Ltd, the parent of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, on 25 February signed an agreement with the Andhra Pradesh government, under which the company will invest Rs15,000 crore in an electronics manufacturing plant on a 150-acre site near Tirupati to manufacture mobile phones and set-top boxes, said a PTI report.
The company, in order to target the 500-million strong feature phone market, is simultaneously building a sales network in rural areas, apart from making the Jio Phone available on online platform Amazon.
The company runs Jio Centres in urban areas and Jio Points, which are small offices in semi-urban and rural pockets, offering after-sales services and customer assistance.
“There are over 1,000 Jio Centres in urban areas. The company is inching close to having 7,000 Jio Points, out of which 3,500-4,000 are currently being used as a distribution chain for the Jio Phone and the rest may be used for the same purpose in the future,"" the first person cited above said.
The Jio Phone is sold through Reliance Retail, the consumer business arm of Reliance Industries Ltd. 
The company does not have plans for a full-fledged TV campaign for Jio Phone, but is targeting advertisements in regional print media, radio and through local fairs. Reliance Jio will also make available over 20 million Jio Phones in Uttar Pradesh within the next two months on a priority basis, Ambani had said recently at the state investor summit.
With the KaiOS, powering Jio Phones, hosted on Reliance Jio’s data centres, some of the software-related issues have also been ironed out, a second person aware of the matter said.
Earlier this month, Reliance Jio made Facebook available on Jio Phone. Popular messaging app WhatsApp is not available, though. “WhatsApp was not ready with the architectural solution for KaiOS,"" a second person in the know said, adding the firm has made a compatible version of a “limited functionality WhatsApp"".
“We are working on it. We have got Facebook. It’s the same firm.... WhatsApp will take some time as you need time to redevelop and optimize the app; it to fit into the small memory of a feature phone,"" the first person cited above said, adding it is also a lucrative opportunity for the messaging service to tap into the India’s feature phone user base.
On Tuesday, Airtel announced a tie-up with Google to bring low-cost smartphones powered by Android Oreo (Go edition) to India by March. Android Oreo (Go edition) is a configuration of the Android operating system optimized for devices with 1GB of RAM or less. “We are also gearing up for Android Go. Jio is working on 10-11 apps being prepared in-house for Android Go,"" the second person said.
An emailed query sent to Reliance Jio remained unanswered till press time."

With Aircel filing for bankruptcy on Wednesday, the last of the small telecom companies is out of the way. It leaves the behemoths—Bharti Airtel, Vodafone-Idea and Reliance Jio—to slug it out.
Late last year, telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan said 2017 had been a year of consolidation for the sector, while 2018 would be a year of growth. She was certainly right with regard to the former; the disruption caused by Reliance Jio’s entry has led to a wave of telecom mergers. But there are several caveats when it comes to the latter.
The sector has been under pressure since 2009. High financial leverage caused by rising capex—the industry has a cumulative debt of around Rs4.6 trillion, while revenues are under Rs1.8 trillion—and increasingly thin margins thanks to Jio’s pricing strategies mean there’s a long way to go.
If 2018 is indeed to be the year of growth, much will depend on the new National Telecom Policy, the relief package the government is putting together and the big three’s ability to find new revenue streams such as financial payments and streaming services."

Before the cut in IUC, it had a share of only 16% in the Ebitda reported by the country’s top four telcos. In the December quarter, Jio’s share nearly doubled to 30%. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
In one sense, the results represent a form of give and take, with Jio gaining at the expense of incumbents—Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd. Put together, the four telcos reported a sequential decline of only 1.75% in Ebitda in Q3, which isn’t bad in the backdrop of an intense battle for subscribers.
More importantly, the cumulative cash burn of Airtel, Jio and Idea Cellular fell to around Rs9,200 crore, from around Rs10,900 crore in the September quarter. Of course, this is nothing much to cheer about, but it does point to a slight recovery. Jio’s cash burn reduced largely because of the IUC cut, while incumbents cut capex to conserve cash. It was also a quarter when Jio raised tariffs and some small telcos shut operations. Of course, cash flow metrics tend to be lumpy, and it’s premature to get excited about the lower cash burn. 
In any case, the joy will be short-lived. Jio has stepped up its aggression on pricing this year, which means the levels of cash burn will worsen for the industry in the March quarter.
Coming back to the previous quarter, while the incumbents reported a 12-13% decline in revenues, Jio’s revenues grew 12% sequentially.
Nearly 90% of the increase in Jio’s operating profit was on account of the IUC cut. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) cut IUC by 57% from 1 October, which also resulted in a sizeable revenue loss for incumbents. The industry might have had a marginal recovery, but things have gone from bad to worse for incumbents.
Airtel reported a pre-tax loss of Rs933 crore for its India wireless business; in Q2, it made a profit of Rs38 crore. Idea was already deep in the red and losses rose to 30% of revenues.
To be sure, Jio’s accounting policy differs significantly from peers, which analysts point out understates costs. As such, it makes more sense to look at cash flow trends. As it turns out, Jio is burning way more cash than others. Thanks to increase in profits, cash outflow reduced from ~Rs6,200 crore in Q2 to ~Rs5,000 crore last quarter. Even so, this is more than the combined cash outflow of Rs4,200 crore of Airtel and Idea."

Mumbai: Industry body Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has hit back at Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, stating that the telecom firm should withdraw its defamation notice and publicly apologize to the association, COAI director general Rajan Mathews said in a letter released on Monday.  
Mumbai: Industry body Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has hit back at Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, stating that the telecom firm should withdraw its defamation notice and publicly apologize to the association, COAI director general Rajan Mathews said in a letter released on Monday. 
The letter from Mathews—dated 28 February and addressed to Jio’s president (regulatory Kapoor Singh Guliani—comes days after the company, owned by Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd, sent a notice to COAI on 22 February to immediately cease and desist from publishing false and defamatory imputations against Jio and issue a public apology.
Jio’s allegation that COAI had acted arbitrarily, discriminatorily and as a mouthpiece of some members was misconceived, Mathews said.
“As an industry association, COAI has the duty to raise grave issues concerning the growth and development of the telecom sector,"" Mathews said, adding that Jio’s allegations against the industry were uncalled for and in bad taste.
Mathews said that COAI denies Jio’s allegations, adding that voicing views cannot constitute defamation.
“You are advised to withdraw your captioned notice and issue a public apology to us for your notice on behalf of Jio,"" he said, adding, “We reserve our right to initiate legal action against you and RJIL for false and malicious imputations against COAI and its officials.""
COAI had in a press statement on 20 February said that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai’s) recent orders, including the latest tariff order amendment, “seem to be strengthening the ambitions of one particular operator with deep pockets and monopolistic designs at the expense of other operators"".
In a 22 February letter addressed to the COAI director general, Jio had said that the press statement by the body is defamatory under the garb of criticizing the telecom regulator’s order. 
The company added that Jio reserves its right to initiate criminal and civil defamation proceedings, including for damages, against both COAI and incumbent dominant operators.
When contacted a Jio spokesperson said that the company did not have any comment to make immediately."

Mumbai: Anil Ambani-led Reliance Infrastructure Ltd on Monday said the company and its wholly-owned subsidiary Reliance Defence Systems Pvt. Ltd have issued a Rs5,440 crore arbitration notice to founder-promoters of erstwhile Pipavav Defence and Engineering Ltd, citing a breach of warranties. 
Mumbai: Anil Ambani-led Reliance Infrastructure Ltd on Monday said the company and its wholly-owned subsidiary Reliance Defence Systems Pvt. Ltd have issued a Rs5,440 crore arbitration notice to founder-promoters of erstwhile Pipavav Defence and Engineering Ltd, citing a breach of warranties.
Exactly two years ago, Reliance Defence had bought Pipavav Defence, India’s largest shipyard, from the Gandhis of SKIL Infrastructure Ltd. Later, it bought another 26% stake in the company through an open offer.
In a stock exchange filing, Reliance Infra said it is making indemnity claims of Rs5,440.38 crore under the purchase agreement dated 4 March 2015 against Nikhil and Bhavesh Gandhi and their companies SKIL Infrastructure, Grevek Investments and Finance Pvt. Ltd, and SKIL Shipyard Holdings Pvt. Ltd.
Reliance Infra did not disclose the nature of these breaches.
“The company has discovered that there have been serious breaches of warranties and representations made by the founder-promoters (of Pipavav Defence). As per the share purchase agreement, we are entitled to claim the loss caused in an arbitration,"" said a person aware of the development, on condition of anonymity.
Warranties are assurances of the state of affairs and governance standards of the company, and any breach can lead to a claim.
Reliance Infra is convinced of the breaches discovered and is therefore compelled to enforce its rights, this person added.
Reliance Group declined to furnish additional details.
Calls and messages received no response from Nikhil Gandhi, founder-chairman at Pipavav Defence. 
On 4 March 2015, Ambani pipped other suitors such as homegrown conglomerate Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, French naval defence company DCNS SA and the Munjals of the Hero Group to buy an 18% stake in debt-laden Pipavav Defence—then India’s largest shipyard with a licence to build warships—for Rs819 crore at Rs63 per share, a 17.6% discount to the prevailing share price at the time and rechristened it Reliance Naval and Engineering Ltd.
The company also acquired the promoters’ additional shares, in addition to the 17.6% stake, and an incremental 26% stake from public shareholders at Rs66 a share. Pipavav Defence, a manufacturer of warships, submarines and liquefied natural gas carriers, was reeling under a debt of Rs7,000 crore at the time, with the founders unable to infuse more cash into the firm.
Ambani moved quickly to seal the deal by offering cash upfront to buy out the promoters’ stakes, with an open offer to follow, in order to participate in the government’s impending plans to build six nuclear-powered submarines and seven stealth warships costing close to Rs1 trillion, Mint had reported on 12 March 2015.
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in the Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case."
816,2018-03-06,Reliance,"Returns may rise in single digits, but even this may be optimistic if Reliance Industries starts spending again, say analysts

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has committed  ₹ 1.3 trillion worth of investments across five states in its non-energy businesses over the past two months. Though analysts worry that these investments may dilute its return on capital employed, RIL executives say it underlines the seriousness with which the company is pursuing opportunities in telecom and retail.  
Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has committed  ₹ 1.3 trillion worth of investments across five states in its non-energy businesses over the past two months. Though analysts worry that these investments may dilute its return on capital employed, RIL executives say it underlines the seriousness with which the company is pursuing opportunities in telecom and retail. 
“The consumer-facing segment is important to RIL and these investments show how serious we are about it. It’s a huge opportunity for us,"" a Reliance executive said on condition of anonymity. RIL did not respond to an email sent on 27 February. 
Since January this year, RIL has announced investments in Maharashtra (Rs60,000 crore); Andhra Pradesh (Rs52,000 crore); Uttar Pradesh (Rs10,000 crore); West Bengal (Rs 5,000 crore) and Assam (Rs 2,500 crore). Most of these investments would go into telecom (Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd); Reliance Retail and energy, in that order. 
“RIL has invested about $53 billion in a range of businesses from wireless telecommunications and shale reserves in the US to real estate and retail outlets. These investments made over the past decade have lowered the return on capital to just 6.4% in the year ended March 31, 2017. Its Jio telecom venture alone has sucked up more than $38 billion,"" said Somshankar Sinha, Piyush Nahar and Pratik Chaudhuri of Jefferies India in a report dated 27 February. 
The analysts expect return on capital to rise but stay in single digits till FY24, “but even this may prove optimistic if Reliance starts spending again,"" they said. 
So far, RIL has invested $38.6 billion in telecom; $9.2 billion in shale gas business and a total of $6.5 billion in retail, media, real estate and others.
“The investment commitments which RIL announced across five states are indicative and conceptual and may not reflect in actual capital expenditure. Ultimately, that would depend on a thorough appraisal of individual projects. In general, though, Reliance has always looked for new avenues to invest and it is plausible that capital spend remains elevated - although not at the level seen in FY15-18,"" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage on the condition of anonymity as he is not allowed to speak to reporters. 
RIL’s investments in Assam, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh will be to strengthen Jio’s network and infrastructure in the states; strengthening its optical fibre network; setting up of an electronics manufacturing facility for mobile phones, set-top boxes and television sets and expanding its retail network including fuel retailing. 
However, analysts expect RIL to be generating impressive cash flow from next fiscal to finance these investments. 
“RIL has always had access to funds at above sovereign rating for its investment requirements; we do not see that changing for the near term. Also, the company is expected to generate  ₹ 2 trillion of cash profits over FY18-20 (estimated), we have seen that RIL prefers to balance its funding with lower cost of debt than equity which is at much higher cost for it versus debt cost, given its superior credit rating,"" said Probal Sen, an analyst at IDFC Securities. 
Sen added that for a company of RIL’s size, its debt to equity ratio at 0.7-0.8 time over FY18-20e, remains very comfortable. 
RIL had this January said that its capex cycle for the energy business is over and full benefits of the same would accrue to the company from financial year 2019. 
In 2014, RIL embarked on a $16 billion refining and petrochemicals expansion plan which ended this January with the commissioning of its refinery off-gas cracker complex of 1.5 million tonnes per annum capacity along with downstream plants and utilities.
In addition to the investments announced in the five states, RIL last month also bought a 65% stake in a real estate project in Bandra-Kurla Complex in central Mumbai for  ₹ 1,105 crore, taking its total investment in property to $2.6 billion. The company also bought a 5% stake in content producer Eros International Plc for $15 per share. 
On Monday, RIL shares fell 2.48% to Rs924.20 on BSE, while the benchmark Sensex shed 0.88% to 33,746.78 points."

Mumbai: Competing with nearly 30 rivals in the over-the-top (OTT) video streaming market doesn’t unnerve Eros Now, the digital arm of movie production and distribution studio Eros International, even as a minority stake acquired by Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) in the parent company late last month brought it under the spotlight. 
On the sidelines of the media and entertainment event Ficci-Frames in Mumbai, the newly appointed chief operating officer, Ali Hussein, discusses content plans, implications of the Reliance stake and more. Edited excerpts:
What do you think are the implications of RIL taking 5% stake in Eros International for Eros Now?
I don’t think there are that many implications because it’s a minority stake. On one hand, the joint venture will help us come up with better quality movie and original programming which would be available to both Jio and Eros Now. The second side of things is that the association with Jio will help us scale up our business in a much better way—in terms of content—with what we’re looking to do with the product as well as with marketing and distribution. It gives us more ammunition to be able to go out into the market and set out a better consumer proposition.
How do you look at this entire convergence between telecommunication and media companies?
Telcos are one of the best and most effective paths to (content) distribution. For that reason, the relationship between them and the content creator is totally symbiotic. Telcos will obviously be able to speak of their strategy better but the reason video is so important to them is that it is the highest form of data consumption. However, because Jio has a minority stake (in Eros), we as a company, are open to working with all players.
What are your content plans going forward?
There are four parts to this. One is our legacy library, or the old movies that we have. Then there are the new movies we are looking at, and we shall get into that ecosystem with both co-productions and acquisitions. Our originals are slated to launch towards the second quarter of this year, we shall start off with Hindi and then get into regional languages. Apart from that, we are looking at shorter, snackier formats within the longer movie format. It could be like black & white, our piece-to-camera chat show. Viewing can be both binge and long-form as well as recreational and we want to cater to both (demands).
How do you think subscription is holding up as a business model in India versus advertising?
While advertising is a hybrid model, the real battle of the business globally is based on subscription. In India, there are lots of issues with YouTube making content available at almost zero cost, Jio coming in with its content and data plans as well as the kind of piracy that is rampant, so taking the advertiser model is the easy way out. But value creation needs to happen at a price that is affordable to the consumer. We’re looking at entertainment as a value commodity to the customer because it’s almost a habit. The question is how can we put it out for them in a convenient way at a cost that doesn’t put a dent in their pockets. So, while subscription is going to be a long-drawn exercise, I believe it is something we will start investing in, in all aspects—payments, functionality, value-added services, everything.
How do you plan to differentiate yourself in this cluttered OTT market?
Differentiation is not going to be a challenge for us. We are deep-rooted in the market of films. We are very clear about that and our originals will also bring out that flavour, that we are, for the lack of better words, closest to B-town. Studios like Dharma Productions and Excel Entertainment also work with us so we are very synergistic to the ecosystem. Eros is one of the best platforms for distributing Indian content globally and the world has broken down into niches so people know what to expect from whom. So in terms of defining a large sample niche, who better than us?"

New Delhi: Delhi high court on Tuesday upheld a May 2017 arbitral award against Delhi Metro Rail Corp. Ltd (DMRC), directing it to pay Rs2,950 crore as compensation, along with interest, to Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd (DAMEPL), a unit of Reliance Infrastructure Ltd (RInfra) for breach of provisions of a ‘concession agreement’ between the two entities for construction, operation and maintenance of the Airport Metro Express Line project.  
New Delhi: Delhi high court on Tuesday upheld a May 2017 arbitral award against Delhi Metro Rail Corp. Ltd (DMRC), directing it to pay Rs2,950 crore as compensation, along with interest, to Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd (DAMEPL), a unit of Reliance Infrastructure Ltd (RInfra) for breach of provisions of a ‘concession agreement’ between the two entities for construction, operation and maintenance of the Airport Metro Express Line project. 
The project was a High Speed Metro Rail Line and intended to operate between New Delhi and Dwarka Sector 21 via IGI Airport Terminal 3, over a stretch of 23km.
Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva, in its judgement, further directed DMRC to deposit Rs3,502.62 crore being 75% of the amount awarded under the arbitral award directly with project lenders. The amount would be deposited in the escrow account maintained with project lenders in four weeks.
A Reliance Infra spokesperson said, “Now that the Hon’ble Delhi High Court has upheld the award by the arbitration tribunal, we expect the compensation to be paid expeditiously, which we shall utilize to retire the outstanding debt of RInfra and DAMEPL.""
According to its media release, Reliance Infrastructure stands to get Rs5,060 crore from the award. 
After winning the competitive bidding for the metro project in 2008, Reliance Energy CAF, a joint venture between Reliance Energy (now Reliance Infrastructure Ltd) and Spanish rolling stock firm CAF, had formed a special purpose vehicle (SPV) DAMEPL and had entered into a concession pact with DMRC for the implementation of the project. 
The pact was terminated by DAMEPL on 8 October 2012 after DMRC failed to cure certain defects in the civil structure of the project, which “severely impaired the performance of the obligations of DAMEPL under the Concession Agreement""
 Subsequently, DAMEPL invoked Article 29.5.1 of the concession agreement upon DMRC to make payment of a termination amount’. 
DAMEPL further invoked provisions of a tripartite escrow agreement, executed between the lenders of the project, DMRC and DAMEPL, asking DMRC to deposit the termination payments as well as all revenues derived from the project operations collected by it in accordance with the concession agreement into an escrow account. 
After a failed conciliation attempt, an arbitral tribunal was constituted which passed an award on 11 May 2017 directing DMRC to compensate DAMEPL for causing ‘material adverse effect’ on DAMEPL’s capacity to operate the project in accordance with the concession agreement.

814,2018-03-07,Reliance,"Reliance Industries's large investments outside of its core Indian energy business have lowered its return on capital employed (ROCE) by 8.8 percentage points between FY02 and FY17

Leaving the question of price aside, the best business to own is one that over an extended period can employ large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return. The worst business to own is one that (does) the opposite— that is, consistently employ ever-greater amounts of capital at very low rates of return,"" Warren Buffett wrote in his letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in 1992. 
Leaving the question of price aside, the best business to own is one that over an extended period can employ large amounts of incremental capital at very high rates of return. The worst business to own is one that (does) the opposite— that is, consistently employ ever-greater amounts of capital at very low rates of return,"" Warren Buffett wrote in his letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in 1992.
How does Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), the country’s largest employer of capital by far, measure on this count? 
Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd estimate that the company’s large investments outside of its core Indian energy business have lowered its return on capital employed (ROCE) by 8.8 percentage points between fiscal years 2002 and 2017 (FY02 and FY17).
The company’s ROCE stood at merely 6.4% in FY17, and without the $53 billion (around Rs3.4 trillion) worth of investments in other sectors such as telecom (Reliance Jio Infocomm) and retail, return ratios would have been at respectable double-digit levels, Jefferies’ calculations suggest. The brokerage firm expects return ratios to rise as the telecom business gains scale and turns more profitable, although even then ROCE is expected to inch up by less than a percentage point each year and reach 9% by FY22. 
Interestingly, even though RIL has been committing ever-increasing amounts of capital at low rates of return—an anathema in Buffett’s books—investors have been lapping up the company’s shares like never before. RIL’s shares have risen nearly 80% from their lows in early 2017, which is no mean feat keeping in mind the company’s free float market capitalization of Rs3.14 trillion.
One might argue that it’s foolhardy to compare historical return ratios with stock returns, since the latter prices in future expectations. 
While this is true, from the looks of it, return ratios in the future aren’t expected to go through the roof either. In fact, Jefferies’ analysts say ROCE could well fall to lower levels (than the projected 9% ROCE for FY22) if the company steps up its investments again.
Perhaps investors are pricing in the so-called unlocking story, where RIL markets the Jio story well and recoups a large part of its investment back through an initial public offering. But as pointed out in this column earlier, investors appear to be pricing in all this and more, what with Jio already being valued at levels that are higher than industry leader Bharti Airtel Ltd’s India wireless business. 
In more ways than one, investors seem to be throwing caution to the wind."

810,2018-03-08,Reliance,"HSBC Daisy-led investors have argued that Reliance Infratel would become defunct after the RCom-Reliance Jio deal as it would not have any assets left

Mumbai: The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Wednesday directed Reliance Infratel Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), to stay the sale of its assets until 13 March. 
Mumbai: The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Wednesday directed Reliance Infratel Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), to stay the sale of its assets until 13 March.
The tribunal was hearing a petition filed by offshore investors of Reliance Infratel led by HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd, which are alleging oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement.
After hearing the arguments of Reliance Infratel, overseas investors and the joint lenders’ forum of RCom, the NCLT division bench of B.S.V. Prakash Kumar and Ravikumar Duraisamy reserved its final order, to be released on 12 March.
This might create a minor hiccup as the Anil Ambani-owned company has entered into a binding agreement to sell off parts of RCom’s assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, controlled by Anil Ambani’s older brother Mukesh Ambani. An RCom spokesperson declined to comment.
Earlier on 28 December, both companies in separate statements said that Reliance Jio had emerged as the highest bidder for the wireless spectrum, tower, optical fibre network and media convergence node assets of RCom. The companies did not disclose the deal value.
HSBC Daisy-led investors argued that the company in which they had invested—Reliance Infratel—would become defunct because it would not have any assets left.
“When we had invested Rs1,100 crore in the company, under the agreement, we had the right to know about any changes that (the) company does, but we were not aware of anything that the company did,"" argued their counsel Iqbal Chagla.
He further argued that out of the total debt of RCom of around Rs45,000 crore, Reliance Infratel had debt of mere Rs3,400 crore, while the valuation of the latter’s tower business alone was Rs11,000 crore when its parent was in talks with Brookfield to sell assets.
“Currently, all the assets including those owned by Reliance Infratel are mortgaged and today, if the assets are not sold, the lenders will approach the tribunal under insolvency and bankruptcy code to recover their dues,"" argued Alpana Ghone, counsel for Reliance Infratel. 
“The entire procedure was conducted by the joint lenders’ forum where Reliance Jio was the highest bidder.""
According to Ghone, the sale of RCom group assets will fetch around Rs24,707 crore, out of which the assets of Reliance Infratel will fetch around Rs8,000 crore. Ghone also argued that the valuations of the telecom tower company had gone down because anchor tenant RCom had decided to terminate the rental agreement, and any delay might further dent valuation. 
Earlier, on 20 February, Reliance Infratel had agreed to share details of the deal to sell its assets to Jio with shareholders led by HSBC Daisy. These investors are seeking an exit from Reliance Infratel at fair market value.
In July 2007, HSBC Daisy Investment along with a clutch of other investors had invested around Rs1,100 crore in Reliance Infratel for about 5% stake, which has now come down to 4.26%. 
Appearing for the joint lenders’ forum, senior counsel Birendra Saraf argued that RCom’s assets, including the tower business, are a pledge and the entire plan was monitored by the lenders; hence, nobody can see any asset in isolation. 
Late on Tuesday, in an exchange filing, RCom said that it had appealed in the Bombay high court against an arbitration court which restrained it from sale, transfer or mortgage of its assets.
The arbitration court was ruling on an appeal by Swedish telecom vendor Ericsson, an operational creditor of RCom.

New Delhi: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Thursday cleared the proposals for sale of assets of Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, a person aware of the development said.
“The proposal cleared include RCom’s towers, India fiber, spectrum holdings and media convergence nodes. The total payout to RCom is likely to be to the tune of Rs18,000 crore,"" the person added on condition of anonymity.
The deal appears to be a win-win for both brothers as Jio gets most of RCom’s assets, giving it more firepower in its telecom business, while the Anil Ambani-promoted firm will reduce its debt overhang substantially.
Emails sent to RCom and Reliance Jio were not answered.
Anil Ambani on 26 December, 2017 said his company had agreed to a new debt resolution plan that will see RCom sell its assets—spectrum, fibre, telecom towers and real estate other than Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City—and did not entail lenders and bond-holders writing off dues or converting it into equity. 
Through this process, he hoped to cut RCom’s debt by Rs39,000 crore from the Rs45,000 crore it owed lenders at the end of October.
According to the deal, Jio will buy RCom’s assets which include 122.4 MHz of 4G spectrum in the 800/900/1,800/2,100 MHz bands, over 43,000 towers, 178,000 RKM (route km) of fibre with a pan-India footprint and 248 media convergence nodes covering five million sq. ft, used for hosting telecom infrastructure.

New Delhi: Debt-laden Reliance Communications’ (RCom) proposal to sell infrastructure assets including towers, optic fibre cable and spectrum to Reliance Jio has been cleared by the Competition Commission of India (CCI). 
New Delhi: Debt-laden Reliance Communications’ (RCom) proposal to sell infrastructure assets including towers, optic fibre cable and spectrum to Reliance Jio has been cleared by the Competition Commission of India (CCI).
“@CCI_India approves acquisition of RCOM’s towers, optic fiber cable, right to use spectrum and media convergence nodes by RJIO,"" the anti-trust regulator tweeted. In December 2017, Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio had signed a pact to acquire the mobile business assets that includes spectrum, mobile towers and optical fibre network of RCom-owned by his younger brother Anil Ambani. 
While neither Jio nor RCom had divulged the size of the deal, people in the know have pegged the transaction value at Rs18,000 crore. RCom statement, at that time, had said the deal packs in 122.4MHz of 4G spectrum in the 800/900/1800/2100 MHz bands, over 43,000 towers, 1,78,000 kilometres of fibre and 248 media convergence nodes. 
At the time of the deal announcement, the companies had also said that the transaction is likely to be completed in a phased manner by March 2018. However, an arbitration panel in an interim order recently, has restrained RCom from asset sale or transfer, without its “specific permission"".

Mumbai: In a setback for Reliance Infratel Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Communications Ltd, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has continued the stay on the sale of its assets to Reliance Jio until further order.
The tribunal was hearing the plea filed by HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd, who is alleging oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement.
On Monday, NCLT had allowed the amendment application of offshore investors to make changes to their original petition seeking a stay on sale of Reliance Infratel’s assets.
The tribunal also posted the hearing on investors’ contempt petition on 6 April.
“We intend to file an appeal immediately before the NCLAT for the vacation of the stay, to protect the interests of our secured lenders,"" said an RCom spokesperson in an email response to Mint query. “It is to be noted the stay granted by NCLT today relates only to RCOM’s tower and fibre assets and does not apply to spectrum, MCNs, real estate, etc.""
The RCom spokesperson further said that “We expect our secured lenders to also take appropriate steps for the expeditious completion of processes transparently run by lenders for monetisation of their securities, and realisation of their dues.""
“As legally advised, the claims of minority investors and/or unsecured vendors cannot under any circumstances rank in higher priority than the undisputed claims of secured domestic and international lenders, and any stay granted in this regard is not defensible in law and liable to be vacated,"" the RCom spokesperson further added.
HSBC Daisy and other investors had originally approached the tribunal in 2015 against the proposed merger of Reliance Infratel with its parent company Reliance Communications. 
Currently, the investors were opposing the transaction on the grounds that once the deal with Jio goes through, the company in which they had invested around Rs1,100 crore will become defunct. In July 2007, HSBC Daisy Investment along with a clutch of other investors had invested around Rs1,100 crore in Reliance Infratel for about 5% stake, which has now come down to 4.26%.

806,2018-03-14,Reliance,"Experts have noted that an increased reliance on borrowings will further exacerbate the Indian Railways's financial situation

This year, the finances of the Indian Railways were presented along with the Union Budget on 1 February, and are scheduled to be approved in the next few days. Here is a look at some key issues and trends. 
This year, the finances of the Indian Railways were presented along with the Union Budget on 1 February, and are scheduled to be approved in the next few days. Here is a look at some key issues and trends.
Internal revenue generation has been declining
The railways’ internal revenue for 2018-19 is estimated at Rs2.01 trillion, 7% higher than the revised estimates for 2017-18. The majority of this comes from freight and passenger traffic, estimated at around Rs2 trillion. However, over the last few years, railways’ internal revenue has been falling due to a drop in the growth of both freight and passenger traffic.
Expenditure on salaries and pension has been increasing
Railways’ operating expenditure for 2018-19 is estimated to be Rs1.88 trillion, up 4% from 2017-18. About 66% of this goes towards the payment of salaries and pensions. This component has been gradually increasing, with a jump of about 15% in the last two years due to implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations. The pension bill is expected to increase further in the years to come, as about 40% of the railways’ staff was above 50 years in 2016-17.
Rs500 crore has been allocated towards the Depreciation Reserve Fund, which provides for the cost of new assets replacing the old ones. This is significantly lower than last year’s allocation of Rs5,000 crore.
Consequently, operating ratio has been on the higher side
Operating ratio is the ratio of working expenditure (expenses arising from day-to-day operations) to revenue earned from traffic. A higher ratio indicates a poorer ability to generate surplus that can be used for capital investments such as laying new lines and deploying more coaches. 
The operating ratio for 2018-19 is projected at 92.8%. In 2017-18 (revised estimates), it was 96%. In the last 10 years, the operating ratio has been around 94% on average, which means the railways has been spending 94 paise on every rupee that it earns. 
Capital expenditure is increasingly getting financed through borrowings
With declining internal revenue, capital outlay gets financed through budgetary support from the central government and borrowings. Till 2015-16, the railways paid a dividend to the central government. In 2018-19, the gross budgetary support from the central government is proposed at Rs55,088 crore, while borrowings are estimated at Rs81,940 crore. Therefore, the majority of capital expenditure will be financed through borrowings (55%), followed by budgetary support (37%), and only 8% from railways’ own internal resources. Experts have noted that an increased reliance on borrowings will further exacerbate the railways’ financial situation."
805,2018-03-16,Reliance,"Mukesh Ambani said with super-abundant youthful talent, India is poised to become the third largest economy in the world by 2028  within just a single decade

London: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s telecom venture Jio, which catapulted India as the world’s largest mobile broadband data consuming nation in less than two years, was first seeded by his daughter, Isha, in 2011. 
London: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s telecom venture Jio, which catapulted India as the world’s largest mobile broadband data consuming nation in less than two years, was first seeded by his daughter, Isha, in 2011.
This was revealed by Ambani, the richest Indian, in his acceptance speech last night after his oil-to-telecom conglomerate, Reliance Industries was presented with the ‘Drivers of Change’ award at the Financial Times ArcelorMittal Boldness in Business Awards.
Since the idea first cropped up, Reliance, which owns and operates the world’s largest single location refinery complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat, has spent more than $31 billion to break into India’s mobile-phone market.
The 2016 upstart, called Jio, dislodged rivals and has emerged as the nation’s No. 4 carrier by offering call services free for life and data transmission at dirt cheap rates.
Jio is also gearing up for newer data-heavy services that can connect homes, businesses, and cars to the internet. Ambani said with super-abundant youthful talent, India is poised to become the third largest economy in the world by 2028 — within just a single decade.
“The idea of Jio was first seeded by my daughter, Isha, in 2011. She was a student at Yale (in the US) and was home for holidays. She wanted to submit some coursework – and she said, ‘Dad, the internet in our house sucks’,"" he recalled.
Ambani said Isha’s twin brother, Akash, at that time stated that in the old world, telecom was voice and people made money on calls but in the new world everything is digital.
“Isha and Akash belong to India’s young generation that is far more creative, far more ambitious and far more impatient to become the best in the world. These young Indians convinced me that broadband internet is the defining technology of our age and India cannot be left behind,"" he said.
India at the time was suffering from poor connectivity and a severe scarcity of the most critical digital resource – data. Data was not only scarce, but it was priced artificially high to make it unaffordable to a majority of Indians, he said.
Jio transformed all of this by making data abundant and affordable and available in every part of the country. “We launched Jio in September 2016. And today Jio has already become the biggest game changer in India,"" he said.
Ambani said while the United States pioneered 1G mobile network, Europe ushered in 2G, and China leapfrogged with 3G, Jio has created the largest greenfield 4G LTE-only data network in the world. “This will make India a leader in 4G in 2019,"" he said.
“It took the combined Indian telecom industry 25 years to build a pan-India 2G network. Jio took just three years to build a 4G LTE network, which is much larger and far more advanced. And it is also 5G-ready today.""
Jio has made voice-calling free for life and has also made high-quality data available at the lowest price in the world - at almost one-tenth the prices in the US, he said, and the firm acquired more than 100 million customers in just 170 days of launch. 
This was more than one-and-a-half times the population of the United Kingdom. For the 500 million Indians still using a feature phone and not a smartphone, Jio brought out the “world’s most affordable 4G LTE smartphone"" that is available for free for use with a deposit of Rs1,500, he said.
“The result has been stunning: 3 lakh to 5 lakh Indians are daily migrating to Jio Phone. And for the same Rs200-300, they benefit through access to the high-speed internet with their existing voice needs are completely free."" 
As the internet becomes accessible to all Indians, the country will be among the first to graduate to the Internet of Everything, he said.
“Within the next few years, Jio will empower the equivalent of two-thirds of Europe’s population to enjoy world-class digital services in India,"" he said, adding because of Jio, India has jumped from the rank of 155 to number one in the world in mobile broadband data consumption in less than two years. “Jio has already grown to be the biggest start-up in India’s history,"" he said. 
The previous honorees for the ‘Drivers of Change’ award include DeepMind Technologies (2016), FANUC (2015), HBO (2014), Alibaba (2013), MONDRAGON Corporation (2012), Amazon (2011), Apple (2010), Fiat (2009) and Ryanair (2008). 
RIL won it for its “exceptional commitment to innovation-led, exponential growth within the areas of hydrocarbon exploration and production, petroleum refining and marketing, petrochemicals, retail and 4G digital services."" 
Stating that his late father Dhirubhai Ambani was the original ‘Driver of Change’ in India’s business history, he said the legendary industrialist founded Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) in 1966 with a meager capital of Rs1,000 (about $130 at that time). RIL, which today is an over $50 billion group, has doubled shareholder money every two-and-half years since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1977, he said. “During the same period, Reliance has contributed more to India’s national wealth than any other business group."""

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Essar Oil Ltd, Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Torrent Power Ltd are among companies planning to bid for the ninth round of city gas distribution (CGD), two people aware of the matter said. 
 The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) will offer compressed natural gas retailing licences in 100 cities shortly.  
RIL, Essar Oil and ONGC did not respond to emails sent on 15 March. 
The PNGRB has so far held eight rounds of bidding. The last few rounds of CGD bidding had seen lukewarm response.
This time around, the PNGRB is looking at a new model with a different bidding parameter. Last October, the regulatory body had called for industry comments on an alternative model of bidding criteria for CGD.
“To encourage wider participation, PNGRB has proposed to increase the exclusivity period and has pruned the minimum net worth criteria for bidders. This will encourage players to bid,"" said a CGD consultant on condition of anonymity. 
Companies with a net worth of not less than Rs150 crore can bid for cities with 5 million people, and those with Rs100 crore net worth can bid for cities with 2-5 million people. A Rs5 crore net worth company can bid for cities with less than 1 million people.  
Companies which win CGD licence for a city would have eight years of marketing exclusivity in that city, against the existing five years. Also, entities with experience of at least one year in operation and maintenance of a CGD network and with adequate number of technically qualified personnel would meet the eligibility criteria for bidding.  
“Also, companies securing a CGD licence will have to enter into a firm natural gas supply agreement with a natural gas producer or marketer and have to achieve financial closure within 270 days from the date of grant of licence,"" the second of the two people mentioned above said.  
The sixth round of bidding for 34 cities in 2015 saw only 20 bids. The seventh round for 11 cities received only one bid. Seven cities were offered in the eighth round last year but not all licences have been awarded so far.  
PNGRB in its notice dated 16 January 2018 on the draft bidding regulations had invited comments by 2 February after which it will finalise the criteria. Many companies have replied to PNGRB’s notice, which the regulator has uploaded on its website."
800,2018-03-20,Reliance,"Reliance Jio is a carriage-content-commerce triple play. But for all the cash being spewed by its units, RIL  isn't the only company in India to brandish a strong balance sheet

India’s telecom industry is in turmoil, and depending on whom you ask, one man deserves all the credit or all the blame. 
India’s telecom industry is in turmoil, and depending on whom you ask, one man deserves all the credit or all the blame.
It’s been 18 months since Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, entered with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. The 4G wireless network is basically a $31 billion bet on data. Ambani made voice calls—the core offering until then of a dozen mobile operators—absolutely free.
Such audacity both stunned and stung his rivals. Since Jio’s September 2016 launch, smaller incumbents have sold out, closed down or filed for bankruptcy, while the ruling troika of Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone Plc’s India unit and aluminium billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Idea Cellular Ltd are hemorrhaging. Vodafone and Idea are also merging. The industry is complaining bitterly about how the regulator is favouring Jio over everyone else.
Rajan Matthews, who heads the Cellular Operators Association of India, is wondering who will put up the $10 billion needed annually over the next five to six years to expand 4G and roll out 5G. Banks are so worried about deteriorating credit quality that they would rather recover what they’ve already lent than throw more money into a bottomless pit.
The one party not complaining is the consumer.
Take a simple regulatory change like the recently imposed ban on non-transparent, discriminatory price discounts that are quietly offered to select customers. The industry is livid. Vodafone has gotten a stay order from the Madras high court against the stipulation that operators must publish all tariff plans and promotional offers on their websites, the Economic Times reported over the weekend.
It’s not a trifling matter, as a senior telecom executive told me in Mumbai, describing the situation as “grim."" Retaining only those customers they consider to be a flight risk already has a cost. If that now has to be borne across the entire subscriber base in a country of 1.2 billion cellular users, then companies will have no choice except to let the fence sitters go—into Ambani’s outstretched arms. While this may upset Bharti, Vodafone and Idea, getting the same deal for the same service is hardly unfair from a customer’s perspective. This should have been fought for a long time ago.
What Ambani is doing isn’t rocket science. Everyone knows Indians’ second-biggest passion after cricket is Bollywood. Jio TV is hooking up customers with movies. Why can’t the incumbents exploit the power of content?
Ambani’s is a carriage-content-commerce triple play. (His plans for mobile commerce are yet to take shape, though he has an existing retail business.) But for all the cash being spewed by its oil refining and petrochemical units, Reliance Industries Ltd isn’t the only company in India to brandish a strong balance sheet.
In 2009, the Tata Group, armed with a $2.2 billion investment from NTT Docomo Inc., said its telecom unit would charge 1 paisa ($0.0002) per second on voice calls, upending the common practice of charging for at least a full minute. The customer-friendly innovation was backed by the Tata Group’s well-diversified balance sheet.
Yet when the big guys matched the challenger’s price, Tata failed to ratchet up the competition. The entrenched trinity won; consumers lost; and last year Tata handed its unprofitable telecom business and 40 million subscribers to Bharti.
India’s telecom industry has been ripe for disruption ever since the country’s Supreme Court cancelled 122 licences in 2012. But Bharti, Vodafone and Idea had no interest in upsetting their well-laden apple carts, and the Tata Group meekly ran away from its own war.
Ambani, though, no longer bound by a non-compete agreement he had signed with his younger brother Anil, was readying to pounce.
If the incumbents had any doubt about how the regulatory regime would take the shape of water to accommodate Jio’s eventual entry, they should have dropped those notions in 2013. That was when the government changed its rules to allow Reliance to convert its pan-India broadband internet spectrum rights (it was the only one to have them) into a full-service carrier licence.
Now, Bharti, Vodafone and Idea can cry all they want about regulatory uncertainty; consumers are too busy watching movies on their phones to pay much attention.
Ambani isn’t the king; content is. Bloomberg Gadfly"

New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) on Tuesday approached the Supreme Court to seek approval for the sale of Anil Ambani led-Reliance Communications Ltd’s (RCom’s) assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. 
While RCom allegedly owes Rs45,000 crore to as many as 35 banks, the total dues to SBI as on 28 February stand at Rs4,027 crore.
This comes a day after RCom approached the top court seeking a stay on orders of the Bombay high court and National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Mumbai bench, barring it from selling its wireless assets to Reliance Jio without prior approval. 
The matter will be heard along with RCom’s main petition.
On 8 March, the Bombay high court rejected RCom’s appeal against an order of an arbitration tribunal barring the sale or transfer of its assets without prior permission. 
The order was passed in a proceeding initiated by Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson for recovery of Rs1,012 crore of arrears from RCom.
SBI has sought stay of the Bombay high court order and claimed that it was preventing the sale of secured assets and stalling the process of recovery of dues of secured lenders.
Separately, in a plea by HSBC Daisy Investments, which had invested Rs1,100 crore in July 2007 in RCom’s Reliance InfraTel unit, NCLT on 12 March directed it not to sell its towers and fibre assets to Reliance Jio till further orders.
HSBC Daisy Investments along with some minority shareholders in Reliance Infratel had approached NCLT, alleging oppression of minority shareholders for not taking their consent for the asset sale.
Anil Ambani on 26 December said that his company had agreed to a new debt resolution plan that will see RCom sell its assets, and did not entail lenders and bond-holders writing off dues or converting it into equity.
Through this process, he hoped to cut RCom’s debt by Rs39,000 crore from the Rs45,000 crore it owed lenders at the end of October.
The matter will be heard next on 22 March.

“The holders of the company’s $300 million bonds, at their meeting held on 20 March 2018 in London, have approved with overwhelming majority the sale of assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited and also monetization of other real estate assets,"" RCom said in a statement.
“The bondholders also approved release of their security on the company’s assets and to accept part prepayment of their outstanding bonds,"" the statement added.
Anil Ambani had in December said that his company had agreed to a new debt resolution plan that would see RCom sell its assets, including spectrum, tower, optical fibre network and other wireless infrastructure, but did not entail lenders and bond-holders writing off dues or converting it into equity. Through this process, RCom hoped to cut its debt by Rs39,000 crore from the Rs45,000 crore it owed lenders.
On Wednesday, RCom shares rose 8.86%, or Rs2.05, to Rs25.20 on BSE while the benchmark Sensex gained 0.42%, or 139.42 points, to end the day at 33,136.18.

795,2018-03-23,Reliance,"That Airtel, Vodafone and Idea are being forced to raise funds at a time when their financials are at their worst just rubs salt into their wounds

The general impression is that the woes of Indian telecom companies are largely because of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s cut-throat pricing. While Reliance Jio’s pricing strategy has played a big role in dragging all incumbents to losses in the December 2017 quarter, these companies are being squeezed at the other end as well.  
The general impression is that the woes of Indian telecom companies are largely because of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s cut-throat pricing. While Reliance Jio’s pricing strategy has played a big role in dragging all incumbents to losses in the December 2017 quarter, these companies are being squeezed at the other end as well. 
Reliance Jio’s relentless aggression isn’t limited to its pricing strategy; there is no end in sight to its capacity for investments in the telecom sector.
Based on recent data presented in the Lower House of Parliament, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities estimate that Reliance Jio has a 62% share of the combined data capacity of the country’s big four mobile companies. In other words, its capacity is about 1.6 times the capacity of Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd combined. 
But according to an analyst at another institutional brokerage firm, Reliance Jio also carries about two times the data traffic these three companies manage between themselves. 
As such, Reliance Jio too needs to augment capacity to support growth, which it indeed is busy doing. The company has told analysts it will increase the number of base stations to around 200,000 in the next few quarters, or by about 25% from current levels. The above-mentioned analyst says that channel checks with suppliers suggest the count will go up to as high as 250,000 eventually.
What all of this means is that incumbents need to step up investments to keep up pace.
“Even as we do not think incumbents need to match Jio on data capacity anytime soon, we do believe they need to accelerate their efforts in closing the gap. This may mean elevated levels of capex for the next two-three years, in our view, posing upside risks to capex forecasts,"" Kotak’s analysts wrote in a note to clients.
This comes at a time when cash flows are drying up. Idea generated next to nothing in terms of cash last quarter, and that was before a series of tariff cuts by Reliance Jio in January. Needless to say, the increasing gap between cash flow and capital expenditure needs to be funded through other means.
So it isn’t surprising that all operators are busy with asset sales, equity/bond issuances or a combination of both. Airtel has periodically sold stakes in its tower infrastructure company and is even considering listing its Africa business to generate funds. Idea has diluted equity, while Reliance Jio is raising over $2 billion (Rs13,000 crore) in debt to fund capital expenditure.
From the looks of it, the need for funds will remain high, given where analysts’ estimates are with respect to capex needs. The fact that some telecom firms are being forced to raise funds at a time when their financials are at their worst and their stocks are beaten down just rubs salt into their wounds."

New Delhi: Anil Ambani-led Reliance Communications (Rcom) is likely to miss the 31 March deadline to sell its wireless assets to Mukesh Ambani-backed Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd to pay off RCom’s lenders as the Supreme Court on Thursday asked the companies to maintain status quo on their Rs25,000 crore asset sale until the next hearing. 
New Delhi: Anil Ambani-led Reliance Communications (Rcom) is likely to miss the 31 March deadline to sell its wireless assets to Mukesh Ambani-backed Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd to pay off RCom’s lenders as the Supreme Court on Thursday asked the companies to maintain status quo on their Rs25,000 crore asset sale until the next hearing.
The matter was brought before a three-judge bench headed by justice A.K. Goel, who will hear the case on 5 April. The firms have been asked to file their written submissions by 28 March. 
The court had initially suggested sending the matter back to the Bombay high court, which was opposed by both State Bank of India (SBI) and RCom.
“The value of the asset in consideration, i.e., spectrum is deteriorating by the day,"" Tushar Mehta, counsel for SBI, told the court. 
“As legally advised, RCom remains confident that its asset monetization programme will be completed expeditiously to protect the interests of its secured lenders, much in advance of the time limit of 31 August 2018 prescribed by the RBI for resolution of such cases,"" a spokesperson for RCom said.
SBI had moved the apex court on 20 March, seeking approval for the sale of RCom’s assets to Reliance Jio. 
While RCom owes Rs45,000 crore to its lenders, total dues to SBI as on 28 February stood at Rs4,027 crore.
SBI was preceded by RCom, which approached the top court on 19 March seeking a stay on orders of the Bombay high court and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Mumbai bench, barring it from selling its wireless assets to Reliance Jio without prior approval. 
On 8 March, the high court had rejected RCom’s appeal against an order of an arbitration tribunal barring the sale or transfer of its assets without prior permission.

New Delhi: Mukesh Ambani-helmed Reliance Industries Ltd on Friday announced an integration with leading music app Saavn for its digital music service JioMusic. 
New Delhi: Mukesh Ambani-helmed Reliance Industries Ltd on Friday announced an integration with leading music app Saavn for its digital music service JioMusic.
In a statement, Reliance said it has executed definitive agreements for the combination of Saavn with JioMusic.
“We are delighted to announce this partnership with Saavn, and believe that their highly experienced management team will be instrumental in expanding Jio-Saavn to an extensive user base, thereby strengthening our leadership position in the Indian streaming market,"" Akash Ambani, director at Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, said in the statement.
The combined entity is valued at over $1 billion, with JioMusic’s implied valuation at $670 million, the statement added.
Reliance will also invest up to $100 million, out of which a rupee equivalent of $20 million will be invested upfront, for growth and expansion of the platform into one of the largest streaming services in the world.
“The integrated business will be developed into a media platform of the future with global reach, cross-border original content, independent artist marketplace, consolidated data, and one of the largest mobile advertising media,"" Reliance said.
Reliance is also acquiring a partial stake from existing shareholders of Saavn for $104 million. The shareholders include Tiger Global Management, Liberty Media and Bertelsmann.
The company will continue to operate the over-the-top media platform available on all app stores.
The three co-founders of Saavn—Rishi Malhotra, Paramdeep Singh and Vinodh Bhat—will continue in their leadership roles and will drive growth of the combined entity.
“Saavn has been at the forefront of the digital music revolution in India. Our partnership with Reliance reinforces our commitment to the growth of our label partners, the independent artist ecosystem, and the overall music industry globally,"" said Singh, executive vice-chairman of Saavn.
The Reliance Jio-Saavn deal comes at a time when India’s audio streaming market is on the rise.
According to the FICCI-KPMG Media and Entertainment Industry Report 2017, streaming audio contributed 10% to the total mobile Internet usage in India. The year 2016 saw a spike in music streaming volume with 50-60 million active monthly users on music streaming applications.
With over 300 million Internet-enabled mobile phones in the country and fast reducing tariff rates, this volume is expected to grow rapidly.
To be sure, the latest deal only reinforces Reliance Jio’s entertainment play growing stronger by the day. Last month, the telecom company bought a 5% stake in film production and distribution studio Eros International Plc, in addition to the existing stakes it has acquired in production houses Balaji Telefilms, and Roy Kapur Films in the last eight months.
Reliance launched its LTE mobile network operator Reliance Jio in 2016. By November 2017, it accounted for a 14.5% share of India’s wireless telecom market for the second quarter of the year, besides revenues of Rs6,140 crore for the September quarter and an implied paid subscriber base of around 131 million.
“Reliance has a hugely penetrative market with Jio, which will only get bigger as time passes. How do you fuel content? So this is a step in that direction where you have a content provider for your user base which is a player who has been in this for a long period of time,"" said a media analyst on condition of anonymity.
“The investment and combination of our music assets with Saavn underlines our commitment to further boost the digital ecosystem and provide unlimited digital entertainment services to consumers over a strong uninterrupted network,"" Akash Ambani said.

793,2018-03-26,Reliance,"China has ample domestic savings to power its economy but it wants to share credit risk with foreigners, while India runs a current account deficit, implying a perennial reliance on overseas savings

India has much to learn from the opening of China’s onshore bond market. 
India has much to learn from the opening of China’s onshore bond market.
Last year, Beijing allowed overseas investors to access local-currency securities via its so-called Bond Connect. On Friday, Bloomberg LP announced the inclusion of Chinese government and policy-bank debt in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index.
Over a 20-month period starting in April next year, as many as 386 bonds will enter the $53.73 trillion benchmark, giving China a weight of 5.49% at full inclusion. Yuan-denominated notes will end up with the fourth-largest presence, after those in US dollars, euros and yen.
Contrast this with India, which has been on a path of gradual debt-market globalization for more than two decades. Yet by limiting foreign participation to 5%, authorities have crimped the prospects of India’s admittance to global gauges compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bloomberg.
This is an odd policy choice. China has more than ample domestic savings to power its economy, but it wants to share credit risk meaningfully with foreigners. India, meanwhile, runs a current account deficit, implying a perennial reliance on overseas savings. So why doesn’t the central bank allow more borrowing in domestic currency, which it can freely print, rather than cling to riskier dollar inflows?
It isn’t an idle query. The country’s basic balance of payments—the sum of the current account deficit and net foreign direct investment—has turned negative. This is when crude oil, which India needs to import, is at only $66 a barrel. Should oil prices firm further, and foreign portfolio investment in stocks and bonds ebb, the rupee would need to weaken to make Indian assets attractive again.
While currency values can and do adjust relatively freely in developed economies, excessive exchange-rate volatility in emerging markets tends to lead to a hard choice between capital controls and high local interest rates. That’s what happened during the destabilizing taper-tantrum episode of 2013.
This time around, the Reserve Bank of India is buying dollars to make sure the rupee doesn’t strengthen to a point where investors lose confidence in its value. But foreign money has already started leaving the Indian bond market; in the face of rising US interest rates, especially a surging dollar Libor, India needs a new category of bond buyers. That’s where aiming for index inclusion could help.
Sovereign credit rating is the one benchmark Indian authorities obsess over endlessly. Indexes— both equity and debt—don’t get as much attention. The disregard that local stock exchanges demonstrated for India’s 9% weight in MSCI Inc.’s emerging-market gauge when they came together to ban index providers from supplying local securities data to foreign bourses is reflective of that cavalier mindset. A comparison with China, which courted MSCI until it won a place for yuan-denominated stocks in the measure, is once again instructive.
The difference is starker in debt. Nomura Holdings Inc. has estimated that a 1 percentage point increase in the limit on foreign participation would lead to Rs800 billion ($12.3 billion) of inflows. What’s more, becoming a part of an index would mean access to a certain assured sum from funds merely looking to replicate the benchmark. The risk of so-called “sudden stops"" would be lower.
“Masala"" bonds, or rupee-denominated credit offshore, are only viable for large, mostly state-linked Indian issuers. Where will single-B rated borrowers go? The RBI won’t let them offer high interest rates even on rupee notes in international markets; the onshore debt market is already in trouble because of a 1 percentage point jump in 10-year sovereign bond yields since July.
Over the past several years, the world’s attention has been focused on China’s excessive credit buildup. But the number of steps Beijing has taken to prevent an accident—from shuttering excess capacity in steel and aluminum and stopping a one-way bet on yuan appreciation to squeezing easy liquidity and going after sales of wealth management products masked as insurance—have all helped maintain a semblance of calm.
Underneath, there still are fault lines, for instance in rapid growth of consumer credit. But the mess in India’s banking system, hobbled by more than $200 billion in stressed assets, is many times more pressing than any challenge facing China.
One of the solutions for making banks healthy in the long run would be to let active, deep onshore bond markets put a price on credit risk. The price tag need not be prohibitive, provided India drops its historical aversion to being in debt to foreigners. Mimicking China’s playbook on index inclusion would be a good starting point.

792,2018-03-27,Reliance,"Reliance Jio generates far more data traffic on its network than Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular combined

Prima facie, telecom sector incumbents Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd have done well to protect market share despite Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s relentless aggression. Subscription numbers released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) show that the Vodafone-Idea combine improved their share of active subscribers from 39% in March 2017 to 40.2% in January 2018. Airtel did even better, increasing its share by 470 basis points to 30.9%. 
Prima facie, telecom sector incumbents Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd have done well to protect market share despite Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s relentless aggression. Subscription numbers released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) show that the Vodafone-Idea combine improved their share of active subscribers from 39% in March 2017 to 40.2% in January 2018. Airtel did even better, increasing its share by 470 basis points to 30.9%.
Reliance Jio increased its share by 580 basis points, which, of course, represents a much faster growth, given its low base. Its share in March stood at 7.8%. Each of these large companies gained at the expense of smaller firms.
One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
But holding on to subscriber market share, or even improving upon it, doesn’t count for much in a world where tariffs are declining. What really matters is the wallet share each telecom firm enjoys with customers who use more than one mobile connection.
From the looks of it, Reliance Jio is doing better than most incumbents on this count. It generates far more data traffic on its network than all of the other large telecom players combined. Pointing to this, analysts at JPMorgan India said in a 22 January note to clients, “Incumbents must do a lot more to become the data SIM of choice for a large mass of their sub-base; Jio may have well established this positioning.""
According to an analyst with a domestic institutional brokerage firm, Reliance Jio is very likely to end up as the second largest telecom firm in terms of revenues in the March quarter. In the December quarter, it had already overtaken Idea’s revenues. Note that in terms of active subscribers, Reliance Jio was about 34-35% behind Vodafone and Idea at the end of December. This just goes to show that the active subscriber count has become less important in the current market environment.
In this backdrop, some analysts say it makes sense to look at trends in wireless broadband subscriptions more closely. The idea is that broadband customers generate higher ARPU (average revenue per user), besides which it is the segment which all telcos are looking to grow.
The data suggests Reliance Jio is leading the way here as well. So far this fiscal year, it has added 59.7 million customers, higher than what the other three large telcos have added cumulatively. Its share in the wireless broadband segment reached a high of 46.8% in January, up from 42.2% in March.
Analysts point out that over a third of Reliance Jio’s additions in January were likely on account of sales of its feature phone, where ARPU is lower than the company average. A clear picture of how market share battles have turned out will only come out when the telcos announce March quarter results.
For now, it is clear that the Reliance Jio juggernaut continues to roll on. The worrying bit is that the company is still miles away from its aspirational goal of a 50% revenue share of the market. As such, price competition can be expected to remain intense for some time to come."

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) Tuesday said it has agreed to sell some of its assets in Eagle Ford shale position in the US to Sundance Energy Inc. for $100 million.
The sale involves “certain acreage, producing wells and related assets in the western portion of its Eagle Ford shale position"", an RIL note said.
Reliance will continue to retain its interest in the remaining Eagle Ford assets.
The assets are located in Atascosa, La Salle, Live Oak and McMullen Counties, Texas and are not part of near-term development plan of the joint development. “This transaction is in conjunction with sales made by Pioneer Natural Resources USA Inc. and Newpek LLC, the other working interest owners in the joint development with Reliance. The sale is expected to close in 1QFY19 and is subject to customary closing conditions,"" RIL said.
Between 2010 and 2013, RIL bought stakes in three upstream oil exploration joint ventures with Chevron, Pioneer Natural Resource, and Carrizo Oil and Gas; and a midstream joint venture with Pioneer. Midstream refers to the processing, storing, transporting and marketing of hydrocarbons. Aggregate investments since the inception of these ventures were $8.2 billion till 2016. 
In June 2015, the firm sold its Eagle Ford (EFS) midstream joint venture with Pioneer Natural Resources in the US, realizing $1 billion from the sale. RIL had spent $46 million in acquiring the 49.9% stake in EFS and invested another $208 million over the years. 
Till 2014, RIL had been bullish on shale gas; however, the drop in crude oil prices since late 2014 hit the valuations of oil and gas assets. Shale gas blocks have suffered far more than conventional oil and gas blocks as they are economically viable only when prices cross a certain limit."

Mumbai: Oil and gas companies are boosting production of coal bed methane (CBM) gas that they are free to sell at market prices.  
Mumbai: Oil and gas companies are boosting production of coal bed methane (CBM) gas that they are free to sell at market prices. 
Natural gas price is capped at $2.89 per mmBtu by the government, while CBM gas fetches $5.7-$10.64 per mmBtu.
Among companies ramping up CBM output are Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Essar Oil Ltd, and Great Eastern Energy Corp. Ltd (GEECL). State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) has already begun test production from its CBM blocks.
“The unconventional CBM gas comes as a replacement to expensive liquefied natural gas imports; so free marketing and pricing is a welcome move for CBM producers. We have to invest a lot in extracting the gas and freedom to market the same encourages us to do better. All CBM producers are ramping up production,"" said Vilas Tawde, director and CEO, Essar Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Ltd.
Tawde believes the share of CBM gas in India’s natural gas basket will go up from the present 3% to 10% in four-five years.
CBM is a natural gas stored or absorbed in coal seams and contains 90-95% methane. According to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, India has the fifth largest proven coal reserves in the world and, therefore, holds significant prospects for exploration and exploitation of CBM. 
In March 2017, the government approved pricing and marketing freedom to CBM gas producers and also allowed them to sell the fuel to affiliates in case they cannot identify buyers. While RIL buys its own CBM gas at $7.14 per mBtu for use at refineries, GEECL sells the same at $10.64 per mBtu. Essar Oil’s sale price is $8.08 per mBtu and ONGC has fixed a price between $6.14 per mBtu and $5.7 per mBtu.
“We are going to begin CBM pilot production in two months from our fields in Bokaro and North Karanpura. Full-fledged production will begin next year. To start, we will produce 0.5 million standard cu. m per day,"" an ONGC official, the second person cited earlier, said. ONGC did not respond to an email sent on 25 March. 
Essar Oil will also double CBM production this fiscal from Raniganj block in West Bengal, up from 1 mmscmd (million standard cu. m per day), to nearly 2 mmscmd, added Tawde.
Essar owns CBM mining rights in five coalfields with prospective resources of about 10 trillion cu. ft. Raniganj is one of the five CBM blocks Essar holds. Other four blocks are Rajmahal in Jharkhand, Talcher and Ib valley in Odisha and Sohagpur in Madhya Pradesh."

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and partner BP India have put up their oil and gas block at Gujarat’s Cambay basin for sale, two people aware of the development said.
RIL is the operator of the CB-ONN-2003/1 block (also called CB-10 block) with a 70% participating interest while BP holds the rest. 
Reliance won the block in an auction in New Exploration and Licensing Policy (NELP). 
RIL did not reply to an email sent on 28 March. BP India declined to comment.
“We had seen the block’s data but are yet to take a call if we would bid for RIL and BP’s block,"" an official from state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd, the first of the two people cited above said on condition of anonymity. 
The block covers 635 sq. km and is divided into two parts, A and B. 
In 2011, RIL had announced a “transformational"" deal with UK-based BP Plc, which picked up 30% stake in its 21 oil and gas blocks. However, since 2012, both companies have been pruning their portfolio, relinquishing unviable blocks.
RIL now holds only four blocks—KG-D6 block in the Krishna Godavari basin; Mahanadi basin blocks NEC-25 and GS-01 in Saurashtra basin; and Panna-Mukta-Tapti oil and gas fields in the Arabian Sea. 
“Crude oil prices are again on the rise and it may be difficult for RIL to find a buyer for the field now. Though we assessed the block’s data, we are not participating in the sale bids,"" the exploration director from an exploration and production company, the second person cited above, said on condition of anonymity.
RIL has also sold all its 16 overseas conventional oil and gas exploration blocks, that it acquired over the last few years. 
In its international portfolio, RIL now holds two shale gas assets in the US. In October 2017, RIL agreed to sell the first of its shale gas ventures—upstream Marcellus shale gas assets in North-Eastern and central Pennsylvania in the US—for $126 million. 
Between 2010 and 2013, RIL bought stakes in three upstream oil exploration joint ventures with Chevron, Pioneer Natural Resource, and Carrizo Oil and Gas; and a midstream joint venture with Pioneer. Midstream refers to the processing, storing, transporting and marketing of hydrocarbons. 
Last week, RIL through its subsidiaries Reliance Eagleford Upstream Holding LP and Reliance Holding USA, agreed to sell part of its interest in Eagle Ford shale assets to Sundance Energy Inc. for $100 million.

While Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's (Trai’s) latest order on tariff rules has given the green signal to Reliance Jio to continue with its promotional offers, the company could find it challenging to acquire new customers unlike a year ago when it garnered most of its subscriber base from small telecom players. With most of the consolidation already completed or on the verge of completion, large telecom firms could find it challenging to acquire new customers at the same pace as before.

New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL) entertainment play just got bigger.

New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL) entertainment play just got bigger. Last week, the Mukesh Ambani-led company announced an integration with leading music app Saavn for its digital music service JioMusic, with the former’s implied valuation in the combined $1 billion entity estimated at $670 million. 
The move comes at a time when the audio streaming market is growing rapidly in India. According to the Ficci-EY media and entertainment (M&E) industry report 2017, the number of music app downloads went up from 205 million in 2016 to 400 million in 2017. While Jio had focused on video until now, media analysts said that with the launch of Amazon Prime Music recently and contenders like Gaana already in the field, they have to grow their music pipeline.
“Overall it’s a positive development for the industry. As more people use legal streaming services, we can build a strong revenue opportunity for artistes and creators, while also making a healthy business for platforms. We expect the current 120 million user market to grow to 300-400 million in the next few years,"" said Prashan Agarwal, chief executive officer, Gaana.
However, there is more to the Jio move than just conquering the audio streaming segment. It comes on the back of RIL’s decision to buy a 5% stake in film company Eros International Plc last month, in addition to existing stakes in production houses Balaji Telefilms and Roy Kapur Films acquired in the last eight months, which will effectively make it India’s biggest content provider, said industry experts.
Jio did not respond to Mint’s queries.
“Of course RIL is looking at media and entertainment in a big way. Eros was a logical partner for it given its Hindi and regional movie slate and the digital presence with Eros Now and its originals,"" said Jyoti Deshpande, former group chief executive officer and managing director at Eros, and now head of the media and entertainment business at RIL as president of the chairman’s office. “Opportunities will unfold with time and we’re keeping an open mind to bring the two forces together and see how we can integrate investments,"" she said.
What Deshpande calls “a big boys’ game"" with huge influx of money into the industry as a whole, is a story of content and consolidation in the Indian entertainment market, evidently led by firms like Reliance for its 4G mobile network operator Jio. 
Telecom operator Airtel has committed to long-term content strategies too, with the telco’s alliances with over-the-top (OTT) platforms like HOOQ, Eros and SonyLIV and its entire content catalogue available on its 360-channel housing video streaming service Airtel TV.
“There are a couple of reasons telcos in India are getting into content,"" said Sameer Batra, chief executive officer at Wynk, Airtel’s music app. “First because the ecosystem in the country is getting really conducive in terms of accessible devices and pricing. Second, there is a direct correlation between consumer loyalty to a telco and its product offerings like music.""
Batra said Airtel thinks of itself as an aggregator of the best content that can be offered to consumers today. Similarly for Reliance, the latest deal is essentially a logical progression—while an Eros blockbuster, a Viacom18 television serial (Viacom18 is a subsidiary of Network18 owned by RIL)) and an ALT web series will now be available on its OTT video service, Saavn’s established music library will feed the audio segment. All of this for RIL to sustain the big bet on telecommunication and 4G with Jio.
“Telco and content are not mutually exclusive. If I produce a film and show it only on my network, how will I monetize it?"" said veteran film producer Amit Khanna. “In the digital value chain, Reliance is seeing entertainment as part of its expansion plan. And it has the money which others don’t, it’s as simple as that,"" he said.
Reliance launched its LTE mobile network operator Jio in 2016. By November 2017, it accounted for a 14.5% share of India’s wireless telecom market for the second quarter of the year, besides revenues of Rs6,140 crore for the September quarter and an implied paid subscriber base of around 131 million. In July last year, RIL acquired a 24.92% stake in Ekta Kapoor’s Balaji Telefilms Ltd in a deal worth Rs413.28 crore, an investment that Balaji said would be utilized to further speed up content development initiatives, especially for ALT, Balaji’s video streaming platform that aims to create 250-plus hours of original content a year.
In September, Reliance announced a multi-year digital content deal with Roy Kapur Films for the latter to produce exclusive long and short-form content as “Jio originals"". Roy Kapur Films was launched by Kapur in mid last year to produce feature films and original digital content. In January this year, TV18 Broadcast Ltd took operational control of Viacom18 Media Pvt. Ltd, raising its stake in the company to 51%, a move that the company said would position it better for affiliates like Jio.
Kapur did not respond to Mint’s queries for the story, while ALT refused to comment.
“Ever since it launched its 4G services, Reliance has spelt out telecommunication and media convergence as a clear goal,"" said a media analyst, on the condition of anonymity. “For 4G to be economically viable, the company needs its data consumption to grow and the best way to get that to happen is video and audio. It’s therefore in Reliance’s interest to drive video consumption which in turn, boils down to content.""
The problem is, media industry experts point out, it’s difficult to get exclusive content in India. That is where firms like Viacom18, Balaji and Eros with a steady stream of movie and digital output come in. Eros, for instance, is not only one of the biggest movie studios in the country but has also forayed into digital business with its streaming service Eros Now expected to touch 6-8 million subscribers by March.
The trend is obvious, there is a major play that Reliance has in Jio where it is looking at multiple content pipes, said Ajit Andhare, chief operating officer, Viacom18 Motion Pictures. “I think it’s (such investments) an absolutely sensible thing to do and it only creates more synergy for the larger company (Reliance) though ultimately the important thing will be that each of the companies generate value in its own domain. And that is what we are focused on, that at Viacom18, we make a difference as a studio,"" he said. 
Further, appointments like Deshpande and Ajit Thakur (former head of Eros’ franchise division, Trinity Pictures and now head of film studios at Reliance) at RIL is an indication of how committed Reliance is to the M&E sector, analysts say. 
“There is obviously a strategic interest in investing in media and entertainment but there is a pattern here, after ensuring a presence on OTT and broadcast networks, this could be a bid to get into film production and distribution,"" said Girish Dwibhashyam, head-content at movie streaming service Spuul. “That would complete the entertainment ecosystem for them. If it was just about content, they could have done a licensing deal with Eros.""
Deshpande added that consolidation is the need of the hour in the Indian film industry that faces an urgent need to grow and scale up. Combined with the emergence of around 30 OTT platforms and evolving audience tastes, traditional movie production in Bollywood, in no exaggerated terms, is in a crisis, as evident in the 10-15% fall in theatrical collections in 2017 compared to 2016. The only recourse, experts said, is to look at players who have deep pockets and can continue experimentation.
“Clearly, there has been a lot of disruption, market sentiments and consumer behaviour are constantly changing. A lot of testing is happening at this time and it’s not always possible to do these things with a smaller budget,"" the analyst mentioned above said. “So size, scale, balance and creativity need to come together which will happen through these deals. To be able to revive the Bollywood segment, you need an entity that will leave no stone unturned to make sure the plan it has will work. And what Jio can achieve with its predatory pricing and deep pockets is incomparable right now."""

785,2018-04-03,Reliance,"For now, Reliance Jio's aggressive stance with regards to free content is clearly aimed at customer retention; monetization seems to be the last thing on its mind

Content is king, until you ask customers to pay for it. India’s largest telecom companies are discovering this the hard way. They have been announcing a plethora of deals with content providers. Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd have announced tie-ups with Hotstar, Amazon Prime, Discovery Communications, etc., while Reliance Industries Ltd and its subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd have gone a step further and even acquired stakes in some content providers.  
Content is king, until you ask customers to pay for it. India’s largest telecom companies are discovering this the hard way. They have been announcing a plethora of deals with content providers. Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd have announced tie-ups with Hotstar, Amazon Prime, Discovery Communications, etc., while Reliance Industries Ltd and its subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd have gone a step further and even acquired stakes in some content providers. 
But while investments are rising, there is no sign yet of monetization. If anything, telcos seem to be headed in the reverse direction. Reliance Jio said over the weekend that existing Prime members needn’t pay anything to access its plethora of apps, which it says is worth Rs10,000. In the last fiscal year, it had collected Rs99 from these subscribers for a Prime membership.
That represents a loss of Rs7 in terms of average revenue per user (Arpu), which is about 5.7% of the Arpu the company generates from its flagship plan. While Reliance Jio’s investments on content are larger, the fact is that costs in acquiring content have increased for all companies. And with Reliance Jio handing over content for free for an entire year, incumbents will be forced to do the same.
This column pointed out last month that telcos are being squeezed at both ends, with lower tariffs on the one hand and rising investments on the other. Add content to the list of growing investments. And as the chart above shows, the market for digital video advertising is tiny compared to the telecom industry’s size. The only hope is to charge subscription fees to recoup investments in content, although that looks like a far cry. 
For now, Reliance Jio’s aggressive stance with regards to free content is clearly aimed at customer retention; monetization seems to be the last thing on its mind.
For perspective, Reliance Jio’s and its parent’s investments in acquiring stakes in content providers have thus far added up to less than $1 billion, according to analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd. This is a fraction of the total investment of around $40 billion in the Reliance Jio project. As such, it wouldn’t be in a tearing hurry to monetize content and recoup its investments in that space. It’s far more important to retain and grow its subscriber base to recoup the far larger investments in its data network.
In this backdrop, other telcos have no option but to match Reliance Jio’s content offerings at as low a cost as possible. “We like Airtel’s approach of being a content aggregator rather than investing heavily in content,"" analysts at BNP Paribas Securities India Pvt. Ltd said in a 12 March note to clients.
Even so, there is a non-trivial cost attached with providing free content, which will add to incumbents’ margin woes. For companies that create content, it’s still a win-win, what with telco carriers outdoing each other in bringing content to their subscriber base. Maybe, just maybe, Reliance Jio is doing the smart thing by investing in the companies where it sources content."
783,2018-04-04,Reliance,"Reliance Jio's continued focus on expanding its subscriber base, via tariff cuts, offers and free Jio Prime membership, mayreflectin a weak quarter for Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular

Mumbai: Competition in the telecom industry, which has led to consolidation in the sector, is unlikely to abate in the coming quarters, as Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd continues to focus on subscriber acquisition and retention, according to recent reports from top equity research firms. 
Mumbai: Competition in the telecom industry, which has led to consolidation in the sector, is unlikely to abate in the coming quarters, as Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd continues to focus on subscriber acquisition and retention, according to recent reports from top equity research firms.
Jio’s ambition to gain and retain subscribers was evident in its aggressive pricing at the beginning of the year and the firm’s current move to extend Jio Prime benefits for no fee, said a 2 April Morgan Stanley research report on the Indian telecom sector.
Reliance Jio had on 30 March extended membership for the 175 million existing users of the Jio Prime loyalty programme for another year for free. Jio Prime membership costs Rs99 for new members.
Jio Prime membership gives registered Reliance Jio users access to a suite of applications and services for free, including live TV channels, movies and music, higher data benefits as well as lower tariffs.
“Clearly, Reliance Jio’s focus continues to be on subscriber acquisition and retention in the near term,"" the Morgan Stanley report said, adding, “Charging prime fee for existing users could have possibly resulted in some subscriber churn for Reliance Jio.""
Morgan Stanley expects a 7% impact on Reliance Jio’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) for financial year 2018-19, from extending Prime benefits to its existing subscriber base.
Reliance Jio, which currently has over 175 million customers, doubled its telecom market share to 13.71% as on 31 December 2017, from 6.40% a year ago, regulatory data shows.
A Reliance Jio spokesperson said most of its customers are Jio Prime members and non-Prime members account for a negligible part of the company’s subscriber base.
A report by Citi Research on 1 April said the competitive intensity of the telecom sector is unlikely to abate anytime soon.
“As the industry consolidates owing to smaller telco closures, we expect the top 3 telcos to continue to focus on grabbing subscriber share,"" said the Citi Research report on India Telecom.
“While the latest announcement from Jio doesn’t indicate another flare-up on pricing (it is broadly along expected lines), we think a pricing recovery is unlikely in the near term,"" it added.
Meanwhile, leading incumbents like Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd/Vodafone India Ltd have continued to match Reliance Jio’s tariffs for its existing 4G (fourth generation) users via segmented offers.
“Jio’s pricing moves in the month of January 2018, impact of international termination rate (ITR) cut effective February 1, 2018, and continued ARPU (average revenue per user) downtrading are likely to reflect in another quarter of sharp sequential revenue decline for the incumbents,"" said a Kotak Institutional Equities report on Telecom (India) dated 2 April.
We expect the January-March 2018 quarter to be another weak quarter for the wireless incumbents, the report said, adding that the brokerage expects a 8-9% quarter-on-quarter decline in ARPU for Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular.
“Jio’s pricing moves in the month of January 2018, even as the incumbents (barring Bharti to some extent) have not responded with headline price cuts, each of them has been forced to cut prices selectively,"" the Kotak Institutional Equities report said, adding that the brokerage ARPU forecast for Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular for Jan-March 2018 quarter stands at Rs115 (down 8.6% on quarter) and Rs104 (down 9% on quarter) respectively.
A JP Morgan report on Reliance Industries Ltd (Jio’s parent company) dated 2 April states Reliance Jio’s investments in content are expected to remain elevated as currently most of the content is third party-owned.
Expect more spending on content, and hence overall capital expenditure for Jio should remain elevated, the report said.
“While Jio continues to add subscribers and the Jio Phone would allow it to gain a larger share of the lower end ARPU market, the focus has now shifted to monetizing the high-end subscriber base beyond the telecom tariffs,"" the JP Morgan report said. 
“While Jio’s subscriber base has very high data usage, the focus for Jio would now be to shift the data usage towards its content offerings and eventually monetize the content offering,"" the report added."

In light of the rising global concerns about drug-resistant infections and India’s plan to eradicate tuberculosis by 2025, this is bad news.
Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a growing problem facing the country as affected patients increased by 13% in 2016, even as total deaths from tuberculosis fell. Widespread consumption of antibiotics is a primary driver of drug resistance.
Drug-resistant infections are difficult to treat because the most-effective forms of medication do not work on the patient and much longer treatments are required.

Mumbai: Companies owned by billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Sunil Bharti Mittal may raise as much as Rs36,500 crore ($5.6 billion) selling bonds as the telecom titans build a war chest in what investors hope will be the home stretch in India’s bruising tariff war.
Mittal-controlled Bharti Airtel Ltd, which sold its first-ever rupee bond of Rs3,000 crore last month, has approval to raise Rs16,500 crore, according to a March 12 filing. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd announced days later that it plans to sell as much as Rs20,000 crore of notes, marking the disruptive upstart’s return to the onshore bond market after 20 months.
The fundraising amount—about 78% of the total outstanding bonds of India’s top four telecom firms—signal that the largest carrier and its rival Jio are gearing to roll out next-generation services and manage about Rs32,000 crore of debt due in the next five years. Jio stormed into the mobile-phone market in 2016 with free services that set off a tariff war and forced smaller players to merge or exit.
“After four years of intense price pain, the India telecom battle could be in its last stretch,"" said Raj Kothari, head of trading at Jay Capital Ltd in London. “It’s down to the big boys and they are piling up funds for that.""
Emails sent to Bharti Airtel and Jio spokesmen seeking details on use of funds went unanswered.
Bharti Airtel said in the filing that the money would be used for treasury activities, including refinancing, and for paying off spectrum dues. Jio hasn’t specified end use, though it has significant repayments due in the next few years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Jio, being a new player, needs to spend aggressively to grab market share, while Bharti Airtel is investing more to retain its lead, said Mehul Sukkawala, senior director for corporate ratings at S&P Global Ratings. “This competition could move to the fibre-to-home business in the future and the related bundling of services with fibre.""
Jio secured AAA rating for 150 billion rupees of debentures last week from Crisil Ltd, a unit of S&P Global, which cited the “irrevocable and unconditional"" support from parent Reliance Industries Ltd. India’s most valuable company has invested at least $31 billion in the telecom venture. Crisil rates Bharti Airtel’s rupee notes at AA+.

New Delhi: In a partial relief to Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), the Supreme Court on Thursday cancelled a March order of the Bombay high court that had rejected the company’s appeal of an order from an arbitration tribunal barring the sale or transfer of its assets.
Accordingly, RCom is at liberty to proceed with the sale of spectrum, media convergence nodes (MCN) and real estate (at New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Jigni and Tirupati) that were previously under challenge.
“It is not a block sale. The court has today paved way for sale of the spectrum, MCNs and real estate,"" Punit Garg, executive director of RCom, said in an interview after the court order. Other people aware of the developments have however, maintained that the asset sale is a block deal.
The top court also rejected the plea of Reliance Infratel, a subsidiary of RCom, and the State Bank of India (SBI) challenging an order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that stayed an asset sale to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. A two-judge bench headed by justice A.K. Goel asked the parties to approach the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in accordance with law. RCom is likely to move the appellate forum on Friday. 
“As legally advised, and based on the order of the Hon’ble SC as above, RCom is confident of securing appropriate relief from the NCLAT to enable sales of tower and fibre assets to also be completed at the earliest. The claim of the minority investors (which is fully disputed by RCom) can, in any case, be a maximum of approx. Rs200-300 crore from the sales proceeds,"" a RCom spokesperson said. 
RCom had moved the top court on 19 March seeking a stay on orders of the Bombay high court and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Mumbai bench, barring it from selling its wireless assets to Reliance Jio without prior approval. The company was joined by SBI which approached the court on 20 March seeking approval for the sale of RCom’s assets to Reliance Jio. 
The tribunal was hearing a petition filed by offshore investors of Reliance Infratel led by HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd, which are alleging oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement. While RCom owes a total of Rs45,000 crore to its lenders, total dues to SBI as on 28 February stood at Rs4,027 crore. On 8 March, the high court had rejected RCom’s appeal against an order of an arbitration tribunal barring the sale or transfer of its assets without prior permission. The tribunal had passed the interim order on a plea by Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson for recovery of Rs1,012 crore from RCom.
Ericsson being an unsecured creditor, through its counsel, C.A. Sundaram, said, “It is not that we don’t have any rights. I have the right to recovery. This cannot be a private transaction; one brother selling to another.""
“Am I to be left in the lurch like this? After they sell the assets, they will say that they don’t have money left to pay us,"" he remarked. He added that its rights were being defeated and being a small company, it would suffer irreparably. It was observed by the court that as unsecured creditors, it (Ericsson) could not be deprived of its statutory rights.
This was opposed by Mukul Rohtagi, representing RCom who told the court, “Even under civil law or commercial law, secured creditors are above unsecured creditors"".

New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s disruptive entry in September 2016 led to $10 billion in annual savings for consumers and will expand India’s per capita GDP by about 5.65%, says a report of Institute for Competitiveness (IFC), a Gurugram-based Indian unit of the Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness at Harvard Business School. 
New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s disruptive entry in September 2016 led to $10 billion in annual savings for consumers and will expand India’s per capita GDP by about 5.65%, says a report of Institute for Competitiveness (IFC), a Gurugram-based Indian unit of the Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness at Harvard Business School.
Reliance Jio has made data accessible and affordable, with average prices per GB dropping to Rs10 from Rs152, bringing the internet within the reach of a larger proportion of the Indian population. Such a drastic reduction in data prices has also allowed newer segments of society to use and experience internet for the first time.
Reliance Jio is the telecom venture of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd.
“As per our calculations, even the most conservative estimate shows that due to Reliance Jio’s entry, the annual financial savings to the consumers would be to the tune of $10 billion,"" said the IFC report. 
According to the report, econometric analysis shows that through widespread network effects, Reliance Jio’s entry would boost India’s GDP by about 5.65%, if everything else in the Indian economy remains constant.
The effect on GDP growth due to higher internet penetration will not just be a contribution of the telecom sector but also the various externalities that arise out of the internet economy, it said.
IFC analysed Reliance Jio’s entry to measure the impact of internet penetration on economic growth. The model used data from 18 states from 2004-14 and showed that a 10% increase in internet penetration led to per capita GDP rising by 3.9%, if all else remains constant.
“Since Jio’s entry into the Indian telecom markets on September 2016, the face of the industry has not remained the same. It changed the basis of competition by offering free lifetime calling to its consumers in an industry that derived 75% of its revenue from voice,"" the report said.
Within six months of Reliance Jio’s launch, India became the highest mobile data user in the world consuming over 1 billion GB data every month as compared to 200 million GB earlier.
By the end of 2017, Reliance Jio users on an average consume almost 10 GB data, 700 minutes of voice and 134 hours of video every month.
“Data usage in the country has soared. India is now only second to China in terms of app downloads. Such levels of digital consumption were unprecedented a year-and-a-half ago,"" it said.
Stating that before Reliance Jio’s entry there were hardly many avenues where such high levels of data could be expended by a consumer, the report said.
Reliance Jio offers its consumers a wide bouquet of digital applications that address a variety of consumer needs ranging from education, health, entertainment and banking.
“All of these services form a part of the digital platform through which Jio aims to address multiple socio-economic needs of its customers,"" it added."

New Delhi: Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) on Friday said the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had passed an interim order to allow the company to execute its Rs25,000 crore asset sale programme. 
The development comes a day after the Supreme Court cancelled a Bombay high court order that had stayed the sale of the telecom firm’s assets. 
“By an interim order... the NCLAT has vacated the remaining stay, and allowed execution of sale deeds and deposit of the proceeds with SBI (State Bank of India) in an escrow account. Based on these orders, RCom can now proceed with completion of its entire asset monetization plan, covering spectrum, towers, fibre, MCNs (media convergence nodes) and real estate,"" an RCom spokesperson said in a statement.

An NCLAT bench comprising S.J. Mukopadhaya was hearing Reliance Group unit Reliance Infratel’s appeal against an order of the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal, which prohibited it from selling its assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
The 12 March stay order was passed in a plea by offshore investors of Reliance Infratel led by HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd, alleging oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement for not taking their consent for the asset sale as per the articles of association of the company. 
U.K. Chaudhary, appearing for Reliance Infratel, submitted that the sale had to be given effect as soon as possible as the value of assets was depreciating by the day. 
The money received from the sale would be used to pay off Reliance Group companies’ Rs45,000 crore debt owed to various banks, he stated.

On 6 April, without vacating the stay on the sale and transfer of Reliance Infratel Ltd’s tower and fibre assets, NCLAT had allowed lenders led by the State Bank of India (SBI) to go ahead with the deal in favour of Reliance Jio Infocomm. 
However, NCLAT chairperson justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya asked the joint lenders' forum to deposit the sale proceeds in a separate escrow account. It also directed the parties to cooperate with the execution of sale deeds if SBI intends to.

NCLAT’s order of 6 April had come a day after the Supreme Court set aside a Bombay high court order that had stayed the sale of the telecom firm’s assets. 
While RCom owes a total of Rs45,000 crore to its lenders, total dues to SBI as on 28 February stood at Rs4,027 crore.
In December 2017, as a part of its debt resolution plan, Anil Ambani-led RCom struck a Rs25,000 crore deal with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio for the sale of its assets mortgaged with different banks, to avoid insolvency proceedings.
The matter will be heard on 19 April.
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in the Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case."

New Delhi: Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd (ONGC) and Reliance Industries Ltd have started discussions with buyers to sell natural gas from their fields in the Bay of Bengal that are expected to start production over the next three years. 
New Delhi: Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd (ONGC) and Reliance Industries Ltd have started discussions with buyers to sell natural gas from their fields in the Bay of Bengal that are expected to start production over the next three years.
The plan is to transport the gas from the east coast to the industrial heart belt of Gujarat, an ONGC executive told Reuters.
“We want to use the pipeline to reach customers in West India to sell gas from the KG basin. We are talking to some of them for contracts,"" Shashi Shankar, chairman and managing director of ONGC, said on the margins of the International Energy Forum.
ONGC plans to use Reliance Industries’ 1,375 km pipeline connecting Kakinada on the east coast to Bharuch in Gujarat in the west. 
Shankar said ONGC is committed to bring east coast gas onstream by 2019 onwards and ramp up production to around 15 million standard cubic metres per day (mscmd).
“We are discussing with customers on a regular basis...,"" he said.
Reliance built the pipeline in 2009, but has been operating at very low capacity utilisation for several years due to a drastic fall in output from the company’s venture in the Krishna-Godavari basin in the Bay of Bengal.
Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries and partner BP Plc, which together own three natural gas fields next to ONGC’s in the east coast, has also started discussions with customers to market the natural gas, Sashi Mukundan, BP’s country head and regional president for India, told Reuters last week.
The RIL-BP joint venture is offering customers contracts ranging from a 10-year tenure, to 5- and 3-year, Mukundan said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target to increase the share of gas in India’s energy mix to 15% by 2030 from below 6.5% now.
The government in February approved a plan by Reliance Industries and its partner BP to develop two new fields in the Krishna-Godavari basin.
This approval followed an earlier clearance to develop another field called R-Series in the basin.
“At peak, 2022, we will produce 35 mscmd and would contribute almost 10% to country’s demand,"" Mukundan said.
The long term contracts that Reliance-BP joint venture is offering is a sign the companies are committed to fulfilling their contracts, Mukundan said.
“If we cannot deliver from our field, we will import and deliver,"" he said. Between 2021 and 2023, India would be hitting at a level which will be 50 mscmd incremental. So India would be producing in the range of 140 mscmd per day, said Atanu Chakraborty, said the head of Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), India’s upstream regulator.
India’s current total consumption of natural gas at end of March 2018 stood at 145 mscmd. Reuters"

New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has subsumed three wholly owned subsidiaries, which owned at least half-a-dozen Reliance Jio apps, into the parent company effective 1 April with the aim of building a single in-house media team, two people aware of the development said. 
New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has subsumed three wholly owned subsidiaries, which owned at least half-a-dozen Reliance Jio apps, into the parent company effective 1 April with the aim of building a single in-house media team, two people aware of the development said.
“All the app companies have been moved to RIL... for example, JioChat was a separate legal entity under Reliance Jio Messaging Services...now moved to RIL,"" one of the persons cited above said, on condition of anonymity.
Reliance Jio Digital Services Pvt. Ltd, Reliance Jio Media Pvt. Ltd, and Reliance Jio Messaging Services Pvt. Ltd—all wholly owned subsidiaries of RIL—ran apps such as MyJio, Jio4Gvoice, JioTV, JioMusic, JioChat, JioMags, and JioCinema.
“The idea is that Reliance Jio (Infocomm Ltd) would purely be telecom (related)...rest everything in RIL...effective 1 April,"" the person added.
An email sent to Reliance Jio remained unanswered till press time.
The move also comes close on the heels of RIL’s latest string of acquisitions in the content space.
Last month, RIL announced an integration with leading music app Saavn for its digital music service JioMusic, with the JioMusic’s implied valuation in the combined $1-billion entity estimated at $670 million. 
Before this, in February, Reliance Industries announced that it would buy a 5% stake in film company Eros International Plc. 
“The idea is...we are building a new in-house media team and all of the content ecosystem, including apps, would come under a single umbrella...eventually, maybe, even Network18,"" the second person cited above said, also on condition that he isn’t named.
Jyoti Deshpande, a former group chief executive officer and managing director at Eros, who has joined as the head of the media and entertainment business at Reliance Industries, is currently driving the company’s initiatives to build businesses around the content ecosystem such as broadcasting, films, sports, music, digital, gaming and animation.
Last week, Reliance Jio also announced the launch of a live mobile game ‘Jio Cricket Play Along’ and a comedy-meets-cricket show ‘Jio Dhan Dhana Dhan LIVE’.
While ‘Jio Cricket Play Along’ can be accessed by all smartphone users in India, ‘Jio Dhan Dhana Dhan LIVE’ would have original live episodes, releasing every Friday, Saturday and Sunday on the MyJio app.
In July last year, RIL acquired a 24.92% stake in Ekta Kapoor’s Balaji Telefilms Ltd in a deal worth Rs413.28 crore, an investment that Balaji said would be utilized to speed up content development initiatives, especially for its subscription-based online streaming service ALTBalaji, to compete with other OTT (over-the-top) service providers.
Reliance Jio entered the telecom sector in September 2016 with free offerings and later announced ultra-cheap tariffs, which hit the revenue streams of other operators including market leader Bharti Airtel. 
With data tariffs falling, consumption has soared. According to data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), for October-December 2017, the average data usage per subscriber per month was 1,945MB, much higher than 878MB in October-December 2016.
To cash in on this growing data consumption, Reliance Jio’s rival Airtel, too, has inked deals with OTT platforms with Airtel TV featuring content from Hooq, Eros Now, and Hotstar.
Last month, Airtel and ALTBalaji announced a partnership to bring digital content from the latter’s portfolio to Airtel TV app users. This comes after Airtel in December launched a new version of its Airtel TV app with a wider content offering and a new user interface."

Chicago: Boeing Co. chief executive officer (CEO) Dennis Muilenburg highlighted the company’s deep roots in space exploration with a playful jab at up-and-comer Elon Musk.
The aerospace titan doesn’t plan to launch cars into the heavens anytime soon, Muilenburg said at a Politico Space Forum. But “we might pick up the one out there and bring it back,"" he said.
It was an apparent dig at the cherry-red Tesla Roadster, with a mannequin astronaut behind the wheel, that Musk launched into space on the first flight of Space Exploration Technologies Corp.’s powerful Falcon Heavy rocket in early February.
The budding rivalry between the companies is anything but playful, however. Musk’s SpaceX is remaking rocketry by undercutting established rivals such as United Launch Alliance, a Boeing-Lockheed Martin Corp. venture, with low prices and reusable rocket boosters that tamp down costs. Musk has also outlined an audacious agenda for colonizing Mars, stoking Muilenburg’s competitive fire over who would build the first rocket to reach the planet.
Boeing, which has been building spacecraft since the 1960s, has intensified its investment in advanced space technology under Muilenburg, 54, an engineer by training and the rare Fortune 50 CEO who is a company lifer.
Space investments
There’s the Phantom Express, an experimental reusable craft that Boeing is developing with the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to air launch small satellites. Then there’s the support from Boeing’s venture-capital arm for an Australian maker of nanosatellites. On Wednesday, Boeing announced an in Reaction Engines, a UK company developing a hybrid engine capable of flying at Mach 25 for space flight.
Boeing and SpaceX are also working on rival commercial capsules to take humans into orbit under a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) program that aims to end the US reliance on Russian rockets to send astronauts to orbit. Both companies are behind schedule as they race to begin flights to the International Space Station before Nasa runs out of purchased seats aboard Soyuz craft at the end of 2019.
The CEOs are training their sights on travel to Mars, as well, in what could become the ultimate space race. SpaceX is assembling tools for an enormous rocket nicknamed the BFR. Boeing is a subcontractor for the Space Launch System, a new, government-funded rocket family. And Muilenburg thinks Nasa should take the lead and leave industry to focus on commercializing space travel closer to Earth.
With the first of the powerful spacecraft under construction, Muilenburg, sees momentum and technology forming that could make the dream of a human setting foot on Mars a reality within his lifetime. In fact, he said, he’s “hopeful"" it will happen within a decade.
The race is on. Bloomberg"

New Delhi: India is reducing its dependence on Russia for critical defence programs, with the joint venture BrahMos missile set to be guided by a locally-developed target tracking device in the next year. 
New Delhi: India is reducing its dependence on Russia for critical defence programs, with the joint venture BrahMos missile set to be guided by a locally-developed target tracking device in the next year.
India’s defence scientists have developed a new indigenous system that identifies missile targets to replace the Russian-developed seeker on all future BrahMos, Sudhir K. Mishra, the chief executive officer of BrahMos Aerospace said.
“Our objective is to make use of the Indian seeker on all future BrahMos missiles,"" Mishra said in an interview on the sidelines of India’s defence show, DefExpo, on Wednesday in Chennai. “The Russians say if the Indians supply a cheaper, cost-effective and reliable seeker, then let us take it from India.""
There are also plans to use a locally-made warhead on the missile, he said, without specifying a time frame.
Russia accounted for 68% of India’s arms import from 2012 to 2016, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It’s been the largest defence supplier to India since the 1960s when the MiG-21 supersonic fighter jets were bought to equip the Indian Air Force (IAF). These were then license-produced at the state-held Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) until recently, when India began to junk the MiG jets and plan a complete phase out of the aircraft by 2022.
Military modernization
As Prime Minister Narendra Modi pushes ahead with his military modernization process with a targeted $250 billion spend over 10 years till 2025, India has widened the scope of its arms purchases to include equipment from the US. In the last two years, the US has emerged as India’s top defence supplier. Since 2007, the US has won defence orders from India worth $17 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
India is preparing to test an anti-ship version of the seeker sometime in October-November this year, Mishra said. A successful second test would allow it to go into production soon after.
Hypersonic development
In the next five years BrahMos Aerospace plans to develop the hypersonic BrahMos missile that can achieve speeds of 5 Mach, or five times the speed of sound, Mishra said. The Indian-Russian joint venture is working on overcoming the technological challenges involved in achieving hypersonic speeds for the present Mach 2.8 missile.
BrahMos is also working to extend the missile’s range to 800 km, he said, without giving a time frame. In March 2017, after India formally joined the international Missile Technology Control Regime, BrahMos successfully tested an extended range of 400 km for the missile. Bloomberg"

Mumbai: Mukesh Ambani’s plan to roll out broadband internet services to Indian households this year under Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has the potential to alter the segment’s competitive landscape, says credit rating company S&P Global Ratings.
The new service may add $5 billion to parent company Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL) valuation, according to CLSA India. The brokerage firm anticipates a Rs4,000 boost to RIL’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in three years on the back of the plan.
“In the past, fiber-to-home was not the primary focus for telecom players in India as they were pursuing growth in the wireless business,"" Mehul Sukkawala, senior director for corporate ratings at S&P Global Ratings said in an email. Sukkawala sees Reliance Jio’s financial muscle being able to change that.
Reliance Jio upended the Indian telecom industry, after its entry in 2016, forcing rivals to merge or exit. It posted its first profit in the October-December quarter, almost 16 months, after provoking a price war with free calling and data.
Reliance may use an aggressive customer pull strategy even in the broadband services space, as it did with the mobile business, CLSA India said in an 10 April note. “It already offers high-speed broadband in select urban areas as a free service, possibly to seed clients and get insights into usage patterns,"" according to the note.

Telecom industry revenues will decline by 9% to $21.6 billion in the current fiscal year 2018-19 as incumbents continue to calibrate offers to match plans of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, noted Deutsche Bank in a report.
Deutsche Bank said it expects the to-be-merged entity of Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone Group’s India unit to have a 37% revenue share in the next fiscal year of 2019-20. Bharti Airtel Ltd and Reliance Jio will have 36% and 25%, respectively.
The bank cut price target for Bharti Airtel to Rs475 from Rs595 and to Rs105 from Rs130 for Idea Cellular, saying the two companies traded at FY20E EV/EBITDA of 6.0x and 7.4x, respectively, below their long-term levels leaving room for valuation catch-up on earnings recovery.
Deutsche Bank forecast Bharti Airtel’s consolidated revenue to achieve a three-year compound annual growth rate of 9.7%, driven by 11.9% and 3% growth in India and Africa businesses, respectively.
Bharti Airtel’s expected growth in India is largely driven by the exit of most weak players from Reliance Jio’s entry and that Bharti Airtel has been at the forefront of buying these assets at distressed valuations, noted the report adding that its robust spectrum portfolio and growth in 4G data will continue to aid its cost leadership in India.
On Idea and Vodafone India, the bank said market continues to underestimate the to-be-merged entity’s market position."

We have been informed that our plan did not meet with the approval of the Committee of Creditors of Alok Industries as required under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,"" Reliance Industries said. 
The reason for rejection and the next course of action for Alok Industries were not known immediately. 
For Alok Industries, the 270-day deadline prescribed under IBC to approve the resolution plan ended on 14 April.

New Delhi: After disrupting the wireless telecom sector, Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is set to make fibre-to-home its next battleground with the formal commercial launch likely towards the end of this year.
“Jio’s main focus now is fibre to home...it has reached a sizeable base of wireless subscribers at 168 million...all efforts now are to successfully deploy wired internet to homes...the full-fledged commercial launch is likely to be announced on 28 December, which happens to be late Dhirubhai Ambani’s birthday,"" a person familiar with the development said seeking anonymity.
Reliance Jio has already initiated beta trials for its wired broadband service across a few locations in the country. It has offered free broadband across regions in New Delhi and Mumbai, with unlimited internet at 100 mbps for a security deposit of Rs4,500.
“We are still deprived as a nation from a fixed mobile standpoint...we have only about 18 million connected homes in India...we would like to see at least 200 million,"" Mathew Oommen, president of network, global strategy and service development at Reliance Jio, had said recently at the CNBC’s Indian Business Leaders Awards.
Brokerage firm CLSA India expects a Rs4,000-crore boost to Reliance’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in three years on the back of the roll-out of broadband internet services, a Bloomberg report said.
The low penetration of wired internet services is another factor that could boost Jio’s efforts. According to Telecom Regulatory of India (Trai) data, as on 31 December, India had only 21.28 million wired internet subscribers, compared with 424.67 million wireless internet subscribers. In the wired internet segment, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) holds a 52.53% market share with 9.38 million subscribers, followed by Bharti Airtel Ltd with a 10.12% market share and Atria Convergence Technologies Pvt. Ltd (ACT) with 6.02% share.
Jio’s focus on fibre also comes with the rise in data usage seen in the past year. According to data from Trai, for October-December 2017, the average data usage per subscriber per month was 1,945 MB, much higher than 878 MB in October-December 2016. To cash in on this surge in data, RIL recently announced an integration with leading music app Saavn for its digital music service JioMusic, apart from separately buying a 5% stake in film firm Eros International Plc.
“Given the huge demand for content, fibre is the better bet than wireless, which can provide only a fraction of the capacity of fibre. Fibre capacity can also be enhanced easily. However, fibre is a tough business: the fibre has to reach every single location physically. That is a nightmare, given the challenges of installing underground fibre. Permissions for digging involve huge costs and delays. However, those who do succeed can expect huge rewards from the market,"" Mahesh Uppal, director at consulting firm ComFirst India, said.
Jio’s rival Airtel provides high-speed wired broadband up to 100 mbps to 2.1 million users across 89 cities in India. As of December end, Airtel’s average revenue per user from its ‘Homes Services’ segment was Rs948. Broadband customers account for 93.5% of its ‘Homes Services’ segment.
“Wired internet is not a pan-India game, Airtel has consciously only focused on regions where it saw good revenue coming in,"" a person aware of the matter said.
Last week, Airtel also upped its game and introduced an all new superfast home broadband plan with speeds of up to 300 mbps at a monthly rental of Rs2,990 with 1,200GB of data. This plan also comes with free subscription to Airtel’s OTT apps—Wynk Music and Airtel TV.
Emails sent to Jio and Airtel seeking details of their broadband expansion plan were unanswered till press time.
Meanwhile, as bigger players capture the pie in metros, cable TV distribution company DEN Networks Ltd has shifted focus on small towns and will push its broadband offerings across tier 2 and tier 3 cities over the next three years by roping in local cable operators to use their existing infrastructure for last-mile delivery of internet.
“The tariff and stress of telcos is as of now is focussed on the main metros. So we have made the game plan for tier 2 and tier 3 cities. We don’t want to be trapped in this (war between telcos),"" DEN Networks chief executive officer S.N. Sharma said in an interview.
According to Trai data, there are 156 internet service providers in the country as of December end and even without its formal presence in the wired internet segment, Jio has the lion’s share of overall internet subscribers with 35.9% of the market share followed by Bharti Airtel at 22.12%."

New Delhi: French company Dassault Aviation SA will continue its joint venture with Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group to manufacture aircraft components despite the latter being embroiled in litigation in India, slowing down its activities. 
New Delhi: French company Dassault Aviation SA will continue its joint venture with Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group to manufacture aircraft components despite the latter being embroiled in litigation in India, slowing down its activities.
In India on a three-day visit, Dassault Aviation chairman and chief executive officer Eric Trappier on Monday also welcomed India’s recent formal request for information for the acquisition of 110 fighter jets for the Indian Air Force. 
Dassault Aviation’s Rafale fighter aircraft was the jet finally shortlisted by the Indian government for procurement of 126 medium-range multi-role aircraft in 2012 but differences over pricing as well as the inability to reach an agreement on technological transfer and doubts over India’s ability to build the plane locally were seen as the main reasons for the cancellation of the deal in 2015. 
India had then announced that it would purchase 36 Rafales under a government-to-government deal with a possible follow-on order for another 36 aircraft. 
On Monday, Trappier said the new request for information (RFI) put out by New Delhi was welcome because it opened new possibilities for manufacturing fighter jets in India by Dassault Aviation. “For this we need a certain quantity of orders because in order to be competitive we need (numbers) so the RFI has now identified 110 aircraft so I think it’s quite a good number. There is a new process, new procedure... so we are welcoming this new request,"" he said. 
Trappier’s visit comes a little more than a week after India initiated the process of acquisition of the new fighter aircraft. Companies like Lockheed Martin and Boeing from the US, Saab from Sweden and Dassault Aviation are among those likely to vie for the deal, worth an estimated $15 billion.
Under the new proposal seeking 110 fighter aircraft for the Indian Air Force, at least 85% of the jets have to be made in India, giving a big push to the Make in India programme. 
 Trappier’s visit also comes a month after French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to India. 
 When asked if Dassault Aviation would continue its partnership with Reliance when bidding for the 110 aircraft under the new RFI issued by the Indian government, Trappier said Dassault was loyal to its partners.

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday stayed a National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order that had allowed for partial sale of assets of Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) to Reliance Jio Infocomm until the tribunal decides on the case. 
New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday stayed a National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order that had allowed for partial sale of assets of Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) to Reliance Jio Infocomm until the tribunal decides on the case.
The top court order effectively halts the RCom-Jio deal worth Rs25,000 crore to the extent of sale of tower and fibre assets.
The Anil Ambani-led RCom can, however, sell or transfer spectrum, media convergence nodes (MCN) and real estate (at New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Jigni and Tirupati) as part of the deal. The case before NCLAT will be heard next on 18 April.
“Stay of NCLAT’s impugned order until final outcome of the case before the tribunal,"" said Justice Rohinton F. Nariman.
He also observed that the order passed by the NCLAT was not passed in the right manner and should not have been passed.
HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd approached the Supreme Court, challenging the NCLAT order of 6 April that had cleared the execution of the RCom-Jio deal.
On 6 April, without vacating the stay on the sale and transfer of Reliance Infratel Ltd’s tower and fibre assets, NCLAT allowed lenders led by the State Bank of India (SBI) to go ahead with the deal in favour of Reliance Jio.
However, NCLAT chairperson justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya asked the joint lenders’ forum to deposit the sale proceeds in a separate escrow account. It also directed the parties to cooperate if SBI intends to execute the sale deed.
“RCom can now proceed with completion of its entire asset monetization plan, covering spectrum, towers, fibre, MCNs (media convergence nodes) and real estate,"" an RCom spokesperson said in a statement.
“Taking into consideration the fact that if the impugned order is stayed it will amount to grant of final relief, while we are not inclined to stay the impugned order for the present, give liberty to SBI/conveners of joint lenders to reach agreement to sale/sale deed with regard to the mortgaged properties of the company with any reliable purchaser and will keep the amount in a separate escrow account, which shall be subject to the decision of the appeal. If SBI intends to execute the sale deed, the parties will cooperate with it,"" the order held.
The appellate tribunal had passed an order on Reliance Group unit Reliance Infratel’s appeal challenging an order of the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which prohibited it from selling its assets to Reliance Jio.
The 12 March stay order by NCLT was passed in a plea by offshore investors of Reliance Infratel led by HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd, alleging oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement for not taking their consent for the asset sale as per the articles of association of the company. NCLAT’s order of 6 April had come a day after the Supreme Court set aside a Bombay high court order that had stayed the sale of the telecom firm’s assets.
While RCom owes a total of Rs45,000 crore to its lenders, total dues to SBI as on 28 February stood at Rs4,027 crore.
In December 2017, as a part of its debt resolution plan, Anil Ambani-led RCom struck a Rs25,000 crore deal with elder brother Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio for the sale of its assets mortgaged with different banks, to avoid insolvency proceedings. RCom shares fell 5.38% to Rs21.10 on BSE, while the benchmark Sensex gained 0.33% to 34,305.43 points.

New Delhi: India’s largest operator by subscriber base and revenue, Bharti Airtel Ltd, will post its financial results for the March quarter on Tuesday evening. Investors will keenly watch out for the company’s comments on the impact of the current tariff war and the recent cut in the international termination charge. 
New Delhi: India’s largest operator by subscriber base and revenue, Bharti Airtel Ltd, will post its financial results for the March quarter on Tuesday evening. Investors will keenly watch out for the company’s comments on the impact of the current tariff war and the recent cut in the international termination charge.
Some brokerages expect the company to post a net loss, its first in 15 years, an Economic Times report dated 4 April said, adding that the Bank of America-Merrill Lynch has estimated the loss at Rs58.5 crore, while Kotak Securities at Rs377 crore.
A UBS research report on the Indian telecom sector dated 13 April expects the January-March period to be weak for incumbent telecom operators on the back of price cuts implemented by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, ARPU (average revenue per user) down trading and reduction in international termination charges.
Companies in the telecom sector have been facing a brutal tariff war after the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016 with six months of free services, followed by rock-bottom tariffs. 
Airtel has since recorded a fall in net profit for five straight quarters as it cut tariffs to take on Jio.
In the quarter ended December, Airtel’s quarterly profit plunged 39%, missing analysts’ estimates, as India’s telecom regulator more than halved interconnection fees and a pricing war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio continued unabated.
“Regulatory fiat in the form of a cut in domestic IUC (interconnection usage charges) rates has exacerbated the industry ARPU (average revenue per user) decline in Q3’18. The recent announcement of reduction in international termination rates will further accentuate this decline and benefit foreign operators with no commensurate benefit to customers,"" Gopal Vittal, managing director and chief executive officer (India and South Asia) at Bharti Airtel, had said in a statement after the company posted results for the December quarter.
The termination charge is payable by an international long-distance operator to the Indian telecom operator on whose network an overseas call terminates. The move is expected to result in an annualized Ebitda hit of Rs500 crore to Bharti Airtel, a report by Kotak Institutional Equities dated 15 January said.
Airtel’s monthly ARPU in India, which fell sharply to Rs123 in the December quarter from Rs172 a year ago, will be another key metric to analysts to assess the company’s revenue generating capabilities in the future.
However, the performance of the Africa unit has saved the company some blushes in the last two quarters."

New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Tuesday asked Bharti Airtel to tweak its ‘T20 cricket Live and Free’ advertisement so that a disclaimer on certain hidden costs are written in bold, and comply with a 13 April order passed by it. 
On 13 April, justice Yogesh Khanna had directed Bharti Airtel to modify, as in an interim measure, the ‘T20 cricket Live and Free’ advertisement to the extent of making the information on data consumption cost more prominent. 
The court was hearing a contempt plea moved by Reliance Jio Infocomm against Bharti Airtel for alleged non-compliance of the 13 April order. 
P. Chidambaram appearing for Bharti Airtel stated that the there had been no instance of non-compliance on behalf of Airtel and submitted a “compliance affidavit"" to the court. 
Reliance Jio had moved the high court on 13 April against Bharti Airtel’s ‘T20 cricket Live and Free’ advertisement, alleging that the advertisement was misleading and deceptive as it failed to inform consumers about the hidden costs. 
Abhishek Manu Singhvi appearing for Reliance Jio had claimed that the Airtel’s claim of providing access to all Indian Premier League (IPL) matches “live and free"" was not true as a user had to pay for the data consumed for streaming the matches by subscribing to one of the data plans starting from Rs399 for 20 GB data per month. 
Singhvi had further argued that the disclaimer that follows the advertisement, stating that “date consumption will be charged as per the existing plan"", went beyond clarifying or expanding the “main message"" and contradictied the message perceived by a viewer. 
Bharti Airtel had clarified that ‘free and live’ in the advertisement referred to a free subscription to online streaming platform Hotstar, and not data consumed. It was argued that the fact that users had to pay for data consumption was already stated in the advertisement. 
The case will be next heard on 27 April."

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is expected to report record revenues in its petrochemical and retail divisions, backed by the highest subscriber additions in its telecom arm Jio, later on Friday when it announces its March quarter earnings. 
Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is expected to report record revenues in its petrochemical and retail divisions, backed by the highest subscriber additions in its telecom arm Jio, later on Friday when it announces its March quarter earnings.
A Bloomberg poll of several analysts expects RIL to report a net profit of Rs9,347 crore, on the back of revenues worth Rs1.16 trillion for the quarter ended 31 March. The poll shows a 12.6% and 0.8% drop in revenue and net profit sequentially. However, on an annual basis, the revenue and net profit are up 36.8% and 16.2%, respectively. 
The RIL stock was trading at Rs998 at 9.20 am, up 2.32 % from the previous day. However, the company’s shares shed close to 4% during Q4, FY18. 
RIL’s $30 billion telecom venture Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd reported a profit of Rs504 crore ($78.97 million) in Q3, FY18 (September-December 2017) from a loss of Rs271 crore in the previous quarter. On the back of its promotions, Jio subscribers crossed the 175 million mark at the end of the March quarter. 
Morgan Stanley said in a 8 April research report that Jio is expected to report a quarter-on-quarter decline in ARPU (average revenue per user) due to tariff cuts of early 2018. “We estimate Jio to add about 30 million subscribers in 4Q taking total subscriber base to 190 million and ARPU to decline about 20% q-o-q to Rs124. This could potentially lead to 5% and 20% sequential revenue and EBITDA decline thus eroding the profitability for the quarter,"" the report added. 
A Jefferies research report dated 4 April said that presuming no drastic changes to opex and capital charges in RIL’s telecom business, ARPU is expected to fall on the January tariff cuts to Rs140 but a higher subscriber number, estimated at 190 million at the end of 31 March, is likely to drive RIL’s EBITDA by 7% and net profit by 22% higher (q-o-q) to Rs6.2 billion (Rs 620 crore). 
RIL’s gross refining margin—the difference between the cost of crude oil and the average selling price of refined products—is expected to drop marginally to $11.3 a barrel, but still outstrip the regional benchmark Singapore Complex which managed $7 a barrel in the same period. A report by Jefferies expects refining EBIT to fall 5% this quarter to Rs6,000 crore levels while the retail business’s EBIT will increase 135% to Rs600 crore.
An analyst report from Motilal Oswal forecasts net profit of Rs9,450 crore for the quarter, backed mostly by strong petrochemical performance. “The petrochemicals segment is expected to do better due to healthy deltas and strong volume growth."" Earnings from the petchem division are expected to surge to Rs6,600 crore, a 92% rise year-on-year, largely attributed to the commissioning of the off-gas cracker and petcoke gasification units at the refinery in Jamnagar.
Shares of RIL rose 2.87% in early trade, buoyed by record earnings expectations. However, analysts have sounded a word of caution. A sharp rise in benchmark crude oil prices and the rupee depreciating against the US dollar doesn’t bode well for oil marketing companies; oil refining, marketing and petrochemicals account for the bulk of RIL’s revenues.
According to a Motilal Oswal research report on the telecom sector, dated 2 April, all existing private sector telecom players are expected to continue pricing aggressively to attract the marooned subscribers from now defunct operators like Tata Teleservices, Telenor, RCom and Aircel, which may hamper Jio’s subscriber addition numbers in coming quarter.
A Jefferies report added that even if Jio maintains its growth pace in terms of subscriber base, its revenue market share may rise more slowly on lower average revenues per user. The firm has maintained an underperform call on the stock."

New Delhi: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-helmed Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) reported its highest ever quarterly net profit of Rs9,435 crore, beating Street estimates, for the quarter ended 31 March.
Revenue at the energy-to-telecom conglomerate rose 39% year-on-year to Rs1.29 trillion, buoyed by a rise in petrochemical sales and increase in global crude prices leading to better realizations in refined products. For the full year, RIL’s net profit stood at Rs36,075 crore, up 20.6% from 2016-17.
A Bloomberg poll of seven analysts had projected RIL to report a net profit of Rs9,379 crore for the March quarter.
However, the performance of the telecom arm, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, remain subdued with the company posting a mere 1% growth in net profit on a sequential basis as the ongoing tariff war, which Jio triggered, brought down its average revenue per user to Rs137 in the March quarter from Rs154 a quarter earlier.
“The Arpu (average revenue per user) came down... due to price action earlier in the quarter (March quarter),"" said Anshuman Thakur, head of strategy and planning at Jio. “We have had a tariff reduction of about Rs50 over three months, which we have more than made up with subscriber growth.""
The total income of the telecom company stood at Rs7,128.66 crore during the March quarter, up from Rs6,880.65 crore during the December quarter. Jio, which has reported financials for three quarters since starting operations, posted a profit of Rs722.96 crore for fiscal 2018, on the back of revenues of Rs20,158.34 crore.
The company’s Ebitda margin, which took a beating due to the discounts offered, stood at 37.8% at the end of March quarter. Jio’s Ebitda margin was 38.2% during the December quarter. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is a measure of operating profitability.
Jio’s net debt stood at Rs57,000 crore at the end of the March quarter, while RIL’s consolidated gross debt was Rs2,19,000 crore. The company is sitting on a cash pile of Rs78,063 crore.
The firm, however, continues to expand its telecom network. “We have identified towers for network roll out. If others don’t share (their towers) with us, we will roll out (our own),"" Thakur told reporters.
V. Shrikant, joint chief financial officer, RIL, said that a bulk of its capital expenditure will happen in building fibre-to-home (internet broadband) network, which the Mumbai-based firm plans to launch in a phased manner. The management declined to give details on the size of investment involved.
For the March quarter, revenue from the petrochemicals segment increased 43.9% to Rs38,113 crore, backed by improved margins on polypropylene and downstream polyester products. Volumes rose to 8.8 million tonnes, from 6.2 in the year-ago period. 
In refining and marketing, segment revenue was Rs93,519 crore, a near 30% increase, propped up by higher benchmark crude prices and inventory gains. The gross refining margin—the difference between the cost of crude oil and the average selling price of refined products—was $11 a barrel, lower than an expected $11.2 but outstripping the benchmark Singapore Complex by over $4 a barrel.
Organized retail reported a 134.1% rise in revenue, at Rs24,183 crore for the quarter, backed by rapid store expansion. Store footage rose to 17.7 million sq. ft in the three months ended March from 13.5 millon sq. ft in the same period a year earlier."

The organized retail business sprang a surprise with segment profit increasing by a whopping 291% to Rs951 crore.
But investors who track the fortunes of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd will be disappointed. Firstly, Jio’s revenue growth slowed to 3.6% last quarter, much lower than the 11.9% sequential growth it had reported in the December quarter. This should worry telcos because the longer Jio takes to reach its revenue share targets, the longer the struggles of the sector may continue. Cut-throat pricing has dragged other telcos to losses, besides resulting in huge debt.
The other big worry is that Jio reported capital expenditure of Rs14,000 crore for the March quarter, far higher than the Rs7,000 crore it had reported in the preceding two quarters. Companies such as Idea Cellular Ltd have fallen behind in their 4G coverage because of balance sheet constraints, and Jio’s aggression on the capex front means it will remain far ahead of competition in terms of coverage. To be sure, capex tends to be lumpy. Even so, Jio has spent Rs28,000 crore on capex in the past three quarters, compared with revenues of Rs20,154 crore. After accounting for operating and interest expenses of another Rs15,000 crore, it burnt over Rs23,000 crore in just the past three quarters. The company’s capex is expected to remain high, since it plans to increase the number of base stations substantially from current levels. The acquisition of Reliance Communications Ltd’s assets will only add to the tally.
The tariff cuts announced by Jio in January hit its own revenues as well. Still, due to strong subscriber additions and the manner in which the company accounts for its Prime membership, some analysts had anticipated growth to remain high. Analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities, for instance, had estimated revenue growth of 10% for Jio. The firm has been accounting for revenues from sales of its Prime membership, assuming its benefits will end in March 2018. As such, for memberships sold in the March quarter, the entire Rs99 for the membership was expected to be accounted for. The fact that revenue growth was under 4% despite this boost and a 17% jump in subscriber base is a dampener. The all-important question is how Jio responds to the deceleration in its growth rates."
749,2018-04-29,Reliance,"Adhering to site restoration guidelines issued by the government, RIL submitted bank guarantee for decommissioning activity for existing producing fields

New Delhi: Reliance Industries plans to shut oil and gas production at its main fields in KG-D6 block in the coming months and begin complying with the government’s guidelines for decommissioning facilities in the Bay of Bengal block where output has hit its lowest ever.  
New Delhi: Reliance Industries plans to shut oil and gas production at its main fields in KG-D6 block in the coming months and begin complying with the government’s guidelines for decommissioning facilities in the Bay of Bengal block where output has hit its lowest ever. 
“Adhering to Site Restoration Guidelines issued by Government of India, RIL submitted Bank Guarantee for Decommissioning activity for existing producing fields (D1D3 and MA),"" the company said in an investor presentation post announcing its fourth quarter earnings. 
RIL had till date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavri basin. Of these, MA—the only oil discovery in the block—began production in September 2008. Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields went onstream in April 2009. 
While the company did not provide any timelines for decommissioning and stopping of production at the fields that have witnessed output drop to a fourth of peak, sources privy to the development said MA field may be shut as early as October after the current lease of a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit, which processes output from the field, expires. 
E-mails sent to RIL and its partner BP Plc of UK, which holds 30% stake, for comments remained unanswered. The government’s site restoration guidelines provide for a one year notice for decommissioning of facilities. 
In the presentation, RIL said “average production of gas (from KG-D6 block in January-March 2018) was 4.3 million standard cubic metres per day and oil and condensate was at 1,865 barrels per day."" The gas output, which was lower than 4.9 mmscmd in the October-December quarter of 2017, was made up of output from D1 and D3 and MA fields. It said this was due to “continuing natural decline"" at the fields. 
RIL had in the field development plan for D1 and D3 proposed a capital expenditure of $8.836 billion. For developing Dhirubhai-26 or MA oilfield, it had in 2006 proposed to invest $2.234 billion, which was scaled down to $1.96 billion in 2012. The fields were in the investment plans supposed to last a minimum 15 years but have extinguished in less than a decade. 
KG-D6 fields had hit a peak of 69.43 mmscmd in March 2010 before water and sand ingress shut down wells. This peak output comprised 66.35 mmscmd from D1 and D3, the largest of the gas discoveries on the KG-D6 block, and 3.07 mmscmd from MA field. 
Besides the fall in output from D1 and D3, gas production from MA field, which had hit a peak of 6.78 mmscmd in January 2012, too has dropped. RIL in the presentation said it is now developing three sets of discoveries—R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ fields in KG-D6 block at a cost of  ₹ 40,000 crore. These fields together would bring 30-35 mmscmd of peak ouput. Initial gas will begin flowing from 2020. “R-Cluster development activities commenced; drilling to commence by 2Q FY19,"" it said."

Mumbai: Brokerage firms applauded Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL’s) robust earnings on the back of strong performance of its petrochemical business but expressed concerns about the subdued performance of its telecom arm. 
Mumbai: Brokerage firms applauded Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL’s) robust earnings on the back of strong performance of its petrochemical business but expressed concerns about the subdued performance of its telecom arm.
After market hours on 27 April, RIL reported its highest ever quarterly net profit of Rs9,435 crore, beating analysts’ estimates for the quarter to March.
However, the performance of the telecom arm, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, remained subdued with the company posting a mere 1% growth in net profit on a sequential basis as the ongoing tariff war, which Jio triggered, brought down its average revenue per user (Arpu) to Rs137 in the March quarter from Rs154 a quarter earlier.
“Reliance delivered solid results, which were in line with consensus. Petrochemicals was the standout performer on growth and margins,"" Sanford C. Bernstein and Co. said in a note, adding that with downstream expansion largely complete and margins at cyclical highs, Jio will become increasingly important for earnings growth. “While (telecom) subscriber growth remains impressive, the pricing war for market share looks set to continue in the near term,"" Sanford analysts Neil Beveridge and Jimmy Zheng said in a report on 28 April. They have a marketperform rating on the stock.
A few analysts were hopeful that competitive intensity in the industry may abate.
“RJio has done well in terms of subscriber growth, gaining a notable market share over the last few quarters. However, our profitability estimates are premised on expectations of reducing freebies beyond 1QFY19 and subsequent Arpu accretion,"" Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd said in a note on 28 April.
“Albeit recent Arpu cuts have been disappointing, we believe that, over the next 2-3 quarters, competitive intensity may abate, increasing industry revenue pool and offering strong growth potential,"" Motilal Oswal analysts said while maintaining their buy rating on the stock.
For IDFC Securities, which reiterated its “neutral"" rating on the stock, the E&P (exploration and production) business was a key laggard, and elevated debt levels a concern. “With growing momentum on downstream expansion/margin improvement projects and the strong performance of Jio, the potential for earnings growth over FY19-20E is not in doubt, with the substantial volume increase in petchem and margin improvement in both refining/petchem segments and the growth in Jio operating earnings over FY19-20E,"" IDFC analysts said in a note on 28 April.
“Having said that, we remain sceptical of any meaningful expansion in RoE/RoCE (return on equity/return on capital employed) levels, with the operating profit improvement offset by higher depreciation/interest costs due to higher capex in FY15-20E and resultant higher debt on the books,"" IDFC analysts added."
746,2018-04-30,Reliance,"Any increase in competition is likely to hurt Reliance Jio equally or probably more than incumbent operators, says a report

Mumbai: Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio), the telecom unit of India’s most valuable company, is no longer insulated from competition and price wars that eventually led to shrinking profits and losses for incumbent telecom operators. 
Mumbai: Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJio), the telecom unit of India’s most valuable company, is no longer insulated from competition and price wars that eventually led to shrinking profits and losses for incumbent telecom operators.
During the quarter ended 31 March, the performance of RJio remained subdued, with the company posting a mere 1% growth in profit from the preceding three months.
RJio saw its average revenue per user (Arpu) fall to Rs137 in the March quarter from Rs154 a quarter earlier.
The company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin, which is a measure of operating profitability, took a beating because of the various discounts offered and stood at 37.8% at the end of the March quarter. RJio’s Ebitda margin was 38.2% during the December quarter.
“Arpu came down... due to price action earlier in the quarter (March quarter),"" said RJio’s head of strategy and planning, Anshuman Thakur, at a post-result press conference. 
“We have had a tariff reduction of about Rs50 over three months, which we have more than made up with subscriber growth,"" Thakur said.
The fourth quarter numbers demonstrate that RJio is no longer insulated from competition, said an ICICI Securities note on Reliance Jio dated 30 April. 
Any increase in competition would hurt RJio equally or probably more than the incumbents, said the report.
RJio has benefited from a 46.7% increase in prime membership revenues to Rs750 crore in Q4FY18, according to the ICICI Securities research. It will, however, see revenues from prime memberships cease from the next quarter as the company has waived off the one-year prime membership fees for many of its subscribers.
It is difficult to comment about the ARPU going ahead (FY19), Thakur said on 27 April. “We will have to see how the other operators do and of course the customer traction,"" Thakur added.
RJio’s focus for the coming months will remain on adding more subscribers to its network and price hikes—that could lead to ARPU corrections—are thus unlikely, Morgan Stanley said in a research report on the Indian telecom sector dated 29 April.
RJio’s management is expected to remain focused on providing higher value to consumers compared to incumbents, and prioritize customer engagement over short-term revenue recovery, said a 30 April UBS report on the sector.
“Management hopes for revenue growth coming from subscriber growth and higher value to customers. Jio will continue to invest and bid aggressively for content, which it sees as a key differentiator,"" the report said.
The company is in the final stage of commercial launch of home broadband services, whose rollout though gradual, is expected to add to the sales and profit of the company, it added.
RJio, which is bullish about its feature phone offerings (Jio Phone), expects to add 8 million subscribers per month.
“What is yet to be seen is how much Jio Phone subscribers, particularly the Rs49/month adopters, would add to operating profit,"" said the ICICI Securities research report dated 30 April.
“For now, it is interesting to note that most Jio Phone users continue to recharge under the Rs153 plan, and average data usage is 6-6.5GB/month (vs 5GB in Q3FY18),"" it said, adding that the company has not seen Jio Phone traction among voice-only users.
RJio did not respond to an email seeking comments on its future plans."

Mumbai: Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) shed more than 3% on Monday morning despite reporting a record March quarter net profit, as analysts argued the valuations could be turning rich in light of uncertainties in earnings, and as the subdued performance by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd bothered investors.
Revenue at the energy-to-telecom conglomerate rose 39% year-on-year to Rs1.29 trillion, buoyed by a rise in petrochemical sales and increase in global crude prices leading to better realizations in refined products.
The performance of the telecom arm, Reliance Jio, remained subdued with the company posting a mere 1% growth in net profit on a sequential basis as the ongoing tariff war, which Jio triggered, brought down its average revenue per user to Rs137 in the March quarter from Rs154 a quarter earlier.
At 10am, RIL shares were down 3.19% at Rs963.05 a piece on the BSE, while benchmark 30-share Sensex traded 0.47% higher at 35,132.74 points. In intraday trade, the stock hit a low of Rs961.10, down 3.38%.
RIL stock is up 10.3% so far in April, after positing 33.84% gains in fiscal year 2018, the best since fiscal year 2010. It touched a record high of Rs1,010.70 on 27 April 2018, and is down 3.6% since then.
Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd analysts pointed In a note on Monday that RIL’s FY18 earnings rose 21% and working capital helped cash flow again but $12.3billion in capex still left net liabilities $4billion higher at $38.3 billion.
“We expect this to fall but gradually even as earnings uncertainties remain. With valuations also rich and ROCE (return on capital employed) modest, we keep our UNPF (underperformer),"" Jefferies analysts said."

New Delhi: The central government on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that BS-VI auto fuel can be introduced in most districts of the National Capital Region (NCR) as well as Agra by 1 April 2019. 
New Delhi: The central government on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that BS-VI auto fuel can be introduced in most districts of the National Capital Region (NCR) as well as Agra by 1 April 2019.
On 26 March, the court had asked the centre to consider if it is possible to introduce the clean fuel across 13 leading metros by 1 April 2019. 
After consulting fuel marketers, the government told the court that it can introduce the fuel in 17 out of 23 districts in NCR and Agra by that date, but not in the other 11 cities, because of non-availability of the product and logistics constraints. 
The government consulted Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Reliance Industries Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Essar Oil Ltd before submitting the affidavit in court.
The 11 metros that will have to wait are Kanpur, Lucknow, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Surat, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune and Sholapur.
On 26 March, the court had also asked the centre to look into diesel pricing so that its lower price does not encourage purchase of mid-segment passenger vehicles.
On this, the central government told a bench headed by Justice Madan B. Lokur that the centre would not be able to reduce the price gap since it would increase inflation. 
At present, price difference between petrol and diesel is Rs9.02/litre in Delhi.
“Private vehicles make up 13% of the total sale of diesel vehicles and the remaining 87% is used by other segments. Agriculture segment also makes up for 13% of diesel sales and is sensitive to the price as it affects the income of farmers,"" the centre submitted. 
If the gap between diesel and petrol prices is further reduced by increasing central excise duty and state value added tax (VAT) on diesel, it will have an adverse impact on inflation and impact all sectors, including agriculture and transportation, the central government said in a 13-page affidavit.
In April 2017, automobile manufacturers had informed the apex court about technological difficulties in converting vehicles to meet BS-VI emissions standards from 2019 in order to meet the April 2020 deadline.
The apex court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by environmentalist M.C. Mehta in 1985.
A series of orders have been passed by the court over the years to try and curb growing pollution in the national capital region centred on Delhi.
Last year, the court banned sale and registration of vehicles that do not comply with BS-IV norms after 31 March 2017"

San Francisco: Intel Corp. drones played starring roles at the 2018 Winter Olympics, the music and arts festival Coachella and danced above the Bellagio Hotel’s fountains in Las Vegas. 
San Francisco: Intel Corp. drones played starring roles at the 2018 Winter Olympics, the music and arts festival Coachella and danced above the Bellagio Hotel’s fountains in Las Vegas.
But while those stunts, involving hundreds of Shooting Star drones that create a light show in a modern twist on fireworks, are great PR, what’s going on behind the scenes is much more valuable to Intel. 
New software that the company is rolling out for more utilitarian unmanned aerial vehicles may play a more lasting role in its attempts to spread the reach of its chips.
Chief executive officer Brian Krzanich is fashioning Intel as a “data-centric"" firm to stress its determination to rely less on a personal computer market that hasn’t grown for six years. 
Intel’s leader said he’s determined that Intel’s technology will be central to whatever new market emerges for data processing. The latest effort is Intel’s Falcon 8+ aircraft, designed for less-glamorous roles at oil refineries, over farmers’ fields and on building sites. 
Software packaged with the drone can help businesses map out pre-planned flights using simple overlays on satellite imagery. That advantage can, for instance, allow a company to see how construction is developing or crops are faring over time. Intel will also soon unveil a new suite of software that would enable drone-gathered data to be stored, processed and used by a whole range of industries.
For Intel, that data is the key. The Falcon 8+ is armed with either a high-end digital camera or array of sensors, and generates a massive amount of information very quickly. 
A 15-minute flight taking high-resolution pictures—possibly combined with thermal-image information—can generate more than 10 gigabytes of data. 
Taking that and turning it into something useful, such as a three-dimensional map, can take a high-end computer a couple of days of work. That’s the kind of new industry that Intel—the world’s largest maker of computer processors with a growing sideline in memory chips—wants to see flourish.
The data transformation that’s possible with the drone is the most intriguing aspect of the device, said Anil Nanduri, who heads up Intel’s drone efforts. 
To support his goal, Nanduri’s group is introducing a new software and service package that will allow data generated by Intel’s drones to be rapidly processed into usable reports and three-dimensional models.
Drones are already big business. They’re used in industries from agriculture to architecture, construction and engineering as well as emergency services and even deliveries. Bloomberg"

Mumbai: Reliance Industries (RIL) is likely to invest Rs60,000 crore into its telecom unit this fiscal year as the company seeks to speed up the roll out of broadband services and expand its wireless network, two people aware of the matter said.
In addition to this, unit Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd may also borrow as much as Rs1 trillion, the people said, requesting anonymity.
“This is being done as Jio wants to fast-track its plan to scale up its capacity and coverage which would require further infusion of funds,"" said one of the two people.
Spokespeople for RIL and Jio did not immediately respond to queries. 
The firm will continue to invest in laying fibre even as it has already built the largest optical fibre network in the country, Anshuman Thakur, head of strategy and planning at Jio, said in an interview on 27 April, after Reliance Industries announced its earnings.
“In terms of total investment, we don’t normally say such figures, but it is the largest network in the country, on both intra city as well as inter-city (fibre). We have a substantial advantage over all operators. But, we will keep on building fibre. We are gradually rolling out our FTTH (broadband services) and other services, during the course of which we will be laying much more fibre,"" he said.
“On the tower (side), we have identified this phase of network rollout. Beyond that, it’s the capacity side (where the investments)… will be required. We are well equipped to put towers on our own if others don’t want to give us. But, if they give us, you know every tower we will have to decide whether we should build on our own or lease it from others,"" Thakur said.
The fresh investments will also allow Reliance Jio to maintain pricing pressure on rivals, who are bleeding due to a tariff war sparked by the Mukesh Ambani-led firm. The firm has also said it remains focused on providing higher value to consumers and will prioritize customer engagement over short-term revenue recovery, which means it will retaliate if rival operators try to sweeten their offers. 
“RIL may have to keep pumping in money through a combination of equity or raising of debt. Though, the investments may not happen at the same intensity as it happened in the initial years of Jio’s rollout, the management indicated that Jio will focus more on fibre-to-the-home, enterprise offering, Internet of things services and other digital services. These segments would need investments going forward,"" a Mumbai-based analyst tracking RIL said on condition of anonymity. 
Reliance Jio will also continue to invest aggressively to acquire content as it sees it as a key differentiator. The company is in final stage of commercial launch of home broadband services, though the rollout is expected to be gradual.
For the March quarter, Jio reported a 1% growth in profit from the preceding three months. It also saw its average revenue per user fall to Rs137 in the March quarter from Rs154 in the preceding December quarter. 
“Clearly, Q4FY18 numbers demonstrate that RJio is no longer insulated from competition and any rise in the same would hurt RJio equally or probably more than the incumbents,"" ICICI Securities said in a 30 April report.

New Delhi: Reliance Infratel Ltd Tuesday told the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Tuesday that there was no choice but to sell its tower and fibre assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
Reliance Infratel counsel Kapil Sibal informed the court that in order to evade initiation of proceedings under the Insolvency Code, The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002 and liquidation, the company decided to sell its tower and fibre assets to Reliance Jio after it emerged as the highest bidder for the same.
“This transaction allows lenders to monetize the assets to an extent of Rs8,000 crore. Under any other circumstances, the company would not be able to recover its outstanding debt,"" Sibal stated, arguing that the decision to sell the assets to Reliance Jio was in no way prejudicial or oppressive. 
An NCLAT bench head by president S.J. Mukhopadhaya was hearing Reliance Group unit Reliance Infratel’s appeal against a 12 March order of the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal, which prohibited it from selling its tower and fibre assets to Reliance Jio. 
The 12 March stay order was passed in a plea by offshore investors of Reliance Infratel led by HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd, alleging oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement for not taking their consent for the asset sale as per the articles of association of the company.

Mumbai: BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, and Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd are front runners to buy IDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd, two people directly aware of the development said.
The first round of bidding for IDFC Mutual Fund, which manages Rs70,000 crore worth of assets, happened on Tuesday, with Reliance Mutual Fund and BlackRock emerging as top bidders, the people said, requesting anonymity.
If Reliance AMC acquires IDFC Mutual Fund, the Anil Ambani-controlled company will become the country’s largest asset management company with combined assets of around Rs3.15 trillion. On the other hand, the acquisition will help BlackRock maintain its presence in India after exiting a mutual fund joint venture with DSP Group on Monday.
Potential buyers for IDFC Asset Management are likely to offer Rs2,000-2,500 crore, the people cited earlier said, although the company’s owners have sought a valuation of around Rs4,000 crore. Bidders are ascribing a lower price because of the asset manager’s declining profitability and failure to retain some top executives, they said. 
IDFC Mutual Fund’s profit plunged by 44% to Rs54 crore in the financial year ended 31 March from Rs97 crore in the previous year. The asset manager had reported a profit of Rs110 crore in the year ended 31 March 2016. 
“Profitability is a key factor in the latest valuation matrix,"" said one of the two people. “The churn at IDFC Mutual Fund has been huge in the past few years, which shows some kind of instability in operations."" 
IDFC Mutual Fund, the country’s 11th largest AMC, is a unit of IDFC Financial Holding Co. Ltd.
“A process is being run and the board of IDFC will make a decision after we receive bids from various parties,"" said Rajiv Lall, chairman of IDFC Financial.
While Reliance Nippon AMC declined to comment, a spokesperson for BlackRock’s Asia Pacific operations said the company is not involved in this deal.
Bhavin Patadia, a senior manager of IDFC Mutual Fund’s equity fund management team, quit last month. In November, Sandeep Prabhani quit as head of operations. In 2016, Kalpen Parekh, managing director of sales and marketing at IDFC Mutual Fund, resigned and in the previous year, Kenneth Andrade quit as chief investment officer.
IDFC Securities Ltd is advising IDFC Financial on the deal.
“The deal is expected to be announced within 7-10 days and may be closed within two months,"" said the first person cited above.
On 19 August, when Reliance Nippon AMC listed its shares on exchanges through a Rs1,800 crore IPO-cum-offer for sale, the company said that a part of the proceeds were to be used for acquisitions and strategic initiatives.

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is planning to create four new units for its various businesses, two people in the know said.
The subsidiaries could be in refining and marketing; exploration and production (E&P); petrochemicals; textiles; hydrocarbons and real estate.
“The new subsidiaries would have an authorized share-capital of Rs1,000 crore each,"" one of the two people said, requesting anonymity.
The company plans to apply to the corporate affairs ministry shortly to obtain requisite approvals required for incorporating the companies.
For the six segments RIL operates in—refining and marketing; petrochemicals; oil and gas exploration; retail; telecom/digital services and media and entertainment—the firm has 99 subsidiaries, joint ventures and associate firms, according to its 2016-17 annual report.
“The company is engaged in multiple businesses which inter alia include E&P, refining, petchem, retail, telecom and media. Reliance has a wide corporate holding structure (having multiple subsidiaries/associates) due to reasons like regulatory requirements, joint ventures, strategic investments and past acquisitions,"" a RIL spokesperson said in an emailed response. “The company continuously endeavors to have efficient holding structure, so that it can maximize shareholder value on sustainable basis.""
“RIL has been, for any new business segment or a sub-segment, creating a new entity. This could be done for two reasons: one, need to segregate risks and funding and save taxes and two, ease of raising funds or resources for specific projects by backing from the parent company,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst with a domestic brokerage. 
Last March, RIL restructured the shareholding of its promoter entities where 1.2 billion shares held by 15 entities were transferred to eight others. The entities involved were limited liability firms wherein disclosure is limited as one does not have to make all financial declarations with the registrar of companies.
“RIL creates new subsidiaries and then amalgamates them after few years. While in some cases, it must be doing this to list some of these entities at a later date, in a few it is done to enable better cash management and operational efficiency,"" said another analyst tracking RIL.
Among the new subsidiaries to be created, RIL may be forming a new one to bring under one umbrella, all of its real estate ventures. RIL had this February, bought a 65% stake in a real estate project in Bandra-Kurla Complex in central Mumbai for Rs1,105 crore, taking its total investment in property to $2.6 billion. RIL has also approved an increased investment limit for in Reliance Corporate IT Park Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary from Rs3,800 crore to Rs6,000 crore for the next financial year. 
According to RIL, it has a policy for determining a material subsidiary for the company when its income or net-worth exceeds 20% of the consolidated income or net-worth respectively, of the company."

Mumbai: Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd fell sharply on Friday, a day after rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd unveiled a new postpaid plan that analysts said was likely to hurt incumbent telecom firms’ business.
Airtel shares fell as much as 7.53% on the BSE during the day before closing at Rs385.70 each, down 6.44%. Idea’s shares dropped as much as 12.94% during the day and ended down 11.83% at Rs51.45 each. The BSE Telecom index fell 4.75%, while the benchmark Sensex closed at 35,535.79 points, up 0.82%.
Reliance Jio on Thursday unveiled a new postpaid plan that offers unlimited domestic voice calls and 25 GB of data, as well as international calling at Rs0.50 per minute, for Rs199 a month. That’s about half the cost of comparable offers from other, older telcos, Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a 10 May note. The brokerage added that it expects the incumbents to cut prices in response, leading to a further decline in average revenue per user, or ARPU.
“We have been concerned on the postpaid revenues for incumbents given the cost to consumers is three times of prepaid. Postpaid, while making up only 7% of top three operators subscribers, contribute over 20% of their revenues,"" it said.
Reliance Jio, which launched in September 2016 and sparked off a tariff war, has not had as much of an impact in the postpaid segment as it has in prepaid, as a significant proportion of postpaid connections are corporate accounts, said Kotak Intuitional Equities. However, the Rs199 plan “changes the dynamic; dramatically, as always"", it added.
The brokerage firms said that ARPU will correct if the incumbents try to hold on to these customers, but the impact may not be immediate. “More important is the much lower ISD rates being offered by Jio now versus the Rs8-10/min currently being charged by the incumbents. While ISD outgoing is a very low proportion of industry’s overall voice volumes (less than 0.1% of outgoing volumes), we believe the contribution to industry revenues could be in the 1.5-2% vicinity. This revenue stream can easily get cut by half,"" it said in a report on 10 May.
According to Jefferies, postpaid users don’t change operators as often as prepaid users do, and a shift to Reliance Jio would be gradual as 40% of the postpaid customers are corporate, and these would be a key targets.
“Any 10% cut in postpaid prices will lead to 2% cut in overall ARPU. Any 10% cut in postpaid prices will lead to 12%/6% Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) hits for Idea and Bharti respectively,"" Jefferies said.
Jefferies expects industry ARPU to remain under pressure and cost pressures to also increase. It said that recovery will also be gradual from mid-FY20 as ARPU increases will require investment in both capacity and content."

New Delhi: The Rs199 new postpaid plan announced by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is expected to hit revenue of competitors marginally and may trigger tariff war in the telecom industry, according to market analysts.
“Move could lead to another brutal tariff cut in the postpaid regime, hurting incumbents further: Jio’s postpaid tariffs are sharply lower compared to the current tariff plans offered by incumbents,"" JP Morgan said in its report.
Reliance Jio on Thursday announced a new postpaid plan starting from with monthly rental of Rs199 and an ISD calling service at a starting price of 50 paise per minute.
“International tariffs offered by Jio are quite competitive and we could see downward pressure on such tariffs for incumbents. However, even in a scenario where we assume 10-15% of postpaid revenues are from international calls, and international tariffs get cut by 50%, the impact on overall revenue of incumbents is likely to be less than 2%,"" Goldman Sachs said.

CLSA analysts Deepti Chaturvedi and Akshat Agarwal in their report said 5% of industry subscribers are on postpaid service. Postpaid subscribers, although limited to 5-6% for Bharti Airtel and Idea-Vodafone, account for around 20% of their mobile revenue, the CLSA report said.
“Jio’s  ₹ 199 per month postpaid plan is a sector negative and will delay the ARPU recovery for the sector,"" CLSA said. According to Morgan Stanley, the new plans of Reliance Jio targeting postpaid customers may impact 1% of Airtel’s mobile revenue in case the telecom major tries to match the tariff.

New Delhi: In fresh salvo fired in the hyper competitive telecom sector, Reliance Jio has complained to the department of telecommunications (DoT) alleging that Airtel is violating the government’s licence norms and posing a threat to national security by not setting up within India certain network infrastructure that it uses to sell Apple Watch Series 3. 
New Delhi: In fresh salvo fired in the hyper competitive telecom sector, Reliance Jio has complained to the department of telecommunications (DoT) alleging that Airtel is violating the government’s licence norms and posing a threat to national security by not setting up within India certain network infrastructure that it uses to sell Apple Watch Series 3.
“Airtel has not set up eSIM provisioning node within India and the node being used to provide Apple Watch Series 3 service is currently located out of India in gross violation of the licence terms,"" Jio wrote in a letter to the DoT on 11 May.
The user’s iPhone and Apple Watch share the same number and the user can choose either device to make or receive calls via the electronic SIM. At the time of pairing of the two devices, over-the-air provisioning of eSIM is carried out by a dedicated network node that is used for eSIM profile allocation which contains network and user information.
Government norms mandate an operator to deploy equipment anywhere in India subject to the interconnection points located and operated in the respective service areas for inter-operator, inter-service area, national long-distance and international calls. The licence terms also require that operators shall not transfer any user information or their accounting information to any person or place outside India.
“Airtel has deliberately chosen to install a critical network element outside India for a service being offered under the Access Services Licence indicates its blatant disregard for the sanctity of the licence terms and conditions including important security conditions,"" Jio said. Mint has seen a copy of the letter.
Bharti Airtel had on 24 April announced a partnership with Apple for the India launch of the Apple Watch Series 3. This comes enabled with built-in cellular through an electronic SIM which will be used with customer’s existing Airtel number. Interestingly, on 11 May Reliance Jio also announced a similar partnership with Apple.
Jio has urged DoT to impose a penalty on Airtel for this alleged violation of norms, apart from directing Airtel to immediately stop this service and commence it again only after complying with requirements of national security and addressing the alleged violations of licence norms.
“This is yet another frivolous complaint by a desperate operator, whose sole aim appears to have a monopoly over everything that they do,"" a Bharti Airtel spokesperson said when contacted.
“The DoT was duly notified prior to the launch of Apple watch including product features, network architecture and lawful interception and we have also requested them to carry out a demonstration of the same. All information relating to customers, network nodes etc. is hosted in a fully secure manner by Airtel India along with provision for lawful interception. We will be happy to share more details with the DoT as and when required,"" the Bharti Airtel spokesperson said.
Mint could not independently verify the veracity of claims made by Jio."

New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd's battle with rival Bharti Airtel Ltd over the latter's 'T20 Live and Free' advertisement campaign is now in the Supreme Court.
The Mukesh Ambani-owned company on Monday challenged in the apex court a 10 May order by a Delhi High Court division bench, that gave a partial breather to Airtel over its disputed campaign.
The matter was mentioned before a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, who posted it for hearing on 18 May.
The dispute revolves around Airtel's ongoing 'T20 Live and Free' advertising campaign in television, print and outdoor media, promising live and free coverage of the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches on its network. In reality, the offer is a free subscription to watch the cricket matches on the Hotstar app.
Reliance Jio moved the Delhi High Court on 13 April, complaining the advertisement was misleading and deceptive as it failed to inform consumers about the hidden cost of data usage. Airtel said its ads indeed mention that “data consumption will be charged as per the existing plan"".
On 2 May, a single-judge bench of the Delhi High Court asked Airtel to make the disclaimer in a bigger type size, across ads in print, TV and in outdoor hoardings. For television and video ads, the judge asked Airtel to start its disclaimer “from the word the girl in the advertisement says ‘seasonal pass....’, in sync with the voice over.""
Airtel contested this order before a larger division bench of the high court, which ordered that the bigger type sizes need to be carried only in print ads, and not in videos or hoardings. Now, Reliance Jio has contested that order in the Supreme Court."

 Sankalp Phartiyal, Reuters  
 Sankalp Phartiyal, Reuters 
Mumbai: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday admitted an insolvency plea filed by Sweden’s Ericsson against Reliance Communications, potentially delaying the Indian firm’s plans to sell assets to lighten its debt load.
Ericsson, which signed a seven-year deal in 2014 to operate and manage Reliance Communications’ nationwide telecoms network, is seeking Rs1,155 crore ($170 million) from the company and two of its subsidiaries.
Worries about the ability of RCom, as the company is widely known, to repay its near $7 billion debt to Indian and foreign banks have been mounting for more than a year. 
Like other incumbents in India’s telecoms sector, RCom has been hit by a fierce price war over the last year, especially after the entry of Reliance Jio, which offered free voice and cut-price data plans.
Run by wealthy businessman Anil Ambani, RCom has said it plans to reduce its debt by selling assets such as airwaves, mobile masts and fibre optic investments. 
The company also plans to sell most of its wireless assets to Reliance Jio - controlled by the country’s richest man and Anil’s elder brother Mukesh Ambani - in a deal sources said was worth about $3.8 billion.
However, Tuesday’s order from the NCLT means that the asset sale would now be overseen by a court appointed administrator.
A lawyer for RCom said it would appeal. The company in a press release said it would decide the next course of action after studying the detailed orders of NCLT.
Under India’s bankruptcy law, insolvency resolution needs to be completed within a maximum 9 months, failing which the company is liquidated. 
With debt of Rs45,733 crore ($6.7 billion) at the end of March 2017, RCom is the most-leveraged of all listed telecoms carriers in India.
The company shut down its consumer mobile business late last year.
RCom’s asset sale plan has also stalled as it faces a separate legal challenge after HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd filed a petition accusing the company of oppression of minority shareholders and operational mismanagement.
RCom shares closed down 8.2% on Tuesday in a broader Mumbai market that ended largely unchanged. The company is set to report earning for the quarter ended March on 19 May.

732,2018-05-16,Reliance,"The only way Reliance Jio can make a decent return on capital is if most competitors succumb and exit the telecom market

In March 2017, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd had said that India’s mobile market will be Rs3 trillion in size by 2020-21, adding it is well-positioned to achieve a market share of more than 50%. 
In March 2017, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd had said that India’s mobile market will be Rs3 trillion in size by 2020-21, adding it is well-positioned to achieve a market share of more than 50%.
But Jio’s own actions point to a singular focus on market share, with little regard for where the industry ends up in terms of revenues. “Reliance Jio’s tariff actions suggest it is happy to live with a 50% share of a market that has shrunk considerably, rather than a lower share in an unshrunk market,"" said an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm, requesting anonymity.
Industry revenues have shrunk almost every passing quarter since Jio launched operations. To add to the misery of incumbents, the company announced new post-paid tariff plans last week that are at about half the level of incumbents’ base plans in the category. It has also slashed international calling rates drastically, and both of these moves are likely to impact industry revenues by another 5% or so. The impact on profits will be far higher.
For perspective, industry revenues stood at Rs1.8 trillion before Jio’s launch, and analysts had initially estimated a drop to Rs1.6 trillion by fiscal year 2018 (bit.ly/2wN46FB). But revenues already fell to an annualized level of Rs1.31 trillion in the December quarter, even before Jio cut tariffs in the prepaid category in January this year. After the impact of the latest tariff cuts set in, revenues could fall below Rs1.2 trillion. And all of this is before Jio has crossed even the 25% hurdle in terms of market share. 
Who knows what lies next? Jio has a majority market share in the prepaid category of connections that use broadband data. But it lags far behind incumbents in the post-paid segment and in the category of non-broadband users within the prepaid segment. If the response of customers to its new post-paid offer as well as its feature-phone offer is lukewarm, it may well decide on more firepower to get to its targeted 50% market share.
That thought is scary, and it isn’t surprising that shares of Idea Cellular Ltd have fallen more than 50% so far this year. In the March quarter, Idea’s pre-tax losses stood at as high as 33% of revenues, after adjusting for one-offs. Jio’s latest tariff cuts will drag Idea deeper into the red, before there is any improvement in its financials. Bharti Airtel Ltd’s India wireless business is also running high losses, though to a lesser extent when compared with Idea.
But what about Jio’s own fortunes? Will a 50% share in a significantly shrunk market cover its high expenses and leave anything as a return on its capital? In the past three quarters, Jio has reported capital expenditure of Rs28,000 crore, and operating expenses and interest costs of around Rs15,000 crore. If expenses remain in that range, revenues may only be enough to cover expenses. Of course, one can argue that Jio will soon enough have other revenue streams such as from home broadband, but the fact remains that its fortunes largely depend on the mobile business. 
The only way the company can make a decent return on capital is if most competitors succumb and exit the market. If the industry ends up in a duopoly or a monopoly situation, investors can hope for tariffs to recover and revenues to increase in size. But as things stand, Jio’s 2021 vision on industry revenues looks blurry and in need for a revisit."

New Delhi: Telecom major Bharti Airtel on Thursday urged the Delhi high court to dismiss the suit of Reliance Jio against its advertisements offering “live and free access"" to IPL 2018 coverage.
Justice Yogesh Khanna, before whom Airtel moved the plea, issued notice to Jio and sought its stand before the next date of hearing on 2 July. Senior advocate Dayan Krishnan, appearing for Jio, told the court that a division bench of the high court has modified Justice Khanna’s interim orders in the matter and against that it has moved the Supreme Court which is expected to hear it tomorrow. 
He said in the present facts and circumstances, there was no urgency in the matter. Taking note of the submission, the court declined to give an early date of hearing, as sought by Airtel’s lawyer. The division bench of the high court on 10 May had modified its single judge’s interim orders and questioned the maintainability of the suit filed by Jio alleging that Airtel’s advertisement was “deceptive and misleading"". 
The single judge in his 2 May order had asked Airtel to use the font of 12 pixels in print media and that too in a prominent and visible place and not at the bottom. The order had also said, “So far as the video clips/television advertisements are concerned the disclaimer should start running from the word the girl says ‘Seasonal Pass-------------’ and it should be displayed in sync with the voiceover."" The disclaimer in billboards and hoardings be also at a prominent place, it had said. 
Prior to that, on 13 April the single judge had asked Airtel to carry a disclaimer in bold stating that under its ‘live and free access offer’ the only subscription to video streaming platform Hotstar would be free and data charges according to the subscriber’s plan would apply. 
The 2 May direction came after Reliance Jio moved an application alleging that the 13 April order was not complied with by Airtel. The division bench in its 10 May decision had upheld the 2 May order to the extent it directed Airtel to use font size of 12 pixel in its print media advertisements and set aside the remaining directions. 
The bench also upheld the 13 April order. The Jio, in its suit, had claimed that the advertisements “falsely proclaim"" that Airtel was offering “live and free"" access to T20 cricket coverage and also “falsely represent that a subscriber need only obtain a 4G sim from the defendant company and download the Airtel TV app to obtain a virtual season pass, that is live and free access to T20 coverage""."

New Delhi: India’s largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel Ltd, which was so far a relatively small wired internet business, plans to push its home broadband offerings in new cities and also expand its network coverage within existing cities ahead of a likely commercial launch by Reliance Jio later this year.
“We have stepped up investments on home broadband. We do 400,000-500,000 home passes a year. Last year we did almost 2 million home passes,"" a person with direct knowledge of the matter said requesting anonymity.
The company aims to achieve another 2-4 million home passes in 2018-19 and expand in its key markets such as Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai.
In the wired internet segment, fibre is distributed to the homes via an optical distribution frame with a single fibre dedicated to each customer’s home, which is termed a home pass.
A formal commercial launch of Reliance Jio broadband will shake up this segment and average revenue per user (ARPU) is expected to drop. The company has already initiated beta trials for its wired broadband service across regions in New Delhi and Mumbai, with unlimited internet at 100 mbps for a security deposit of Rs4,500.
“Airtel has under-invested in home broadband so far...the investment behind this segment will be in the ballpark range of few hundred crores out of the overall capital expenditure of $4 billion by Airtel in 2018-19,"" said the person cited above.
At present, Airtel provides wired broadband up to 100 mbps to 2.1 million users across 89 cities in India. As of quarter ended 31 March, Airtel’s average revenue per user from its ‘Homes Services’ segment was Rs929, registering a decrease of 12.6% year-on-year. Broadband customers account for 94% of its ‘Homes Services’ segment.
Last month, Airtel upped its game and introduced a new home broadband plan with speeds of up to 300 mbps at a monthly rental of Rs2,990 with 1,200GB of data. This plan comes with free subscription to Airtel’s OTT apps—Wynk Music and Airtel TV."

Mumbai: Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) said it was in advanced talks with Ericsson to resolve “commercial issues"", after two people indicated it was currently uncertain if the firms’ discussions over dues would lead to an out-of-court settlement.
Earlier this week, India’s bankruptcy court admitted a plea by the Swedish telecom gearmaker seeking insolvency resolution against debt-laden Reliance Communications (RCom) over unpaid service dues, potentially derailing the company’s plans to sell assets to larger rival Reliance Jio. 
Ericsson, which signed a seven-year deal in 2014 to operate and manage RCom’s nationwide telecoms network, is seeking Rs1,155 crore from RCom and two of its subsidiaries.
“We confirm that RCom and Ericsson are at an advanced stage of discussions to expeditiously resolve commercial issues,"" the company said in a securities filing on Friday, adding a resolution would enable it to exit the bankruptcy court process.
RCom is also confident of “expeditiously"" proceeding on its asset sale deal agreed with Jio and the overall debt resolution plan agreed with its creditor banks, it said in the statement.
One of the two people who spoke to Reuters earlier on Friday, said RCom had approached Ericsson, but with a lack of clarity around payment of dues “a settlement currently looks uncertain"".
The two, who asked not to be named as the talks are private, said Ericsson could withdraw its plea if an out-of-court understanding is reached. 
Ericsson said it does not comment on speculation.
Shares in RCom, controlled by billionaire Anil Ambani, had soared 30% on reports of settlement talks with Ericsson, but reversed gains to trade down 2.7%. The Mumbai market was down 0.7%.
With debt totalling Rs45,733 crore at end-March 2017, RCom is the most-leveraged of all listed telecom carriers in India.
To raise funds, RCom announced plans late last year to sell most of its wireless assets to mobile carrier Reliance Jio infocomm Ltd in a deal said to be worth about $3.8 billion.

New Delhi: The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has sought reply within a week from Bharti Airtel Ltd on a complaint by rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd alleging that the operator flouted norms on activation of eSIM in Apple Watch 3, a person close to the development said. 
New Delhi: The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has sought reply within a week from Bharti Airtel Ltd on a complaint by rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd alleging that the operator flouted norms on activation of eSIM in Apple Watch 3, a person close to the development said.
The DoT also mentioned that the security clearance tests for the service are due on 23 May and 30 May 2018. The DoT had on 17 May sought multiple clarifications within a week from Airtel about eSIM service facilitation by the company on Apple Watch 3. Both Reliance Jio and Airtel started selling Apple Watch 3 on May 11 through their sales channels.
“Reliance Jio has filed complaint alleging that Airtel has not set-up the eSIM provisioning node within India in gross violation to the licence terms. Airtel had informed DoT about the service but in its letter services storing user information was not indicated. The department has asked Airtel whether eSIM provisioning network of node of Airtel is storing eSIM profiles and user information outside India,"" the person quoted above said, requesting anonymity.
Apple Watch 3 and iPhone of a subscriber share the same number and subscribers can use both iPhone and Apple Watch with eSIM to make or receive calls independent of the call status of the other devices. The eSIM is paired with the SIM in iPhone wirelessly through a dedicated network node. The node used for eSIM profile allocation contains network and user information such as operator identifier, SIM details, PIN, and remote file management.
“The DoT has received information that Airtel intends to launch Apple Watch 3 service. The tests for security clearance of the service is scheduled for 23 May and 30 May 2018. This was informed to Airtel on 11 May,"" the person said.
When contacted, an Airtel spokesperson said that the company has already written to the DoT on 15 May and clarified that it is in compliance with the licence conditions and why “Reliance Jio’s complaint is fallacious and needs to be rejected"".
“It appears that this particular communication from the DoT (which is dated 17 May 2018) has not taken into account our communication. We would like to reiterate that this is yet another frivolous complaint by Reliance Jio and we will respond to it at the appropriate forums,"" the spokesperson said.
Airtel in its 15 May letter said that all information relating to customers, network nodes, etc., along with provision for lawful interception, are hosted in a fully secure manner by the company in India. It stated that no network node or information or data, as alleged by Reliance Jio, has been hosted outside of India.
Airtel’s letter said that network node referred by Reliance Jio appears to be an inventory server, called SMDP server of eSIM, which is not the network node of the company. The letter said that network related information on SIM or eSIM to enable mobile devices connect with network is loaded by SIM makers outside India.
Airtel said that Reliance Jio itself is using SMDP servers installed outside India, which it has not disclosed to the DoT. A company official on condition of anonymity said that charges levelled by the rival are baseless and the SMDP server used by Reliance Jio is located inside India."

Mumbai: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is planning to expand beyond the Indian market, and will set up a subsidiary in Estonia, according to two people aware of the plans.
Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd, an investment holding company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), will give a loan of Rs12.20 crore (€1.5 million) to the Estonian unit to begin operations, according to one of the two people cited above, both of whom declined to be named.
“Thanks to its sophisticated e-solutions, over the last decade, Estonia has transformed itself into one of Europe’s business success stories. Indian companies would certainly wish to collaborate and imbibe e-governance solutions in this regard and Jio is no exception,"" said the second person.
A company established in the northern European nation can operate worldwide, while all the compliance work and agreements can be handled digitally .
A spokesperson for Reliance Jio did not immediately respond to queries.
In Estonia, 99% of public services are available online 24x7.
Since 2000, all government services in Estonia are offered online and all documents are electronically available.
The reported move comes against the backdrop of Estonia wishing to develop a long-term relationship with India.
According to an IANS news agency report on 13 March, Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, had in a meeting with an Estonian government delegation, expressed interest in collaborating with the country to develop better e-governance solutions or India.
“A statement from the company said Ambani envisaged to make lives better for millions in India by replicating innovative solutions offered by Estonia into the Indian context, adding that, the ‘e-residency programme’ of Estonia will empower him with easy access to the entire European Union (EU) for his existing business while sitting in India,"" the IANS report had said.
E-Residency is a new digital nation for global citizens. Estonia is the first country to offer e-Residency, a government-issued digital ID available to anyone in the world.
E-Residency offers the freedom to easily start and run a global business in the European Union. Estonia will give access to the European Union.
“We believe your solutions are easily scalable to India. We wish to have a very close cooperation with your talent in Estonia,"" Ambani had said.
“Reliance Jio would want to diversify because, like it’s competitors it too is under great pressure in the Indian market. There is every reason to believe that the company may be running operations below cost,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India.
“In such an environment, it makes sense for any company to diversify in markets where the margins may be better. Besides, the European Union has long worked for a single telecom market. Being in Estonia does give you a foothold to expand further in Europe and helps Jio to mitigate some of the risks in the Indian market,"" said Uppal."

What is it? The net loss posted by State Bank of India (SBI) in the three months ended March 2018, almost double of that reported (Rs3,442 crore) in the same period a year ago.
Why is it important? This is the bank’s highest loss ever and the second-largest quarterly loss reported across lenders (after Punjab National Bank). The losses were mainly due to a surge in bad loans and the provisions made against them (Rs28,096 crore in the March quarter, against Rs18,876 crore in the December quarter). Its net and gross NPA (non-performing assets) ratios rose to 5.73% (from 5.61%) and 10.91% in the March quarter (from 10.35%), respectively.
Tell me more: There have been divergences in terms of bad loans, gross NPAs and provisions between the numbers reported by SBI and those assessed by the Reserve Bank of India, the net impact of which is reflected in its current earnings.

What is it? The number of people killed after the police opened fire against a group of protesters who were demanding the closure of a copper smelting plant belonging to Sterlite in Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu on Tuesday.
Why is it important? Many local residents have been protesting against the plant and its reported expansion for over three months. Things took an ugly turn on Tuesday and the protestors allegedly began vandalising government property, throwing stones at policemen and torching their vehicles, defying Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code imposed in the town area. Tamil Nadu chief minister E Palaniswami said the police resorted to firing to protect public life and property.
Tell me more: Residents of the town are said to be angry due to the pollution caused by the plant. The chief minister has ordered a judicial inquiry into the incident and announced a compensation of Rs10 lakh and jobs to the kin of the deceased, and Rs3 lakh for the injured.

What is it? The number of years for which Tata Motors produced Indica. On Tuesday, the company announced it would no longer be manufacturing the Indica.
Why is it important? The Indica was a seminal moment in the Indian passenger car journey. It marked the maiden foray of Tata Motors, which was a leader in trucks and buses then, into cars, a diversification it has since widened and deepened. While its diesel roots made it popular in the taxi segment, consumers didn’t warm up to it in the same way.
Tell me more: Tata Motors manufactured 19,042 units of Indica in 2016-17, but this plummeted to 1,686 units in 2017-18.

What is it? The loan amount that Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings, an investment holding company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries, will reportedly give to Reliance Jio Infocomm to set up a unit in Estonia.
Why is it important? This suggests that Reliance Jio, after disrupting the Indian telecom market with its aggressive pricing, has global ambitions. With its Estonian entry, Reliance Jio would get access to the unified European Union telecom market. Estonia is the first country to offer e-Residency, a government-issued digital ID that gives the freedom to start and run a global business while working from anywhere in the world.

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has made an investment of Rs10 crore in KareXpert Technologies Pvt. Ltd, an early-stage digital healthcare technology platform, two people aware of the matter said.
The investment was made by RIL’s subsidiary and investment arm, Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL).
“RIIHL has bought 22,222 preference shares in KareXpert Technologies Pvt. Ltd by way of private placement at a cost of  ₹ 4,500 a share and later may buy the entire lot of 66,666 preference shares in a few tranches, probably by pumping in another  ₹ 0 crore,"" the first of the two people said on condition of anonymity. 
Emails sent to RIL and KareXpert Technologies remained unanswered till press time.
Founded in 2014 by Nidhi Jain, Gurugram-based KareXpert intends to provide digital healthcare services in India’s top 100 cities. The company claims its technology to be India’s first digital healthcare open network, with cloud-based technologies for healthcare providers and multiple mobile/web applications for all stakeholders and patients. 
Last April, it soft-launched operations in Gurugram by signing up a few hospitals, clinics, high-rise residential communities and enterprises.
KareXpert is developing a one-stop digital healthcare platform. “Key differentiators are its greenfield development of core intellectual property to design and implement system modelling of entire distributed healthcare for a country’s private and public healthcare and to build a patient-centric platform rather than provider-centric,"" says the company’s LinkedIn profile.  
Reliance Jio’s HealthHub app, on the other hand, allows users to upload health and medical data to maintain a medical profile and view health charts, among other features.
With the help of the app, users can upload medical prescriptions, bills, lab reports, etc. and share them with medical service providers and family members.
“RIIHL’s interest in KareXpert could be from the point of view of its telecom arm Jio,"" an analyst tracking RIL said. “Last January, Jio had made its JioHealthHub health and fitness app live for its users.

721,2018-05-25,Reliance,"Anil Agarwal  wants to keep building Vedanta Resources into a giant producer of the commodities that India needs to curb its reliance on imports, create jobs and reduce poverty

London: Billionaire industrialist Anil Agarwal plans to leave behind a legacy: an Indian resources group to rival the world’s biggest. 
London: Billionaire industrialist Anil Agarwal plans to leave behind a legacy: an Indian resources group to rival the world’s biggest.
The founder and owner of Vedanta Resources Plc wants to keep building the company into a giant producer of the commodities that India needs to curb its reliance on imports, create jobs and reduce poverty. Despite its insatiable appetite for materials, India is yet to impose itself among the mining heavyweights in the way that Australia, China or even the UK does.
“It can be the second- or third-largest resource company in the world,"" Agarwal, 64, said in an interview in London. Domestic resources have been key to the success of all of the world’s biggest economies and India should be no different, he said. “We thought India should have a company.""
The goal is to invest in more local production of all commodities to feed India’s rapidly growing economy, which currently depends on imports for 80 percent of its oil and minerals. What’s less clear is how Agarwal’s stake in Anglo American Plc fits into that plan. The structure of his purchase last year — he’s now Anglo’s top shareholder but effectively rents the shares — led to speculation that he might take an activist role and seek to merge assets with Vedanta.
Management talks
Anglo’s management have consulted Agarwal regularly, he said, and so far his interventions have been limited to advice that the miner shouldn’t abandon South Africa as well as offering to help it expand into India. He said he’s committed to his 21% stake in Anglo.
“I am long-term, we can always keep extending, I can buy the bonds,"" he said. “We can do anything.""
The self-made businessman has enjoyed an audacious ascent from a small-town metal business in northern India to chairman of Vedanta, which he founded in Mumbai in 1976 and listed in London in 2003. Through its local Vedanta Ltd. and Hindustan Zinc Ltd. units, it controls oil fields, zinc mines, iron ore assets and aluminium and copper operations in India. It also has mines in Zambia and South Africa.
To keep expanding, Vedanta will invest $8 billion in the next 2 and 1/2 years. That’s a bigger share of annual revenue than miners such as Rio Tinto Group and Anglo have pledged to spend over a similar period.
“We take chances,"" Agarwal said. “We are like a river, we are going as and where assets are available.""
Agarwal’s confidence is largely driven by India’s reliance on imported raw materials. The country’s economy is expected to triple by 2030, and at the moment oil and mineral imports cost the nation about $300 billion a year, he said. By developing local mines, he hopes to curb that import spend and increase the mining industry’s contribution to the economy from 2.5% to 10%.
“In India we have enough resources,"" Agarwal said “India’s policies are liberalizing and improving the ease of doing business, and we don’t have to go outside of India.""
While Agarwal sees Vedanta’s growth and his philanthropy as key to helping reduce India’s poverty, the company’s expansion plans haven’t always been welcomed in the country. Deaths this week during protests at its copper smelting operations in southern India are the latest incidents in a controversial rise that has seen the company clash with communities and environmental standards. It shows the challenges of mining in the world’s most populated democracy.
Last month, Agarwal hired AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.’s Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan to take over as chief executive officer, giving Vedanta a chief with global mining experience and a strong reputation in India. Agarwal said it will allow him to better focus on company strategy, in the way he did before former CEO Tom Albanese left last year, as well as philanthropic work. But he won’t be walking away from the company.
“I’ll never retire, why should I retire,"" he said."

717,2018-05-29,Reliance,"Reliance Communications, or RCom, has offered to pay Rs500 crore to Ericsson India to settle a dispute related to unpaid dues of over Rs1,150 crore

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on Tuesday asked Anil Ambani owned Reliance Communication Ltd to “settle its dispute"" with respect to the non-payment of dues with the Swedish based telecom equipment manufacturer Ericsson India Pvt Ltd, following an offer of Rs. 500 crore made by the telco as a settlement amount.
A two judge NCLAT bench headed by Justice S.J Mukhopadhyay was hearing an appeal preferred by Reliance Communication against a 15 May order of the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) initiating insolvency proceeding against it on a plea made by Ericsson for recovery of unpaid dues of over Rs. 1,150 crore. 
Apart from Reliance Communications and Ericsson, other parties before the Appellate Tribunal include the lenders to Rcom group--China Development Bank, State Bank of India and Standard Chartered Bank. 
Ericsson had signed a 7-year deal in 2014 with Reliance Communications to operate and manage its nationwide telecom network. After non-payment of dues since 2016, Ericsson moved NCLT under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code against Reliance Communications and its two subsidiaries- Reliance Infratel and Reliance Telecom in September 2017. 
Arun Kathpalia appearing for Ericsson informed the court that the principal due amount of over Rs. 900 crore has now inflated to Rs. 1600 crore.
Post insolvency proceedings, the efforts by Reliance Communications to strike an out of court settlement with Ericsson have reportedly not worked out. 
The admission kick-starts a time-bound 180-day insolvency resolution process for RCom, which can be extended by an additional 90 days. The management control of RCom along its two units now vests with resolution professionals appointed by NCLT. 
Initiation of insolvency proceedings also puts a question mark on the fate on Reliance Communication’s Rs25,000 crore deal with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio for the sale of its assets mortgaged with different banks, as a debt resolution plan. 
Part of the deal with respect to the sale of tower and fibre asset is already pending before NCLAT, after NCLT Mumbai bench had imposed a stay on its sale in a plea by offshore investors of Reliance Infratel led by HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd. 
A stay imposed by the Bombay high Court on sale of spectrum, media convergence nodes (MCN) and real estate (at New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Jigni and Tirupati) was vacated by the Supreme Court on 5 April.

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) Wednesday stayed the corporate insolvency resolution process initiated against Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) and two group companies—Reliance Infratel and Reliance Telecom. The NCLAT order came after telecom equipment manufacturer Ericsson India Pvt. Ltd, which had initiated the insolvency proceedings, accepted RCom’s offer to pay Rs550 crore by 30 September.
The appellate bankruptcy tribunal also permitted RCom and its Joint Lenders’ Forum (JLF) headed by State Bank of India (SBI) to “sell the mortgaged assets"" of RCom to Mukesh Ambani owned Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, and deposit the money with the banks. 
“Taking into consideration the fact that if the corporate insolvency resolution process continues, both financial creditors as well as operational creditors will suffer...and prima facie case has been made out...the impugned order (passed by National Company Law Tribunal’s Mumbai Bench kick-starting the insolvency process for RCom) is stayed."", justice S.J. Mukhopadhyay said.
A two-judge NCLAT bench headed by Mukhopadhyay, however, made it clear that in case the agreed amount is not paid to Ericsson within 120 days starting 1 June, the appellate tribunal may revive the insolvency process against RCom. 
Under such a circumstance, the proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged property would go back to RCom. 
“Let this deal (with Reliance Jio) go through.. Their (Ericsson’s) claim would still be alive,"" RCom’s counsel Kapil Sibal submitted before the NCLAT, arguing that the initiation of insolvency would result in huge “hair-cuts"" for the banks as well as Ericsson. The settlement between RCom and Ericsson was reached a day after the appellate tribunal urged the parties to “settle the dispute"" on unpaid dues, while hearing an appeal by RCom through a shareholder , against the order of Mumbai bench of NCLT which initiated insolvency proceedings against it on a plea made by Ericsson for recovery of unpaid dues of over Rs1,150 crore.
Ericsson had signed a seven-year deal with RCom in 2014 to operate and manage its nationwide telecom network. After non-payment of dues since 2016, Ericsson moved NCLT under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code against RCom and its two subsidiaries Reliance Infratel and Reliance Telecom in September 2017. With the insolvency process stayed, RCom can now go ahead with its Rs18,100-crore deal with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio for the sale of its assets mortgaged with different banks to bring down debt.
Counsel appearing for the JLF informed NCLAT that as per the agreement with RCom, the lenders expected to get a total of Rs37,000 crore through the sale of mortgaged assets and through other debt resolution plans by July 2018. 
Part of the deal with respect to the stay on sale of tower and fibre assets was cleared by the appellate tribunal on 29 May after Reliance Infratel’s offshore investors and minority shareholder HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd decided to withdraw their objections to the sale. A stay imposed by the Bombay high court on the sale of the other assets i.e. spectrum, media convergence nodes (MCN) and real estate (at New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Jigni and Tirupati) was vacated by the Supreme Court on 5 April.

New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd will offer internet access, videos and voice calls for less than Rs1,000 a month when it wired broadband services later this year, a repeat of the aggressive pricing strategy that ruffled incumbents during the launch of its wireless phone services.
Reliance Jio, which has triggered a consolidation in the telecom sector since its entry in September 2016, is testing its fibre-to-home services in some cities, including New Delhi and Mumbai. 
“Reliance Jio plans to enter the wired internet segment by the end of this year...and the fibre-to-the-home (services) will also come with unlimited calling through a VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) phone as well as JioTV,"" a person aware of the matter said, requesting anonymity.
“Discussions on a bundled tariff are still going on, but current talks suggest it could be under Rs1,000 a month,"" the person added.
An emailed query sent to Reliance Jio was unanswered till press time.
As part of the wired broadband trials, Reliance Jio is currently offering free broadband with unlimited internet at 100 mbps against a security deposit of Rs4,500.
“Bundled offerings, though popular in some Western countries, have not been successful without a strong content play. Reliance Jio has been active with its content strategy and this would become an advantage with a bundled quad play—fixed line, mobile, broadband internet and media. It may increase consumer stickiness,"" said Amresh Nandan, research vice-president, Gartner.
On 1 May, the government approved a proposal to permit internet telephony. VoIP is a technology that allows users to make voice calls using a broadband internet connection instead of a traditional public switched telephone network.
JioTV, Reliance Jio’s television app, has also stepped up its content offerings recently. In the past, it has won digital rights for global sporting events such as Winter Olympics 2018, EFL Cup (Carabao Cup Final), and T20 cricket series Nidahas Trophy. Through the JioTV app, a user can access many TV channels and even pause and play a live programme or catch up on shows telecast over the previous seven days.
Ahead of Reliance Jio broadband launch, rival Bharti Airtel Ltd is trying to push its home broadband offerings in new cities and expand its coverage in cities where it is already present. Airtel has also boosted its content by introducing a new home broadband plan with speeds of up to 300 mbps at a monthly rental of Rs2,990, with 1,200GB of data and free subscription to Airtel’s over-the-top apps Wynk Music and Airtel TV.
Airtel currently has three plans with monthly rentals of Rs1,099, Rs1299 and Rs2,199, where it has bundled Amazon Prime subscription with landline calling and broadband.
“Bundled offering makes a lot of sense since the ability of telcos to monetize their infrastructure has fallen considerably, with competition forcing tariffs down drastically. Moreover, net neutrality rules disallow differential pricing of internet content. Therefore, offering additional services like DTH TV allows the telco to marry content with carriage and get pricing flexibility without breaching net neutrality. This is perhaps the best way for telcos to retain customers in the current volatile environment,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India.
Reliance Industries has increased the focus on content by recently announcing an integration with music app Saavn for its digital music service JioMusic, apart from separately buying a 5% stake in film firm Eros International Plc."

New Delhi/London: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, plans to halt oil imports from Iran, two sources familiar with the matter said, in a sign that new US sanctions are forcing buyers to shun oil purchases from Tehran. 
New Delhi/London: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, plans to halt oil imports from Iran, two sources familiar with the matter said, in a sign that new US sanctions are forcing buyers to shun oil purchases from Tehran.
RIL’s move, expected to take effect in October or November, came after US President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 nuclear agreement this month and ordered the reimposition of US sanctions on Tehran.
Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day “wind-down"" period ending on 6 August, and the rest, notably on the petroleum sector, after a 180-day “wind-down period"" ending on 4 November.
India has said it does not follow US sanctions but companies with links to the US financial system could be liable to penalties if they do not comply.
RIL, an Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has significant exposure to the financial system of US, where it operates some subsidiaries that are linked to its oil and telecom businesses among others.
RIL, whose modern refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat can process about 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, has told officials of the National Iranian Oil Co. (NIOC) that the firm would stop oil imports from Tehran in October or November, one of the sources said.
A second source said the company could halt imports from Iran earlier than that if European nations and Tehran failed to salvage the nuclear deal.
This source said that some insurance companies have asked RIL to end exposure to Iran before November. Global insurers have already warned about doing business with Iran while some shipping lines have said they would not take new bookings for Iran.
US has threatened to impose sanctions on European companies that do business with Iran.
In the interim period until it stops buying Iranian oil, RIL has asked NIOC to supply Iranian oil in vessels owned by National Iranian Tanker Co. (NITC), the sources said.
The sources did not wish to be identified as the matter is sensitive. Reliance did not respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment.
In 2017, RIL’s oil imports from Iran surged by about 45% to 67,000 bpd, according to ship tracking data. In Jan-April 2018, the company has imported about 96,000 bpd.
Rethinking Dealings
Washington’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal has spurred global insurers and other companies to rethink their dealings in Iran as they await further guidance from US and European Union.
Earlier this month French energy giant Total said it might quit a multi-billion-dollar gas project if it could not secure a waiver from US sanctions.
Italy’s Eni, which last June signed a provisional agreement with Tehran to conduct oil and gas feasibility studies, has said it had no plans for new projects in Iran.
RIL, which deals with some of the top-notch foreign bankers with huge exposure to the US financial system, exports fuel to the United States and imports ethane from there for its petrochemical plants.
Trade sources have said Reliance recently bought up to 8 million barrels of US crude.
After a gap of six years, Reliance resumed purchases from Iran in 2016 when Western powers eased restrictions on trade with Iran in return for Iran agreeing to end its disputed nuclear programme.
During previous sanctions NIOC waived a condition for its oil buyers to open letters of credit.
Since the lifting of sanctions, it has been selling oil in euros, a move that has allowed companies to temporarily continue dealing with Iran, despite the US move to reimpose sanctions.
Iran is also offering deep discounts on sales to recoup market share in Asia, lost to key rivals Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
The company’s global depository receipts are traded in the US market. It is also the first Asian company to float 50- and 100-year bonds on the US debt market, according to its annual report."

New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has started hiring a team of professionals under Akash Ambani to work on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its multiple use cases for the telecom firm, two people aware of the development said.
“Reliance Jio has hired a few senior people who will build this team...the company wants to set up this team in either Bengaluru or Hyderabad.... Akash Ambani is taking keen interest in this and is expected to lead this initiative,"" one of the two people said, requesting anonymity.
The company has not selected the location.
“Reliance Jio has already started the recruitment process in Bengaluru...apart from AI, it is looking for people who can work on machine learning and blockchain,"" the second person said, requesting anonymity.
Reliance Jio, the latest entrant in India’s telecom sector, has signed up a subscriber base of 186 million users since its launch in September 2016. The company first pushed its cheap data and free voice services aggressively in the market and followed it up with an “effectively free"" Jio Phone available for a refundable security deposit of Rs1,500. It is now looking at technologies like blockchain, apart from leveraging the strength of its pure 4G network to move to its next phase of growth which it believes will be led by 5G, artificial intelligence, internet of things, among others.
During his inaugural address at the India Digital Open Summit in Mumbai in January, Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambani’s son Akash Ambani had said that “globally, Artificial Intelligence is becoming one of the mainstream technologies and voice assistance, recognition and command are growing on a daily basis in terms of usage"".
Reliance Jio’s rival Bharti Airtel too has stepped up focus on AI and machine learning. In April, it appointed Santanu Bhattacharya as its chief data scientist to leverage data science capabilities and analytics to understand customer needs and develop innovative products and services at Airtel. Bhattacharya is based out of Bangalore and reports to Harmeen Mehta, global chief information officer and head of digital at Bharti Airtel.
“Recognizing patterns where large numbers are involved is the core of Artificial Intelligence. Reliance Jio could use it to figure out how best to run a network, deploy capacity, what to bundle, which services to target across regions, among others. Artificial intelligence can also help a telco better monetise usage of data on its pipe and strategise its content push,"" a sector expert said requesting anonymity.
In May, Reliance Jio launched ‘JioInteract’, an artificial intelligence-based platform for movie promotion and brand engagement.
JioInteract can listen to user questions and respond. The platform also has an auto-learning feature that helps improve the answering accuracy, the company had then said, adding Reliance Jio is also tapping the developer ecosystem to create innovative applications like virtual showrooms, product demonstrations, ordering cart for e-commerce, etc."

Mumbai: There is nothing striking as yet about the two mid-sized rooms in the 150,000 sq. ft building on the 5.5-acre campus of Whistling Woods International (WWI), a film, communication and media arts institute. A couple of virtual reality (VR) headsets and VR cameras are strewn about, and a team of youngsters sitting on the floor discuss some plans. 
Mumbai: There is nothing striking as yet about the two mid-sized rooms in the 150,000 sq. ft building on the 5.5-acre campus of Whistling Woods International (WWI), a film, communication and media arts institute. A couple of virtual reality (VR) headsets and VR cameras are strewn about, and a team of youngsters sitting on the floor discuss some plans.
Yet, the belief in the nascent VR market has been strong enough for Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd to partner with Whistling Woods to set up this Development Lab dedicated to the VR and Augmented Reality (AR) industry. The lab at Mumbai’s Film City in Goregaon, named ‘Whistling Woods Jio VR Lab’, is expected to be officially inaugurated by Mukesh Ambani’s son Akash Ambani this month.
“This lab is still in the process of being set up. It will be a few months before we can get everything in place,"" explains Chaitanya Chinchlikar, vice-president of business development at Whistling Woods which was founded by filmmaker Subhash Ghai. The idea is to create the first generation of cinematic VR filmmakers in the Indian film, media and entertainment industry, says Chinchlikar, who is also the chief technology officer at Whistling Woods, besides being VP, strategic development at Mukta Arts Ltd. 
“Reliance Jio has given us a three-year commitment to begin with,"" says Chinchlikar who points out that the telco already has a lot of experience in the VR arena. For instance, the Reliance Jio phone launch and Reliance Industries Ltd’s 40th annual general meeting on 21 July 2017, were broadcast live in 360-degree VR. Moreover, last November, the UK-based Birmingham City University said Reliance Jio had plans to launch its own VR app in 2018 and was hoping to rope in experts from the university. Last, but not the least, Reliance Jio has a lot of bandwidth (read: 5G or fifth generation network) that will help in speeding up VR projects while reducing latency times.
The Lab, according to Chinchlikar, hopes to work with the Indian film and media industry in many ways, including conducting monthly seminars and workshops for them. “We will also develop a curriculum for Cinematic VR, which will be taught to all students of WWI, making them India’s first generation of VR Filmmakers,"" adds Chinchlikar.
VR/AR is the fourth platform, after films/theatre, television and digital, according to Chinchlikar who believes VR will become ubiquitous by 2020-21 by when he hopes the Whistling Woods students will be “industry-ready with VR content"". However, there are quite a few challenges to overcome when dealing with VR/AR content. For one, if a story can be told as effectively in any other format, it should be. “Just because something can be done in 360VR, doesn’t mean it should,"" cautions Chinchlikar. Second, fiction narrative content for VR is at a highly nascent stage and there is “no format for the same"" as yet.
To address these issues, the lab will work with students and industry professionals (including Whistling Woods alumni) to “create multiple fiction / narrative short videos in ‘working-under-supervision’ model"", says Chinchlikar. Moreover, Whistling Woods is a member of the India chapter of the VR Industry Forum (VRIF) and a member of the Production Guidelines Task Force. VRIF is a global collective of leading organizations in VR. Its goal is to further the widespread availability of high quality audiovisual VR experiences and establish guidelines for security, interoperability, distribution and production of VR content.
“This (partnership with Reliance Jio) is a first-of-its-kind example of industry-academia partnership in R&D for the media and entertainment industry,"" says Chinchlikar, who concludes with a smile, “The lab will never be ready. We will always have something new."""

New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Wednesday rejected Reliance Power Ltd’s plea seeking permission to mine coal from the Moher and Moher-Amlohri blocks beyond the approved limit of 17 million tonnes per annum (MTPA).
Reliance Power had argued that the existing cap on coal mining was not enough to run its 3,960 megawatt Sasan Ultra Mega Power Project (UMPP) in Madhya Pradesh, and if the additional 2 MTPA was not allowed it could face the “threat of a shutdown"".
It also said that the additional amount will help it to maintain a buffer stock 1.25 million tonnes of coal for meeting any exigency, which might disrupt coal production, PTI reported.
Reliance Power’s pleas claimed that a shutdown of the power project would result in a loss of Rs130 crore for the company, while the discoms would have to shell out more than Rs200 crore to purchase power from other sellers to provide electricity to its consumers.
The plea was part of a writ petition filed by Reliance Power in 2015, challenging the Centre’s decision to cancel one of the three coal blocs — the Chhatrasal coal block in Madhya Pradesh — allocated to Sasan.
Sasan UMPP, which comprises six units of 669 MW each, is the world’s largest integrated power generation and coal mining project. The power project aims to provide reliable and low-cost power for 25 years to more than 42 crore people across seven states.

The telecom industry’s losses, expectedly, expanded in the March quarter. Apart from continued erosion in tariffs, telecom companies were also hit by a cut in international termination rates.
Bharti Airtel Ltd’s India wireless operations slipped into the red on the Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) line, joining Idea Cellular Ltd, which has been running losses for four quarters now.
Airtel and Idea reported a loss before interest and tax of  ₹ 480 and  ₹ 1,080 crore, respectively, after adjusting for exceptional items.
The saving grace for the incumbents is that they have held their own in terms of voice and data traffic in the past two quarters.
At one point last year, it had seemed that capital expenditure constraints had begun to hurt Idea Cellular. But in the past two quarters, it has reported an increase in subscriber count and network usage, as well as a sharp drop in subscriber churn.
Of course, all this means that capital expenditure requirements remain at elevated levels.
With Jio promoting unlimited voice plans, bundled with large amounts of data, the name of the game is investing in building capacity. With high losses accompanied by high investments, it’s little wonder leverage is going from bad to worse.
What’s more, the erosion in Arpu (average revenue per user) is nowhere near done. 
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has just begun targeting the post-paid and international calling segments, and pricing pressure in those segments will result in lower price realizations and, hence, higher losses.
And with the company’s history of frequent disruptions, analysts fear what may be coming next.
Since the incumbents have demonstrated an ability to hold their own in terms of traffic and subscriber growth, it shouldn’t be surprising if Jio remains in disruption mode for some time to come."

“Our aim is to have the consumer businesses contribute on par with the energy and materials businesses over the next decade, when we celebrate our golden jubilee,"" Ambani said in the company’s annual report 2017-18.
During the year, RIL’s consumer businesses attained a threshold from which they will start contributing meaningfully to consolidated profits, Ambani said.
“From a mere 2% in FY17, Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail accounted for 13.1% of RIL’s consolidated segment Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in FY18. This was achieved notwithstanding a sharp 33.6% spurt in consolidated Ebitda to  ₹ 74,184 crore.

For FY18, the government had initially set the fiscal deficit target at 3.2% of GDP, but had later revised it to 3.5% of GDP.

Kotak Institutional Equities has an interesting report that draws parallels between the famous dollar auction game and the Indian telecom sector. The dollar auction game was used by economist Martin Shubik, a pioneer of game theory, to illustrate a concept known as “escalation of commitment"". Since the highest bidder wins the dollar, and the second highest bidder loses all that he/she has bid, those playing the game tend to keep bidding higher amounts to avoid losing what they have already bet. 
Kotak Institutional Equities has an interesting report that draws parallels between the famous dollar auction game and the Indian telecom sector. The dollar auction game was used by economist Martin Shubik, a pioneer of game theory, to illustrate a concept known as “escalation of commitment"". Since the highest bidder wins the dollar, and the second highest bidder loses all that he/she has bid, those playing the game tend to keep bidding higher amounts to avoid losing what they have already bet.
Shubik says it is not uncommon for the person conducting the game to end up with $3-5 for every dollar that was auctioned. In such scenarios, the winning bidder would have ended up paying roughly between $1.5 and $2.5, with the losing bidder ending up losing a similar amount, give or take a few cents. Of course, the winning bidder’s losses will be lower when compared to the second highest bidder, since he gains the auctioned dollar, but both end up losing when bidding is competitive.
Could the fate of India’s largest telecom companies be the same? Every passing day, they increase their bids to gain a higher share of the market. They are doing this by increasing capital expenditure, and a willingness to fund large operating losses in the hope of a glorious future, where all of this will be recouped. 
In the three-headed slugfest between Bharti Airtel Ltd, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and the Vodafone-Idea combine, each entity has already spent somewhere between  ₹ 2 trillion and  ₹ 3 trillion in gross capital investments. 
But the sharp rise in investments, especially since the entry of Reliance Jio, has also led to a shrinking of the market size. As the chart above shows, industry revenues have fallen by about a third since Reliance Jio’s entry. And this is before the new entrant’s latest salvo that involved a sharp cut in post-paid tariffs and international calling rates. Who knows what lies next?
In this backdrop, even a sizeable 50% market share may not amount to much in terms of profit potential. “We have seen spectrum auction bids and commercial decisions add up to an ‘escalation of commitment’ and undesirable outcomes, as things stand today,"" Kotak’s analysts write in the report.
“The game (between telecom firms) has the potential to reach a stage where aggressive bids are placed just to force another player to exit; such aggression again reduces the size of the prize but a player can still look at the trade-off between reduced size of the prize and potentially higher share of it as a net positive. Commitments escalate easily,"" they add.
Such scenarios haven’t been restricted to dollar-auction games in the past; they have played out often in real-life scenarios as well. In a paper published in the Journal of Marketing, researchers Eyal Biyalogorsky, William Boulding and Richard Staelin say that the occurrence of “escalation of commitment"" phenomenon is a well documented one. They cite the examples of “the Vietnam War and Desert Storm, the Apollo moon missions, the Campeau–Federated merger, the coffee wars between Philip Morris and Procter & Gamble, the National Basketball Association draft etc."", adding that the tendency to escalate commitments can be disastrous for firms, especially in hyper-competitive markets.
Kotak’s analysts say, “It is possible for a net-positive win-win outcome to emerge when players realize that the size of the prize and the cost associated with getting to a particular share matter as much as the share itself."" But this will involve so-called de-escalation bids, such as increasing tariffs and similar sane decisions. Now, who wants to bet on that?"

Its latest plan extends a strategy of raising cheaper debt, riding on its better-than-sovereign ratings, while also actively investing about $12 billion in reserves to generate returns.
The cash “helps them manage their debt-raising at the most optimal interest rates,"" Vishal Kulkarni, a Singapore-based analyst at S&P Global Ratings, wrote in an email. “Historically the company has been able to keep their cash invested in financial assets that provided returns more than their costs of funding—thereby avoiding any negative costs of carry.""

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd has approached the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), accusing Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd of making false and misleading claims in its latest advertisement. ASCI has upheld the complaint. 
New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd has approached the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), accusing Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd of making false and misleading claims in its latest advertisement. ASCI has upheld the complaint.
This is the latest round in the war of words between the two telecom operators. 
Since Reliance Jio’s entry, the two operators have locked horns over network testing norms, provision of points of interconnect, the cut in interconnect usage charges and advertisements. Last month, Bharti Airtel had moved the fast-track complaints panel of the council alleging that Reliance Jio, in its latest advertisement starring actor Deepika Padukone, had falsely claimed that it was the “best network and the world’s largest mobile data network"", besides offering “best entertainment"" and “best postpaid offers"".
The claims, Airtel argued, were unsubstantiated and there was no clarification or independent third-party data to back them. Moreover, since these claims were made without any supporting evidence or disclaimers, the advertisement violated ASCI guidelines, Airtel said in the complaint.
The panel, after concluding a personal hearing with Reliance Jio, observed that Reliance Jio may carry the largest quantum of data consumed by subscribers globally, but data consumption cannot be the only parameter for claims that it was the largest mobile data network. It said infrastructure as well as the number of subscribers are also important parameters and, therefore, Reliance Jio’s claim of “best network and world’s largest mobile data network"" is misleading by ambiguity.
Mint has reviewed a copy of the panel’s recommendation as well as Airtel’s complaint to the panel. “The panel is also not in agreement with a blanket claim of the advertiser’s (Reliance Jio’s) offers being the best postpaid offers since it is not clear what aspects of the advertiser’s product are being compared with that of the competitor’s product,"" ASCI said in the letter. The panel also said Reliance Jio’s self-proclaimed claim of “best entertainment"" was not substantiated and is misleading by ambiguity.
A Reliance Jio spokesperson said, “The allegations made by the incumbent dominant operator are thoroughly frivolous and have been made only to distract others. This specific matter is currently under discussion with the ASCI. We believe that the recommendations at this stage do not reflect the submissions made, and the favourable views expressed by the ASCI during the course of discussions. We have followed up with further submissions and clarifications so that the right decision is made.""
It is likely that ASCI and Reliance Jio will meet again on 18 June, a person aware of the matter said, requesting anonymity.
This is not the first such controversy on advertisements between the two telecom operators. In March 2017, Reliance Jio accused Bharti Airtel of airing misleading ads on network data speed and ASCI, after investigating the matter, asked Airtel to withdraw the advertisement. Reliance Jio moved the metropolitan magistrate’s court after Airtel advertisements started appearing again in June, but in August the court dismissed its plea."

Mumbai: The Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) stock seems to have much steam left, even after a stellar performance in 2017-18 when it posted the best returns in eight years.
RIL share price has gained 11.29% in 2018-19, even before the first quarter has ended. This comes on the back of a 33.84% gain in 2018, the best returns since its surged 41.11% in 2009-10.
For the calendar year-to-date, however, the stock is up mere 6.67%, given the dismal performance in the first three months of 2018.
RIL shares touched a record high of  ₹ 1,010.70 on 27 April, and have erased 2.8% ever since to close at  ₹ 982.45 on Monday.
For the three months ended 31 March, RIL had reported its highest quarterly net profit of  ₹ 9,435 crore, beating analysts’ estimates. 
However, the performance of the telecom arm, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, remained subdued with the company posting a mere 1% growth in net profit on a sequential basis as the ongoing tariff war, which Reliance Jio triggered, brought down its average revenue per user (ARPU) to  ₹ 137 in the March quarter from  ₹ 154 a quarter earlier.
However, analysts believe the impressive subscriber growth was a key positive for Reliance Jio.
“...we see the stars aligning for it to break toward our PT (price target of  ₹ 1,241) as diesel, polyester and retail margins step up to a new normal, telecom subscriber growth sets new benchmarks and capex unwinds,"" Morgan Stanley said in a 10 June note.
“This should energise a front-loaded 80% EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) rise in three years,"" Morgan Stanley analysts, who have an overweight rating on the stock said.
There was more conviction among analysts than a year before for RIL stock.
According to data from Bloomberg, currently, 31 analysts have a buy or overweight rating on the stock, four have a hold or neutral while five have a sell or underweight rating.
In comparison, 23 analysts had a buy or overweight rating on the stock a year ago, while 12 had a hold or neutral, while three rated it a sell or underweight.
“The capex cycle of RIL is now towards the end, and most of the petchem plants are up and running. Petcoke gasification should be operational in the first half of FY19,"" said Sudeep Anand, head of institutional research, at IDBI Capital Market & Securities Ltd.
According to Anand, once all these plants kick start, it will add to the GRMs (gross refining margins) by $2-3 per barrel, given the firm global gas prices.
“Performance of Reliance Jio is quite encouraging. The key thing is subscriber growth. The stock is not very expensive, as it trades at 14.5 times FY20 earnings. Hence, we continue to have a buy rating on the stock,"" added Anand.
A few were pessimistic though.
In a note on Monday, Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said it keeps its underperform rating on Reliance Industries where valuations are rich and fourth quarter of FY18 was soft, noting that earnings (softer refining, gradual integrated gasification combined cycle ramp-up and softer telecom) and free cash flow (higher capex, a turn in working capital) could also lag Street expectations in fiscal year 2019-2021."

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai’s) financial report for the March quarter puts Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s adjusted gross revenue (AGR) at  ₹ 6,218 crore. This is about 22% higher than Vodafone India Ltd’s revenue and only 12% lower than market leader Bharti Airtel Ltd’s AGR of  ₹ 7,087 crore.  
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai’s) financial report for the March quarter puts Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s adjusted gross revenue (AGR) at  ₹ 6,218 crore. This is about 22% higher than Vodafone India Ltd’s revenue and only 12% lower than market leader Bharti Airtel Ltd’s AGR of  ₹ 7,087 crore. 
Based on these numbers, Reliance Jio has a market share of as much as 25.6%, less than two years since its launch. Vodafone and Idea Cellular Ltd, both of whom had a head start of about two decades over Reliance Jio, had an AGR market share of 21% and 16.6%, respectively.
But apparently, the AGR figure needs to be adjusted some more to reflect true market share. The AGR reported by telcos for their various circles does not fully capture revenues subscribers pay for roaming and national long distance (NLD) calls. As such, it makes sense to add NLD revenues reported by telcos, to the extent these are used by their captive subscribers, and arrive at, if you will, adjusted AGR (AAGR).
Based on estimates of Kotak Institutional Equities, after making these adjustments, Reliance Jio’s market share stands at 20.7%. We made another adjustment to reflect revenues of Aircel Ltd, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year and didn’t bother reporting revenues to Trai.
Based on this so-called AAGR data, Reliance Jio has a market share of 20.4%, which is not much lower than Vodafone’s 21.5%. So while the new entrant may not be No.2 yet, it isn’t far away from the mark.
The company may well reach that milestone in the June quarter, although it may get relegated back to the third position after Vodafone and Idea announce their merger.
While Reliance Jio has quickly grabbed a fifth of the market, its cut-throat pricing has also led to a fall of over a third in the revenue of large incumbents. Small firms’ revenues have fallen by 85%, and it’s only a matter of time before they completely disappear.
Since Reliance Jio’s launch, the overall industry size has fallen by about 30% based on the above-mentioned AAGR data. A moot question is how much lower it can go with Reliance Jio aggressively continuing to vie for a larger piece of the pie. 
As pointed out earlier in this column, Reliance Jio’s actions suggest it is happy to live with a high share of a market that has shrunk considerably, rather than a lower share in an unshrunk market. As the drop in revenues in the past six quarters show, that is extremely bad news for incumbents."

Mumbai: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani is planning to enter the e-commerce business by combining the best of online and offline shopping experiences, a business model that will require zero cash burn to acquire customers.
As part of the plan being put together by two of Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL) consumer-oriented units—Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Reliance Retail Ltd—the company plans to sign on local merchants, boosting their sales through what is known as O2O (online-to-offline) marketplace, a business model that Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has pioneered, said one person with direct knowledge of the matter, on condition of anonymity.
The move is in line with Ambani’s aim to generate half of the group’s revenue from the consumer businesses over the next 10 years. Currently, 80% of the group’s sales come from its traditional oil and gas business. 
“Demand is going to come from tier 2 and 3 and 4 towns and cities. Then you need to have the ability to deliver at these places,"" said this person.
“At present, the cost of delivery will be very high, making this unviable. So, you have to create local markets and be present everywhere, where you know the local merchants and local customers and Jio will have to connect them,"" the person added.
An email sent to an RIL spokesperson remained unanswered till press time.
Under the O2O model, a consumer searches for the product or services online but buys it through an offline channel. RIL’s plan is to consolidate merchants under an e-commerce platform. The merchants, in turn, will cater to the demand from the untapped markets. 
This will help the company save on costs by avoiding the discounting game and penetrate areas currently outside the traditional purview of e-commerce companies. 
“Over a period of time, the company can pass on the demand to the merchant, since the (local) merchant is closer to the consumer,"" said the person cited above.
This is where Jio’s role converges with the strengths of Reliance Retail.
According to a Reliance executive, the company has a formidable physical presence in the country with 4,000 Reliance Retail stores, about 50 warehouses, and 4,000 Jio points, which will be scaled up to 10,000 over a period of time. 
“That is going to help us in our e-commerce venture in a big way as each of them is a touch point to sign up merchants, and act as delivery points,"" the person said."

It’s not just that the current account deficit is widening—the means of financing it also became more risky in 2017-18. On the one hand, higher oil prices are raising the current account deficit and on the other, foreign direct investment—the most stable source of financing the deficit—has come down. This has led to greater reliance on foreign portfolio inflows, particularly volatile debt inflows and also on short-term credit. 
It’s not just that the current account deficit is widening—the means of financing it also became more risky in 2017-18. On the one hand, higher oil prices are raising the current account deficit and on the other, foreign direct investment—the most stable source of financing the deficit—has come down. This has led to greater reliance on foreign portfolio inflows, particularly volatile debt inflows and also on short-term credit.
This is a problem because the US Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates and has signalled more rate hikes to come. As RBI governor Urjit Patel wrote in an article in The Financial Times, the US Fed’s programme of shrinking its balance sheet, coupled with increased US Treasury issuance to fund a larger government deficit, has already led to dollar liquidity shrinking in international markets, particularly in the debt markets. This is behind the outflows from emerging market debt.
Indeed, economists expect India’s current account deficit to widen sharply in the current fiscal year. Suvodeep Rakshit, Madhavi Arora and Upasna Bhardwaj, writing in a Kotak Securities research report, say that even with an average price for Brent crude at $67.5 a barrel in FY19, an optimistic assumption given current levels, the current account deficit will be 2.6% of GDP, up from 1.9% in FY18. Assuming Brent at an average of $72.5, which too is lower than the current level, results in the current account deficit going up to 2.9% of GDP. And with Brent at $80 a barrel, the Kotak researchers say the current account deficit will be 3.3% of GDP.
The rapid deterioration in the trade environment as a result of protectionist policies is also likely to affect export growth, while rising investment demand will result in more imports. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, or UNCTAD, had in its recent World Investment report pointed to a slowdown in global foreign direct investment flows.
Gaurav Kapur, chief economist at Indusind Bank Ltd, says reliance on portfolio flows to finance this deficit will expose the country to the vagaries of fickle international capital flows, making funding difficult particularly during risk-off episodes. Kapur says the balance of payments surplus may disappear in FY19.
Within portfolio flows, the increased reliance on debt inflows carries more risks, as unlike equity, debt has to be repaid. NRI flows too have proved to be volatile, especially if the rupee depreciates. Earlier this month, credit rating agency Moody’s Indian affiliate, ICRA Ltd, said high global crude oil prices are likely to widen India’s current account deficit and pointed to slowing foreign portfolio investments as an area of concern.
The higher current account deficit will put downward pressure on the rupee and it may also raise the cost of Indian borrowing abroad. A note from Edelweiss Securities Ltd points out, “The stress on BoP is already visible in Q1FY19 with the INR depreciating 4%; the RBI had to intervene to stem the depreciation."""

Without giving investment details, Reliance in its latest annual report said it has developed capabilities for 3D printing of wide-range of plastic and metals products. 
Reliance is developing new business verticals in the petrochemicals business to capture Rs30,000 crore composites market and has plans to produce graphene, enhanced plastics and elastomers, fibre reinforced composites which can replace steel. 
A composite is an engineered material made from two or more ingredients with significantly differing properties, either physical or chemical. 
One of the most common forms of composite in use today is carbon fibre. It is made by heating lengths of rayon, pitch or other types of fibre to extremely high temperatures in an oxygen-deprived oven. 
The resultant rayon strands are spun into a thread, then woven into sheets and mixed with hardening resins to form the various components needed. 
“RIL is investing in India’s first and largest carbon fibre production line with its own technology—to cater to India’s aerospace and defence needs as well as the specialty industrial applications,"" it said. 
It had last year acquired the assets of Kemrock Industries to enter the composites business and is focusing on thermoset composites such as glass and carbon Fibre-Reinforced Polymers (FRPs). 
“The ability to deliver exceptional strength (similar to or better than steel) at a significantly lower weight is a critical performance attribute of FRPs. Additionally, FRPs can withstand harsh weather, have a long life with minimal maintenance, are corrosion resistant and can be moulded into any shape,"" it said. 
Composites are used in a wide range of markets and applications: industrial, railways, renewable energy, defence and aerospace. 
“RIL expects the newly launched Reliance Composites Solutions (RCS) business to be the No. 1 composites player in India,"" the company said. 
Stating that it will focus on design and specifications driven markets and applications that have the potential to grant better returns, it said the focus areas include wind mill blades and parts for railways and metros, which have exacting standards of performance and safety (especially fire retardant). 
Also on the radar are carbon wraps to rehabilitate/refurbish India’s old infrastructure—bridges, buildings (for improved seismic performance) and pipes. 
“RCS will design and administer low-cost and high-volume products such as modular toilets and homes to support the Swachh Bharat Mission, disaster relief measures and Housing for All programmes initiated by the Indian Government,"" the annual report said. 
RIL said industrial 3D printing (especially with metal) is reaching an inflection point and the company has developed the capabilities to design and print a wide range of products using 3D printing technology—in both plastic and metal—from prototypes to functional parts."

Mumbai: This Father’s Day, Sundeep Sikka, executive director and chief executive officer of the Rs4 trillion-Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd, speaks of the money lessons he has given his daughter, Saima, who will pursue an under-graduation course.  
Mumbai: This Father’s Day, Sundeep Sikka, executive director and chief executive officer of the Rs4 trillion-Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd, speaks of the money lessons he has given his daughter, Saima, who will pursue an under-graduation course. 
How do you bring up a child in an environment of plenty rather than scarcity? 
Sundeep Sikka: What these kids take for granted was a luxury for us. I tell my daughter that what we see may or may not be around since this wealth is not inherited but built. You are going to be on your own and have to survive on your own steam.
What’s the money mantra you have given her?
Sundeep: I speak about compounding. Both from the point of view of price rise and investments. You have to keep working not just harder, but smarter. It is not about the number of hours you put in, but what you put in those hours. You have to save for the future. I’ve tried to inculcate the habit of saving in her by getting her to find the cheapest ticket or the best deal. For example, she was visiting her grandparents and she was on a 5:30am flight as it was cheaper than a later, more comfortable flight. Also, I have to demonstrate what I say, because saying is not enough. She has to see that attitude around her in the house too.
As a father how do you deal with peer pressure?
Sundeep: This is a constant struggle. This is really a big parenting issue. I tell her that each person has his own priorities. If their’s is spending big, it is for them to do. We don’t need to follow. It is really not about how expensive (a thing is), but about how good it is. Go for value in things and values in life.
What is a future father’s day gift you would like from her?
Sundeep: That she is successful and remains grounded.
When your father is a finance expert, he will understandably pass on a few lessons. Saima Sikka, 17, has learnt a few important lessons from her father. 
How do the money mantras work out in the real life?
Saima: I get an allowance and have to be within that. I have learnt to manage because of these early lessons. These will help me when I live on my own.
Any theory that came true?
Saima: He had invested in equity mutual funds at the time of my birth. I saw the magic of compounding when I looked at what it has become now; far superior to bank fixed deposits.
Did your dad’s money messaging help you in any way?
Saima: To deal with peer pressure better. I learnt that I should not follow the herd and think about what works for me. I have a good relationship with my parents, so I can discuss with them when I felt susceptible to this pressure.
What gift in the future would you like to give your dad for Father’s Day?
Saima: I think my parents will be happy if I work my way up to a great career. My being happy is the greatest gift I can give them."

Appearances can be deceptive, and so can reported profits. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd was the only Indian telco to report a pre-tax profit in the March quarter. Its pre-tax profit of  ₹ 784 crore last quarter stands in stark contrast to losses of  ₹ 2,052 crore and  ₹ 1,582 crore, respectively, in Idea Cellular Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd’s India wireless businesses. How has the company managed to stay immune from the pain inflicted on the telecom sector? 
Appearances can be deceptive, and so can reported profits. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd was the only Indian telco to report a pre-tax profit in the March quarter. Its pre-tax profit of  ₹ 784 crore last quarter stands in stark contrast to losses of  ₹ 2,052 crore and  ₹ 1,582 crore, respectively, in Idea Cellular Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd’s India wireless businesses. How has the company managed to stay immune from the pain inflicted on the telecom sector?
Reliance Jio’s operating costs indeed look far lower than its peers. But the company still capitalizes some expenses, since some of its operations such as home broadband and enterprise services are yet to be commercially launched. Besides, it follows a different depreciation policy which results in lower charges vis-à-vis peers, at least in the initial years of operations.
For this reason, Reliance Jio’s annual report is a much-awaited affair to figure out what the company’s total costs really are. Its FY17 annual report had revealed these hidden expenses in a fair amount of detail. The FY18 annual report not only conceals the break-up of operating expenses that were capitalized, but it even hides the total amount of capitalized expenses. One of the few new pieces of information in the report is that interest costs worth  ₹ 5,799 crore were capitalized. As such, total interest costs on a quarterly basis are  ₹ 1,962 crore, far higher than the interest cost of  ₹ 711 crore listed in the March quarter profit and loss statement.
Analysts at JM Financial Institutional Equities estimate operating expenses worth  ₹ 7,500 crore were capitalized in FY18, the majority in the June quarter, when all expenses were still being capitalized. On an ongoing basis, it is estimated that expenses worth  ₹ 800 crore are being​ capitalized each quarter.
Adjusted for all this, Reliance Jio’s pre-tax profit, or rather losses, stood at  ₹ 1,267 crore. Of course, it can be argued that the above-mentioned expenses don’t pertain purely to the wireless business, and hence may not be a fair comparison. Even so, it helps to get a sense of how much the home broadband and enterprise businesses need to add in terms of revenues, alongside growth in the wireless segment, for the company to turn profitable. 
From what is visible, some analysts marvel at Reliance Jio’s low-cost structure—especially with respect to network operating costs—while others raise questions about a sharp drop in staff costs from FY17 and the unusually low levels of general and administration expenses vis-à-vis peers.
Perhaps we shouldn’t worry about profitability, since there are more questions than answers.
What matters most is the movement of cash. After all, negative cash flow needs to be funded through debt or other means and has a bearing on investors’ fortunes. Reliance Jio generated  ₹ 3,570 crore in cash from operations, but spent almost 10 times that amount on capital expenditure. Free cash flow stood at a negative  ₹ 32,200 crore. Besides, capex spend using credit from suppliers rose by another  ₹ 4,700 crore. In short, Reliance Jio’s funding needs remain huge, which are largely met through borrowings by the company and its parent.
There aren’t exactly comparable figures for Airtel and Idea, although using a proxy Ebitda-capex measure, their cash outflows were far lower. Airtel’s negative free cash flow stood at  ₹ 4,380 crore, while Idea curtailed capex and limited it to  ₹ 1,050 crore. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Of course, Reliance Jio’s large capacity creation is helping it tap the boom for data services, as opposed to, say, Idea, where capacity constraints can result in market share losses.
Having said that, revenues and profitability need to rise meaningfully from current levels to cover large recurring cash outflows and also repay debt. For this to happen, tariffs need to rise meaningfully from current levels. Unfortunately for investors, the news on that front is quite the opposite and continues to worsen almost every passing week."

In February, RIIHL had acquired a 65% stake in Indian Film Combine for  ₹  1,105 crore. “This loan, however, could be disbursed in tranches,"" said one of the two people, requesting anonymity.
In an emailed response, a Reliance Industries spokesperson said: “RIL intimated stock exchanges on 16 February 2018 of its proposed investment in Indian Film Combine through its wholly-owned subsidiary RIIHL. Pursuant to this announcement, RIIHL has made and will be making investments in Indian Film Combine. No loan is proposed to be extended to Indian Film Combine."" 
 Reliance Industries had bought the 65% stake from Indian Film Combine’s existing shareholders—20% from the US-based Xander Group’s Mauritian arm for  ₹  340 crore and 45% from entities belonging to the promoter group of Reliance Industries—for  ₹  765 crore. The remaining is held by the Maker Group. 
Indian Film Combine is setting up a drive-in theatre and hospitality precinct comprising a hotel, a retail mall and a club, built on 12 acres in Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex. 
Reliance Industries is also engaged in construction and development of a convention centre, a retail mall and an office space at the complex. 
In its 16 February statement, RIL had said that together with the aforesaid Indian Film Combine project, it will create the city’s most attractive retail and entertainment destination, which will complement its world-class convention centre.

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is considering an initial public offering (IPO) of its telecom unit Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in the next two to three years, a person with knowledge of the matter said. 
Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is considering an initial public offering (IPO) of its telecom unit Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in the next two to three years, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
RIL plans to list Reliance Jio on the exchanges after the company’s consumer businesses, which includes Reliance Jio, overtakes its energy business in terms of revenue, the person said on condition of anonymity. “Reliance Jio’s plans are massive and when it reaches that stage, the company shouldn’t be a 100% subsidiary of a refinery company,"" the person said.
Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio set off a brutal price war among telcos when it launched services in September 2016, triggering a wave of consolidation in one of the world’s most crowded telecom markets. The consolidation of the industry into about three large operators and an increase in Reliance Jio’s market share will set the stage for the listing of the company.
“Many RIL investors don’t understand data services or digital services and many of those who want to invest in digital services may not want to invest in refineries,"" the person cited above said. “At some point, when everything has stabilized, you will have to give investors options to invest where they want to.""
“If we keep Reliance Jio as a 100% subsidiary of RIL, some RIL investors are bound to say that they don’t understand digital services. Which is one of the reasons our stock price doesn’t reflect our true potential,"" the person said, adding that RIL’s consumer business will be on a “par with its energy business in three years"".
Reliance Jio’s short-term plan is to engage with customers, and continue to add subscribers.
“There is no cutoff time, and there are a lot of decisions that need to be taken (for the listing to happen),"" the person said, adding that keeping Reliance Jio separate from RIL is going to be a complicated decision, which not many at the company are currently prioritizing.
In December, Bloomberg first reported RIL was considering a Reliane Jio IPO by early 2019, citing unidentified people aware of the matter.
Emails sent to spokespersons for Reliance Jio and RIL didn’t elicit a response till press time.
In the quarter ended 31 March, Reliance Jio added more than 9.4 million subscribers, taking its total users to 186.5 million, according to data compiled by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), becoming India’s fastest-growing telco. During the same period, Idea Cellular Ltd added 9.1 million subscribers, while Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone India added 8.4 million and 5.6 million users, respectively.
Reliance Jio can be expected to add more customers during the June quarter, the person cited above said. “At Reliance Jio, customer engagement is a priority, with focus being on adding subscribers. Revenue market share will eventually come,"" the person said.
For the moment though, Reliance Jio will be functioning as an entity under RIL. “The balance sheet is stable and steady and RIL can invest more (in Reliance Jio),"" the person added."

New Delhi: Reliance Infrastructure (RInfra) on Thursday said the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has approved the 100% stake sale in its integrated Mumbai power business to Adani Transmission Ltd (ATL) for an estimated value of Rs18,800 crore. 
“Following the commission’s nod, the transaction is expected to be closed in July 2018. The MERC had concluded its hearing into the matter and reserved its order on June 14, 2018,"" it said in a BSE filing. 
Reliance Infrastructure said it has already received approval of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) as well as its shareholders for the deal. Reliance Infrastructure and ATL had signed a Definitive Binding Agreement for 100% stake sale of the integrated business of generation, transmission and distribution of power in Mumbai in December 2017. 
The company said the total consideration value of the deal is estimated at Rs18,800 crore. Reliance Infrastructure will utilise the proceeds of this transaction entirely to reduce its debt, becoming debt free and will have a cash surplus of up to Rs3,000 crore. 
It said this is the largest ever debt reducing exercise by any corporate and is a major step in the company’s deleveraging strategy for future growth. The Mumbai power business (known as Reliance Energy) is India’s largest private sector integrated power utility, distributing power to nearly 3 million residential, industrial and commercial consumers in the suburbs of Mumbai, covering an area of 400 sq km. 
It caters to a peak demand of over 1,800 MW, with annual revenues of Rs7,500 crore with stable cash flows. Going forward, Reliance Infrastructure will focus on upcoming opportunities in asset-light EPC and defence businesses, it added.

688,2018-06-28,Reliance,"Brokerages CLSA and Kotak Institutional Equities already ascribe an enterprise value of over  1 trillion for Reliance Retail, and valuations can be far higher on listing

Reliance Retail Ltd is an obvious IPO candidate, if we ever saw one. It has everything investment bankers and IPO investors dream of. It is the largest in its industry (its revenues are nearly double the size of D-Mart), it is growing at a brisk pace (37% growth last year), and it has improved margins (from 4.2% in FY17 to 6% last year). All of the numbers pertain to its core retailing business. 
Reliance Retail Ltd is an obvious IPO candidate, if we ever saw one. It has everything investment bankers and IPO investors dream of. It is the largest in its industry (its revenues are nearly double the size of D-Mart), it is growing at a brisk pace (37% growth last year), and it has improved margins (from 4.2% in FY17 to 6% last year). All of the numbers pertain to its core retailing business.
But here is the clincher—retail stocks are hot. Avenue Supermarts Ltd, which runs the D-Mart chain of stores, trades at over six times FY18 revenues and nearly 70 times operating profit. What’s more, its massive rally post listing has rubbed off on other retail stocks.
If Reliance Retail goes ahead with an IPO anytime soon, it would be striking while the iron is hot. Brokerages such as CLSA and Kotak Institutional Equities already ascribe an enterprise value of over  ₹  1 trillion for Reliance Retail, and valuations can be far higher on listing. If it’s marketed well, which isn’t asking for much from the Reliance group of companies, the company can be valued at over $20 billion. And a mere 10% float can help it raise roughly over $2 billion. That is nothing to sneeze at—except when you are Reliance Industries Ltd.
In fact, analysts say, there may never even be a Reliance Retail IPO. From the sounds of it, the company’s parent has grander plans. Whenever it is ready, Reliance Industries is likely to float a mega IPO of its consumer businesses combined together.
Also read: RIL may go for a Reliance Jio IPO in 2-3 years
It has been talking about its retail business in almost the same breath as its telecom venture, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, referring to them as “consumer businesses"".
“The year saw our consumer businesses attain a threshold, wherefrom they will start contributing meaningfully to consolidated profits. From a mere 2% in FY 2016-17, Jio and Retail accounted for 13.1% of RIL’s consolidated Segment EBITDA in FY 2017-18. Our aim is to have the consumer businesses contribute on par with the energy and materials business over the next decade, when we celebrate our Golden Jubilee,"" chairman Mukesh Ambani wrote to shareholders in the annual report.
Apart from the fact that the two companies already work closely together—Reliance Retail is the master franchisee for Reliance Jio—the parent also sees a great amount of synergies going forward. For instance, when a Reliance Jio customer wants to shop for groceries online, revenues can stay within the family, if an app can direct him to Reliance Retail’s e-commerce wing. Besides, vouchers that can be used on both platforms can result in increased customer stickiness and cross-selling opportunities for both businesses.
Possibly, the company also thinks that a Reliance Retail IPO alone wouldn’t bring much to the table, especially seen in comparison with its overall investments in its non-energy businesses. Capital expenditure in the telecom business stood at  ₹  49,000 crore, or over $7 billion, just last year. This year isn’t expected to be very different. As and when Reliance decides it’s time for outside investors to share part of the burden of funding its grand plans, it would like it to be large enough to recoup a sizeable portion of its own investments. Perhaps, clubbing the telecom and retail businesses may provide the heft needed to raise large amounts and deleverage the balance sheet.
And if we were willing to get excited about just retail and e-commerce, imagine how delirious investors would get when more exciting terms such as data, digital services, content, connectivity and cloud are thrown into the mix.
But having said all this, it still makes sense for the company to explore a separate listing of its retail and telecom arms. First, the two businesses will attract different sets of investors. The basic tenet for unlocking value in a subsidiary is to attract investors who have an appetite for a specific business vertical, and thereby get rid of the embedded holding company discount. For all we know, if a combined consumer business arm is listed, there will eventually be a demand to split the two divisions.
And finally, as the saying goes, ‘A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush’. Why wait for a mega IPO when you can do a large-sized one now? In Reliance’s books, maybe we’re all just thinking too small."

This comes a month after Reliance Infratel, a unit of Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), withdrew its appeal before NCLAT against an order of the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which prohibited it from selling its assets, following a settlement with HSBC Daisy.
The settlement paved the way for Anil Ambani-led RCom’s deal with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio for the sale of its assets mortgaged with different banks, to avoid insolvency proceedings.
The final agreement was signed by the parties on 15 June, Salman Khurshid and Ashish Prasad, appearing for Reliance Infratel and HSBC Daisy, respectively, informed the two-judge NCLAT bench led by Justice S.J. Mukhopadhyay, and placed the agreement for record before the bench. 
On 12 March, NCLT’s Mumbai bench had stayed the sale of tower and fibre assets by Reliance Infratel in a plea by HSBC Daisy that alleged oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement and saying that their consent was not taken for the asset sale as should have been done under the articles of association of the company.
Subsequently, in April, Reliance Infratel moved the appellate tribunal challenging the stay.
A stay imposed by Bombay high court on the sale of other assets—spectrum, media convergence nodes (MCN) and real estate (at New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Jigni and Tirupati)—was vacated by the Supreme Court on 5 April.

There are two new offers in the fixed income market for retail investors. Shriram Transport Finance Co. Ltd is out with a public issue of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) across various tenures with 9.10-9.40% annualised return, while Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd has its new fund offer (NFO), Reliance Nivesh Lakshya Fund, a long-term fixed income investment option. 
New NCD
NCDs offer a good solution to those looking for regular income. This one is offering a choice of three tenures—3, 5 and 10 years. There are three options for interest payment—monthly, annual and cumulative (see graph). The monthly option works if you are looking for regular income and the cumulative option (where interest accrued is aggregated and paid out at the end of the tenure) gives the most efficient return if you don’t require money in the interim. While the interest rate is higher than what most bank fixed deposits give, the interest will be taxable at your slab rate just like in FDs. 
“The headline return at 9% plus is attractive. But on a post-tax basis, it works well only for those in the 10% tax bracket. If you are looking for diversification, tax efficiency (beyond 3 years holding) and liquidity debt mutual funds are better,"" said Amol Joshi, founder PlanRupee Investment Services. 
At 9.03% per annum, the post-tax earning for those in the highest tax bracket will be around 6.24%; for those in the 10% bracket, it will be around 8.10%. Avoid investing in the longer tenure NCD and if you fall in the 30%-plus tax slab. 
New fund offer
It’s an open-ended fund where you can invest at all times. This scheme will invest in government securities with long maturity with the objective of giving long-term compounded returns. It is an actively managed but with a buy-and-hold strategy. The minimum duration of the scheme will be seven years. 
“The strategy is a high duration product but does not depend on interest rate movements. We will invest in 25-30-year G-secs; incremental inflows too will be used to buy and hold the same. The end corpus for an investor will be influenced by how long they remain invested,"" said Amit Tripathi, chief investment officer – fixed income, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management. 
Sovereign guaranteed G-Secs are perhaps the safest for conservative investors. For holding periods beyond three years, tax efficiency rises. But given the mutual fund format and daily reporting of per unit net asset values (NAV), in the initial years you are likely to see the impact of marked-to-market volatility in the NAV.  “Return visibility increases over time as marked-to-market impact on NAV smoothens out with compounding of annual yield from the underlying security. The investment horizon should be at least 10 years,"" said Tripathi.
However, interim volatility can cause anxiety. “This type of fund will help if you are sure to remain invested for at least 15-20 years. Investors need to be able to handle daily swings,"" said Joshi. 
It is a buy-and-hold investment, which if managed consistently can help build a good debt allocation for long-term goals. It has an exit load of 1% for redemptions before 36 months. It can add allocation to your long-term fixed income portfolio, with the caveat that daily volatility shouldn’t bother you."

Airtel’s current move to transform itself comes after it has become imperative to build multiple non-wireless revenue streams—something that rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd already has in its blueprint with the upcoming launch of fibre-to-the-home and aggressive plans to set up data centres and build teams for artificial intelligence and IoT—especially at a time when revenues from the wireless and broadband business are shrinking across the industry. 
Reliance Jio, for example, has made a string of acquisitions targeted at the content space. It also sees opportunities in sectors such as healthcare and education sector where offerings can ride on its telecom pipe. Reliance Jio parent Reliance Industries Ltd also plans to use the tech prowess of Reliance Jio to foray into e-commerce, Mint reported on 14 June.
Airtel, too, sees data centres as a big revenue opportunity. It now plans to consolidate 108 MSCs (mobile switching centres, which connect calls by switching digital voice data packets from one network path to another) spread across the country to 12 large data centres, which it believes will make it the largest data centre operation in the country. “We are in the process of construction in Pune, Chennai and in Kolkata and we will have these 12 in the next 18-24 months,"" Vittal said.
Airtel attracted controversy when it was barred by the Unique Identification Authority of India from conducting Aadhaar-based verification of customers using the e-KYC process. It later allowed Airtel to conduct Aadhaar-based verification of mobile subscribers, but the e-KYC licence for Airtel Payments Bank remains suspended.
“We were chasing growth and we were perhaps complying with the letter but not the spirit so we inconvenienced customers when the DBT credits went in without their explicit consent to their bank accounts. We have significantly corrected our systems,"" Vittal said."
679,2018-07-04,Reliance,"Reliance Industries has struck at least 12 deals over 12 months with an estimated tab of about 28,900 crore. Ten of these are related to his consumer business

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd., India’s second-largest company by market value, has been on a shopping spree this past year, with a focus on expanding the draw of its consumer offerings. 
Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd., India’s second-largest company by market value, has been on a shopping spree this past year, with a focus on expanding the draw of its consumer offerings.
Helmed by India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, the company has struck at least 12 deals over 12 months with an estimated tab of about  ₹ 28,900 crore ($4.21 billion), according to calculations by Jefferies Group LLC and Bloomberg. Ten of these are related to his consumer business. Ambani has also capitalized on India’s ongoing bad-debt issues with purchases of distressed or insolvent companies including a local textile-maker, a carbon-fiber firm and the wireless assets of an indebted telecom company.
For a conglomerate better known for building massive projects including the world’s largest refining complex, this recent acquisitive streak reflects Ambani’s ambition to make his telecom, retail and media offerings as profitable as the legacy petrochemicals and refining businesses. It also traces his pivot toward building an integrated digital offering around carrier Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. with purchases in the entertainment and artificial intelligence-based education space.
Some of these acquisitions are basically Reliance “trying to grab content,"" said Deven Choksey, managing director at Mumbai-based KR Choksey Shares and Securities Pvt. “If they end up generating enough content, you can be reasonably sure that users will come on their network.""
Ambani has also been able to cherry pick debt-laden assets as local lenders scramble to resolve their $210 billion in stressed loans, Choksey said.
When Ambani, 61, rises to address shareholders in Mumbai on Thursday analysts are expecting to hear more on how the group will further integrate retail and telecom. Clear e-commerce plans, possibly at the annual shareholder meeting, could become a driver for re-rating the stock, brokerage CLSA said in a July 3 report.
Reliance has committed about $1.3 billion to acquisitions in the two years through to 31 March 2019, Jefferies India analysts led by Somshankar Sinha estimated in a report on Tuesday. The count excluded the Rhea Retail Pvt. Ltd. deal and a proposed  ₹ 17300 crore acquisition of spectrum, mobile-phone towers and fiber assets from Reliance Communications — the largest among recent transactions.
Overall, Reliance has invested about $53 billion in a range of businesses from telecom, retail and petrochemicals to real estate. Telecom alone has sucked up more than $36 billion. Debt has climbed three-fold over five years to about $32 billion at the end of March."

On payment of monthly bills for 12 consecutive billing cycles, Jio customers will get  ₹ 500 cashback in form of credit in the postpaid account. The credit will be adjusted against next postpaid invoices. Last year, in September, Reliance Jio had slashed the price of JioFi device from  ₹ 1,999 to  ₹ 999.
Reliance Jio’s postpaid plan of  ₹ 199, for example, offers 25 GB of data and free voice calls, unlimited SMS messages, and complimentary subscriptions to Jio apps to consumers.
Recently, Jio had announced a new ‘Jio Oppo Monsoon Offer’ with benefits worth up to  ₹ 4,900. Under this offer, Jio subscribers buying new Oppo device on old/new Jio SIM can avail cashback benefits worth  ₹ 1,800 in the form of  ₹ 50 vouchers. They will also get Jio Money credit of up to  ₹ 1,800 in three equal tranches of  ₹ 600 each (post 13th , 26th and 39th recharge) and  ₹ ,300 worth discount coupons from MakeMyTrip. 
Last month, Jio, in a limited period offer, gave additional 1.5 GB data per day to users who recharged with prepaid plans priced in the range of  ₹ 149 to  ₹ 799. Reliance Jio’s aggressive offering has taken the market by storm by forcing other operators to lower tariffs. In the quarter ended March 2018, Reliance Jio, with gross revenue of  ₹ 6,217.64 crore, pipped Vodafone to occupy the second spot in revenue market share.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai’s) performance indicator report for the March 2018 quarter shows that the industry’s woes continue. Kotak Institutional Equities points out in a note to clients that consumer-level wireless spends (including service tax) fell to  ₹  29,800 crore in the March quarter. That’s down from a peak of  ₹  44,700 crore in the June 2016 quarter, the last ex-Reliance Jio quarter. As such, the reduction in wireless bills works out to  ₹  59,600 crore on an annualized basis.

On an average, based on this data, consumer spends have fallen by 33% since Reliance Jio’s launch. While these computations are based on Trai’s quarterly report, there are some adjustments made by Kotak’s analysts.
While this is a bonanza for consumers, it is a nightmare as far as profitability of the sector goes. Each of the companies in the sector is burning high amounts of cash, with revenues barely able to meet operating expenses, leave alone capital expenditure.
This means that banks with exposure to the sector can get into further trouble. Also, as mentioned earlier in this column, lower revenues for the sector mean lower collections for the government. Telecom firms pay around 12% of adjusted gross revenue to the government in regulatory fees, apart from being the goose that lays the golden egg whenever spectrum auctions are conducted. Inflows from the sector have already come down considerably for the exchequer.
Kotak’s analysts also point out that consumer-level spend on wireless services fell to as low as 0.66% of nominal gross domestic product, compared to 1.2-1.3% pre-Reliance Jio.
“It is a new low in what was already a global-low ratio, and far below underlying spend potential,"" the analysts said in the note."

677,2018-07-05,Reliance,"Highlights from Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries’ (RIL’s) annual general meeting (AGM) for the financial year 2017-18

OTHERS :
The 41st annual general meeting of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) was held today, where the chairman spelt out the direction the energy-to-telecom conglomerate will take in 2018-19. Ambani announced the rollout of Reliance JioGigaFiber, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s fiber-to-the-home, or wired broadband, service. A new Jio Phone, the Jio Phone 2, and an exchange offer were also announced. The mainstay energy business and the consumer business, led by Reliance Retail, were also in focus. RIL share price went down by Rs 9.05 to Rs 981 after the AGM ended in the afternoon. Here are the highlights from the RIL AGM: 
“As we kick off our Golden Decade with a flourish, we remind ourselves of Reliance’s unwavering commitment towards India’s rise. May the God Almighty bless us in our endeavour,” says Mukesh Ambani as he concludes the RIL AGM.
Mukesh Ambani said Reliance Foundation’s rural transformation initiatives will now reach out to over 13,500 villages across 15 states of India. The CSR initaitives are focused on establishing strong market linkages for farmers and leveraging technology for better reach and impact.“All these initiatives will enhance our capabilities and competencies, making us future-ready, as we transition from a cyclical business to annuity business,” he added at RIL AGM.
Reliance Industries will maximize oil to chemicals conversion and upgrade all fuels to high value petrochemicals, says Mueksh Ambani at the RIL AGM. “The hydrocarbon business is thus posed for robust value creation and exciting times ahead.”
At the RIL AGM, Mukesh Ambani called agriculture and education as the two “unprecedented opportunities” in India, sectors that Reliance Industries will tap going forward.“India has unprecedented opportunity to create wealth in agriculture. Our purpose is to benefit farmers and consumers. Jio can usher in a smart, new green revolution in India, connect 58,000 colleges and universities and 1.9 million schools in less than 2 years,” says Ambani. “Reliance Jio will attempt to help overcome the deficit of physical infrastructure in healthcare.”
Reliance Industries is creating a hybrid, new commerce platform of that will see synergies between Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio.At RIL AGM, Mukesh Ambani says there are 35 crore customer footfalls at Reliance Retail, 21.5 crore Reliance Jio customers, 5 crore JioGigaFiber home customers, And three crore small merchants and shopkeepers in this ecosystem.
Reliance Jio has enabled Reliance Industries to strategically reinvent itself as a technology platform company, says Mukesh Ambani at RIL AGM. “Digital platforms have become the new-age factories and service providers,” he says.
“With the added functionalities and strong retail presence across India, the goal that I have now set for our Reliance Jio team is to enable 100 million users on Reliance Jio Phone platform in the shortest possible time and create another world record,” says Mukesh Ambani at RIL AGM.
Mukesh Ambani has unveiled the Reliance Jio Phone 2 at an introductory price of Rs 2,999. The Jio Phone 2 will be avialable from 15 August.
Under the Reliance Jio Phone Monsoon Hungama offer, you will be able to exchange your old phone for a Reliance Jio Phone. Under this offer, by exchanging your old feature phone, you can get a brand new Jio Phone for an effective entry price of just Rs 501, says Mukesh Ambani at RIL AGM.
RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani says YouTube, Facebook and WhatsApp are coming to the “effectively free” Reliance Jio Phone from 15 August.
“Your home will have wall-to-wall Wi-Fi coverage, every appliance, plug point, switch will become smart. You can have cameras giving you 24x7 security monitoring, alerts,” says Reliance Jio director Akash Ambani at the RIL AGM introducing JioGigaFiber.
“Gone are the days of Mbps, now it will be about Gbps,” says Isha Ambani at RIL AGM introducing the JioGigaFiber service.
Reliance JioGigaFiber will give large companies the ability to compete in the global marketplace, using digital tools and techniques that are powering the Fourth Industrial Revolution, says Mukesh Ambani at RIL AGM
Mukesh Ambani says Reliance JioGigaFiber will empower the small merchant. “When you combine fixed-line connectivity with the agility and customer obsession of a small owner-driven business you empower them to compete on level terms with larger businesses,” says Mukesh Ambani at RIL AGM.
The Reliance JioGigaFiber will bring to home ultra HD entertainment on large screen TVs, multi-party video conferencing, voice-activated virtual assistants, virtual reality gaming, digital shopping and immersive experiences, says Mukesh Ambani at RIL AGM. 
Speaking at the 41st RIL AGM, Mukesh Ambani unveils Reliance Jio’s JioGigaFiber, the fiber-to-the-home wired broadband service.We will now extend fiber connectivity to homes, merchants, small and medium enterprises and large enterprises simultaneously across 1,100 cities to offer the most advanced fiber-based broadband connectivity solutions, says Mukesh Ambani at RIL AGM.

Reliance Jio’s customer base has doubled to 215 million in the one year since the last RIL AGM, says Mukesh Ambani. “215 million customers within 22 months of start is a record that no technology company has been able to achieve anywhere in the world.” he claims.
Mukesh Ambani has started the annual general meeting (AGM) of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) by putting out the achievements of the company’s consumer business. “As our golden decade rolls on, our consumer businesses will contribute nearly as much to the overall earnings of your company as our energy and petrochemical businesses,” says Ambani at the RIL AGM."
678,2018-07-05,Reliance,"Ahead of the RIL AGM later today, a look at Reliance Industries' annual report for 2017-18 and what it says about the company's financials and consumer business led by Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail

A day before its 41st annual general meeting (AGM), Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL’s) shares appreciated 2%, well above the rise in the Sensex. At the RIL AGM, investors will stay closely tuned for announcements on its telecom business (Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd), if any. Timelines/statements pertaining to the FTTH (fibre to the home) and enterprise launch will be crucial to watch out for.

At the RIL AGM, investors will stay closely tuned for announcements on its telecom business (Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd), if any. Timelines/statements pertaining to the FTTH (fibre to the home) and enterprise launch will be crucial to watch out for.
Here are some key elements from RIL annual report 2017-18:
(1) Taking stock of debt
RIL’s consolidated reported net debt increased 18% to  ₹  1.41 trillion. But net debt-to-equity rose marginally to 0.48 times from 0.45 times last year. However, net liabilities are much higher after taking into account a few other items—primarily creditors for capex (about  ₹  76,000 crore) and deferred spectrum liability ( ₹  26,500 crore). Accordingly, net liabilities have risen to  ₹  2.49 trillion, reckon Somshankar Sinha, Piyush Nahar and Pratik Chaudhuri of Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd. The chart above has the details. Net liabilities may not fall as quickly as the Street expects, therefore denting its deleveraging thesis, pointed out Jefferies’ analysts in a report on 3 July.
(2) What about the cash?
The company’s net cash flow from operating activities increased 44% year-on-year to  ₹  71,459 crore. However, that was not enough to cover capex, which came in 31% lower than last year at  ₹  79,250 crore. Out of that, Reliance Jio’s capex stood at around  ₹  49,000 crore. Jefferies estimates RIL’s negative free cash flow to have come down to  ₹  19,800 crore in FY18 from  ₹  54,700 crore from FY17.
Over the last few years, RIL has been on a capex spree with expansion in the downstream oil businesses (refining and petrochemicals) and the launch of its telecom venture. Analysts, of course, hope the company’s capex requirements taper down as we go ahead. Investors would do well to watch how the capex trajectory pans out. Declining capex would support an improvement in its free cash flow.
(3) Profitability
RIL’s consolidated operating profit increased by 39% for FY18 over the same period last year to  ₹  64,176 crore. That’s commendable given its gargantuan size. Performance was helped by increased contribution from the consumer businesses (Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail) on a year-on-year basis. The company’s traditional petrochemicals and refining businesses too performed well on the back of expanded capacities, high operating rates and better cost competitiveness. Overall, reported profit after tax for FY18 increased 21% to  ₹  36,080 crore with high depreciation and interest expenses. Interest capitalized stood at  ₹  10,000 crore.
Further, consolidated return on average capital employed (RoACE), adjusted for capital work-in-progress and investments, fell to 12% from 13.1% in FY17, point out analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities. This is despite further improvement in stand-alone RoACE to 21% reflecting weaker contribution from subsidiaries, they add.

4) Consumer businesses to grab a larger bite of the pie in future
RIL defined its big ambitions for the consumer businesses—Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail. On the Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) front, “our aim is to have the consumer businesses contribute on par with the energy and materials business over the next decade, when we celebrate our Golden Jubilee,"" pointed out the company’s annual report.
5) What of the stock?
Investors have had a good run, led by optimism on the telecom business. Since the beginning of 2017, the RIL stock has risen a huge 83%, sharply outperforming the Sensex, which went up 34% during this time. Currently, the stock trades at about 14.3 times estimated earnings for FY19, suggesting most of the good news is baked into the price. From here onwards, Jio announcements and financial performance, decline in overall capex intensity, and better refining margin environment would keep sentiments favourable for the stock."

Reliance Jio plans
Mukesh Ambani outlined a target of garnering 100 million Jio Phone users in the “shortest possible time"". One of the biggest drawbacks of the Jio Phone so far was its inability to access popular apps like WhatsApp, Facebook and YouTube. But now with added capabilities and functionalities for JioPhone, all this will be possible in the internet-enabled feature phone that offers 4G connectivity.
According to Mukesh Ambani, 500 million Indians still use feature phones without internet capabilities. “The doors of digital life are closed to them because of the problem of affordability,"" Ambani said pointing out that this had been the driving force behind last year’s launch of Jio Phone at a fully-refundable deposit of  ₹ 1,500, that made it effectively free. The company already has 25 million Jio Phone users. 
“With the added functionalities, our wider network reach across India and strong retail presence across India, the goal that I have now set for our Jio team is to enable 100 million users on this Jio Phone platform in the shortest possible time,"" he said. 
The telecom venture of Reliance Industries whose aggressive tariff positioning in the market is backed by  ₹ 2,50,000 crore investments in digital infrastructure, has amassed over 215 million mobile subscribers within 22 months of launch. “Even after serving the needs of our 215 plus million customers, the capacity utilisation of the Jio network is less than 20 per cent, which means, we can multiply our customer base without additional investment,"" he said. 
Ambani said Jio is on track to achieving the target of 99% population coverage with 4G-LTE, an expansion that would ensure its presence in every district, taluk, gram panchayat and village of India."

My Dear Shareowners,
A very warm good morning to each and every one of you. It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the 41st Annual General Meeting of Reliance Industries Limited. This is the first AGM as Reliance begins its Golden Decade.
The Company’s accounts for the year ended March 31, 2018, along with the Directors’ and Auditors’ report, a Letter to the Shareholders, and Management’s Discussion and Analysis, have already been circulated to you.
With your permission, I would like to take them as read.
Business and Financial Performance
Dear Shareowners,
This year has been yet another transformational year for Reliance.
On one hand, our new-age consumer businesses have started delivering profits.
On the other, our hydrocarbon business (refining and petrochemicals) has further scaled up its capabilities to become more profitable, integrated and predictable in its earnings profile. Together, our hydrocarbon and consumer businesses have helped create more records and scale greater heights than ever before.
I am delighted to report yet another record breaking performance by your company. Our net profits grew by more than 20.6% to  ₹ 36,075 crore. Reliance’s earnings profile underwent a fundamental change this year.
The company’s consumer businesses – Jio and Retail – represented about 13% of the consolidated EBIDTA, up from a mere 2% last year. This increase is especially remarkable because it is taking place at a time when the hydrocarbon businesses are growing rapidly.
I can tell you with confidence that Reliance has reached an inflection point. As the Golden Decade rolls on, our consumer businesses will contribute nearly as much to the overall earnings of the company as our energy and petrochemical businesses.
Reliance continues to be India’s largest exporter accounting for 8.9 % of India’s total merchandise exports with a value of  ₹ 176,117 crore with access to markets in 113 countries. Your company paid  ₹ 26,312 crore of customs and excise duty – 6.4 % of India’s total collections during the year –highest in the Indian private sector.
We also paid  ₹  42,553 crore of GST, which is another record. Reliance is also the highest Income tax payer in the private sector in India, paying  ₹ 9,844 crore during the year.
Reliance Jio – Our Digital Services Initiative
Dear Friends,
I want to start with Reliance Jio – OUR DIGITAL SERVICES INITIATIVE. Since I last spoke, we have doubled our customer base to over 215 million now. 215 million customers within 22 months of start is a record that no technology company has been able to achieve anywhere in the world.
In the last one year, we have achieved UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH starting with an already existing large base:
Data usage has grown from 125 crore GBs per month to more than 240 crore GBs per month.
We were the world’s largest mobile data network last year and the gap from the others has only widened in the last 12 months.
Voice usage on the network has grown from 250 crore minutes per day to more than 530 crore minutes per day. The amount of video consumption has grown from 165 crore hours per month to more than 340 crore hours per month.
Doubling of these metrics at such scale is truly unparalleled. Our customers are actively engaged with us for more than 290 minutes per day on an average.
Friends,
Jio’s motto is simple: We are determined to connect everyone and everything, everywhere – always at the highest quality and the most affordable price.
Like our customer metrics, our NETWORK also CONTINUES to expand rapidly. In terms of COVERAGE…Our network has a wider coverage than any other network in India. We are on track towards achieving our target of 99% population coverage with 4G-LTE.
This means that Jio will be present in every district, taluk, gram panchayat and village of India.
When it comes to CAPACITY…Over the past 12 months, we have more than doubled our NETWORK CAPACITY.
Even after serving the needs of our 215+ MILLION customers, the capacity utilization of the Jio network is LESS THAN 20%. Which means, we can multiply our customer base without additional investment. We have achieved this unprecedented network growth while maintaining our NUMBER ONE position as the
FASTEST network in India… as attested by the TRAI speed-test data for each and every month of the past year. We recognize that just around 1% of our customers are yet to enjoy the best user experience some of the time. But we are working tirelessly to satisfy and delight them as well.
Jio is a customer obsessed organization and will work harder to ensure that not even one consumer remains dissatisfied on our network. Let me now update you about the JIOPHONE. JioPhone has taken the country by storm.
I am pleased to announce that we have more than 25 MILLION JIOPHONE USERS in India. We are now taking the JioPhone to the next level, with added capabilities and functionalities.
Friends,
WHAT COMES NEXT FOR BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY IN INDIA?
While India has pole-vaulted into global leadership in the mobile broadband space… we still lag behind
SIGNIFICANTLY in fixed-line broadband.
India is ranked quite low at 134th in the global ranking for fixed broadband,
Poor fixed-line infrastructure has been a key reason for this.
In countries with better developed communication infrastructure, more than 80% of data consumption happens
INDOORS THROUGH FIXED-LINE CONNECTIVITY in homes, in offices and other premises. Optical Fiber based fixed-line broadband is the future. Fixed-line broadband offers HUNDREDS OF MEGABITS, even GIGABITS per second of data speeds.
Jio is determined to move India to among the top 5 in fixed-line broadband, too.
Your company has already invested over  ₹ 250,000 crore for creating state-of-the-art digital infrastructure to provide mobile and broadband connectivity across the country, with the largest fiber footprint.
We will now extend this fiber connectivity to homes, merchants, small and medium enterprises and large enterprises simultaneously across 1,100 cities to offer the most advanced fiber-based broadband connectivity solutions.
FOR THE HOME, this will mean…
ULTRA HIGH DEFINITION entertainment on your large screen TVs…
MULTI-PARTY VIDEO CONFERENCING from the comfort of your living room…
VOICE-ACTIVATED VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS who obey your every command…
VIRTUAL REALITY GAMING and DIGITAL SHOPPING where you are magically transported into a digital universe of IMMERSIVE EXPERIENCES…
SMART-HOME SOLUTIONS… where hundreds of devices like security cameras, home appliances… even lights and switches… can be securely controlled by their owners using a smartphone… from both inside and outside the home. This will redefine 24X7 emergency help for all homes.
FOR MERCHANTS and SMALL BUSINESSES, fixed-line broadband means…
When you combine fixed-line connectivity and cloud applications with the agility and customer obsession of a small owner-driven business you empower them to compete on level terms with larger businesses.
Jio is thus performing a task of VITAL NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.
Because the success of Indian small businesses and small merchants translates directly into faster and more sustainable growth with large-scale employment for the Indian economy.
Likewise, FOR LARGE ENTERPRISES, fixed-line broadband will mean…
Having the ability to compete in the global marketplace using digital tools and techniques that are powering the
FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION…
We are calling this fiber based broadband service JIO GIGAFIBER.
Dear Friends,
The three most popular apps YouTube, WhatsApp and Facebook will be available to all the JioPhone users from 15th August. Jio was born with a purpose. To transform India with the power of the Digital Revolution. For this vision to be realised, every Indian must become a DIGITAL INDIAN. However, as many as 500 million Indians still use feature phones, who cannot use the Internet.
The doors of Digital Life are closed to them because of the problem of affordability. Which is why, last year we offered the JioPhone – India Ka Smartphone – for a fully refundable deposit of  ₹ 1500. In other words, for an effective price of zero.
325 million Indians have availed this scheme and become JioPhone users.
This scheme will, of course, continue. Today we are introducing another attractive offer to feature phone users. It is the JIOPHONE “MONSOON HUNGAMA"" offer.
Starting July 21st... they can exchange their existing feature phone for a brand new JIOPHONE for just  ₹ 501! We have thus reduced the effective entry cost of the JioPhone from  ₹ 1500 to as low as  ₹ 501.
Starting 15th August, our JioPhone2 will be available at an introductory price of only  ₹ 2999. Our purpose is to accelerate the Digital Revolution in India with the extreme affordability of a JioPhone, so that each and every Indian can access the internet and enjoy the Digital Life.
Further details about both these offers will soon be made available on jio.com. With the added functionalities, our wider network reach across India and strong retail presence across India, the goal that I have now set for our Jio team is to enable 100 MILLION users on this JIOPHONE platform in the shortest possible time.
Friends,
JioGigaFiber creates magical experiences that are going to be available to every Indian consumer. SO… WHEN WILL JIOGIGAFIBER BE AVAILABLE? We are currently running beta trials in tens of thousands of homes.
Starting this Independence Day, August 15th you can start registering your interest for JioGigaFiber through both MyJio and Jio.com.
We will prioritize our JioGigaFiber rollout to those localities from where we receive the highest number of registrations. JIOGIGAFIBER will be the largest greenfield fixed-line broadband rollout anywhere in the world, with rollout happening in 1,100 cities of India simultaneously.
So, this 15th of August, Jio welcomes you to celebrate the day of India’s Freedom by signing in for every Indian’s Digital Freedom.

I am happy to inform you that your company has prepared itself for this exciting future of non-linear and exponential growth. 43. Reliance Retail
Dear Shareowners,
Reliance Retail has been one of the catalysts for the growth of modern organised retail in India.
It is the LARGEST, FASTEST GROWING AND MOST PROFITABLE retail company in India.
Our 7,500 stores received over 350 million footfalls last year. Our revenues crossed  ₹ 69,000 crore, a growth of over 100% year on year.
More than 4,000 new stores were opened during the year, an unprecedented expansion in the retail industry. We now operate over 7,500 stores across more than 4,400 cities.
Reliance Digital is the LARGEST RETAILER OF CONSUMER ELECTRONICS in the country. Reliance Trends continues to be the LARGEST FASHION RETAILER in India…. It sells nearly 1.2 crore garments a month or over 33,000 garments every hour.
In Grocery, we are the LARGEST MODERN TRADE RETAILER. We sold over 500,000 tonnes of groceries last year, connecting thousands of farmers and small manufacturers to happy customers.
Over the years Reliance Market has been creating value for small merchants by bringing both buying and operational efficiency to their businesses.
The existing ecosystem of 3 million plus partners will be enabled further with our digital merchant platform. Reliance Retail has emerged as the partner of choice for International brands. It operates the largest portfolio of 41 international retail brands in India.
Our network of over 1,300 fully automated and future ready petroleum outlets on key highways cater to major demand centres and witnessed robust revenue growth.
Based on our growth initiatives and commitment to our customers, I am confident that Reliance Retail will become bigger, better and more profitable.
Friends,
As Reliance transitions to become a TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM COMPANY, we see our biggest growth opportunity in creating a hybrid, online-to-offline NEW COMMERCE PLATFORM.
We shall create this by integrating and synergising the power of Reliance Retail’s physical marketplace with the fabulous strengths of Jio’s digital infrastructure and services.
This platform will bring together …The 35 crore and growing customer footfalls at Reliance Retail stores... The 21.5 crore and growing JIO connectivity customers. The targeted 5 crore Jio GIGA-HOMES; and…
…Most importantly, All the 3 crore small merchants and shop-keepers all over India who provide the last-mile physical market connectivity.
Hence, we will integrate the physical and digital marketplaces in a uniquely collaborative BHARAT-INDIA JODO enterprise.
We see merchants and small shop owners as critical customer interaction and fulfilment points, who will share a mutually beneficial win-win relationship with us.
 Through the deployment of Merchant Point of Sale for small shop owners, we will enable them to do everything that large enterprises and large ecommerce players are able to do.
They will be able to manage inventory, keep digital records and file returns, improve working capital management, retain and upgrade customers, access new customers, run promotion and loyalty programs, link to our highly efficient supply chain, and much more.
Our NEW COMMERCE PLATFORM will redefine retail in India by enabling all customers ─ rich or poor, whether at home or on mobile ─ to transition from simple shopping to personalised Immersive shopping experience.
This will be made possible by Augmented Reality, holographic technology and VR devices. Our digital tools will predict and anticipate the needs of shoppers.
JioGigaFiber will bring the entire marketplace to large screens powered by high speed broadband at home. We will also leverage Reliance Retail’s deep insights into Indian customers, large local presence, and best-in-class supply chain.
We will invest in the best data analytics engines using artificial intelligence to bring a powerful offering to all consumers, merchants and small businesses.
We will also facilitate availability of financing to small shopkeepers and merchants to improve their capital efficiency, so that they can become competitive and grow their businesses.
Thus, the principal purpose of our hybrid NEW COMMERCE PLATFORM is to promote Shared Prosperity.
This will enable even the smallest merchant to earn more, employ more people, and give common Indian customers the best value for their money.
Media and Entertainment
Let me turn to our media and entertainment platform. We have already created a large portfolio of media and digital properties, which are as widespread as theyare valuable.We have the largest portfolio of TV Channels in India - 69 Channels across News and Entertainment.
We have India’s largest TV News Platform in News18 that is multilingual providing independent and reliable news. We also have India’s largest entertainment platform which spans all major regional languages. We are consistently ranked amongst the top players in each of our segments.
We are the partner of choice for leading global brands like CNBC, CNN, Forbes, History, MTV and Nickelodeon. Our digital properties MyJio, JioTV, JioCinema, JioMusic, BookMyShow, FirstPost and MoneyControl are all leaders in their category with significant embedded value.
We have a leading market share in television broadcasting, movie production and distribution, digital content and commerce, print magazines, mobile content and allied media services businesses,
One in every two Indians consume Network18’s content. One in every five internet users in India is on Network18 websites or apps. Regional content and digital delivery continue to be the focus of Network18, which will drive its future growth.
The media and entertainment platform with a viewership in excess of 700 million enables us to achieve a very special societal purpose:
Our purpose is two-fold: to provide wholesome entertainment and to enrich the power of Ideas that can make India a great nation.
Other Platform Opportunities
Dear Friends,
Let me illustrate the power of our PLATFORM BUSINESS STRATEGY by highlighting three other large opportunities.
Agriculture
First, and most important, the AGRICULTURE PLATFORM. In agriculture, India has an unprecedented opportunity to create wealth and new knowledge-rich livelihood opportunities in rural areas.…by encouraging adoption of technologies for water conservation, soil management, precision farming,waste reduction.…to enhance agricultural productivity.
Our purpose is to benefit both the kisan and the consumer.…to more than double the incomes of our farmers.…and to bring nutritious food products to consumers at affordable prices.
I am sure that if we combine digital technology tools with the innate knowledge and wisdom of Indian farmers, Jio can usher in a SMART NEW GREEN REVOLUTION in India.
Education
Second, the EDUCATION PLATFORM. The purpose of this platform is to overcome the challenge of poor and inadequate educational infrastructure by digitally delivering high-quality education and skills training to schools, colleges and universities across the country.
This will enable every educated Indian youth to earn a respectable livelihood and contribute to the nation’s wealth.We have to equip our children to be digitally-savvy right from school. So that we can lay the foundation for a sustained leadership in the digital age for India. Through Jio, we are providing broadband connectivity to all the 58,000 colleges and will connect 1.9 million schools across the country.
These educational institutions collectively provide education to nearly 200 million children. And all these can be done in less than two years.Jio will achieve this by partnering with a large number of stakeholders.
Once this is done, India will have one of the most-digitally enabled education systems in the world.
Healthcare
Third, the HEALTHCARE PLATFORM.
Here our purpose is to ensure affordable and quality healthcare to all, which is both a national necessity and a national responsibility.
For the first time in history, this has become possible because of digital technologies – accessible across the country and even in remote locations.
India can considerably overcome the deficit of physical infrastructure of hospitals and doctors by universalising telemedicine, tele-radiology, eDiagnostics, genomics and other cost-effective cloud-based solutions.
This cannot happen overnight.
 It is a long-term gestation opportunity, and we will pursue this with a host of partners to realise this for India to become a global leader in healthcare.
To summarise, our DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY PLATFORM has served as the foundation on which we are building our NEW COMMERCE PLATFORM, OUR MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT PLATFORM, EDUCATION PLATFORM, HEALTHCARE PLATFORM and AGRICULTURE PLATFORM.
Going forward, we shall build more such platforms. Each of these will create significant shareholder value and enormous societal value.
Hydrocarbons Business
Dear Friends,
Let me now turn to the performance of our hydrocarbons business of petrochemicals and refining. This year Jamnagar completes 20 years of operations. Jamnagar has expanded manifold in scale, complexity, scope and size since we commissioned the world’s largest greenfield refinery in 1998.
Let me update you on the progress of the projects, as we are now nearing the end of our largest-ever investment at Jamnagar. We have successfully commissioned and stabilized the world’s largest Paraxylene complex.
Today, Reliance is the second largest PX producer in the world and Jamnagar has the distinction of being the largest manufacturing facility of PX in the world with 4.2 million MT of capacity.
We also commissioned the largest off-Gas cracker complex in the world. Using our Refinery off-gasses as feedstock, this cracker is the most cost competitive ethylene cracker, globally. This positions us uniquely, as one of the most efficient producers of Polymers in the world. I am proud to report that both these projects have been completed in a record time frame, at world-beating capital productivity and commissioned flawlessly. Both the Paraxylene and Cracker complexes are already running substantially higher than their design capacity.
The Butyl rubber project will be commissioned later this year.We are also adding a new line of materials to our portfolio– composites and carbon fibre. These high-value materials will cater to the growing needs of India’s transportation and alternate energy sectors.
All these projects position your company amongst the leading and most-diversified and integrated producer of materials globally. In Petrochemicals, we continued to generate value for our customers through constant innovation and product development.
As an example, we launched R-Elan, a super micro-denier polyester with unique anti-sweat and anti-bacterial properties for use in active wear.
Similarly, our RecoSilk and SuperFeel products have emerged as products of choice in ladies fashion wear.
Environmental regulation is now a global imperative.
I am happy to state that your company is the largest recycler of PET in India recycling over 2 billion bottles annually. We are committed to becoming a leader in the emerging circular economy and to become one of the largest recyclers of plastics in India,
All these initiatives will enhance our capabilities and competencies, making us future-ready, as we transition from a cyclical business to annuity business.
Dear Shareowners,
 Let me now turn to Refining business.
This year we commissioned the world’s largest and most unique Petcoke gasification project. I am pleased to share that the DTA Gasification complex startup and stabilization was accomplished in a record time of less than 120 days against a typical 9 to 12 months period required for a project of this magnitude and complexity byglobal peers.
The gasification project will eliminate the dependence of the refinery on imported natural gas and add value to our profitability, particularly in a high oil price scenario. Our strategy of a full “Bottom of the Barrel conversion"" is truly unique.
A key element of our configuration driven competitiveness is the integration of Refining with Petrochemicals. As a result of our robust and flexible configuration we are also uniquely positioned to take advantage of emerging opportunities in view of IMO 2020.
The forthcoming changes in sulphur specifications of bunker fuel will lead to a significant jump in demand for low sulphur distillates.
Equally it will benefit versatile and complex refiners like us with a capability to process challenged heavy crudes.
Dear Friends,
We began our “Oil to Chemicals"" journey starting with the inception of the Jamnagar complex in 1996-1999 when Reliance challenged the industry paradigm and set a new benchmark by maximizing Propylene and Aromatics.
We took a further quantum jump with the commissioning of the world’s largest Refinery off gas cracker and the Paraxylene complex. These set of new projects have redefined Oil to Chemicals integration.
It is our belief that with the rapidly increasing demand for Petrochemicals maximizing Oil to Chemicals conversion will play a catalytic role in determining profitability of hydrocarbons businesses of the future.
As the world migrates from fossil fuels to renewable energy, we will further maximize this Oil to Chemicals conversion and upgrade all of our fuels to high value petrochemicals. This up-gradation will be implemented in a phased manner over the next decade to meet the rapidly increasing demand for petrochemicals, in India and the region. The hydrocarbon business is thus poised for robust value creation and exciting times ahead.
 Oil and Gas Exploration and Production
Dear Shareowners,
Your company, along with its joint venture partner BP, continues to optimize its India upstream business by pursuing integrated development in KG D6 Block. In these gas field developments, we will deploy many advanced technologies to start gas production in 2020 and reaching full production of 30-35 MMSCMD by 2022.
Our Gas marketing JV with BP is looking for opportunities to source and distribute gas to Indian consumers including in cities. Our Coal-Bed Methane production crossed 1 MMSCMD level last year.
We have started the second phase of CBM development to more than double the current production.Your company is proposing a cross-border merger of RHUSA with RIL thereby integrating the US gas resources with
Indian market as we have done with ethane for Petro-chemicals. I am confident that our participation in the gas economy of India will generate value in the coming years.
 Reliance Foundation
Dear Shareholders,
I would now like to share the good work being done by our Foundation.
Let us congratulate Nita for her leadership of the Foundation and her relentless efforts in driving grassroots sports and education in the country.
Our diverse sports initiatives provide a world class platform to young sportspersons. In recognition of her accomplishments in the field of sports, Nita was awarded the Rashtriya Khel Protsahan Puraskar by the Honourable President of India.
Reliance Foundation’s rural transformation initiatives are focused on establishing strong market linkages for farmers and leveraging technology for better reach and impact.
The initiatives now reach out to over 13,500 villages in 15 states across the country. We are now focused on increasing our reach and expanding the scope of our Foundation to deliver impact to larger sections of India through a combination of partnership and direct action.
I hope to share several success stories with all of you in the future as Reliance Foundation continues to make a difference as the largest corporate Foundation in India.
 Value Creation Roadmap
Dear Shareholders,
Last year I had shared with you my vision for value creation in Reliance’s Golden Decade. We are laying a robust foundation to realise this vision. We have already made a lot of progress in the past year.
Reliance is making a strategic transition to become a Technology Platform Company. We are focussed on creating multiple platforms that will accelerate our growth and create significant societal value for years to come.
Our connectivity platform has already made Jio the largest mobile data network in the world. Through JioGigaFibre we will now build the home-and-office connectivity platform.
A platform that potentially connects 50 million homes. It will be as big as the mobile connectivity platform.
Moreover, it will have a much higher value proposition because the core investments have been made while building the mobility network.
The third big platform that we are building is New Commerce. This platform has the potential to redefine retailing in India and become one of the biggest new growth engines for Reliance in the years to come.
We are also looking at nation-wide platforms in Agriculture, Education and Healthcare. I am confident that our growth in these consumer businesses, based on asset-light platforms of the future, will be nonlinear and exponential.
In our hydrocarbon businesses, the largest ever cycle of investment in our world-scale complex projects is nearly complete. This will yield healthy profits for many years to come. The value-chain integration allows us to create an annuity-like cash flow with lower risk of cyclical markets.
Reliance was among the first companies globally that adopted an ‘Oil to Chemicals’ strategy and manage it as one integrated business.
We have a full plan to further increase the level of integration by adding new chemical chains and capacity to produce new materials and composites of high value. This will minimise the impact of renewables and electricity on transportation fuels.
We have the unique advantage, among global players, of being able to pursue this strategy with physical integration at one large site.
I am confident that our current business model and planned investments make our hydrocarbon portfolio future-proof with sustained earnings growth.
We are committed to strengthening our balance sheet while we pursue growth and realise multiple monetisations.
As the earnings from our consumer businesses begin to match those from our hydrocarbon businesses, I assure you that the next decade will truly become a Golden Decade for Reliance.
Conclusion
Friends,
Reliance has always been a responsible Corporate Citizen. We know fully that our responsibilities have grown with our opportunities. We shall discharge them with utmost commitment.
Employment generation for all our youth has become an urgent national imperative. In addition to employing as many as 200,000 people in the last two years alone, Jio and Retail have created indirect livelihood opportunities for 1 million people across India.
In all our digital service businesses, data privacy is sacrosanct. Cyber-security is our solemn promise.
Our energy and petrochemical businesses follow the philosophy of not only the Green Economy but also the Circular Economy.
Because we care for the Environment, which is the most precious asset of mankind.
Lastly, ensuring the safety, satisfaction and happiness of our employees is our Dharma, because, for me, all of them are members of the extended Reliance Family.
Before I conclude, permit me once again to share with you ─ and with all my dear countrymen ─ a dream I have inherited from my father.
It is the dream to see India become an economic superpower. And to see that India becomes a global leader in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
India’s prosperity and Reliance’s progress have been closely intertwined in every phase of our journey so far. Which is why, Reliance has become a shining icon of Modern India.
As India starts on its high growth journey to double the size of its economy by 2025, I assure you that the size of Reliance will more than double in the same period. And the creation of societal value by Reliance will be of an even higher order.
Old-timers amongst you will recall that whenever our Founder Dhirubhai Ambani spoke of India, there was a surge of patriotic passion in the audience.
He always urged us to ‘Think big, think fast, think ahead…and, above all, THINK OF WHAT WE CAN DO TO
BRIGHTEN INDIA’S FUTURE.’ That passion will never subside.
As we kick off our Golden Decade with a flourish, we remind ourselves of Reliance’s unwavering commitment towards India’s Rise. May the God Almighty bless us in our endeavour.
 Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the Central and State Governments, shareholders, investors, suppliers and customers for their consistent and resolute support. I thank all my colleagues on the Board for their unanimous support and immense encouragement.
I have special words to acknowledge the collective efforts of the entire Reliance team, working tirelessly for creating and sustaining a world-class enterprise.
Thank you.

673,2018-07-06,Reliance,"Mukesh Ambani seeks to reduce reliance on energy sector, focus on consumer business

Mumbai: Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, said on Thursday that Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) aims to double sales in about seven years, even as the company explores ways to boost profitability of its mainstay refinery and chemicals businesses. 
Mumbai: Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, said on Thursday that Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) aims to double sales in about seven years, even as the company explores ways to boost profitability of its mainstay refinery and chemicals businesses.
Ambani, however, does not plan to rely solely on refinery and petrochemicals, and is placing outsized bets on new consumer businesses to drive growth. RIL has invested about  ₹ 2.5 trillion in telecom unit Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, through which Ambani wants to venture into e-commerce, healthcare, education and agriculture in the next two years.
“As India starts on its high-growth journey to double the size of its economy by 2025, I assure you that the size of Reliance will more than double in the same period,"" Ambani told shareholders at the company’s 41st annual general meeting (AGM) in Mumbai.
“Our consumer businesses will contribute nearly as much to the overall earnings of the company as our energy and petrochemical businesses,"" he added.
RIL currently derives 80% of its sales from refining and petrochemicals. This however, is undergoing a change as the company focuses on consumer-facing businesses. RIL saw operating profit from its consumer businesses rise to 13% of the total in the year ended 31 March from 2% in the previous year. RIL’s consolidated revenue from operations was at  ₹ 4.08 trillion last fiscal and net profit at  ₹ 36,080 crore.
On the consumer side, Ambani’s immediate bet is on optical fibre-based fixed-line broadband which, he claimed, offers hundreds of megabits per second of data speeds and will allow RIL to offer smart home solutions.
“The big story for Reliance Jio from here on is going to be fibre connectivity,"" said Mayuresh Joshi, a fund manager at Angel Broking Ltd. 
In the coming months, Jio will extend fibre connectivity to homes, small businesses, traders and small businesses. Leveraging on its advanced fibre bandwidth network, Jio will be offering this service in over 1,100 cities and towns across India.
For homes, this could mean ultra HD entertainment, multi-party video conferencing, digital shopping, security cameras, home appliances, voice-activated virtual assistants, lights and switches. 
Over the past 40 years, RIL has periodically transformed its core business through backward integration. First it was textiles, then it was polyester, followed by chemicals and then refining. In the past few years, a major lateral shift has happened, with the focus on telecom, data, broadband and retail.
Now, the energy business is under threat due to a shift from fossil fuels to renewables, and Ambani acknowledges that. 
“It is our belief that the rapidly increasing demand for petrochemicals maximizing oil-to-chemicals conversion will play a catalytic role in determining profitability of hydrocarbons businesses of the future,"" Ambani said.
“As the world migrates from fossil fuels to renewable energy, we will further maximize this oil-to-chemicals conversion and upgrade all our fuels to high-value petrochemicals,"" he said, adding this upgradation will happen in a phased manner over the next decade. 
Still, there are some concerns about the company’s growing debt (about  ₹ 1.41 trillion) on account of Jio. 
“Generating reasonable returns (say a 10% post-tax return on capital employed) off a balance sheet of R-Jio’s size (current levels) needs the company to generate an Ebitda (we compute it to be $8 billion) that is higher than the peak historical annual Ebitda ever generated by the aggregate Indian telecom industry, including the home broadband and enterprise data players, per our math,"" said Rohit Chordia & Aniket Sethi, analysts at Kotak Institutional Securities, in a 5 July note."
672,2018-07-06,Reliance,"Reliance Industries will integrate Reliance Retail's physical marketplace with Reliance Jio'sdigital infrastructure for an e-commerce platform, says Mukesh Ambani at RIL AGM

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL’s) telecom unit will serve as the foundation on which the company’s new commerce platform consisting of businesses, including media and entertainment, education, agriculture, healthcare, will be built, chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said on Thursday. 
Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL’s) telecom unit will serve as the foundation on which the company’s new commerce platform consisting of businesses, including media and entertainment, education, agriculture, healthcare, will be built, chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said on Thursday.
Speaking to shareholders at RIL’s 41st annual meeting (AGM), Ambani said that the company will also create a hybrid online-to-offline commerce platform by integrating and synergizing Reliance Retail’s physical marketplace with telecom unit Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s digital infrastructure and services.
That is in line with his stated aim of generating half of the group’s revenue from the consumer businesses over the next 10 years. Currently, 80% of the group’s sales come from its traditional oil and gas business.
Mint reported on 14 June about RIL’s plans to enter the e-commerce business by combining its online and offline shopping features.
“With Jio, we have built a digital connectivity platform of unparalleled capacity and a nation-wide reach,"" Ambani told RIL shareholders on Thursday adding “This has enabled Reliance to strategically reinvent itself as a Technology Platform Company.""
Reliance Jio has doubled its customer base to 215 million in the past year. 
Ambani put rival telecom players on notice, when he announced that RJio’s much awaited FTTH (fiber to the home) broadband services—Jio GigaFiber—will be rolled out in 1,100 cities simultaneously.
The registration for Jio GigaFiber will begin from 15 August and will come with a set top box for TV with voice enabled command feature. Besides, it will have a TV calling feature.
Ambani also said that JioGigaFiber will bring entire market place to large screens powered by high-speed broadband at home.
The technology platform company, which RIL aspires to be in the coming years, will bring together 350 million customers from Reliance Retail stores with 215 million Jio users, and will target 50 million Jio Giga Homes, Ambani added.
Jio Giga Homes planned by RIL will use technology and FTTH to make homes smart for its customers. This would include ultra-high definition entertainment through FTTH, multi-party video conferencing, voice activated virtual assistant, virtual reality gaming, digital shopping and smart home solutions.
The AGM also saw Mukesh Ambani’s children Akash and Isha Ambani launching the company’s flagship JioPhone 2, with more advanced features than its predecessor, including speakers and inbuilt applications like Facebook, YouTube and WhatsApp.
Jio Phone 2, which will be available for  ₹  2,999, will be available for purchase from 15 August. 
“The goal that I have now set for my Jio team is to enable 100 million users on Jiophone platform in the shortest possible time,"" Ambani added.
RJio is already the third largest telecom operator in the country in terms of revenue, with 20% revenue market share.
“Even after serving the needs of over 215 million customers, the capacity utilization of the Jio network is less than 20%,"" Ambani said. 
“Which means, we can multiply more customer base without additional investment."""
671,2018-07-06,Reliance,"Reliance industries' (RIL) investors have been pricing in the opportunity from digital services for some time now

Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL’s) 41st annual general meeting (AGM) on Thursday was a disappointment as far as its investors were concerned. The company’s shares fell 2.6% at the end of the day’s trading session, far more than the 0.2% drop in the Nifty 50 index. In contrast, the RIL stock had risen 3.6% soon after last year’s AGM, when the company announced the launch of the Reliance Jio Phone. 
Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL’s) 41st annual general meeting (AGM) on Thursday was a disappointment as far as its investors were concerned. The company’s shares fell 2.6% at the end of the day’s trading session, far more than the 0.2% drop in the Nifty 50 index. In contrast, the RIL stock had risen 3.6% soon after last year’s AGM, when the company announced the launch of the Reliance Jio Phone.
Yet, RIL’s announcements this year appear to be more wide-ranging. For instance, the company’s chairman Mukesh Ambani said, “Reliance is making a strategic transition to become a technology platform company."" Apart from the mobile connectivity platform, which already has 215 million customers, the company is targeting 50 million home broadband users with JioGigaFiber. Currently, there are only 18 million home broadband connections in the country. RIL’s entry in this segment is expected to be far more disruptive than the feature phone segment it targeted last year with the Reliance Jio Phone.
Then, it is building an e-commerce platform, on the back of the large existing offline retail base. “We are also looking at nationwide platforms in agriculture, education and healthcare. I am confident that our growth in these consumer businesses, based on asset-light platforms of the future, will be non-linear and exponential,"" Ambani said at the RIL AGM.
For some reason, investors seemed unmoved. Does this mean they can’t see the big picture? Not quite.
The truth is investors have been pricing in the opportunity from digital services for some time now. Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients that RIL’s current share price implies an enterprise valuation of $50 billion for its telecom business. Bharti Airtel Ltd, with a much larger mobile subscriber base, has an enterprise value of roughly $22 billion for its India wireless business, estimate analysts.
Evidently, investors already have high expectations from RIL’s digital endeavours. As pointed out earlier in the column, investors dream of the day customers will talk, shop, bank, read, write, eat, watch digital content and book a holiday using one Reliance digital service or the other. They point to online services firm Tencent, which offers a multitude of services to its customers in China. But platform firms such as Tencent aren’t telecom companies. One of the reasons for their popularity is that they can be used across different networks. As such, it remains to be seen how successful the company can get with its digital services. What’s more, in areas such as e-commerce, companies such as Amazon and Flipkart (now owned by Walmart), have dug their heels deep, and may not cede share in the space easily.
According to an analyst at an institutional brokerage firm, the RIL AGM announcements regarding convergence of offline and online services may well entail more capex, which can drain cash flows more than what was anticipated earlier. This could have dragged the stock down as well, he says.
And finally, investors seemed underwhelmed by the fact that there were no concrete details about the home broadband launch. Last year, for instance, the pricing of the Reliance Jio Phone was announced at the RIL AGM, leading to an expectation that the same would be done for home broadband this time around. But this wasn’t to be.
RIL did say that it is targeting 50 million homes for its new service, which is fairly ambitious, considering that the current industry size is only 18 million. Of course, when Reliance Jio started mobile services, there were only 153 million mobile broadband subscribers, but Reliance Jio alone now has 215 million connections.
“Home broadband is capital intensive and time consuming, where local issues complicate last mile access with customer stickiness also an entry barrier,"" say Jefferies’ analysts.
In this backdrop, Reliance Jio may well resort to another price war to gain scale in this new segment. Again, this may lead to higher spends than was earlier anticipated, which may have added to some investors’ concerns."

The company put a resolution to re-appoint Ambani “for a period of five years, on expiry of his present term of office, i e with effect from April 19, 2019"" at the 41st Annual General Meeting (AGM) held on 5 July in Mumbai. As many as 50,818 crore shares out of a total share base of 616.45 crore voted on the resolution, RIL said in a regulatory filing. Of the votes polled, 98.5% were in favour of the resolution while 1.48 voted against it. 
According to the resolution, Ambani will be paid an annual salary of  ₹ 4.17 crore and  ₹ 59 lakh of perquisites and allowances. Retirement benefits are not included in the overall ceiling of remuneration. He will also be entitled to receive bonus based on net profits and “expenses incurred for travelling, boarding and lodging, including for spouse and attendant(s) during business trips and provision of car(s) for use on company’s business and communication expenses at residence shall be reimbursed at actuals and not considered as perquisites,"" it said.
Also, “the expenses, as may be borne by the company for providing security to Mukesh D Ambani and his family members shall not be considered as perquisites and accordingly, not to be included for the purpose of computation of the overall ceiling of remuneration,"" the resolution, which was carried at the AGM, said.
After Dhirubhai Ambani’s demise on 6 July 2012, Mukesh was elected chairman and managing Director of RIL, while younger brother Anil was elected vice chairman and MD. The two siblings parted ways in 2005 and divided the business their father created between them.
At the AGM, shareholders also allowed RIL to raise up to  ₹ 20,000 crore through a non-convertible debenture (NCD) issue in 2018-19, according to the regulatory filing.
RIL wants to “offer or invite subscriptions for secured / unsecured redeemable non-convertible debentures, in one or more series / tranches, of an aggregate nominal value up to  ₹ 20,000 crore, on private placement, from such persons and on such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors of the company may, from time to time, determine and consider proper and most beneficial"". The company did not say where the proceeds will be utilised."

When will Reliance Jio GigaFiber be available
Currently, Reliance Jio is running beta trials of Jio GigaFiber in tens of thousands of homes.
Starting this Independence Day, 15 August, you can start registering your interest for JioGigaFiber through both MyJio app and Jio.com. This data will be used to prioritise the rollout of JioGigaFiber, which aims to be the largest greenfield fixed-line broadband rollout anywhere in the world.
There was no announcement on the price of Jio GigaFiber but it is being speculated in the market that the pricing plans will be disruptive just like what Reliance Jio did to mobile internet rates. Industry body Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) director general Rajan Mathews said he expects Reliance Jio broadband to make some disruption and drive down prices in the market. 
Mukesh Ambani said JioGigaFiber will enable households access ultra high-definition entertainment on large screen TVs, multi-party video conferencing from living room, voice-activated virtual assistants, virtual reality gaming, digital shopping and immersive experiences.
For merchants and small businesses, fixed-line broadband JioGigaFiber will empower small owner-driven business to compete on level terms with larger businesses, Ambani said. For large enterprises, fixed-line broadband will provide them the ability to compete in the global marketplace, using digital tools and techniques that are powering the Fourth Industrial Revolution, he added.
Read highlights of Mukesh Ambani’s speech at RIL AGM here.
Reliance Jio is targeting 5 crore JioGigaFiber home customers and 3 crore small merchants and shop-keepers.
Pointing out that India lags behind significantly in the fixed line broadband market because of poor infrastructure, Ambani said India ranks 134th globally in the segment.
Mukesh Ambani predicted that optical fixed line broadband is the future and is confident that Reliance Jio will take India to the top 5 in fixed line broadband services globally in the coming years.
Will Reliance JioGigaFiber disrupt India’s fixed-line broadband market?
“Looking at the experience of Jio 4G launch and its impact on the telecom sector, the street is extrapolating the impact of today’s launch on cable/broadband companies,"" said Amit Kumar, a Mumbai-based media and consumer goods analyst at Investec Ltd told Bloomberg. “However, there are no details on pricing of TV+broadband and thus, it is difficult to take a call on potential impact.""
Shares of Hathway Cable & Datacom Ltd. fell as much as 18%, Siti Networks Ltd declined by 6.6%, and Den Networks Ltd 15.3%.
With 4G, the difficulty was setting up the nationwide telecom back-end while with broadband services, the front-end—including laying fiber to homes—will require effort, Kumar said. The company has been running trials in the nation’s financial capital Mumbai for the past two to three years, though their services are still not fully available across the city, he said.
“To what extent they will be available in these 1,100 cities, that remains to be seen,"" Kumar said."
669,2018-07-09,Reliance,"Reliance Industries plans to ship aviation turbine fuel from its Jamnagar refinery to the Pirpau Jetty in Trombay, and then use the pipelines of Indian Oil and others to transport the fuel to Mumbai airport

Mumbai: State-owned fuel marketers are pushing back against a regulatory suggestion to allow Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) to use their pipelines to sell jet fuel at the Mumbai airport. 
Mumbai: State-owned fuel marketers are pushing back against a regulatory suggestion to allow Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) to use their pipelines to sell jet fuel at the Mumbai airport.
Currently, the three public sector oil marketing companies — Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd—fuel all aircraft at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport through two pipelines from their refineries. RIL had written to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) in November 2016 to declare these pipelines “common carriers"" which would allow it to access them. On 4 May this year, the board suggested the same in a notice seeking public opinion, but OMCs are not giving up without a fight.
BPCL and HPCL say PNGRB did not consult them, and does not have the authority to impose any direction.
“Though BPCL owns the pipeline, PNGRB has not heard BPCL’s view on the matter. The ATF pipeline is outside the scope and purview of the PNGRB Act and as such, PNGRB does not have the jurisdiction to declare the ATF pipeline as a common carrier,"" said BPCL in its reply.
A common carrier system implies that the capacity in a pipeline over and above the owner’s own requirement can be made available to any other entity if not fully utilized by the owner. This can be done on an annual contract basis.
Officials from HPCL and BPCL said on the condition of anonymity that if need be, they will have to take the legal route on this matter. 
RIL and BPCL did not reply to an email sent. HPCL declined to comment. 
A 2002 government notification says a pipeline less than 300 km is granted right of use treating it as a “captive pipeline"". 
“Therefore, pipelines such as BPCL’s ATF pipeline which is 15 km long (being a pipeline of a length of less than 300 km) is a captive pipeline, a dedicated pipeline and therefore outside the scope and ambit of a common carrier and beyond the jurisdiction of the PNGRB,"" said BPCL in its reply to PNGRB. 
At present, the entire ATF demand of 1.4 mmtpa (million metric tonnes per annum) at the Mumbai airport is met by the three OMCs. Indian Oil, along with BPCL and HPCL, has a joint venture company called Mumbai Aviation Fuel Farm Facility Pvt. Ltd for the ATF supply. Airlines at the Mumbai airport consume more than a fifth of the India’s total jet fuel requirement.
RIL plans to ship ATF from its Jamnagar refinery to the Pirpau Jetty in Trombay, and then use the pipelines to transport the fuel to the airport.
RIL in its 2016 letter to PNGRB had said that in the absence of competition, airlines are not able to enjoy the benefit of competitive prices. 
“The three oil marketing companies are enjoying a monopoly to the exclusion of all other ATF marketing companies (OMCs) in the supply of ATF at the Mumbai airport. This resulted in entry barrier to other authorized ATF suppliers. It has deprived the airlines' customer of the benefit of effective competition at the airport in effect impacted the cost to passengers at large."" 
According to the letter, BPCL has 70.8% of capacity remaining in its pipeline."
666,2018-07-11,Reliance,"Reliance Jio GigaFiber will have huge implications for cable, DTH, TV broadcasting, OTT services

Imagine a home with connected devices, with gadgets and appliances such as mobiles, refrigerators, televisions, geysers and air conditioners talking to each other. A smart home will soon be a possibility with the help of a single service provider Jio GigaFiber, the high-speed fixed line broadband from Reliance Jio Infocomm. The announcement of the service was made by Reliance Industries chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani on 5 July at the company’s 41st annual general meeting.  
Imagine a home with connected devices, with gadgets and appliances such as mobiles, refrigerators, televisions, geysers and air conditioners talking to each other. A smart home will soon be a possibility with the help of a single service provider Jio GigaFiber, the high-speed fixed line broadband from Reliance Jio Infocomm. The announcement of the service was made by Reliance Industries chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani on 5 July at the company’s 41st annual general meeting. 
The service will include ultra high definition entertainment on TV, virtual reality, gaming, smart home solutions and e-commerce. The company will offer a router, set-top box and a fixed line phone, among other things. The fibre connectivity to 1,100 towns and cities will target 50 million broadband users.
Reliance’s entry in this segment is expected to be hugely disruptive for the media and entertainment industry as it will have far-reaching implications for cable, direct-to-home (DTH), television broadcasting as well as over-the-top (OTT) video streaming brands such as Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hotstar, among others.
The biggest beneficiary of the Jio GigaFiber would be OTT services, says Ashish Pherwani, partner (media and entertainment) at consulting firm EY. “The more there is wired infrastructure in place, the more houses that have fibre, the better it is for OTT platforms. It will give a leg-up to subscription-led OTT because OTT content will now be seen on TV. In fibre-to-home, the quality of broadband is much better,"" he says.
For some sections of the media and entertainment business, Jio GigaFiber may pose a challenge. For instance, on the day of the announcement of the service, shares of broadband and cable TV operators like Hathway Cable & Datacom, Den Networks and Siti Networks tanked as both cable and internet service providers (ISPs) business may face stiff competition from GigaFiber. “What if it (Jio) offers 250 TV channels and 50GB data for  ₹ 500 a month? Nobody can compete with that,"" says a media executive. However, Ashok Mansukhani, a cable industry veteran as well as CEO and managing director of Hinduja Ventures Ltd, the holding company of Hinduja Group’s media firms, does not agree. He says cable has several unique strengths such as local content, convenience of service and low pricing. Also, cable can provide broadband. Besides, cable (especially Hinduja’s HITS platform) is servicing remote rural areas and has access to difficult hinterlands. “While any new technology and service impacts the industry, we feel cable will innovatively move ahead with the strengths it has in understanding customers for the last 20 years or more.""
Media industry experts expect an impact on DTH as well since DTH is not a two-way technology and the world is moving towards a model where content is reaching the consumer directly. Mihir Shah, vice-president at research firm Media Partners Asia (MPA), says that vanilla linear channel offerings will not be adequate to attain meaningful average revenue per user growth in the pay-TV sector. “Product innovation will be vital for the DTH industry. Already operators like Airtel and Videocon D2H have rolled out connected STBs (set-top boxes) allowing consumers to stream online content, though the deployments have not yet attained any meaningful scale.""
Besides, Jio will also have better negotiating power with broadcasters as it will become the largest multi-system operator and television distributor in the country. Experts say that broadcasters may lose their pricing power for content as Jio can flaunt the number of homes that it hooks.
To be sure, the consumer stands to gain. Right now, every home has multiple service providers—one each for landline, TV and broadband. With Jio, it will be the first time that one company will offer all three services. And although its pricing strategy is not known, Jio may offer these at very low prices to capture the market.
But the question is, will the consumer switch? It may not be easy. Experts say the conversion may be slower than what it was for its mobile service. In the case of SIM cards, the situation was different. Many people tried Jio phones while keeping their existing connections. In this case, whether a consumer replaces his existing service providers remains to be seen. 
But given its earlier record, Jio will go all out to woo the consumer. Says MPA’s Shah: “In comparison to the mobility segment, the subscriber uptake in the fixed broadband segment will be slow. However, the quality of subscriber growth going forward will be superior, with many upgrading to next-gen broadband technologies.""

667,2018-07-11,Reliance,"RIL's gross refining margins may hit $20 a barrel by FY21 against the estimated $12 a barrel

Mumbai: Tougher quality standards for fuel oil powering ships are expected to boost the refining margins of Reliance Industries Ltd, which has already upgraded to these standards as part of its massive refinery expansion. 
Mumbai: Tougher quality standards for fuel oil powering ships are expected to boost the refining margins of Reliance Industries Ltd, which has already upgraded to these standards as part of its massive refinery expansion.
Under regulations issued in October 2016 by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), ships must shift to fuel oil with sulphur content below 0.5% January 2020, against the present 3.5%. 
“As a result of our robust and flexible configuration, we are also uniquely positioned to take advantage of emerging opportunities in view of IMO 2020,"" Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of RIL, had said at the company’s 41st annual general meeting on 5 July. 
Fuel oil, also called furnace oil, is a byproduct of crude oil distillation. It is used in ships, and for steam boilers in power plants and in industrial plants. 
With the impending shift to low-sulphur fuel oil, demand for the same is expected to rise. According to a Macquarie Research report, RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM) can hit $20 a barrel by the financial year 2020-21 against the estimated $12 as RIL stands to gain from expansion in middle distillate cracks. 
GRM is realization from turning every barrel of crude oil into finished products.
 “RIL is a prime beneficiary of IMO 2020 regulations. Unsurprisingly, on an absolute basis, RIL ranks at the top with refining margins expanding to $20 per barrel in FY3 from $12 today,"" said Macquarie Research in its report dated 9 July.  
RIL is not the sole winner though. Indian Oil Corp. Ltd., Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd too will benefit as they have already begun producing low-sulphur fuel. 
Macquarie added that by virtue of operating one of the highest complexity refineries in the world, RIL should benefit from the material expansion in middle distillate cracks which it expects to expand from $15 a barrel today to $30 due to a substantial demand from the shipping industry.  Middle distillates refers to a range of refined products including jet fuel, heating kerosene, and gas and diesel oils like marine bunker fuels.
Higher demand will double the product’s crack spread (difference between the price of crude oil and petroleum products extracted from it).
This January, RIL commissioned its refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) complex of 1.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) capacity along with downstream plants and utilities. This marks the end of the $16 billion refining and petrochemicals expansion plan that RIL embarked on in 2014. The plant will help RIL double ethylene capacity in addition to lowering its fuel cost and boosting profits."

Mumbai: Mukesh Ambani is poised to overtake Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma to become Asia’s richest person as he positions Reliance Industries to disrupt the e-commerce space in India.
The chairman of India’s refining-to-telecoms conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd, Ambani was estimated to be worth $44.3 billion on Friday with Reliance trading 1.7% higher, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The stock fetched  ₹ 1,100.65 as of 12.25pm in Mumbai and is set for a record. Ma’s wealth stood at $44 billion at close of trade on Thursday in the US, where the company is listed.
Ambani has added $4 billion to his fortune this year as Reliance doubled its petrochemicals capacity and investors cheered the success of his disruptive telecom upstart Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. Then earlier this month, the tycoon unveiled plans to leverage his 215 million telecom subscribers to expand his e-commerce offerings, taking on the likes of Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Ma has lost $1.4 billion in 2018.
“We need to broaden our horizon of expectation with Reliance,"" said Nitin Tiwari, a Mumbai-based analyst at Antique Stock Broking. “They are in for something really transformational.""
Ambani, best known for executing large-scale projects, spearheaded construction of the world’s largest refining complex in Jamnagar, owns the most-widespread mobile data network globally and claims to have India’s biggest as well as most-profitable retail firm.
At this month’s annual shareholders’ meeting, Ambani said Reliance saw its “biggest growth opportunity in creating a hybrid, online-to-offline new commerce platform,"" involving the group’s Reliance Retail Ltd. and Reliance Jio businesses.
The latter will introduce a fiber-based broadband service across 1,100 Indian cities in August in what Ambani said would be the biggest greenfield fixed-line rollout anywhere in the world.
A spokesman for Reliance didn’t immediately reply to an email seeking comment.
Equity culture
Within a week of the announcements, Reliance re-entered the $100 billion club after more than a decade. He used the same venue two years ago to announce his disruptive telecom venture with free offers that eventually forced smaller rivals to quit and the biggest ones to merge.
The billionaire inherited Reliance from his much-storied father Dhirubhai Ambani, who is credited with sparking an equity culture among middle-class Indians and using their savings to build the group’s textile and petrochemical manufacturing units.
Dhirubhai’s death in 2002 left the group in the hands of Mukesh and his younger brother Anil Ambani. The brothers eventually split the company in 2005, as per a family pact brokered by their mother, after years of acrimony."

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd, India’s second-largest company by market value, plans to raise about  ₹ 40,000 crore in fresh debt this financial year as it expands its consumer businesses, according to people familiar with the matter.
The billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led company will raise funds through loans and bonds, mostly in the Indian currency, the people said asking not to be named as they are not authorized to speak to the media. Of this, the refining-to-retail conglomerate already has shareholder approval to raise as much as  ₹ 20,000 crore through non-convertible debentures.
Reliance’s total debt has tripled in the past five years as it borrowed to fuel more than  ₹ 3.3 trillion of spending on a new telecom venture and its traditional petrochemicals business. Ambani will invest this year to roll out fiber-based broadband services and on acquisitions, including the purchase of telecom assets from brother Anil’s Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom). The company has total borrowings of about  ₹ 2.2 trillion, more than half of which is due to be repaid by 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Net liabilities will probably increase this year, mostly due to the RCom transaction, before falling in the financial year ending March 2021 as cash flows improve, said Somshankar Sinha, a Mumbai-based analyst at Jefferies India. “Reliance needs funds to refinance existing long-term debt or replace short-term debt with longer tenors, and to fund its announced acquisitions.""
Reliance has agreed to pay about  ₹ 17,300 crore to purchase spectrum, mobile-phone towers and fiber assets from RCom and another  ₹ 5,000 crore for textile-maker Alok Industries, which it won in an auction under India’s bankruptcy rules.
There are investments planned for the fiber-based broadband services, JioGigaFiber, that will launch across 1,100 cities in August under the umbrella of telecom unit Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., the people said. In addition, the conglomerate will spend on acquiring apparel brands and opening new retail outlets, one of the people said.
Issuance mode
A spokesman for Reliance didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.
Reliance’s better-than-sovereign rating has helped it raise cheaper debt while actively investing cash reserves that reached  ₹ 78,100 crore last financial year. Other income accounted for about a fifth of its profit before tax in the 12 months to 31 March—much of it earned by investing the cash. The company has a “BBB+"" credit score from S&P Global Ratings, two levels higher than the Indian government.
Reliance returned to the local-currency bond market after a more-than-seven-year absence last year, raising 200 billion rupees via six offerings between August and November. The conglomerate priced some notes maturing in three years or slightly more in the range of 6.78% to 7.07%—lower than the 7.15% average yield on top-rated three-year corporate bonds during the same period.
Unit Reliance Jio on Tuesday sought bids to raise  ₹ 1,500 crore via three-year notes after tapping the rupee bond market four times already this year."

When contacted, Bharti Airtel spokesperson confirmed the development. 
According to the source, Mardikar has resigned to move up the ladder in his career path. 
Mardikar has been with Airtel since August 2012. This was his second stint with the telecom major. 
Earlier, he has served Airtel for about a decade from 2001-2010 after quitting his job at the Department of Telecom. He was serving as CTO of Airtel’s mobile network since January 2017."
660,2018-07-23,Reliance,"The fear is that the bloodbath which followed  Reliance Jio's entry could now play out in the cable space

In January, Amazon, along with JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway, announced a new healthcare company. The three companies merely said it would provide high-quality healthcare for their employees and families at a reasonable cost. 
In January, Amazon, along with JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway, announced a new healthcare company. The three companies merely said it would provide high-quality healthcare for their employees and families at a reasonable cost.
But healthcare investors got nervous at the prospect, selling off shares of established players like UnitedHealth and Anthem.
In June 2017, Amazon bought Whole Foods. The unexpected deal sent shares of several biggest grocers, including Walmart, down sharply. Kroger, another top grocer, lost one-tenth of its value on the day of the announcement.
Call it the fear of being “Amazoned"", but its interest in expanding into a new business or even a half-baked mention of its plans has spooked investors in potential competitors.
A similar rattling effect was felt in India when Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, the homegrown telecommunications company owned by Mukesh Ambani, announced its expansion into fixed-line broadband with Jio GigaFiber. Instant reaction: Shares of cable TV service providers Den Networks, Siti Cable and Hathway Cable witnessed intraday fall of 11%, 5.5% and 18%, respectively. Companies are also preparing a war-chest: Hathway announced it is raising funds up to  ₹ 100 crore from promoters.
Such events are not in response to just a competitor building a similar product. It was in response to Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL)’s ambitions, which have few limits, and the mere spectre of its entry into a particular industry can shape markets. 
The markets have seen it play out over the years. RIL has almost always wrested control in a market it has entered, mostly by financial muscle power and playing on economies of scale. Most recently, it was telecom, which saw the industry roadmap getting rearranged when the company entered the sector with disruptive packages, which incumbents were forced to match—resulting in stiff losses, value erosion, mergers and even bankruptcies. Telecom companies, including Aircel, Telenor India, MTS, Tata Teleservices Ltd and Reliance Communications, part of the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group, had to shut shop primarily due to the Jio effect, or got “Jio-ed"" maybe. Remember the “Death by Amazon"" index. Time for Death by Jio. Probably, huh!
The underlying fear is that the bloodbath that followed RIL’s entry into telecom could now play out in the data and cable space—clearly divided as pre-Reliance Jio and post-Reliance Jio eras.
Sample the scale: Jio’s services, which commercially launched on 5 September 2016, acquired 16 million subscribers within the first month. It had around 130 million subscribers in October 2017 and 186.6 million as of April. In less than two years, it owns over 20% of the market.
Amazon, too, began to knock off weaker brick-and-mortar rivals, leading to a “last man standing"" thesis. Amazon already controls 40% of the US e-commerce market and is on track to own 50% by 2021. According to Bain Insights, the Seattle-based retail disruptor will capture around 70% of all e-commerce growth over the next five years.
Jio GigaFiber will likely borrow from the same playbook. According to Rohit Dokania, senior vice-president, research, IDFC, matching Jio’s “free period"" would be difficult for existing players. This could lead to heightened churn and falling average revenue per user (in overlapping areas) and, thus, impact profitability of existing fixed broadband players.
Jio has already laid enough intra-city fiber across hundreds of towns and it has to now just extend it to the last mile—into people’s homes.
Jio is not talking about just another allied industry expansion. It is about creating a “Jio ecosystem"" through an eponymous sprawl, which now seeks to include smart TV, IoT and security with fibre connectivity to 1,100 towns that will target 50 million broadband users. Jio wants to control not only the pipe, but also what goes through it—the content (the group’s ownership includes Network 18, Jio TV, Jio Music, Jio Express, stakes in Saavn, ALT Balaji, Eros, Jio Chat, Jio Payments Bank, Jio Cricket Play Along, Jio KBC Play Along and e-commerce and others).
As with any disruptor like Amazon or Jio, whether the sprawl presents a threat or an opportunity for a given company depends on the context. For consumer product companies looking for quick online distribution, Amazon might be a game changer. For over-the-top platforms, Jio GigaFiber could give a further leg-up to their distribution. The threats, though, are obvious.
“Dealing with ‘Jio’ factor is a major part of due-diligence conversations,"" says a deals leader at a consulting firm. What this means for investors is that such disruptors have become a factor in the due diligence of almost any target asset across industrial, consumer and retail sectors. In more and more cases, underwriting future value means assessing the “Jio factor""—good or bad.

657,2018-07-24,Reliance,"Reliance Jio has amassed 215 million subscribers since its 2016 launch, accounting for 18.2% market share in May from about 10% a year earlier

Mumbai: The bruising telecommunications price war unleashed by the entry of Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd into the sector may continue for at least a year or as long as it takes Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. to nearly double its user base.
Reliance Jio “will strive to double subscribers to 400 million before raising prices,"" Kunal Agrawal, a Hong Kong-based analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence said in an emailed response to questions. “We expect cut-throat pricing and weak average revenue per user to continue over the next one-to-two years, possibly increasing balance sheet leverage for other domestic telecom incumbents.""
Reliance Jio, which stormed the sector with free calls and data forcing rivals to merge or exit as revenues declined, has amassed 215 million subscribers since its 2016 launch. Agrawal estimates the company will now aim for a dominant market share after turning the industry into an oligopoly and as India’s mobile users inch up to 1.2 billion over two to three years, from 1.13 billion currently.
Reliance Jio market share surged to 18.2% in May from about 10% a year earlier, according to regulatory data compiled by Bloomberg.
Reliance Jio didn’t answer an email seeking comment.
Also read: Why Reliance Jio, Amazon are two sides of the same coin
A dominant position in a “three-way battle"" between Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel Ltd. and Vodafone Idea Ltd, a proposed combination of Vodafone Group Plc’s India unit and Idea Cellular Ltd. would require at least a 33% share of subscribers, Agrawal said. That puts Reliance Jio’s “minimum subscriber threshold"" before looking to increase average revenues per user at 400 million, he projected.
“There is a lot of pain ahead before it gets better,"" he said."

New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is setting up its own production house to create original web series and short films for subscribers of its telecom unit Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, as it seeks to maintain an edge over competing offerings.
This, the company expects, will help attract more users to its 215-million wireless user base, and also when it formally introduces its wired broadband service towards the end of this year.
Mobile data consumption has soared as tariffs plunged, boosting the viewership of video-streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. India-specific shows on these platforms, including Sacred Games and Comicstaan, have become popular.
“Content market is still not properly tapped… Reliance has hired a bunch of scriptwriters and content creators and is in the process of setting up a huge production house,"" a person aware of the development said requesting anonymity.
RIL has made a string of acquisitions recently to boost its content offerings. In March, the company announced an integration with music app Saavn for its digital music service JioMusic. In February, RIL announced that it would buy a 5% stake in film maker Eros International Plc. 
Jyoti Deshpande, a former group chief executive officer and managing director at Eros, who has joined as head of the media and entertainment business at RIL, is currently driving the company’s initiatives to build businesses around the content ecosystem.
“Recently, 20-25 creative people have come on board… the company has realised that viewers here are taking to original Indian content on platforms such as Netflix and Amazon in a big way… the company too expects to offer some web series to consumers within 4-6 months,"" the person cited above said.
Jio also has a tie-up with media arts institute Whistling Woods International to set up a lab dedicated to virtual reality and augmented reality, with an aim to create a generation of cinematic VR filmmakers.
Content is a crucial piece in the ‘commerce-content-carriage’ play for RIL, which is now also eyeing the home broadband market to increase market share. Content will come bundled with its home broadband offering. 
Rival Bharti Airtel Ltd, which has a wireless subscriber base of 344.55 million and around 2.2 million wired broadband users, on the other hand, believes that the business model around content has not been proven.
“The challenge in content is that if you want to actually produce your own content, it needs a different DNA. The question is do we have the DNA. Maybe the answer to that is no. Currently, we are exploring partnerships to do it (offer content). At some stage, if you have to do it yourself, you have to think about it differently and create a different entity that can actually do it. That to me is still speculative and is out there. At this point, we are focussed on building the platform,"" Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal said in an interview in July.
Both telcos have, however, stepped up investments behind home broadband and expect content to increase consumer stickiness for them. Airtel has a few broadband plans bundled with Amazon Prime subscription.
“Reliance’s strategy to create a platform for exclusive content could work well as new media has seen a lot of traction in the entertainment space. A lot of content is coming up on platforms such as Netflix and Amazon, which has also given a path to talent which could otherwise not emerge through traditional production houses,"" an analyst said, requesting anonymity.
A query emailed to Jio remained unanswered till press time."
658,2018-07-24,Reliance,"Analysts estimate revenues of Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular will decline between 2.5% and 3% in the June quarter on an organic basis

The June quarter was fairly eventful for Indian telecom companies, at least as far as disruptive announcements by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd go. In May, the company announced post-paid tariffs that were less than half of prevailing offers from incumbents, coupled with far cheaper international calling rates. It also considerably increased the data allowance on its flagship plans. 
The June quarter was fairly eventful for Indian telecom companies, at least as far as disruptive announcements by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd go. In May, the company announced post-paid tariffs that were less than half of prevailing offers from incumbents, coupled with far cheaper international calling rates. It also considerably increased the data allowance on its flagship plans.
But the impact of these moves is expected to have been minimal in the June quarter, with the new post-paid services being available for only about half of the period. It was also the first full quarter of operations after the exit of Aircel Ltd, resulting in gains for incumbents. At the same time, downtrading by subscribers continues to cost-effective bundled plans, which means the decline in Arpu (average revenue per user) and revenues should continue for incumbents.
Not all smartphone users have migrated to bundled plans yet. According to analysts, Arpu of smartphone users remains higher than what Arpu of bundled plans imply, leaving room for downtrading still. Of course, the pace at which this migration occurs has reduced, which should result in a drop in the rate at which revenues are declining.
In the March quarter, revenues of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd’s India wireless operations had declined sequentially 3.7% and 5.7%, respectively. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities estimate their revenues will decline between 2.5% and 3% in the June quarter on an organic basis.
Of course, the lower rate of decline is hardly any comfort to investors. Both Airtel and Idea were running losses at the Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) level in the March quarter, and losses are expected to increase in the first quarter of this fiscal year.
Idea, for instance, is estimated to report losses of   ₹  1,331 crore, according to Kotak’s estimates, far higher than the loss of   ₹  193 crore a year ago. The company’s estimated Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of   ₹  817 crore amounts to only two-thirds its estimated interest cost of  ₹ 1,200 crore. Vodafone India Ltd’s financial position isn’t expected to be far better, and the merged Vodafone-Idea entity will be heavily banking on a recovery in Arpu for avoiding breaches on their debt covenants.
But Jio’s move in the post-paid segment shows that it is no mood to relent. If anything, Arpus will be under downward pressure for some time to come. The company itself is expected to report a drop in Arpu in the first quarter, since it has waived the Prime subscription fee. Besides, subscribers who availed of cashback offers will also generate lower Arpus. Whether Jio also reports a drop in Ebitda will depend on how much of its expenses remain capitalized.
The company has also stepped up competition in the feature phone segment, after a somewhat muted response to its JioPhone offering. In July, it lowered the initial outgo for owning a JioPhone to a third of existing levels. The company also said it has set a target of 100 million users for the feature phone, compared to around 25 million in early July.
In the smartphone segment, Jio continues to report decent growth rates, with its overall base having risen to 215 million subscribers in early July, compared to 186.6 million in end March. As long as new subscribers are being added at a fast clip, Jio can be expected to maintain current tariff levels. After all, why unnecessarily rock the growth engine? Those hoping for a recovery in tariffs may need to wait much longer."

“Overall, we expect Ebitda and profit after tax to witness 48% and 17% year-on-year growth, respectively,"" said Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in its report dated 11 July. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation and is an indication of a company’s profitability.
Analysts expect RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM) to be in the range of $10-11 per barrel against $11.9 per barrel that it reported a year ago. GRM is what a refiner earns by turning a barrel of crude oil into refined products. 
During the quarter, the Singapore Complex GRM was down 6% year-on-year to $6 per barrel against $6.4 per barrel in Q1FY18. Crude oil price, however, continued its upward trend in April-June quarter. Average Brent crude price was up 48% year-on-year and 11% quarter-on-quarter to $74.5 per barrel. 
“We estimate RIL’s petchem earnings to grow by 10% quarter-on-quarter due to steady margins and higher volumes though the same will be offset by 8% decline in refining from weaker GRM. We estimate Ebitda to be up by 2% on quarter though net profit would decline 2-3% due to higher interest cost (from forex loss) and lower Other Income"" said Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd in a report dated 6 July.
“Given the softness in light distillate yields (gasoline, naphtha and LPG) and LPG margins, we expect RIL’s GRMs to decline by $0.8 per barrel quarter-on-quarter. Diesel margins have been stable,"" added Credit Suisse.
On the petrochemicals front, analysts expect higher petchem volumes to offset softness in refinery Ebitda. Petchem margins have been mixed but volumes should increase. “Petchem segment is expected to do better, led by healthy petchem deltas and strong volume growth,"" said Motilal Oswal in its report. 
RIL’s telecom venture Reliance Jio Infocomm, which clocked standalone net profit at  ₹ 510 crore in the March quarter, is expected to post good growth in the June quarter.
Analysts expect Jio’s profit to increase to around  ₹ 600 crore led by 15% subscriber growth to 21.5 crore subscribers. Ebitda is expected to grow by 3.4% quarter-on-quarter. In the fourth quarter of last fiscal, Jio had clocked 3.5% revenue growth and 3.8% ebit growth quarter-on-quarter.

“MA field cessation expected by September 2018,"" Reliance said in an investor presentation post announcing June quarter earnings. The field had in the first month produced 39,976 tonnes of crude oil and peaked to 108,418 tonnes in May 2010, according to data available from upstream regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).
Output has been declining since then. It produced 0.14 million barrels (1960 tonnes) in the April-June quarter, Reliance said in the presentation. MA also started producing gas from April 2009, just when D1 and D6 went live. It peaked to 8.4 million standard cubic metre per day in August 2010 before sand and water ingress forced a shutdowns.
D1 and D3 fields too had a peak that year in March when it touched an output of 61.4 mmscmd. Output thereafter has only declined.
Reliance said KG-D6 output in April-June averaged at 4.7 mmscmd, which includes production from both D1 and D3 and MA fields.
In April, the Mukesh Ambani-controlled firm stated that “adhering to Site Restoration Guidelines issued by Government of India, RIL submitted Bank Guarantee for Decommissioning activity for existing producing fields"". While the company had not provided any timelines for decommissioning and stopping of production at the fields then, it has now said MA field would shut in September. The government’s site restoration guidelines provide for a one-year notice for decommissioning of facilities.
The shutdown coincides with the expiry of the current lease of a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit, which processes output from the field.
Reliance is the operator of KG-D6 block with 60% interest, while BP Plc of the UK holds 30% stake. Niko Resources Ltd of Canada has the remaining 10%.
Reliance had in the field development plan for D1 and D3 proposed a capital expenditure of $8.836 billion. For developing Dhirubhai-26 or MA oilfield, it had in 2006 proposed to invest $2.234 billion, which was scaled down to $1.96 billion in 2012. The fields were in the investment plans supposed to last a minimum 15 years but have extinguished in exactly a decade’s time.
Reliance in the presentation said it is now developing three sets of discoveries: R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ fields in the KG-D6 block at a cost of  ₹  40,000 crore. These fields together would bring 30-35 mmscmd of peak output. Initial gas will start flowing from 2020.

“We are planning to raise $ 2.7 billion in forex debt through the course of fiscal 2019. The money will be raised in multiple tranches and will be used to refinance some of our existing high cost forex debt,"" a senior company official said, refusing to reveal more information.
More than half of RIL’s $ 34 billion debt is due for repayment by 2022, while around $ 13 billion is maturing from 2018 through 2020. Most of the outstanding debt is denominated in foreign currencies.
Reliance has sought shareholders approval to issue redeemable non-convertible debentures (NCDs) at its 5 July annual general meeting, it said in its annual report. Due to the high rating at BBB+ (by S&P Global Ratings), which is two notches higher than the sovereign rating, Reliance can raise cheaper funds. Moodys has a Baa2 rating on the company, a notch above the governments rating.
RIL is the only private sector company in India that has issued perpetual bonds to foreign investors a few years back. The only other domestic entity to tap the perpetual bond market is the state-run State Bank of India.
According to investment bankers, Reliance’s debt repayments from 2018 through 2020 will be its biggest for any three-year period in the past and include about $ 8.14 billion term loans, $ 3.52 billion bonds and a $ 300 million revolving loan. It also has about $ 1.65 billion in interest payments.
In the June 2018 quarter, Reliance’s finance cost jumped more than threefold to  ₹  3,555 crore on an annualised basis. Its debt has trebled over the past five years as it invested $ 37 billion in Reliance Jio and expansion of its petrochemical business that included setting up a pet coke gasification unit.
During the recent RIL AGM, Ambani said his vision for the group was to become a consumer company over the next decade. Already, 31% of Reliance’s revenue is coming from retail and telecom business, June quarter numbers show.
Reliance Jio, which was launched two years ago, reported a net income of  ₹  612 crore in the June quarter, while market leader Bharti Airtel Ltd’s plunged to  ₹  97.3 crore from  ₹  367.3 crore a year earlier.

653,2018-07-29,Reliance,"Reliance Industries beat the street by a handsome margin in the June quarter, reporting an operating profit of 20,661 crore

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL’s) shares have beaten the market by a wide margin in the past two months on expectations of a regulatory boost for its refining business and excitement about revenue accretion from its telecom subsidiary’s non-mobile businesses. 
Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL’s) shares have beaten the market by a wide margin in the past two months on expectations of a regulatory boost for its refining business and excitement about revenue accretion from its telecom subsidiary’s non-mobile businesses.
While those outcomes will take some time to materialize, the company has some good news for investors in the interim. It beat the Street by a handsome margin in the June quarter, reporting an operating profit of  ₹ 20,661 crore. On an average, analysts had estimated profit of  ₹ 18,280 crore, according to Bloomberg.
The outperformance was led by the petrochemicals segment, which reported a 35% year-on-year jump in volumes, helped by the company’s expanded capacity. Petchem realizations were up 24%. The upshot— petchem Ebit (earnings before interest and taxes) rose 95% year-on-year to  ₹ 7,857 crore. The performance of the refining segment was subdued, but more or less in line with expectations. RIL’s gross refining margin last quarter stood at $10.5/barrel, more or less in the range that analysts had anticipated, based on the decline in Singapore refining margins.
Of course, much of the excitement around RIL these days is over its telecom subsidiary, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. It didn’t disappoint. Surprisingly, it reported a mere 2% or so decline in average revenue per user (Arpu), despite waiving off prime membership fees since April, and also taking a hit on account of discounts offered for some modes of payment.
As a result, most of the increase in Jio’s subscriber base ended up as commensurate growth in revenue. They grew nearly 14% quarter-on-quarter to  ₹ 9,567 crore. Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd had estimated that a close to 10% drop in Arpu will offset the increase in subscribers.
Jio’s Ebit grew at a similar pace to  ₹ 1,708 crore. Along with the retail business, the company’s consumer businesses now account for over a fifth of its operating profit. It’s important to note that the retail subsidiary’s margins rose quarter-on-quarter, which should allay concerns that the spike in margins in the March quarter was a one-off.
Coming back to Jio, the company’s capex in the June quarter stood at  ₹ 17,000 crore, higher than the  ₹ 14,000 crore it spent in the March quarter. As such, cash burn remains exceptionally high.
According to an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm, Jio appears to be going for the kill, by increasing its lead over incumbents significantly in terms of network coverage. Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd are already losing subscribers, without the ability to keep up with investments.
In this scenario, it may not be totally off the mark to expect Jio to steadily increase its market share to its targeted level of 50%. The company’s progress so far will please investors. Whether it will make a decent return on its huge investments is another matter.
As far as the RIL stock goes, the results can be expected to sustain investor interest. A fair share of optimism lately has been due to the expected increase in refining margins under the new rules issued in October 2016 by the International Maritime Organization. The limit for sulphur content in fuel oil used by ships has been set at 0.5% from 1 January 2020— as against 3.5% at present. This is expected to boost demand for low sulphur diesel/middle distillates globally, which in turn would lead to an increase in product cracks. Complex refiners such as RIL are expected to benefit from this.
Whether this materializes or not, the progress of the Jio project, coupled with expectations surrounding non-mobile businesses such as home broadband, is likely to keep investors excited.

London/Dubai/Abu Dhabi: Days before rubbing elbows with global business titans in Davos in January, Arif Naqvi set out to charm another circle of friends—Gulf Arab tycoons—in a last-ditch attempt to save his Dubai private equity firm. 
London/Dubai/Abu Dhabi: Days before rubbing elbows with global business titans in Davos in January, Arif Naqvi set out to charm another circle of friends—Gulf Arab tycoons—in a last-ditch attempt to save his Dubai private equity firm.
But things were already on the cusp of spiraling out of control. Dogged by allegations Abraaj had mismanaged investors’ money, Dubai’s star financier soon couldn’t pay the rent. After Naqvi, 58, surrendered control of Abraaj in June, it was revealed that for years, its main revenues didn’t cover operating costs. Abraaj borrowed to fill the gaps and now owes creditors over $1 billion. Once lenders turned off the taps, the firm collapsed, leaving losses, lawsuits and shattered reputations in its wake.
Abraaj’s reliance on multiple levels of leverage created a “highly unstable"" business model that’s unusual for the private-equity industry, the court-appointed liquidators that are dismantling the firm said in a report dated July 11 and seen by Bloomberg.
After analysing the documents they could get their hands on—since some went missing—investigators at PricewaterhouseCoopers said Abraaj’s use of loans to cover operating expenses left it “sensitive to volatility and potential liquidity crises."" They are now selling Abraaj assets to pay creditors and investigating allegations of “mismanagement, commingling of funds and misappropriation of assets.""
Naqvi declined to comment, while the firm defended its use of leverage. Borrowing was a necessity because most of its clients, especially early on, were family businesses that weren’t always timely in making payments, according to an e-mailed statement from Abraaj. “In hindsight, the pace of growth should have been more measured,"" the statement said. “The back office was not keeping pace in terms of sophistication or best practice."" Back-office operations encompass things like record maintenance and accounting.
Abraaj’s spectacular demise has dealt a severe blow to Dubai’s reputation as a global financial centre. It rattled the trust of investors who included Bill Gates, the International Finance Corp. and US and UK government agencies, triggered defaults on loans from at least 10 sources and set off lawsuits in the UAE and Turkey.
The chronology of the collapse, drawn from conversations with about a dozen people with direct knowledge of the company, lays out how rapidly things fell apart for Naqvi, the suave Pakistani entrepreneur who built Abraaj from the ground up in the past 16 years only to see it crumble in under 10 months.
A fixture at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Naqvi had crafted Abraaj’s image as the face of Middle East private equity. Starting with $3 million of capital and $60 million of assets under management in 2002, it grew by leaps and bounds. 
At one point it managed almost $14 billion of assets for investors like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the retirement fund for teachers in the state of Texas. Abraaj oversaw funds from 18 offices in emerging markets spanning Latin America, Africa and Asia—a network that several US investors have since tried to buy at fire-sale prices."

TCS, which closed 0.19% lower at  ₹  1,941.25 per share, was valued at  ₹  7.43 trillion.
The surge in RIL share price follows its Q1 results where its standalone net profit increased 18% to  ₹  9,459 crore. TCS, on its part, reported quarterly revenues of over $5 billion for the first time in Q1.
RIL shares have beaten the market by a wide margin in the past two months on expectations of a regulatory boost for its refining business and excitement about revenue accretion from its telecom subsidiary Reliance Jio’s non-mobile businesses.
It’s outperformance in Q1, however, was led by the petrochemical and refining realizations, which reported a 35% year-on-year jump in volumes, helped by the company’s expanded capacity. Revenue at the energy-to-telecom conglomerate rose 56.5% to  ₹  1.4 trillion against  ₹  90,537 crore in the corresponding previous quarter. Its telecom arm Reliance Jio reported a profit of  ₹  612 crore for the June quarter, a 19.9% rise on a sequential basis, on the back of a revenue of  ₹  8,109 crore from its operations, the company said.
“Reliance Jio continued to show strong subscriber momentum, in line with our expectation. However, flattish sequential ARPU despite cash back offers and changes to prime membership are surprises. Focus remains on onboarding more subscribers and driving engagement; price increase appears less of a focus for now,"" said Morgan Stanley in a note to its investors.
TCS on 10 July reported a 24% profit rise, the fastest pace in two years, to  ₹  7,340 crore due to robust growth in banking, financial services and insurance and the North American operations. Revenue grew 16% to  ₹  34,261 crore.
“TCS had a strong quarter witnessing a healthy growth on back of turnaround in the BFSI segment of the North American market and the management expects the growth to sustain in the coming quarters... TCS is on track to achieve its targeted double-digit growth in FY19. Yet, we believe that at current valuations, the stock is fairly priced from a short to medium-term perspective,"" said Indsec Securities in 12 July note."

Mumbai: The sharp drop in telecom tariffs in the past two years has wreaked havoc on the financial health of Indian telecom firms. The surviving telcos are in dire straits. Idea Cellular Ltd reported pre-tax losses of  ₹ 2,817 crore in the June quarter, compared to a profit of  ₹  600 crore in the June 2016 quarter, ahead of Reliance Jio’s launch. Its debt has reached unsustainable levels of 19 times annualised Q1 Ebitda. And although things will get better after the merger with Vodafone India, and the resulting cost synergies, unless substantial equity is brought in, leverage of the merged entity will be at damaging levels. 
Mumbai: The sharp drop in telecom tariffs in the past two years has wreaked havoc on the financial health of Indian telecom firms. The surviving telcos are in dire straits. Idea Cellular Ltd reported pre-tax losses of  ₹ 2,817 crore in the June quarter, compared to a profit of  ₹  600 crore in the June 2016 quarter, ahead of Reliance Jio’s launch. Its debt has reached unsustainable levels of 19 times annualised Q1 Ebitda. And although things will get better after the merger with Vodafone India, and the resulting cost synergies, unless substantial equity is brought in, leverage of the merged entity will be at damaging levels.
Both companies have lagged far behind Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel Ltd with respect to investments in their network. Reliance Jio has stepped up investments lately with capital expenditure of  ₹  17,000 crore and  ₹  14,000 crore in the preceding two quarters.
Idea, with its balance sheet constraints, spent  ₹  7,000 crore on capex in all of financial year 2017-18. The gap is already beginning to show in subscriber numbers.
Until recently, when networks of Aircel Ltd and Reliance Communications Ltd were shutting down, Idea and Vodafone had the advantage of increasing subscriber numbers by going after customers leaving those networks. But now, it turns out that they are the most vulnerable among surviving telcos.
According to an analyst with a domestic institutional brokerage, Reliance Jio’s incremental market share is largely expected to come at the expense of the Vodafone Idea combine.
While Airtel is far better placed in terms of its balance sheet, the deterioration in the profitability of its India wireless business has been equally dramatic. In the June quarter, it reported a loss before tax of around  ₹  2,000 crore, compared to a profit of  ₹  2,340 crore ahead of Reliance Jio’s launch. And things are getting progressively worse. It burnt cash worth  ₹ 4,200 crore last quarter, almost as much as it did in the whole of financial year 2017-18. As pointed above, this is driven by the need to increase data capacities, leading to higher capital expenditure.
Reliance Jio, interestingly, appears to be immune from all of the pain in the sector. It has reported profits for its wireless business in the past three quarters.
But its accounting has some quirks, including a different depreciation policy compared to peers, making comparisons difficult.
It’s best, then, to look at cash burn. On this measure, it leads the charts with cash burn of over  ₹ 40,000 crore in the previous financial year. This includes capex funded by creditors and capitalised interest costs. Put together, incumbents’ cash burn was a fraction of this.
Of course, Reliance Jio is yet to commercially launch its non-mobile businesses such as home broadband, and it remains to be seen how much this segment contributes to overall profits."

Mumbai: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is making life miserable for everyone—everyone, barring the consumer, that is. While four telecom firms have already folded up, Reliance Jio’s massive push to provide Indians with digital oxygen—which is how it refers to broadband data—is cutting the lifeline of even India’s largest telecom firms, including market leader Bharti Airtel Ltd. Indebtedness at Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd has reached unwieldy levels. The only hope for investors and lenders is that tariffs increase from current levels.

Indebtedness at Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd has reached unwieldy levels. The only hope for investors and lenders is that tariffs increase from current levels.
But Reliance Jio itself seems content with current tariff levels. It has a lower cost structure compared to incumbents, and has been reporting profits in its wireless business. Besides, it hopes to recover a large part of its costs from the fixed broadband business, which is yet to be commercially launched. Then, there is the aspiration of being a platform business, which, according to some investors, will bring limitless opportunities.
What, then, could cause Reliance Jio to relent on pricing? If it does not and stays with its disruptive instincts, will other telcos survive?
“The current pricing in the telecom market is great from a consumer’s perspective… it is not great from a lender’s perspective. We have to be very, very cautious while taking exposure to the telecom sector,"" Rajnish Kumar, chairman, State Bank of India, said in an interview with Mint recently.
Much to the dismay of investors in telecom companies, there is no sign of an increase in tariffs. On the contrary, downward pressure on tariffs has continued unabated. Average revenue per user (Arpu) of Bharti Airtel Ltd fell sequentially by another 6% in the June quarter. Its Arpu has fallen 44.3% since Reliance Jio launched services in September 2016.
Things may only get worse. Reliance Jio has only recently targeted the postpaid segment, which accounts for over a fifth of incumbents’ revenues. Besides, in early July, Reliance Jio announced a huge cut in the cost of owning the Jio Phone, a feature phone targeting incumbents’ voice-only users. The impact of these moves is yet to be seen."

Mumbai: The Supreme Court on Friday cleared a settlement between Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) and the Indian unit of Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson AB, paving the way for the sale of the telecom operator’s assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. 
Mumbai: The Supreme Court on Friday cleared a settlement between Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) and the Indian unit of Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson AB, paving the way for the sale of the telecom operator’s assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
The judgment, which was delivered by a two-judge bench headed by justice R.F. Nariman, directed Reliance Communications to pay  ₹ 550 crore to Ericsson by 1 October and asked RCom chairman Anil Ambani to give an undertaking to this effect.
The apex court will now hear RCom’s plea to close the insolvency case on 1 October.
Meanwhile, Ericsson objected to the settlement terms of RCom’s insolvency case, news agency Bloomberg reported. 
Ericsson had in 2014 signed a seven-year deal with RCom to operate and manage its nationwide telecom network. Now, its Indian-arm has alleged that it has not been paid over  ₹ 1,000 crore. The Swedish company had earlier claimed outstanding dues to the tune of  ₹ 1,600 crore, but had agreed to settle for  ₹ 550 crore later on. 
With the settlement, RCom is now expected to complete asset sales pegged at about  ₹ 25,000 crore to Reliance Jio within the next three weeks. The asset sale to Reliance Jio will help reduce the lenders’ exposure to RCom by 50%, said an RCom spokesperson. It owes about  ₹ 42,000 crore to its lenders.
In December 2017, as part of its debt resolution plan, RCom had struck a  ₹ 25,000-crore deal with the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio for the sale of its assets mortgaged with different banks, to avoid insolvency proceedings.
According to the deal, Jio will buy RCom’s assets, which include 122.4 MHz of 4G spectrum in the 800/900/1,800/2,100 MHz bands, over 43,000 towers, 178,000 RKM (route km) of fibre with a pan-India footprint and 248 media convergence nodes covering five million sq. ft, used for hosting telecom infrastructure.
The plan, however, faced numerous setbacks with the Supreme Court and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) ordering stays at various junctures during the process. 
The apex court ruling on Friday comes as a big relief to RCom. The deal with Jio does not include RCom’s real estate assets. RCom is also left with some portion of its spectrum assets for which it is understood to have found other bidders. With the completion of the deal, Jio gets most of RCom’s assets, giving it more firepower in its telecom business, while the Anil Ambani-promoted firm will reduce its debt overhang substantially.
RCom’s assets are expected to contribute significantly to the large-scale roll out of wireless and fiber-to-home and enterprise services by Reliance Jio. A June UBS report pegs Reliance Jio and RCom’s present separate spectrum market shares at 16.2% and 7.4%, respectively, which when combined, adds up to 23.6%.
UBS expects Jio to garner 23.6% of the spectrum market share after the completion of RCom’s asset sale, compared with Airtel’s 23.5%, and the Vodafone Idea Ltd’s 27.2%.

The apex court on August 3 allowed RCom to sell assets covering spectrum, fiber, telecom towers and certain real estate assets, for an aggregate value of  ₹ 25,000 crore.

Mumbai: Reliance Naval and Engineering Ltd has approached the Bombay high court against Oil and Natural Gas Corp.

In its petition, the firm controlled by Reliance Infrastructure Ltd said ONGC has refused to take delivery of the eighth vessel and also invoked a bank guarantee. 
Mumbai: Reliance Naval and Engineering Ltd has approached the Bombay high court against Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) after the explorer ended a deal for the supply of a dozen vessels to support offshore oil exploration. In its petition, the firm controlled by Reliance Infrastructure Ltd said ONGC has refused to take delivery of the eighth vessel and also invoked a bank guarantee.
The company, a part of billionaire Anil Ambani’s diversified Reliance Group, is seeking a refund of more than $6.6 million (about  ₹  45 crore), which ONGC has invoked as performance bank guarantee, along with $15.46 million (about  ₹  105 crore) as payment for the eighth offshore support vessel (OSV) that it built for India’s largest explorer.
Reliance Naval also sought the court’s intervention to direct ONGC to take delivery of the eighth vessel.
Reliance Naval said in its plea that ONGC had in 2008 floated a tender to build and supply the dozen vessels. At that point in time, erstwhile private shipbuilder Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering Co. Ltd had entered into an agreement with Singapore-based Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd to meet the eligibility criteria for technical support to build the vessels.
The contract was bagged by Pipavav in 2009. On 4 March 2015, Reliance Defence Systems, a unit of Reliance Infrastructure, acquired Pipavav Defence—then India’s largest shipyard with a licence to build warships—and rechristened it Reliance Naval and Engineering Ltd.
However, in June 2016, ONGC informed Reliance Naval that it needs to execute a fresh memorandum of understanding with Jurong Shipyard for continuing technical support. However, Reliance responded that all trials concerning the eighth ship have been completed and it also provided the progress report for the remaining four vessels.
Reliance Naval, in its subsequent responses, told ONGC the technical pact with Jurong Shipyard is still binding and, therefore, a new agreement isn’t needed. In June 2017, Jurong Shipyard and Reliance Naval entered into an amendment agreement with regards to technical support. The firm had also sought an extension of a year to June 2019 to deliver remaining vessels. However, ONGC categorically informed the shipbuilder that the only reason the eighth ship was not accepted because of change of name issue and the company’s “alleged inability to substantiate Jurong Shipyard’s contribution to the project"". Also, in June 2018, ONGC informed Reliance Naval that the name change has not been accepted by them and also the company is not in a position to give any further extension.
“We would like to inform that ONGC has issued a letter dated July 30, 2018, for termination of an old contract dated 16th October 2009 for the supply of 5 out of 12 offshore support vessels,"" Reliance Naval informed the stock exchanges on 2 August. “As advised, the termination of the aforesaid contract is arbitrary. The company has taken and will take all necessary steps and actions to protect its rights,"" it further added.
According to the Bombay high court’s website, a division bench of Justice R.M. Borde and Justice V.M. Deshpande will hear the matter on 9 August.
An emailed query to ONGC did not elicit any response. Nishit Dhruva, managing partner of law firm MDP and Partners who is advising ONGC along with senior counsel Kevic Setalvad, confirmed the filing of the case by Reliance Naval, but declined to divulge any details since the matter is sub judice.
A spokesperson for Reliance Naval declined to comment on the issue as the matter is in the court. Senior counsel, Venkatesh Dhond who is representing Reliance Naval along with law firm Mulla & Mulla & Craigie Blunt & Caroe said the company wants to fulfil the contract to deliver all 12 vessels but declined to elaborate.

637,2018-08-10,Reliance,"Petcoke gasification will help Reliance Industries lower the Jamnagar refinery's energy costs and boost its gross refining margin

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has approached three state-run oil marketing companies to buy petroleum coke (petcoke) from them to fire its $5 billion petcoke gasifiers, according to three officials aware of the development. RIL operates the world’s biggest refining complex in Jamnagar, Gujarat, where two adjacent plants can process about 1.4 million barrels of oil a day. It has 10 petcoke gasifiers of which four, in the domestic tariff area (DTA), are already in the ramp-up phase, and the remaining six, in the special economic zone refinery, are likely to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of this fiscal. 
Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has approached three state-run oil marketing companies to buy petroleum coke (petcoke) from them to fire its $5 billion petcoke gasifiers, according to three officials aware of the development. RIL operates the world’s biggest refining complex in Jamnagar, Gujarat, where two adjacent plants can process about 1.4 million barrels of oil a day. It has 10 petcoke gasifiers of which four, in the domestic tariff area (DTA), are already in the ramp-up phase, and the remaining six, in the special economic zone refinery, are likely to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of this fiscal.
“RIL has approached us seeking additional petcoke as RIL’s own petcoke generation capacity will not suffice to meet its gasification needs. We are deliberating on the matter,"" a senior official of one of the oil marketing companies said on condition of anonymity.
Reliance Industries, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) did not reply to an email sent on 2 August.
“We produce 6.5-7 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of petcoke and once the gasifiers are running at full capacity, we would be running the entire petcoke for gasification. We also may require more of either coal or petcoke. Once we are running at 100% capacity, we would stop importing LNG,"" said V. Srikanth, RIL’s joint chief financial officer. 
With refineries processing heavier crudes, the production of petcoke at refineries is peaking and gasification of petcoke has become an efficient and environmentally safe way of utilising it.
RIL wants to completely eliminate its petcoke production of 6.5 million tonnes a year, generated from two of its cokers. Petcoke gasification will help it produce 23 mscmd (million standard cu. m a day) of synthesis gas or syngas which will reduce intake of regasified liquefied natural gas (R-LNG) at its refineries. Syngas is a fuel gas mixture of primarily hydrogen, carbon monoxide and, very often, some carbon dioxide.
RIL takes around 8 million standard cubic metres a day (mscmd) of R-LNG for its refineries which it eventually plans to bring down to 2 mscmd. 
In an emailed response, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd said, “Reliance Industries has expressed interest in procuring petcoke from Indian Oil but discussions in this direction have not yet been initiated."" Indian Oil sells petcoke to customers from industries like cement, lime kiln and steel. The company plans to install the facility of petcoke gasification in one of its refineries, for which a study is in progress, it said.
Petcoke gasification will help RIL lower the refinery’s energy costs and boost its gross refining margin (GRM), which is what a refiner earns by turning a barrel of crude oil into refined products.

“We expect the entire project (with 10 gasifiers) will be fully commissioned by March 2019. In addition, RIL’s flexibility to switch crude sourcing toward heavier crudes should raise its competitiveness versus global peers. Every $1 per barrel change in GRMs affects FY19-21e earnings by 5-6%,"" said HSBC Research in a report dated 29 July.
However, if the government decides to ban import of petcoke, owing to environmental concerns, RIL can use 15-20% coal instead of petcoke. “RIL will require 25% of its petcoke requirements once gasifiers are fully ramped up. However, the company does not see a ban on imports for gasifiers and cement kilns,"" said Morgan Stanley Research in its report dated 30 July."

635,2018-08-12,Reliance,"CEO Rajesh Dhingra says Dassault chose Reliance Defence to meet its 'offset', or export obligation, in the Rafale deal and that the defence ministry has no role in the selection of Indian partners by foreign vendors

New Delhi: Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group on Sunday said it received the Rafale jet deal from Dassault Aviation SA and not the defence ministry. “Reliance Defence or any other Reliance group company has not received any contract from the MoD till date, related to 36 Rafale aircraft. This is absolutely unfounded and incorrect,"" said Reliance Defence Ltd chief executive Rajesh Dhingra. 
New Delhi: Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group on Sunday said it received the Rafale jet deal from Dassault Aviation SA and not the defence ministry. “Reliance Defence or any other Reliance group company has not received any contract from the MoD till date, related to 36 Rafale aircraft. This is absolutely unfounded and incorrect,"" said Reliance Defence Ltd chief executive Rajesh Dhingra.
Answering questions ranging from lack of experience to state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) being overlooked for the Rafale jet deal, the Reliance Defence CEO said the French aviation firm chose Reliance Defence to meet its “offset"" or export obligation in the contract and that the defence ministry has no role in the selection of Indian partners by the foreign vendors.
According to Dhingra, the government-to-government deal requires all 36 Rafale fighter jets to be delivered in a “fly-away"" condition, which means “they are to be exported from France by Dassault"" and “HAL or anyone else cannot be the production agency for the simple reason that no aircraft are to be produced in India"".
Dhingra said HAL was a nominated production agency for the 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft programme, which never reached the contract stage.
The opposition Congress had last week demanded setting up of a joint parliamentary committee on the Rafale jet deal, even as its president Rahul Gandhi attacked the Narendra Modi government for inking the deal at a much higher price than the one the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) had negotiated. He has accused the government of changing the deal to benefit “one businessman"".
On allegations of Reliance Defence getting the contract because of Ambani’s reported proximity with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Dhingra said: “As per the defence procurement procedure (DPP), ministry of defence has no role in the selection of Indian partners by the foreign vendors. This has been the position right from 2005 when offsets were first introduced in the country."" In the more than 50 offset (export obligations) contracts signed in the country till date, the same process has been followed, he said. “Therefore, this is a deliberate attempt to mislead people and cloud the issue.""
On the issue lack of experience in making fighter jets, Dhingra said no company in India, except HAL, has the experience of making fighter planes. “This would mean that we will never create any new capability beyond what exists and will continue to import more than 70% of our defence hardware,"" said the Reliance Defence CEO.
Dhingra added that Reliance Defence will be participating in the offset programme through Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd (DRAL) in which Dassault holds a 49% stake bringing in its 90 years of aerospace manufacturing experience, making it the “most qualified vendor"".
He termed as “absolutely wrong"" the allegations of Reliance Group benefiting with a  ₹  30,000 crore contract. “Dassault’s share of offsets is about 25%, with the remaining offset obligations being shared by Thales, Safran, MBDA and others. Therefore, the basic premise of Dassault giving  ₹  30,000 crore worth of offset contracts to Reliance is totally unfounded.""
Dassault and its other Tier-I suppliers have already indicated that more than 100 Indian companies which will participate in the offset contracts, he added. This includes joint ventures with PSUs like HAL and Bharat Electronics Ltd. “We can also not lose sight of the fact that up to 30% of total offsets can be discharged through transfer of technology to DRDO, as per DPP,"" Dhingra said.
Asked about Reliance Defence being incorporated days before announcement of the Rafale deal, Dhingra said three companies were incorporated in December 2014 and Reliance Group’s entry into defence sector was announced at Aero India in February 2015.
“Also, there are reports in the media of as late as end-March 2015 where Dassault officials were on record to say that the MMRCA deal is 95% done. If this is correct, what is the linkage with the date of incorporation of Reliance Defence?"" Dhingra asked.
When asked about Anil Ambani’s presence in France when Modi signed India’s Rafale deal with France in April 2015, Dhingra said the Reliance Group chairman is part of the CEOs’ Forum for France and also many other countries.
“He (Anil Ambani) was in Paris because there was a meeting of the CEOs’ Forum on the sidelines of the prime minister’s visit. More than 25 other CEOs from the Indian companies were also present, including the Chairman of HAL,"" Dhingra said.
Asked about allegations that Reliance actually got contracts worth  ₹  1.3 trillion and not  ₹  30,000 crore, the Reliance Defence CEO said the amount may be coming from projections of  ₹  30,000 crore for offsets and another  ₹  100,000 crore towards the lifecycle cost over 50 years.
“There cannot be anything further from truth.... To the best of my knowledge, the government has not signed any lifecycle contract for 50 years with Dassault. Therefore, the very question of Reliance getting a contract does not arise,"" he said.
On the issue of defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman denying knowledge of the contract, he said according to DPP 2016, the foreign vendor has a choice to submit the details of its offset partners at the time of claiming offset credits. “In this case, offset obligations are due only after September 2019. It is, therefore, possible that the Ministry of Defence has no formal communication from Dassault Aviation about the choice of its partners for the offsets,"" Dhingra said.
Asked whether it was correct that under DPP, a joint secretary-level official is required to countersign the contract, Dhingra said: “The offset contract is signed between the MoD and the foreign vendor. MoD does not sign any contract with the Indian offset partners.""

631,2018-08-16,Reliance,"If India's draft e-commerce policy becomes a law, Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail will emerge as the most formidable challenger to Jeff Bezos's Amazon empire

New Delhi: Jeff Bezos, meet Mukesh Ambani. 
New Delhi: Jeff Bezos, meet Mukesh Ambani.
It’s time the Amazon.com Inc. boss took notice of his real rival in India, the only billion-strong consumer market open to Western tech firms. While Walmart Inc.’s acquisition this year of Flipkart Online Services Pvt. Ltd, a homegrown e-tailer, might have given the impression that the battle for India would be an all-American contest, a new national e-commerce policy doing the rounds in New Delhi should disabuse Bezos of that notion.
If the draft e-commerce policy becomes law, the oil-to-telecom tycoon who’s India’s richest man will emerge as the most formidable challenger to the wealthiest person on the planet.
The core contest comes down to warehouses. Foreign-funded firms aren’t allowed to hold e-commerce inventory in India. That’s a disadvantage for Amazon, since it prevents the firm from fully capitalizing on the strengths of its vaunted logistics operation, seen as one of its most decisive edges in the US.
Amazon was hoping that those rules would be loosened, but the proposed e-commerce policy instead calls for harsh controls on even the phantom sellers that Amazon and Flipkart have been using to get around the no-inventory problem. If the new policy is strictly implemented, Amazon, and its preferred resellers, won’t be able to offer deep discounts.
Meanwhile, Indian-managed companies like Ambani’s Reliance Retail Ltd will be free to control and improve their supply chains while building a fearsome online presence in partnership with his mobile operator, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
That’s not the only onerous aspect of the policy. The draft speaks of a two-year period after which data generated in India—on social media (Facebook Inc.), via search engines (Alphabet Inc.’s Google), or e-commerce (Amazon)—will have to be stored on local servers. As the Wall Street Journal noted this week, the move is bound to push up costs for Western firms.
This new restriction will probably make it to the final law. The Indian central bank is already directing all payment firms like Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. to keep their Indian data exclusively in the country by October, so there’s little reason to expect that rules for e-commerce data will be much less stringent.
Besides, similar laws already exist in China. Amazon sold its Chinese servers and some other cloud assets to a local partner to comply with Beijing’s local storage rules. Alphabet, which has no data centers in China, is also looking for a local partner to bring its Google Drive and Google Docs to that country, Bloomberg News reported recently.
Other aspects of the e-commerce policy may die without Bezos needing to move a muscle. Indian privacy activists will balk at the idea of a “social credit database,"" to be set up—in a very Chinese fashion—by mixing state and non-state citizen data. While the goal of the database is to promote digital lending, there’s no guarantee it won’t be used to stifle dissent.
A more problematic suggestion in the draft is that the Indian government would have access to the data stored in India, “subject to rules related to privacy, consent etc"". A proposed Indian data-privacy law is yet to be passed by parliament, and whatever makes it onto the books will in turn be shaped by the Indian apex court’s verdict in a case challenging the constitutional validity of a biometric identification system that the government has rolled out to 1.2 billion Indians.
Detractors argue that the biometric database is unsafe, a threat to privacy, and a tool for digital exclusion because the failure rate of authentications is too high. For business, however, the stakes in the central data repository are significant. Fast customer acquisition made possible by the unique ID database helped Reliance Jio sign up 215 million users in just 22 months for its low-priced 4G telecom service. The draft e-commerce rules now promise a single “know your customer"" data portal, akin to Singapore’s MyInfo. This move could help Jio’s payments bank acquire customer deposits cheaply.
A report in Factor Daily, an Indian tech news website, gives a detailed account of how executives from Jio and Reliance Industries Ltd., the group flagship, helped shape the “India First"" doctrine of the new e-commerce rules.
ALSO READ | Why Reliance Jio, Amazon are two sides of the same coin
The Reliance boss owes it to his shareholders to try to make the most of his home-field advantage. The only way his big telecom investments—already amounting to $36 billion, and counting—will make sense is if Jio can succeed in locking in India’s consumers with a triple play of carriage, content and commerce. Of those three, carriage may drive ubiquity of Reliance’s services and content will bring a sticky audience – but only commerce will make real money.
India is pegged to be a $1 trillion digital economy by 2025, and Bezos, Ambani, and the Bansal and Walton families backing Walmart-Flipkart all want a piece of the action. Judging by this first round of regulatory skirmish, it’s the Reliance boss that Bezos needs to worry about most."

The timing is tight for RCom. Its onshore lenders will agree to a debt restructuring only if they know that the dollar bonds are also being restructured, in line with so-called inter-conditional agreements on debt, said one person with knowledge of the matter. The outcome of the talks this month may sway how much the company’s debt holders will get repaid in the end.
“It’s a lose-lose for creditors and the company if RCom goes into insolvency,"" said Mihir Chandra, head analyst at SC Lowy. “Creditors would take longer to get repaid"" with lower recoveries likely, and shareholders would be wiped out, he added.
A RCom spokesman wasn’t able to immediately comment when contacted by email.
India’s large delinquent borrowers face an 27 August deadline to put in place a resolution plan, as the nation’s regulator pushes its lenders to recast and clean up $210 billion of bad loans in their balance sheets. RCom’ default was India’s most high-profile one on international debt since the nation’s insolvency and bankruptcy code was passed in May 2016, and its debt talks are being closely watched.
The company expects to complete the sale of assets including spectrum and telecom towers by the end of August, thereby “accelerating its overall debt resolution plan,"" it said earlier this month.
Resolving its debt would mean coming to an agreement with offshore bondholders. RCom earlier this month offered to repay holders at a discount to principal value, prompting a plunge in bond prices.
“RCom’ proposal to bondholders was worse than the market expected,"" said Chandra at SC Lowy. “We think it’s likely that bondholders will push for a better deal.""
The Reserve Bank of India in February introduced a time line for the country’s banks to recast bad loans.
For delinquent accounts that were in default as of 1 March, and where lenders have exposure of  ₹  2,000 crore or more, a resolution plan should be implemented within 180 days from 1 March, according to RBI guidelines.

Jio broadband has started accepting registrations and has also announced a 3-month preview offer where customers get 100 GB monthly data for 90 days. Reliance Jio GigaFiber is not even charging an installation fee.
Tata Sky’s entry into the broadband market, therefore, comes at a crucial stage where existing broadband subscribers are being lured to change their loyalty by Reliance Jio’s attractive plans, including the free preview offer.
Tata Sky broadband plans
Tata Sky broadband is being gradually rolled out in these cities: Mumbai, Hyderabad, Ghaziabad, Delhi, Pune, Bhopal, Chennai, Gurgaon, Thane, Noida, Bengaluru and Mira Bhayandar (Maharashtra).
These are the rates for monthly unlimited plans: 5Mbps —  ₹ 999, 10Mbps —  ₹ 1,150, 30Mbps —  ₹ 1,500, 50Mbps —  ₹ 1,800 and 100Mbps —  ₹ 2,500.

Days after registrations for its much-awaited broadband service began, Reliance Jio has announced free preview plans for Jio GigaFiber broadband. Under the 90-day preview offer, Jio broadband is giving you 100 GB monthly data free for 3 months at internet speeds of up to 100Mbps.

After you have expressed your interest in getting a Jio GigaFiber broadband connection on the Jio website or MyJio app, Reliance Jio will start prioritising its launch based on the demand factor. The locality which gets a higher number of registrations will experience the availability of Jio broadband service faster.
As and when your locality or housing society gets selected for the service, Reliance Jio will contact you to get its fixed-line fiber-to-home broadband connection at the home or office address you gave during registration.
Free installation
The best part about the Jio GigaFiber broadband preview offer is that installation comes completely free of cost. There are zero installation charges and customers will only be charged a refundable security deposit of  ₹ 4,500 for Jio’s broadband router. Since it is an optical line terminal (OLT) device with a different configuration than a regular broadband router, your existing router is highly unlikely to be compatible with the Jio broadband connection. The Jio router has been named GigaHub Home Gateway.

After the Jio GigaFiber preview offer ends, Reliance Jio customers will be given the option of migrating to its prepaid plans which will be announced in the next few months. Initially, Jio GigaFiber will be available only in prepaid plans. The postpaid plan will be rolled out later.
Jio’s speed
Jio is promising that downloading will happen in merely ‘milli-seconds’ with its ultra-fast broadband service. The key distinguisher being the fiber cable of Jio GigaFiber which comes directly to your home. It says unlike fiber, traditional cable reduces the speed due to patches in between.Jio is also expected to roll out its TV connection service soon which will be bundled with the broadband connection.

Mumbai: China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has initiated talks with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail Ltd to form a mega Indian retail joint venture (JV), with an investment of at least $5 billion to challenge the dominance of Flipkart and Amazon in the world’s fastest-growing economy, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said. Alibaba Group has proposed to acquire a large stake in Reliance Retail to create a behemoth in the digital marketplace and also expand Alibaba’s physical retail businesses in India, the people said, requesting anonymity. 
Mumbai: China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has initiated talks with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail Ltd to form a mega Indian retail joint venture (JV), with an investment of at least $5 billion to challenge the dominance of Flipkart and Amazon in the world’s fastest-growing economy, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said. Alibaba Group has proposed to acquire a large stake in Reliance Retail to create a behemoth in the digital marketplace and also expand Alibaba’s physical retail businesses in India, the people said, requesting anonymity.
The talks indicate that the battle for India’s booming e-commerce market may only intensify further, with two large and deep-pocketed companies planning to come together to take on the market leaders.
A Reliance spokesperson, however, said there has been no discussion with Alibaba or anyone else on acquiring a stake in Reliance Retail Ltd.
Alibaba’s executive chairman, Jack Ma, met Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambani recently to discuss the proposal, the people said. The two discussed a number of issues, including a plan to create a large omnichannel retail entity through the proposed joint venture, they said.
“Alibaba is willing to pick up a significant stake in Reliance Retail, preferably 50%, which will require Alibaba to invest $5-6 billion,"" one of the two people said. “It could also result in a strategic JV between Alibaba and Reliance Retail, with a smaller stake held by Alibaba.""
Goldman Sachs is advising Alibaba on the proposed venture, the person said. A Goldman Sachs spokesperson declined to comment. Emails sent to Reliance and Alibaba remained unanswered.
The joint venture, if it goes through, will be the largest investment by Alibaba in an Indian company.
“The deal is crucial for Alibaba, especially after RBI (Reserve Bank of India) directed Paytm (in which Alibaba holds 49%) to stop on-boarding new customers because of the shareholding pattern of Paytm,"" said the second person.
RBI was concerned that the Chinese company has access to Paytm’s customer data, the person said. It has asked Paytm to improve security mechanisms to store customer data, Mint reported on 1 August.
“Alibaba had picked up the stake in Paytm with the objective of benefiting from Paytm’s successful e-commerce and digital wallet business in India. Reliance Retail is planning a similar model like Paytm, and once that happens, Alibaba will benefit the same way it was gaining from its association with Paytm,"" added the second person.
Alibaba’s Taobao and Tmall are two of the world’s largest and most popular online retail marketplaces. Together, they achieved a total transaction volume of $478.6 billion in fiscal 2016, and hope to double the figure to over $900 billion by 2020. As of February 2018, Taobao had at least 580 million monthly active users, while Tmall had 500 million.
Alibaba has also announced that it will invest 100 billion yuan over five years to build a global logistics network, while working on an aggressive overseas expansion plan.
Alibaba’s consumer-to-consumer portal Taobao and business-to-consumer portal Tmall, each feature over a billion products and both are among the 20 most visited websites globally.
Reliance Retail, a unit of Reliance Industries Ltd, is the largest retailer in India in terms of revenue. Its retail outlets offer food, groceries, apparels, lifestyle and home-care products, consumer electronics, farm implements and so on. The company also sells vegetables, fruits and flowers, apart from consumer goods, consumer durables, travel services, energy, entertainment and leisure, and health and well-being products.
In the year ended 31 March, Reliance Retail’s profit before depreciation, interest, and taxes more than doubled to  ₹  2,529 crore. As on 30 June, Reliance Retail was present in at least 5,200 towns and cities, with 8,533 stores including 4,530 Jio Points, according to a company release.
Reliance Retail, which has crossed the $10 billion revenue mark, has been planning to expand its retail business, leveraging the network of its parent’s telecom unit, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
ALSO READ | The case for a Reliance Retail IPO
Reliance Retail has an edge over overseas online retailers, as foreign entities are not allowed to hold inventory in India and can only operate as marketplaces. Amazon is taking an indirect route to avoid any complications and comply with the numerous conditions that it might have to follow under the multi-brand FDI norms.
Alibaba’s talks with Reliance Retail and other potential retail partners in India assume significance after RBI’s directive to payment firms such as Visa, Mastercard and PayPal Holdings to ensure before October that the data of Indian customers stays in the country.

“Reliance Jio has raised  ₹ 1,500 crore which would be used to expand its operations in the GigaFiber segment,"" one of the two people cited above said. The NCDs bear a coupon rate of 8.70% per annum and would be redeemable in July 2021, the person said. 
Reliance Jio did not respond to an email query for comment until press time.
Reliance Jio’s parent Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has approval from its shareholders to raise as much as  ₹ 20,000 crore through NCDs.
“RIL is a AAA-rated issuer and has a higher volume of issues. Also, most of these are short-term instruments which we are holding on to maturity. Consideration for us is the yields,"" said a fund manager whose fund participated in the private placement. He spoke on the condition of anonymity.
SBI Short Term Debt Fund, DSP Blackrock Short Term Fund, HDFC Short Term Debt Fund, IDFC Bond Fund, Axis Mutual Fund and ICIC Prudential Corporate Bond Fund are among funds which took part in the latest fundraise. 
RIL, during its first-quarter earnings statement for this fiscal, said it has retained its domestic credit ratings of “Crisil AAA/Stable"" from credit rating agency Crisil; “IND AAA/Stable"" from credit rating agency India Ratings and an investment grade rating for its international debt from Moody’s as Baa2 and BBB+ from Standard & Poors.
Jio will use the funds for expansion in the telecom sector.
Jio plans to extend fibre connectivity to homes, local merchants, traders and small businesses. While for homes, this could mean ultra HD entertainment, multi-party video conferencing, digital shopping, security cameras, home appliances and voice-activated virtual assistants, for retail it would mean signing on to local merchants and boosting their sales through online-to-offline marketplace.
JioGigaFiber will be the largest greenfield fixed-line broadband roll-out globally, with a simultaneous launch in 1,100 cities across India, Mukesh Ambani had said, and may come bundled with content, set-top box and VoIP (voice over internet protocol) phone and could potentially disrupt the wired broadband market in the same way as it disrupted the wireless market.
RIL’s outstanding debt till June is  ₹ 2.42 trillion. Till March 2017, the company’s debt was at  ₹ 1.19 trillion. 
Jio spent  ₹ 17,000 crore on capex in the June quarter, higher than the  ₹ 14,000 crore in the March quarter. This June, Jio raised  ₹ 2,000 crore from State Bank of India Security Service through private placement of secured redeemable NCDs. 
“Cash burn at the company remains exceptionally high and RIL will keep raising funds to meet its investment commitments,"" said the first person cited above. “It has RCom’s assets to pay for. It had also bid for Alok Industries.""
RIL will pay  ₹ 5,000 crore for textile-maker Alok Industries, which it won along with in JM Financial ARC, under the bankruptcy bidding. It will also pay about  ₹ 17,300 crore to purchase spectrum, mobile-phone towers and fibre assets from Anil Ambani-promoted RCom."

623,2018-08-23,Reliance,"The sale of media convergence nodes concluded today represents the initial tranche of the planned RCom-Reliance Jio deal

Mumbai: Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) today said it has completed the sale of its media convergence nodes and related infrastructure assets worth  ₹  2,000 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. The company said 248 MCNs covering about 5 million sq.ft of area used for hosting the telecom infrastructure were transferred to Reliance Jio.

The company said 248 MCNs covering about 5 million sq.ft of area used for hosting the telecom infrastructure were transferred to Reliance Jio.
“Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) today announced the completion of the sale of its MCNs and related infrastructure assets, worth  ₹  2,000 crore, to Reliance Jio Infocomm,"" the RCom statement said.
RCom had earlier in August reinstated bank guarantees worth  ₹  774 crore with the department of telecommunications, ahead of the timeline set by the telecom tribunal, and had said that its  ₹  25,000 crore asset sale plans are “on track"".
RCom had in December 2017 signed a pact with Reliance Jio for sale of wireless spectrum, tower, fibre and MCN assets, the proceeds of which were to be used to reduce debt. The deal packed in 122.4 MHz of 4G spectrum in the 800/900/1800/2100 MHz bands, over 43,000 telecom towers, 178,000 km of fibre and 248 media convergence nodes. The MCN sale concluded today represents the initial tranche of the planned larger deal.

The operator, which defaulted last year on a $300-million bond, got 83% of bondholders to approve the plan, the company said in an exchange filing.
“Reliance Communications bondholders approved the tender and exchange offer of $300 million bonds with an overwhelming majority of over 83%, at their meeting held today, 24 August 2018, in London,"" RCom said in a statement. Following the offer, bondholders will receive cash proceeds of up to $118 million. “Bondholders will also get $55 million bonds to be issued by Global Cloud Xchange Ltd (holding company of GCX), a foreign subsidiary of RCom,"" the statement added. The Global Cloud Xchange bonds will be unsecured and will carry a coupon of 0.1% with maturity of four years, it added
The vote was crucial for Ambani because settling the matter was a precondition for RCom to reorganise its larger local debt. The company has been working against the clock to reach agreements with all its creditors by 27 August or face insolvency proceedings.
RCom is also in the midst of completing its sale of airwaves, towers and fiber to Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio. The brothers wrapped up a smaller deal involving transmission nodes,  ₹ 2,000 crore on Thursday.

Jio broadband customers will, however, have to pay a refundable security deposit of  ₹ 4,500 against the Jio broadband modem, known as optical line terminal (OLT).
At the RIL annual general meeting (AGM) last month, RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani had announced that Jio will soon start rolling out broadband services for both homes and offices. The service will be available across 1,000 cities of India. It is being speculated in the market that Jio GigaFiber broadband will be available around the festive season of Diwali.

At present, you cannot apply for a Jio broadband connection but can only express your interest in applying for one. Based on how many people apply from your locality or housing society will Jio take a call on which areas to launch its broadband service on priority. Registering for Jio broadband service can, therefore, make a difference if you want a connection.
Interested customers can register on the Jio website by sharing their address and phone number. This would be just an expression of interest sans any commitment from your end to buy Jio broadband services.
After the Jio broadband service is available in your area, its staff will call you to get the fixed-line fiber-to-home broadband connection.

Broadband market in India
According to latest data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), there are 447.12 million broadband subscribers. Out of this only a fraction, or 17.90 million, have wired broadband connections. Once the Jio service is available, this minority number is expected to become the majority as the company promises to offer fixed-line fiber-based broadband services at dirt cheap rates.
Fearing tough competition from Reliance Jio, existing operators like Airtel and BSNL have already reduced their prices and have come out with fresh offers to retain customers who may be planning to switch their loyalty to the new market entrant.
Tata Sky, which was so far offering only DTH TV connections, has launched its broadband plans already to compete with Jio.
In terms of the number of subscribers, the top 5 wired broadband service providers are BSNL (9.15 million), Bharti Airtel (2.21 million), Atria Convergence Technologies (1.34 million), MTNL (0.83 million) and Hathway Cable & Datacom (0.75 million)."
619,2018-08-26,Reliance,"To face security threats and meet international expectations, self reliance in defence is critical for India

Four years ago on 15 August, in his address from the Red Fort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the clarion call for “Make in India"". He said, “come make in India, we have steel...we have discipline, we have resolve.. sell anywhere, (but) make in India"". Among the range of opportunities he highlighted, there was the unmissable “satellites to submarines"", implying immense potential in defence and aerospace. 
Four years ago on 15 August, in his address from the Red Fort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the clarion call for “Make in India"". He said, “come make in India, we have steel...we have discipline, we have resolve.. sell anywhere, (but) make in India"". Among the range of opportunities he highlighted, there was the unmissable “satellites to submarines"", implying immense potential in defence and aerospace.
In 1947, India had a reasonable defence industrial base comprising 18 ordnance factories and one defence public sector undertaking (DPSU). Over the years, although the defence public sector expanded to 41 ordnance factories and nine DPSUs, it could not keep pace with the evolving threat and concomitant requirements, resulting in increasing dependency on import. Defence was opened to the private sector in 2001, with each edition of the procurement procedure adding provisions to promote indigenization. But this could not generate enough enthusiasm because of complex processes and difficultly in access.
The “Make in India"" initiative is striving to change that. Some very forward-looking policy directions were promulgated through the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) 2016 with emphasis on “self-reliance"" and “promoting MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises)"". Concomitantly foreign direct investment (FDI) norms were relaxed from 26% to 49% and up to 100% for state of art technology. The strategic partnership policy was announced in 2017. More recently, defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman simplified the industry funded development procedure (Make-II). A new defence production policy that is under deliberation aims to achieve self-reliance in 13 systems latest by 2025. The draft policy has unambiguous targets—achieve a turnover of  ₹  1.7 trillion in defence sector by 2025, with an additional investment of  ₹  70,000 crore, creating two-three million jobs. The defence export target is set at  ₹  35,000 crore.
Defence offsets introduced in 2005 to leverage imports to develop Indian defence industry remain underutilized. The offset guidelines are being reviewed to enlarge avenues for discharge.
The government’s thrust is also evident from the two defence industrial corridors and the launch of the Innovation for Defence Excellence (IDEX). A defence planning committee has been constituted under the national security adviser, with the three service chiefs, and the foreign, defence and expenditure secretaries. The committee is expected to prioritize modernization of the Armed Forces.
India’s growth to a $5 trillion economy has to be undergirded by strong security. To face our security threats and meet international expectations, self-reliance in defence is critical. To achieve self-reliance, it is imperative that these forward-looking policies are actualized. For example, the Make procedure, which is the soul of “Make in India"", needs to be pursued more vigorously for both the government-funded Make 1 and the industry-funded Make 2. To encourage start-ups in defence, we need to learn from Israel. While success is important, even failed projects provide great lessons.
The services need to look beyond the predominantly command orientation towards creating specialists, like technology leaders who understand military requirements and technology to lead the drive. To promote technology through strategic partnership and other provisions such as “enhanced performance parameters"", the services, together with finance authorities, have to devise means for price indexing technology.
India’s excellence in information technology (IT) needs to be optimized for defence. DPP is too cumbersome to keep pace with technological life cycle of IT. Even for other products, including import substitution, the prolonged procurement process upsets industry investment cycles. Predictability, timeliness and continuity are important for industry to sustain the rigorous demands of defence.
The industry is well invested and awaiting projects. The enthusiasm of the MSME is palpable from the preparations of the old participants and surge of new entrants.
ALSO READ | Wanted: A coherent defence manufacturing policy
The simplification of ministry of defence processes is a constant expectation of the industry. The challenge to simplification, for process managers, is the fear of allegations of scams. To quote a former bureaucrat, “We are so fond of scams, we manufacture one even when it doesn’t exist."" Invariably, defence procurements, whether it’s PT shoes or fighter aircraft, hit headlines, with allegations and counter-allegations resulting in freezing of procurement, collateral effects on other schemes and making the process more knotted. The unnecessary hue and cry discourages both domestic and foreign industrial partners.
ALSO READ | Execution key for defence manufacturing in India
For the Armed Forces to modernize and “Make in India"" to succeed, this environment has to change. Inherent challenges in an election year notwithstanding, in a democracy there needs to be a larger buy-in for strategic decisions. A possible solution is to empower the parliamentary committee on defence, which cuts across party lines, to scrutinize major procurement decisions and send the right message, while being mindful of security sensitivity. To achieve the objectives of “Make in India"" and secure independence from imports in defence, nurturing the right environment for decision making and implementation of these transformational policies is more crucial now than ever before.

Ever since Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launched services in 2016, revenues of India’s wireless industry have been on a steady decline. The only exception was the June-September quarter of 2017, when Reliance Jio started reporting revenues, and more than made up for the drop in revenues of other telecom firms. 
Ever since Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launched services in 2016, revenues of India’s wireless industry have been on a steady decline. The only exception was the June-September quarter of 2017, when Reliance Jio started reporting revenues, and more than made up for the drop in revenues of other telecom firms.
The April-June quarter this year was another instance where Reliance Jio’s incremental revenues made up for the drop in others’ revenues. Wireless revenues rose by about 1% sequentially last quarter, a report by JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd points out, based on revenues reported by telcos to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).
“Underlying wireless spending stabilised in Q1. Assuming no further tariff cuts, wireless spending is unlikely to decline materially from here,"" analysts at JM Financial said in the note to clients.
But while there may be signs of some stability, not all telcos are experiencing a state of calm.
Reliance Jio is clearly miles ahead of others in terms of revenue growth—its Q1 revenues grew 14%. Among the incumbents, Bharti Airtel Ltd was relatively better off with revenues growing by about 1% last quarter. Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd reported a 4% and 2% drop in revenues, respectively.
According to JM Financial, the Idea-Vodafone combine’s revenue market share has dropped from 42.4% a year ago to 34.1% currently. This is using the sum of adjusted gross revenues (AGR) in the wireless business and AGR in national long distance, which also captures revenues related to the mobile business. Reliance Jio, meanwhile, has raced from zero to a 22% share in the same period.
If revenues related to non-mobile businesses, such as fixed line, are knocked off using rough estimates, Reliance Jio’s share rises to 23.5%, say analysts.
With most other telcos having exited the market, analysts now expect Reliance Jio’s market share gains to come at the expense of Vodafone Idea. This is simply because the two companies are still far behind Reliance Jio and Airtel in terms of network investments.
A pertinent question, therefore, is, will the stability in revenues seen in the June quarter continue going forward. After all, what stops Reliance Jio from getting more aggressive to gain market share at a time when the two companies are still busy completing their merger?
Of course, much depends on Reliance Jio’s attempts to make inroads into the post-paid segment and the feature phone segment.
If the response to the company’s new offers in these segments is lacklustre, the industry may well have to prepare for another round of downtrading."

A bewildering array of digital payment businesses from global names like Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp to Google are in a slugfest to win Indian users with their payment services. On Monday, Mint reported that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is set to acquire a stake in Paytm.
Meanwhile, a string of other big-name players are also expanding in the country’s digital payments market including its banks, its postal service, and its richest man, Mukesh Ambani.
India saw a brief spurt in digital payments two years ago when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government banned most of the nation’s existing bank notes, although the spike petered out as new bills were printed. But over the past year, a string of new apps have made payments increasingly easy, and the discounts and cash bonuses they offer are proving irresistible to young, urban users like Sucharia.
Credit Suisse Group AG now estimates that the Indian digital payments market will touch $1 trillion by 2023 from about $200 billion currently. Cash still accounts for 70% of all Indian transactions by value, according to Credit Suisse, and neighbouring China is far more advanced with a mobile payments market worth more than $5 trillion.
But local players have a stranglehold on China’s digital payments space. Modi’s administration, meanwhile, has welcomed foreign firms in order to expand financial services across India.
“This kind of a promising market exists nowhere else,"" said Vivek Belgavi, a Mumbai-based partner at consultancy PwC India with an expertise in financial technology.
Still, the Indian payments market remains a chaotic field where the rules are hazy on what players can offer. And users often switch between apps. Rahul Matthan, a Bangalore-based lawyer, says he’s used every one of the leading payment apps, although he now confines most of his transactions to BHIM, Paytm and WhatsApp payments.
Experts like Vinayak H.V., Singapore-based senior partner at McKinsey & Co., say profitability isn’t close on the horizon for the industry. While it’s too early to call the game, here are a few players with a shot at winning:
Facebook’s WhatsApp Payments
Beta testing of WhatsApp payments service on a million Indians started in February this year.
Pros: WhatsApp is India’s most popular messaging app, whose quarter of a billion users text family and friends all day. It doesn’t need to put in cash to acquire customers and that’s a massive advantage.
Cons: WhatsApp payment service is stuck in beta mode, and its countrywide launch has been impeded by regulatory questions over areas like storage of user data. Meanwhile, the government has been upbraiding WhatsApp for not curbing fake videos that have gone viral on its messaging service and led to the lynching of over two dozen Indians. This could further delay the full-fledged launch of its payments business.
Google Tez
Google says its payment app crossed 50 million app downloads a few weeks ago. Google Tez is swiftly adding users and sprinted to increase total number of transactions using the country’s Unified Payments Interface, or UPI, a system that’s linked to over a 100 banks and facilitates real-time digital transactions.
Pros: Google’s Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said Tez is central to the company’s India strategy and also key to its global payments push. The payments app has localized, supporting several Indian languages, and is chasing young users with games that offer cashbacks.
Cons: Tez is lagging rival WhatsApp whose strong base of users come from its messaging service. Google has belatedly introduced a chat feature on Tez.
Flipkart’s PhonePe
PhonePe says it has 133 million app downloads.
Pros: When Walmart Inc. acquired a majority stake in PhonePe’s parent Flipkart Online Services Pvt. , the payments app also acquired a global backer. All signs are that PhonePe is already gaining from Walmart’s financial heft with a recent infusion of about $66 million from Flipkart.
Cons: Flipkart rival Amazon has been steadily pumping capital into its own wallet, Amazon Pay, and increasing its user base.
Paytm
Backed by China’s Alibaba as well as Ant Financial Services Co., Paytm is India’s largest digital payments company and says it has 150 million app downloads.
Pros: An early player, it got a boost from India’s demonetisation drive in 2016, when a scarcity of cash sent millions scurrying toward providers like Paytm. The company has since built a wide network of merchants and outlets with a robust system of cashbacks and discounts to keep users locked in.
Cons: Paytm’s users have to go through a multi-step enrollment process since it’s a licensed payments bank, unlike most of its digital wallet rivals like Tez and PhonePe. RBI recently barred Paytm temporarily from enlisting new users for non-compliance with procedures. The company said it has responded to the regulator’s concerns.
BHIM
Has 32 million app downloads. Designed by UPI, it’s the government’s own play in digital payments. The app is simple and fast, appealing to non-technologically savvy users in smaller towns and rural India.
Pros: The government has been actively pushing BHIM, using Modi’s face to promote its brand, setting transaction targets for banks and state-owned utilities to boost its user base.
Cons: Despite an initial popularity burst, it hasn’t been able to keep pace with rivals whose bottomless pockets have kept users hooked with sweeteners.
Next in line:
A brand new India Post Payments Bank, set up by the state-owned Department of Posts, is starting operations with 650 branches and thousands of trained postmen fanning out to far-flung corners to teach users how to use its app. Also, Ambani’s digital payments business via his Reliance Jio mobile service, has the potential to jolt rivals."
614,2018-08-29,Reliance,"The sale of Mumbai power assets to Adani Transmission will reduce Reliance Infrastructure's debt by two-thirds to 7,500 crore

Mumbai: Reliance Infrastructure Ltd’s chairman Anil Ambani on Wednesday completed the sale of its Mumbai city power distribution business to fellow industrialist Gautam Adani for  ₹ 18,800 crore.
Though Reliance Infra has sold one of its profitable business ventures, it will help bolster the company’s financials by repaying debt of   ₹ 13,800 crore from an accumulated debt of   ₹ 22,000 crore.
“For Reliance Infra, this is truly a transformative transaction. RInfra’s gross debt will be reduced from about  ₹ 22,000 crore to  ₹ 7,500 crore, representing a steep debt reduction of 65% in just a single transaction,"" chairman Ambani told reporters at a news conference. “RInfra’s annual interest cost will also be reduced by 70% from  ₹ 2,600 crore to  ₹ 800 crore.""
The deal will help to narrow RInfra’s debt-equity ratio to 0.3:1, among the lowest in the industry.
To further pare debt, Ambani said he expects arbitration awards of   ₹ 6,000 crore in ongoing cases of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, Goa Power and National Highways Authority of India, and a   ₹ 5,000 crore inflow from regulatory assets of the Mumbai Power distribution business that are under approval. “We have a further cushion of   ₹ 8,000 crore under arbitration yet to be decided. With these available cash avenues, we expect to be completely debt-free by 2019.""
Ambani plans to make RInfra “capital-light with high return on capital employed"". Making a case for Reliance Infra, Ambani said his remaining businesses will continue to bring in stable revenues over long concession periods with no further need to sell assets. These include a city utility business in parts of Delhi which covers 4.2 million customers, 11 operational road projects with annual revenue of  ₹ 1,300 crore, the Mumbai metro project and 5,800 megawatts (MW) of coal-based power generation capacity.
Adani, which will now be one of the utilities in Mumbai, will house the business under Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd (AEML). It will serve 3 million customers in Mumbai. In a phone interview, Anil Sardana, managing director and CEO, Adani Transmission Ltd and chairman AEML, said the company has a 100-day plan to bring in ‘wow’ factors to Mumbai’s customers. “This means faster turnaround time in commercial aspects of the business, streamlining of the interface with customers, prompter service with more delegates on the ground and IoT (internet-of-things)-enabled improvements."" Sardana also said that over the long term, the capital expenditure dosage in the business will be substantial—underground cables right now are very old and bulk power needs to be made more competitive so that consumers will benefit. “The plan is to not raise tariffs for consumers,"" Sardana said.

612,2018-09-01,Reliance,"A simple trick to get a good deal on your Airtel broadband subscription, ahead of a planned disruption in the broadband market by Reliance Jio, is to negotiate for discounts and free data.

It may not actually be like bargaining with your vegetable vendor, but Airtel is offering you discounts and free data only if you are smart enough to just give them a call and negotiate. Just ahead of the Reliance JioGigaFiber launch, several Airtel broadband customers have secured discounts on monthly broadband bills by simply asking for them. 
It may not actually be like bargaining with your vegetable vendor, but Airtel is offering you discounts and free data only if you are smart enough to just give them a call and negotiate. Just ahead of the Reliance JioGigaFiber launch, several Airtel broadband customers have secured discounts on monthly broadband bills by simply asking for them.
As part of its retention strategy for customers who may be lured away by lucrative offers from Reliance Jio, which is offering free 100GB data for the first 90 days under a preview offer, Bharti Airtel is offering customer retention discounts and bonus data.
Airtel has already announced new plans, with more data at lower cost. For several plans, the telecom service provider has removed its fair usage policy (FUP) limits, which allows unlimited data at the same speed. Most of these new plans have not been declared on Airtel’s website and can be uncovered by talking to the customer care helpline or by keeping an eye out on pamphlets or outdoor advertisements.

Such packages, however, vary from city to city. But since Reliance Jio has made it evident that it will disrupt the broadband market in India with 1Gbps data and cheap prices, Airtel has taken another step to protect its 9.53 crore customer base.
Airtel broadband users who are calling up the customer care helpline and trying to negotiate a deal with more discounts or bonus data are bagging benefits. These deals are being provided case by case without any official announcement from the service provider.
All such calls seeking discounts or subscribers asking to discontinue their Airtel broadband service are being transferred to a team specially assigned to retain customers. The executive online tries to understand what kind of deal the customer is looking at and based on the feedback prepares an irresistible offer. For example, if you are happy with 30 GB monthly data but find the monthly rental expensive, you can ask for cheaper plans with the same data limit. Or if you want more data at the same speed then also you can demand free bonus data.
Darshana Agarwal, a housewife living in Noida, wanted both. She called up the helpline and got her 30GB plan cost reduced to  ₹ 499 from  ₹ 599 and had the data doubled. An Airtel executive told her that this is a special customer retention discount and customer retention bonus data offer.
The Reliance Jio effect
Through its wireless broadband, Reliance Jio is already dominating the broadband market in India with a 48% market share, according to June 2018 data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai). Existing operators, especially in the wired broadband segment, fear the situation may worsen after Jio GigaFiber broadband is launched. Once the service is made available in the next few months, Jio has promised not to charge installation fees or rent for the first three months. With plans to roll out broadband services in 1,000 cities, Reliance Jio will offer 100GB data at a speed of 100Mbps free for 90 days.
It will only charge a refundable security deposit of  ₹ 4,500 against the Jio broadband modem."

Vodafone was quick to respond: “Yeah @Idea. It’s time we made it official"", and gave out the new website address of the joint entity.

Another thousand-point milestone is within reach for India’s benchmark equity index. Following the drubbing earlier this year, the S&P BSE Sensex is nearing the 39,000 level, the gauge’s third round-number mark since surpassing its life-time peak two months ago - a rally that’s helped the gauge cement the tag of Asia’s best performer this year. 
Another thousand-point milestone is within reach for India’s benchmark equity index. Following the drubbing earlier this year, the S&P BSE Sensex is nearing the 39,000 level, the gauge’s third round-number mark since surpassing its life-time peak two months ago - a rally that’s helped the gauge cement the tag of Asia’s best performer this year.
While there’s optimism that economic growth topping 8 percent will help power equities higher in the coming months, lingering external risks, most notably from the price of oil - and its impact on the rupee - and stretched valuations is giving some investors a pause.
“Markets have run up a lot and there’s certainly an element of risk when this happens - it is never easy to buy in such times,"" said Sunil Sharma, who oversees $1 billion of assets as chief investment officer at Sanctum Wealth Management Pvt. in Mumbai. “There are short-term fears like oil prices that may lead to a correction, though the economy remains on a firm footing.""
Gross domestic product expanded 8.2 percent in the June quarter from a year earlier, the government said after market hours on Friday. That was faster than the 7.6 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 42 economists.
The beat isn’t prompting investors and analysts to sound the all-clear for Indian equities just yet. Here is why:
Valuations
The Sensex trades at an estimated price-earnings ratio of about 21, the steepest among equity benchmarks in the region after New Zealand. Despite the selloff in mid-cap stocks, the one-year forward PE ratio for the Nifty Midcap 100 Index is still at a premium to the Nifty gauge of India’s top 50 companies, signaling higher growth expectations for smaller firms are priced in, UBS Securities India Pvt. said in a report last week.
Earnings Growth
About three-fourths of 50 Nifty members reported results that either beat or met earnings estimates in the June quarter, the highest proportion in at least three quarters, according to calculations by Bloomberg Quint. The “upcycle could be quite significant, a contrast to most parts of the world"" as the share of corporate profits in India’s GDP is close to all-time lows, according to Morgan Stanley. For now, the rally has outpaced the outlook for profit growth, with UBS saying consensus earnings for Nifty are likely to be cut 7-8 percent.
Premium Soars
While Indian equities have traditionally traded at a premium to Asian peers because of the nation’s potential for faster economic growth, the valuation gap between MSCI India Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index has widened to the highest in a decade, Citigroup Inc. said in an 20 August note. Global uncertainties and rich valuations before a general election next year are “enough reasons to be cautious in equities,"" the bank said.
Lopsided Rally
While the benchmark indexes hit multiple records in August, gains have been uneven. The Sensex’s 13.5 percent year-to-date climb has been dominated by three stocks - Reliance Industries Ltd., Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Infosys Ltd. About three-quarters of the 30 Sensex stocks are trading higher than their 200-day moving average, compared with 94 percent in January when the gauge peaked.
Fund Flows Moderate
Persistent buying my domestic equity mutual funds has time and again provided a buffer against foreign outflows. Domestic funds bought $10.8 billion of shares this year, outweighing $283 million of withdrawals by their global peers. Still, retail flows to stock funds have slowed recently, averaging about  ₹ 10,000 crore a month from  ₹ 14,000 crore to  ₹ 15,000 crore at the start of the year, according to Citigroup.
Costly Oil
Moody’s Investors Service last week said India, the world’s fastest-growing oil user, risks missing budget targets because of higher oil prices. While elevated crude prices stoke inflation, a spike also weakens the rupee, which causes foreigners to sell Indian assets. It’s a vicious cycle. The currency fell past an unprecedented 71 per dollar on Friday.
“The biggest risk is from macros like oil and the rupee. If the oil goes above $80-82 range and the rupee declines to 73-75 range, it will create problems for the economy, which will result in postponement of FDI and FII flows,"" said G. Chokkalingam, managing director at Equinomics Research & Advisory Pvt. in Mumbai. “The whole spiral starts playing out."""

While Reliance Jio’s entry helped the two companies decide on a merger about 18 months ago, its continued aggression has meant the merged entity is in a far more precarious position than anyone had envisaged at the time of the merger announcement. 
Back then, the two companies had reported a combined Ebitda of  ₹  24,400 crore for the 12 months till December 2016. Profit fell to  ₹  10,700 crore in the 12 months till June 2018, Vodafone Idea Ltd reported last week. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
And while Vodafone Idea leads the industry by a huge margin in terms of revenue and subscribers, the picture is quite different when it comes to profitability and leverage ratios. Its trailing 12-month Ebitda, for instance, was 20% lower than that of Bharti Airtel Ltd’s India wireless business, even though its revenues were 33% higher.
Analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd estimate that the combined entity’s annualized profit stood at merely  ₹  7,270 crore in the June quarter. Vodafone Idea’s net debt, meanwhile, is about 15 times its profit. At the time of the merger announcement in March 2017, the net debt to Ebitda ratio was at roughly 4.4 times."

Mumbai: IDBI Bank Ltd has approached the dedicated bankruptcy court against Reliance Naval and Engineering Ltd for defaulting on loans totaling more than  ₹ 1,250 crore.  
Mumbai: IDBI Bank Ltd has approached the dedicated bankruptcy court against Reliance Naval and Engineering Ltd for defaulting on loans totaling more than  ₹ 1,250 crore. 
Reliance Naval, part of Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Group, is a private shipbuilder with licence and contracts to build warships.
The state-run bank has approached the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) against Reliance Naval to initiate a resolution process against the company.
Reliance Naval owes a total of  ₹ 5,349.17 crore to its lenders as on March 2018. 
“As per the valuation report of March 2018, the company’s net market value stood at  ₹ 1,880 crore while its fair market value by another valuer was around  ₹ 1,535 crore as on 21 May 2018,"" IDBI said in its petition.
Nishit Dhruva, managing partner of law firm MDP and Partners, who is representing IDBI Bank, confirmed the filing of the petition but declined to elaborate.
IDBI Bank and Reliance Naval did not respond to emails seeking comment.
According to the petition, Reliance Naval is facing financial stress due to a downtrend in commercial shipbuilding sector, cancellation of contracts and cost overrun of dry dock-2 project under construction.
Reliance Naval, which is controlled by Reliance Infrastructure Ltd, was previously known as Reliance Defence and Engineering Ltd. 
On 4 March 2015, Reliance Defence Systems, a unit of Reliance Infrastructure Ltd, acquired Pipavav Defence—then the country’s largest shipyard with a licence to build warships—and rechristened it.
A group of lenders led by IDBI Bank has been trying to restructure debt on the books of Reliance Naval ever since it acquired debt-laden Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering, which was undergoing restructuring under the corporate debt restructuring (CDR) scheme.
In 2017, the lenders gave their nod to Reliance Naval’s CDR exit plan with a longer maturity period for loans of about  ₹ 6,800 crore. It even gave its go-ahead for implementing a refinancing scheme.
The company was however declared a non-performing asset in February this year after the Reserve Bank of India introduced a framework for stressed asset resolution.
Reliance Naval was also in discussions with lenders for a one-time settlement but lack of a resolution led the lenders to proceed with insolvency proceedings.
Reliance Naval’s consolidated loss almost doubled in the last financial year to  ₹ 1,011.97 crore from  ₹ 577.22 crore in the previous year. Net sales fell 33% to  ₹ 378.48 crore at the end of March 2018.

New Delhi: Seven of the 10 most valued Indian companies suffered an erosion of  ₹ 75,684.33 crore from their market valuation last week, with FMCG major HUL taking the steepest hit.

New Delhi: The sharp depreciation in rupee’s valuation is unlikely to impact India’s sovereign credit profile as rupee-denominated government bonds and robust foreign exchange reserves mitigate the risk, William Foster, vice president—Sovereign Risk Group—at Moody’s Investors Service told Mint today. 
New Delhi: The sharp depreciation in rupee’s valuation is unlikely to impact India’s sovereign credit profile as rupee-denominated government bonds and robust foreign exchange reserves mitigate the risk, William Foster, vice president—Sovereign Risk Group—at Moody’s Investors Service told Mint today.
“The impact of rupee depreciation on India’s sovereign credit profile is mitigated by the currency composition of government debt and foreign exchange reserve buffers. The government relies nearly entirely on local currency-denominated financing, with under 4% of its debt denominated in foreign currency compared to a median of 37% for BAA-rated sovereigns,"" Foster, who is Moody’s India sovereign analyst, said in an email response to Mint’s queries.
Recent heightened investor risk aversion across emerging markets and the widening of India’s current account deficit to 2.4% of GDP in the June quarter—driven by higher oil prices and robust non-oil import demand—have contributed to the rupee’s 13% fall since the beginning of 2018, making it the worst performing emerging market currency.
A Standard and Poor’s spokesperson refused to comment on the developing situation. Both Moody’s and S&P refused to comment on the timing of India’s next ratings review.
S&P has assigned the lowest investment grade of BBB– for India, with a stable outlook, citing a sizeable fiscal deficit, high general government debt and low per capita income.
Moody’s last year raised India’s sovereign rating from the lowest investment grade of Baa3 to Baa2, and changed the outlook to “stable"" from “positive"", on expectations that the government’s continued focus on economic and institutional reforms will—over time—enhance India’s high growth potential.
Additionally, S&P—in a 16 July report—said downward pressure on its India ratings is possible if (1) GDP growth disappoints; (2) net general government deficits rose significantly; or (3) the political will to maintain India’s reform agenda significantly lost momentum.
“Upward pressure on the ratings could build if government reforms markedly improve its net general government fiscal out-turns and so reduce the level of net general government debt. Upward pressure could also build if India’s external accounts strengthen significantly,"" it added.
According to Moody’s Foster, India’s External Vulnerability Indicator (EVI) at 65% is also relatively low compared to other large emerging markets and Baa-rated peers. “Although foreign currency reserves, at around $375 billion as of mid-August 2018 are off their peak, they remain significantly higher than the $247-$258 billion seen in 2013. This large foreign currency reserve buffer provides additional policy space and flexibility for RBI to manage external shocks and reduce the risk of sustained and large portfolio outflows and pressure on the currency,"" Foster said.
External Vulnerability Indicator indicates a country’s capacity to meet its external debt obligations over the next year (accounting for potential withdrawals of non-resident deposits) with existing foreign reserves.
On India’s growth outlook, Foster said despite external headwinds from higher oil prices and rising interest rates, growth prospects remain generally in line with the economy’s potential. “We expect India’s real GDP to remain on course to grow by about 7.5% in 2018 and 2019. Growth is supported by strong urban and rural demand and improved industrial activity. The increase in minimum support prices (MSPs) for kharif crops, should help support rural demand,"" he added.
ALSO READ | Global funds dump Indian bonds at fastest pace in four months
On India’s fiscal position, Foster said, higher oil prices add to short-term pressures, following cuts in the goods and services tax (GST) on some items and relatively high increases in MSPs for some crops. “We see risks that the central government fiscal deficit will be wider than budgeted. However, temporary fiscal slippage, if any, will not offset robust nominal GDP growth and a large domestic financing base that will keep the government’s debt burden broadly stable,"" he added.
India targets to bring down fiscal deficit to 3.3% of GDP in 2018-19 from 3.5% of GDP a year ago."

A consortium of handset maker Micromax and telecom major Reliance Jio has bagged a  ₹  1,500 crore order from the Chhattisgarh government to distribute 50 lakh smartphones to women and students in the state. 
A consortium of handset maker Micromax and telecom major Reliance Jio has bagged a  ₹  1,500 crore order from the Chhattisgarh government to distribute 50 lakh smartphones to women and students in the state.
Under the project, 45 lakh smartphones are being given to women and the remaining will be distributed to college students in the state, Micromax co-founder Vikas Jain told PTI.
“About 10,000 camps are being organised under the project and deliveries have already started. Every beneficiary, chosen by the state government, is handed the device personally after activating it with Reliance Jio connection. The authentication of the beneficiary is done using Aadhaar,"" he said. 
Jain said the project covered a large part of the population and the company reserved space in 15 warehouses across the state to ensure timely distribution of the handsets to people. Chhattisgarh had a population of over 2.5 crore as per the 2011 census. The deal was signed earlier this year with distribution starting end of July. 
“For carrying out the project, we hired about 2,000-2,500 temporary staff... We expect to complete deliveries to all beneficiaries in the next few weeks,"" he added. 
Jain explained that the project “doesn’t appear to be politically motivated"", given that it has taken months of planning and execution for all involved parties. 
The project was given through a tender process. 
“Micromax has partnered with Chhattisgarh government in launching the Sanchar Kranti Yojana (SKY)... Their commitment towards SKY initiative has helped us reach out to women of urban BPL families, rural house and youth consumers by providing them a worthwhile digital experience through their smartphones,"" Chhattisgarh Infotech Promotion Society CEO Alex Paul Menon said. 
He added that the initiative will help make Chhattisgarh a digitally empowered state. The devices being given to women have a configuration of 4-inch display, 1GB RAM/8GB internal memory, while the handsets given to students feature a 5-inch display and 2GB RAM/16GB internal memory. 
“The SKY project is a key development initiative to deliver digital inclusion, e-Governance and faster economic development in Chhattisgarh. Jio is happy to be a part of this digital initiative to connect the unconnected,"" a Reliance Jio spokesperson said. 
The beneficiaries will receive 1GB 4G data, 100 minutes voice calls and 100 SMS per month for six months, following which they will be offered tariff plans that are most affordable and competitively priced."

Mumbai: Reliance Power (RPower) is looking at inorganic expansion by buying stressed thermal power projects under resolution under the insolvency and bankruptcy code, said Reliance Group chairman Anil Ambani at the company’s annual general meeting (AGM) today. 
Mumbai: Reliance Power (RPower) is looking at inorganic expansion by buying stressed thermal power projects under resolution under the insolvency and bankruptcy code, said Reliance Group chairman Anil Ambani at the company’s annual general meeting (AGM) today.
Thirty-four stressed power projects account for about  ₹  1.74 trillion of the  ₹  10.3 trillion non-performing assets (NPAs) in the Indian banking system. A few of these power plants have been declared bankrupt by their lenders and can be bought out by interested parties under a competitive bidding process.
Given the precarious positioning of the domestic thermal power sector, Ambani said the company’s key growth paths going forward would be in undertaking operational and maintenance contracts of stressed power projects and expanding the mine development operations business.
Reliance Power operates three coal-based power plants in Sasan (Madhya Pradesh), Rosa (Uttar Pradesh) and Butibori (Maharashtra).
On Tuesday, Reliance Power shares fell 4.44%, or  ₹  1.55, to  ₹  33.35 on the BSE, tracking the benchmark Sensex that lost 0.78%, or 294.84 points, to end the day at 37,290.67 points."

Mumbai: Reliance Communications Ltd will completely exit the telecom business to concentrate on real estate in future, said Reliance Group chairman Anil Ambani at the company’s annual general meeting (AGM) today. RCom’s first priority is to resolve its over  ₹  40,000 crore debt, he added.
“We have decided that we will not proceed in this sector. And many other companies have taken a similar call. This is very much a writing on the wall... As we have moved out of the mobile sector, we will monetise at an appropriate stage our enterprise business,"" Ambani said.
“Reliance Realty will be the engine of growth for the future of this company,"" Ambani said.
Reliance Realty, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RCom will develop Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City in Navi Mumbai. said Ambani, adding that it is an already registered IT and fintech park. The company has 3 million sq. ft of built-up space, which will be leased out to multinationals. The Reliance Group chairman expects revenue accruals through it this year itself, pegging the potential value creation at the site at  ₹  25,000 crore.
According to Ambani, RCom will serve 35,000 businesses through enterprise, data centres, undersea cables and international voice calling verticals and will get half of its revenues from abroad. The company is “committed"" to exit these verticals as well to pay off bank debt and will take a call on the same at an appropriate time.
At the RCom AGM, Ambani also thanked his elder brother and Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambani, whose telecom venture—Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd—bought RCom assets. “It would be most appropriate for me to thank and acknowledge the support (and) guidance extended to RCom, and me personally, by my brother Mukeshbhai Ambani,"" Ambani told shareholders.
Speaking of RCom’s debt, Ambani said he is confident of getting a resolution in the next few months, and added that other monetisation measures, including sale of telecom infrastructure and fibre to Reliance Jio, are at an advanced stage of closure. The company is awaiting final approvals for spectrum-sharing and trading from the department of telecommunications.
Some of the shareholders appreciated efforts taken by RCom to service its debt, but a few were critical as well. When one such shareholder persisted, a company official patted him on the back, probably pointing to the time constraints. When he complained, Anil Ambani said this is a pat and not a stab, and asked him to continue with the question.
But the mention of the controversy surrounding the Rafale fighter jet deal prompted Ambani to stop him from speaking further. “Shaileshbhai, who is a very educated person and comes with non-facts, half-baked facts, untruth, lies, is in my father’s words, a true well-wisher of all of you. I do respect, in a democratic world, his comments. But none of them have any relevance to what is in front of us today as a company and for all of you shareholders,"" Ambani said."

New Delhi: India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani plans to build Reliance Jio Hubs, a one-stop shop for all consumer items sold by Reliance Industries Ltd and its units ranging from electronics to groceries, to provide people living in small towns their first mall-like shopping experience. The aim is to leverage the strengths of units Reliance Retail Ltd’s physical stores and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s digital infrastructure to boost sales in smaller towns, which have largely been untouched by modern retail and online shopping. 
New Delhi: India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani plans to build Reliance Jio Hubs, a one-stop shop for all consumer items sold by Reliance Industries Ltd and its units ranging from electronics to groceries, to provide people living in small towns their first mall-like shopping experience. The aim is to leverage the strengths of units Reliance Retail Ltd’s physical stores and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s digital infrastructure to boost sales in smaller towns, which have largely been untouched by modern retail and online shopping.
Reliance Jio Hubs is the biggest focus area for the company after Jio GigaFiber broadband services, a person familiar with the development said, requesting anonymity. The Jio Hubs project is in line with Ambani’s vision to bring together telecom, retail and e-commerce to become a technology platform.
“It is the chairman’s (Ambani’s) pet project. The company has realized that it has to reach small towns to get big volumes,"" the person said.
At Reliance Industries’ annual general meeting on 5 July, Ambani said: “We see our biggest growth opportunity in creating a hybrid, online-to-offline new commerce platform.""
“Small towns need assisted e-commerce and the comfort of a physical space where after-sales service is also available,"" said a retail sector analyst, requesting anonymity.
“Reliance Jio Hubs could showcase what is available and act like experience centres. Most importantly, these hubs could also hold inventory and act as warehouses as it satisfies the 100% India owned requirement under the draft e-commerce policy.""
Under the draft e-commerce policy floated by the government last month, only Indian-owned firms will be allowed to hold inventory.
“The company plans to set up close to 800 such Reliance Jio Hubs which will sell all consumer items under Reliance. The investment required for setting these up will be finalized within a month,"" the person cited above said.
The plan to reach local markets, know local merchants and local customers assumes significance given a large chunk of Indian population still shops offline.
The online retail market in India has more than tripled since 2015, but it is only expected to contribute to 2.9% of the total retail sales in 2018, a June report by researcher eMarketer said.
Reliance already has a formidable physical presence in the country with 7,500 stores across 4,400 cities under its subsidiary Reliance Retail. This arm sells grocery, electronics, jewellery and clothes under Reliance Fresh, Reliance Digital, Reliance Jewels, Reliance Trends, among other brands.
It also has close to 5,000 Jio Points, which are small 500 sq. ft offices in semi-urban and rural pockets, offering after-sales services and customer assistance.
Jio Hubs, on the other hand, would be spread across a much larger area and would capitalize on brand Jio which already enjoys a mass-market appeal and good market share in rural markets given its 4G coverage.
“Jio is doing especially well in the rural markets (category B and C circles) because incumbents lag Jio in 4G coverage and also due to the success of JioPhone which has sold 25 million devices by June 2018,"" a 27 August research note by BNP Paribas said.
RIL, with a wireless subscriber base of over 215 million, is also gearing up to commercially roll out Jio GigaFiber through which it aims to offer high-speed home broadband to 50 million homes.
“We forecast Jio’s subscriber base to rise above 400 million by March 2020. This equates to almost 45% of India’s population in the age of 14-80 years. Under ‘Reliance’s grand plan’, these may not be seen as mere telecom subscribers but as ready customers to get revenue/profit from other sources like ads, retail sales, services and content,"" a 6 September report by CLSA said.
An email query sent to Reliance Jio was unanswered till press time."

HDFC Asset Management Co Ltd declined 7.6% to  ₹ 1,422 a share. HDFC Asset Management Co Ltd declined 7.6% to  ₹ 1,422 a share. The stock got listed on 6 August and since then it gained over 28% from its issue price of  ₹ 1,100. 
Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd (RNAM) slumped 8.2% to  ₹ 196.55 a share. The stock was listed in November 2017 and has fallen nearly 22% since then from its issue price of  ₹ 252 a share. 
Sebi on Tuesday capped the total expense ratio (TER) for equity-oriented mutual fund schemes (close-ended and interval schemes) at 1.25% and for other schemes at 1%. The cap for fund of funds will be 2.25% for equity-oriented schemes and 2% for other schemes.
“(This) will have a direct negative impact on overall revenue yields for most AMCs. What the recent rise in assets under management, this will lead to further pressure yields,"" said Emkay Research in a note to its investors.
Sebi said all mutual fund commissions and expenses must be paid from the scheme itself, adding that the industry must adopt a full trail model of commission in all schemes without paying any upfront commission. Trail commissions are payments earned by distributors as long as investors stay invested in the scheme.
Brokerage firm Morgan Stanley has cut its equity gross revenue assumption by 20 basis points. “We assume 6 bps to be the overall savings in distribution costs, as some hit will likely be passed on to distributors. This will be the one of the key variables in determining upside or downside to our earnings forecasts,"" Morgan Stanley added.

Nomura Research has downgraded the Reliance Nippon scrip to ‘neutral’ from ‘buy’ and cut its price target to  ₹ 210 a share from  ₹ 315 a share.
“We expect Reliance Nippon to maintain strong position in the business and incrementally benefit from its efforts to penetrate the B15 and B30 locations. Considering overall pressure on yields, we are reducing our revenue estimates by 1.4% for FY20E resulting in an earnings decline of 3.2%,"" Emkay Research added."

Mumbai/New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, Sterlite Technologies Ltd and two investment firms have bid to separately purchase assets of Aircel Ltd, but lenders to the bankrupt telecom operator may still have to take a large haircut. Lenders to Aircel are, however, keen on a lump sum sale to a single party as it believes such a move would lead to the best outcome, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Both declined to be named. 
Mumbai/New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, Sterlite Technologies Ltd and two investment firms have bid to separately purchase assets of Aircel Ltd, but lenders to the bankrupt telecom operator may still have to take a large haircut. Lenders to Aircel are, however, keen on a lump sum sale to a single party as it believes such a move would lead to the best outcome, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Both declined to be named.
“The bids have been received. But we are thinking of the possibility of a lump sum sale, that is, give all of the assets to a single party. This should get better value for the assets,"" said one of the two people cited before. “In a couple of days, these talks should happen. We are hoping to get over  ₹ 25,000 crore from asset sale proceeds."" 
Aircel Cellular Ltd and Dishnet Wireless Ltd, together known as Aircel, owe about  ₹ 50,000 crore to creditors. The companies owe  ₹ 15,545 crore to financial creditors, and about  ₹ 35,000 crore to operational creditors. Bids for the assets closed on Monday.
Hammered by intense competition in the domestic telecom market, Aircel’s woes multiplied with the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in September 2016 with free calls and cheap data. 
Things turned sour last October when Reliance Communications called off plans to merge its wireless business with Aircel, citing legal and regulatory uncertainties, as well as “intervention of vested interests to derail the deal"".
In February, Aircel filed for insolvency, citing high unsustainable debt and increased losses.
Aircel holds 65 MHz spectrum in the 2,100 MHz band, 103 MHz spectrum in the 1,800 MHz band, and 21 MHz spectrum in the 900 MHz band. Details of other assets such as fibre and towers could not be ascertained immediately.
The assets, including spectrum licences and fibre, are valued at about  ₹ 32,362 crore, Aircel’s lawyer said on 9 March.
A potential raising of more than  ₹ 25,000 crore from the sale of Aircel’s assets would lead to a massive haircut to its lenders such as State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and Bank of Baroda.
India’s second-largest telecom operator, Bharti Airtel, is the sole bidder for Aircel’s spectrum assets, while Jio is the sole bidder for the telecom towers, said the second person.
The person added that Jio is also in the fray for Aircel’s fibre assets, along with Anil Agarwal-promoted Sterlite Industries, private equity firm I Squared Capital, and distressed asset fund Aion Capital.
Sterlite denied placing a bid for Aircel’s fibre assets. Jio, Airtel and I Squared Capital did not respond to queries till press time. Aion Capital declined to comment.
“Deloitte is very happy with the outcome, which exceeded everyone’s expectations. We will know final decisions on winners probably in four weeks’ time... the bids were being opened on Wednesday,"" the second person said.
Vijay Kumar Iyer of Deloitte, who has been nominated as the interim resolution professional, didn’t respond to calls.
Airtel, currently the sole bidder for spectrum, had in April 2016, announced buying spectrum worth  ₹ 3,500 crore from Aircel in eight telecom circles: Tamil Nadu (including Chennai), Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir, West Bengal, Assam, the North-East, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh.
In 2010, Aircel sold 17,500 towers and 21,000 tenancies to Chennai Network Infrastructure Ltd, a unit of GTL Infrastructure Ltd, for  ₹ 8,000 crore."

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd has identified two new areas—healthcare and education—around which it plans to build content apart from sharpening focus on regional music and videos on its platform as it braces for a long battle with rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. Airtel expects the current round of battle will centre around content as cut-rate data tariffs have ceased to provide a meaningful competitive edge in the hyper-intensive telecom industry. 
New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd has identified two new areas—healthcare and education—around which it plans to build content apart from sharpening focus on regional music and videos on its platform as it braces for a long battle with rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. Airtel expects the current round of battle will centre around content as cut-rate data tariffs have ceased to provide a meaningful competitive edge in the hyper-intensive telecom industry.
While Reliance Jio aims to focus on producing in-house web series and shows for its subscribers, Airtel is forging partnerships with content producers Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar, Sony LIV and ZEE5, among others.
“We don’t believe in controlling the entire value chain end-to-end... There are a bunch of partnerships that we have got done which are exclusive to us...on the video side, we want to stay away from producing content,"" Sameer Batra, chief executive officer, content and apps, Bharti Airtel, said in an interview.
With regional content doing well on its platform, Bharti Airtel plans to increase these offerings to users to boost data usage. The company aims to bank on its machine learning and data science capabilities to spot trends and customise its offerings.
“Customers are very different across areas. For example, you would think that Hindi music is popular in Delhi. We are finding that Bhojpuri and Haryanvi music is very big in Delhi,"" he said.
The company has already inked a couple of partnerships to enhance regional content. It has partnered with Kolkata-based Shree Venkatesh Films to bring a large catalogue of Bengali content on Airtel TV, apart from signing up Marathi folk singer and Indian Idol season one contestant Prajakta Shukre to release six music tracks for Airtel’s music app Wynk Music.
“We are also talking to a team which has a huge catalogue of Nepali films, apart from planning a couple of partnerships for content to cater to the youth. We are also on the verge of closing a deal with global music label Orchard to add to our South Korean pop music category,"" Batra said.
Driving data usage through content is key for Bharti Airtel. In April-June, Reliance Jio reported 10.6 GB average data consumption per user per month while for Bharti Airtel this was 7.8 GB.
“Apart from music and video, we will get into one or two more key areas of interest and build the portfolio in a manner that we think is consistent with our ability to get scale and more importantly lock customers down. Healthcare and education are two areas which we are studying at the moment quite deeply,"" Batra said.
Reliance Jio also sees opportunities in sectors such as healthcare and education sector where offerings can ride on its telecom pipe. It has also made a string of acquisitions targeted at the content space. —in March, the company announced an integration with music app Saavn for its digital music service JioMusic and in February, Reliance Industries announced that it would buy a 5% stake in filmmaker Eros International Plc.
Monetising content is the big challenge not just for Airtel, but all telecom firms, especially at the current environment of suppressed tariffs. However, Airtel thinks it is too early to worry about monetisation.
“We have seen that if we are able to lock customers down to more digital products, their relative stickiness to Airtel goes up... Music, we have started to monetise at a decent scale. We are trying a few experiments on advertising etc. Right now, the objective is to get pretty much everybody with a smartphone have one of our digital properties,"" Batra said."

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has shuttered its only oilfield (MA field) in the D6 block in the Krishna Godavari (KG) basin due to lack of any production. 
Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has shuttered its only oilfield (MA field) in the D6 block in the Krishna Godavari (KG) basin due to lack of any production.
“This is to inform that MA (D26) field in block KG-DWN-98/3 (KGD6), which is being operated by RIL as an operator of the joint venture consisting of RIL (60%), BP (30%) and NIKO (10%), has ceased production on 17 September 2018. Post-cessation activities related to safe shutdown of the field are underway,"" RIL informed the stock exchanges on Friday.
Production from the field had been in natural decline and was facing continuous challenges because of high water production and sand ingress. 
The field has cumulatively produced about 0.53 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of gas and 31.4 million barrels of oil and condensate and has no remaining reserves.
The fields were predicted to last a minimum 15 years but have been exhausted in less than a decade. In April-June 2018-19, the MA field contributed less than 0.1% in terms of revenue at the consolidated level, RIL said. 
The Dhirubhai-26 (D26), oil, gas and condensate deepwater discovery was made in 2006. 
This was India’s first deepwater development, entailing a water depth of up to 1,250 metres.
“Relevant governmental agencies have already been informed,"" RIL said in its notice. 
The company had made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the KG basin, of which D26 or MA—the only oil discovery—was the first to begin production in September 2008. The Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) gas fields went on-stream in April 2009.
The field had in the first month produced 39,976 tonnes of crude oil, peaking at 1,08,418 tonnes in May 2010. Output, however, has been declining since and it produced 0.14 million barrels in the April-June quarter this year. 
Sand and water ingress has forced the shutting down of well after well. The D1 and D3 fields, too, had a peak in March 2010 when their combined output touched 61.4 mmscmd. Production has since declined. The KG-D6 output in April-June averaged at 4.7 mmscmd. It comprised production from the D1 and D3 fields and the MA field.
RIL, along with its partner BP Plc, is now developing three sets of discoveries—R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ fields—in the KG-D6 block at a cost of  ₹ 40,000 crore. These fields are expected to bring peak output of 30-35 mmscmd, with gas set to flow from 2020."

New Delhi: The controversy over India’s purchase of Rafale fighter jets under a deal with the French government took a new turn on Friday with a French journal quoting former president François Hollande as saying that Dassault Aviation was given no choice but to partner Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group for the offset clause in the deal, according to an ANI report. 
New Delhi: The controversy over India’s purchase of Rafale fighter jets under a deal with the French government took a new turn on Friday with a French journal quoting former president François Hollande as saying that Dassault Aviation was given no choice but to partner Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group for the offset clause in the deal, according to an ANI report.
Ambani-controlled Reliance Infrastructure Ltd has a 51:49 joint venture with Dassault—the maker of Rafale—called Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd (DRAL), which has an offset contract of about  ₹ 30,000 crore for 36 Rafale aircraft. Under an offset policy, foreign companies selling goods to the Indian government or state-run firms are made to source part of the supplies locally.
India quickly responded, saying that neither its government nor the French government had any say in what it called a commercial decision. French journal Mediapart said, quoting Hollande in an interview, that it was India that proposed Reliance’s name and Dassault had no choice but to take the company given to it, news agency ANI said. French journalist Julien Bouissou tweeted parts of the interview that was done in French.
“We did not have a say in that. The Indian government proposed this service group and Dassault negotiated with Ambani. We did not have a choice, we took the interlocutor we were given,"" ANI quoted Hollande as saying.
The report drew a response from India’s defence ministry in the evening. “The report referring to former French President Mr Hollande’s statement that the government of India insisted upon a particular firm as offset partner for Dassault Aviation in Rafale is being verified. It is reiterated that neither the government of India nor the French government had any say in the commercial decision,"" it tweeted.
Reliance Group did not respond to an email seeking comment.
The purchase of the 36 Rafale jets, which are slated to be inducted into the Indian Air Force from September 2019, has been in the eye of a storm with the Congress questioning the price and the choice of Reliance as the offset partner.
Hollande’s reported statement contradicts India’s claim that the deal between Dassault and Reliance was a commercial pact between two private parties and the government had nothing to do with it.
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in the Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case."

And, with a new partner in Reliance Jio, we will have even more opportunities to raise the bar for cricket fans.""
In April, Star India retained the television broadcast and digital rights for all domestic cricket under BCCI for the next five years at a whopping  ₹  6,138.1 crore. This win effectively established Star India’s monopoly over all cricket media rights, including the Indian Premier League (IPL), which it won for  ₹  16,347.50 crore (around $2.55 billion) in September 2017."

Dassault Aviation has clarified that the 2016 contract for 36 Rafale aircraft sale to India was a government to government deal, which provided for a separate contract in which Dassault Aviation committed for making compensation investments (offsets) in India worth half the value of the purchase. 
Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd (DRAL) has an offset contract of around  ₹ 30,000 crore for 36 Rafale aircraft. Under an offset policy, foreign companies selling goods to the Indian government or state-run firms are made to source part of the supplies locally.
“This offsets contract is delivered in compliance with the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) 2016 regulations. In this framework, and in accordance with the policy of ‘Make in India,’ Dassault Aviation has decided to partner India’s Reliance Group. This is Dassault Aviation’s choice, as CEO Eric Trappier had explained in an interview published in MINT newspaper on April 17, 2018,"" according to the statement from the French company uploaded on its website on Friday. France is three hours 30 minutes behind Indian time.
Mint had reported on 16 April quoting Trappier that the joint venture was Dassault’s choice, which it will continue with.
Dassault said the joint venture, DRAL, was created in February 2017 and a plant had been built in Nagpur for manufacturing parts for Falcon and Rafale aircraft. The Nagpur site was chosen because of the availability of land with direct access to an airport runway, an essential condition for aeronautic activities, said the statement from the French firm.
Dassault also said it has signed partnerships with other firms too. “Negotiations are ongoing with a hundred-odd other potential partners,"" the company said. The company was very proud that the Indian authorities had selected the Rafale fighter, it added.

United Nations: US President Donald Trump told Germany on Tuesday to follow Poland’s example and not rely on Russia for its energy supplies which could make it vulnerable to “extortion and intimidation"".
Russia’s Gazprom and its European partners are developing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, designed to double natural gas volumes pumped from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea, avoiding traditional transit route Ukraine.
“Reliance on a single foreign supplier can leave nations vulnerable to extortion and intimidation and that is why we congratulate European states such as Poland for leading construction of a Baltic pipeline so that nations are not dependent on Russia to meet their energy needs,"" Trump told the United Nations General Assembly.
“Germany will become totally dependent on Russian energy if it does not immediately change course.""
Most eastern Europe states and the United States argue the proposed pipeline could ultimately limit supply routes and the energy security of the European Union, as well as hurting Ukraine’s efforts to reform its economy as bypassing the country would deprive it of billions of dollars in gas transit fees.
While Berlin and Moscow have been at loggerheads since Russia’s annexation of Crimea four years ago, they share a common interest in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project."

Mumbai: Facebook’s WhatsApp is working closely with Reliance Jio to spread awareness of false messages, weeks after the Indian telecoms operator opened up the messaging service to tens of millions of customers using its cheap internet-enabled phone. 
Mumbai: Facebook’s WhatsApp is working closely with Reliance Jio to spread awareness of false messages, weeks after the Indian telecoms operator opened up the messaging service to tens of millions of customers using its cheap internet-enabled phone.
Jio this month gave its more than 25 million JioPhone customers, many of them first-time internet users, access to WhatsApp at a time when the messaging service is battling false and incendiary texts and videos circulating on its platform.
Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, launched the JioPhone last year at a refundable deposit of  ₹ 1,500 ($20.60). The device is internet enabled but didn’t initially allow the use of WhatsApp or have several popular smartphone features.
All new users of the JioPhone get educational material that tells them about spotting a forwarded WhatsApp message and encourages them to share messages thoughtfully, WhatsApp spokesman Carl Woog told Reuters.
“We are working closely with Jio to continue our education campaign for WhatsApp users,"" Woog said.
In India’s smaller towns and villages, deep-seated prejudices, often based on caste and religion, and cut-price mobile data can aggravate the so-called fake news problem. Such regions are a key market for cheap devices such as the JioPhone.
More than 30 people have died this year in mob violence triggered by vitriolic messages on social media and WhatsApp, according to unofficial estimates, and police have previously told Reuters that minorities have been targeted in some remote and rural regions.
That has prompted New Delhi to call on WhatsApp to take immediate action to “end this menace"".
WhatsApp has already taken some steps to quell the rise of fake news. It has launched print and radio ad campaigns to educate users and introduced new features on the app including limiting message forwards as well as the labelling of forwarded messages.
It has also partnered with Digital Empowerment Foundation (DEF), a New Delhi-based non-profit organisation, to spread digital literacy in India’s towns and cities.
DEF will host a workshop in the eastern Indian city of Ranchi this week, WhatsApp’s Woog said.
WhatsApp also plans to expand its outreach programme to existing JioPhone users.
Reliance Jio did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
With more than 200 million users, India is a key market for WhatsApp but one where it has had to delay the official launch of its payments services due to the country’s push on data localisation.
WhatsApp is currently looking for an India chief and a policy head for the country.
It last month appointed a grievance officer for Indian users at its Menlo Park, California headquarters, like other global tech firms whose grievance officers sit outside of India.
India has, however, said it will toughen up its laws including pushing US tech giants to have their grievance officers in India."

According to news reports, Reliance Entertainment signed the pact with Gayet’s company just days ahead of Hollande arriving in India in 2016 and India and France signing a pact to acquire 36 Rafale fighter aircraft under a government to government deal. The movie deal was seen as a quid pro quo to Reliance Defence being identified as an offset partner in the 58,000 crore Rafale deal.
“Reliance Entertainment has not signed any agreement with Julie Gayet or her company, Rouge International… nor has any payment ever been made by Reliance Entertainment to either of them in relation to the film film ‘nOmber One’,"" a Reliance Entertainment company spokesman said in a statement.
The Congress has been attacking the government, alleging a scam in the scrapping of the earlier deal for 126 aircraft negotiated with the previous United Progressive Alliance government.
In its statement, Reliance Entertainment, which has financed over 50 international films, said it had “participated, through one of its partners, a French financing firm, Visvires Capital, in the film project involving famous French actor and director Serge Hazanavicius, and leading French actor  Kev Adams"".
“Reliance Entertainment has financed just 15% of the overall film budget, and paid only 1.48 million euros. The balance cost of the film budget has been financed to the extent of another 15% (on identical terms as Reliance) by a leading French investment firm, NJJ Capital, and the balance through sale of TV rights and pre-sales of global territories to a number of parties, tax credits, etc.,"" the statement said.
The payment of 1.48 million euros was made to Visvires Capital only “on December 5, 2017, as customary, about two weeks before the release of the film on December 20, 2017. “President Hollande had ceased to hold office in May 2017, more than six months prior to the said payment,"" the statement said. It said the company also received “300,000 euros from the French producer of the film for providing physical production services for extensive location shooting of the film in difficult mountainous terrain in Ladakh"".
“At around the same time, Visvires Capital also acquired for Reliance Entertainment the rights to remake a hugely popular and successful French movie, ‘La Famille Belier’, which is going into production in the year 2019.
“In addition, as announced in the year 2017, Reliance Entertainment is producing an Indo-French film, ‘The Interpreter’, starring Kev Adams, helmed by the famous Indian director, Vikas Behl (’Queen’, ‘Super 30’), which is at the scripting stage,"" the statement said.
“It is deeply shocking that, to serve narrow political interests, baseless allegations have been made by deliberately distorting facts and falsely attempting to co-relate a normal business course payment of a relatively small amount of 1.48 million euros to the supply of 36 fighter jets from France to India valued at nearly 8 billion euros,"" the statement added.
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case."

Around 306 new entrants were added to the list in the 2018 edition while 75 of those featured in 2017, didn’t make it to the present edition. 
There is a huge gap between the top ranks. Ambani’s wealth rose on the back of 47% increase of the share price of his flagship company, Reliance Industries. His wealth is more than the combined wealth of the next three: S.P. Hinduja, L.N. Mittal, and Azim Premji.
Ambani’s wealth increased by  ₹ 300 crore a day over the past year, backed by successful launch of Jio, and by the above average margins maintained by Reliance’s petrochemical business, tripled with a successful retail business foray have resulted in Reliance’s share price increasing by more than 47%.

580,2018-09-27,Reliance,"Reliance Communications Ltd is negotiating with two investors who are conducting due diligence.

Reliance Communications Ltd., the telecommunications company that’s offloading most of its assets to a rival, is in talks to sell a controlling stake in what will remain after it exits India’s consumer wireless business.
The company helmed by billionaire Anil Ambani is negotiating with two investors who are conducting due diligence, Bill Barney, chief executive officer of the company and its undersea cable unit Global Cloud Xchange Ltd., said Wednesday.
The undersea telecommunications cable system, data centers and business-to-business connectivity services will remain after the sale of airwaves, towers, underground fiber and transmission nodes to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., the wireless carrier controlled by Anil’s elder brother Mukesh Ambani. Once India’s No. 2 mobile-phone service, Rcom took on debt and lost market share amid a withering price war that eventually led to its exit and lawsuits from vendors, including a local unit of Ericsson AB, saying they hadn’t been paid.
The outcome of talks with the investors would be known in a “few months,"" Barney told reporters in Mumbai on Wednesday. He declined to provide a price or identify the investors beyond saying one was a consortium with four firms.
Anil Ambani’s Reliance conglomerate has been disposing other assets as well. Reliance Infrastructure Ltd. last month completed the sale of its Mumbai electric-power distribution assets, cutting total debt by about 66 percent.
RCom shares fell 2.3 percent to 12.6 rupees as of 11:22 a.m. in Mumbai, paring a 12 percent gain from Wednesday, and leaving its year-to-date decline at 65 percent.
Previous negotiations for a sale of Rcom’s undersea cable, data center and enterprise businesses didn’t lead to a transaction.
There were three bidders for the assets, Nomura Holdings Inc. said in June, citing management’s comments on an investor call. The company was also said to be in talks to sell GCX to China’s Citic Telecom International Holdings Ltd. for $500 million in 2014, though the deal eventually stalled after Citic got a new chief executive.

579,2018-09-28,Reliance,"In 'Sui Dhaaga' Varun Dhawan and Anushka Sharma lead from the front In Sharat Katariya's gentle celebration of self-reliance

Appalled by a scene of her husband’s public humiliation, Mamta (Anushka Sharma) prods the rather simple-minded Mauji (Varun Dhawan) to free himself from an abusive employer (a sewing machine showroom owner) and stand on his own feet. Almost immediately Mauji follows up on her encouragement to become a self-employed tailor. 
Appalled by a scene of her husband’s public humiliation, Mamta (Anushka Sharma) prods the rather simple-minded Mauji (Varun Dhawan) to free himself from an abusive employer (a sewing machine showroom owner) and stand on his own feet. Almost immediately Mauji follows up on her encouragement to become a self-employed tailor.
Mamta might have spent most of her life serving her husband and in-laws, but she is the brain in this enterprise. Without actually instructing Mauji directly, she gives him broad hints, nudging him in a direction, and then willingly takes her place on the backseat of the cycle.
Writer-director Sharat Katariya’s film is quite simply the story of a young couple that find the impetus and self-motivation to break out and take risks.
Along the way, his mother’s (an adorable Yamini Das) medical treatment not only provides Mauji with a business opportunity, but also exposes him to the vile ways of established businesses and opportunists. In spite of his risk-averse retired father’s (Raghuvir Yadav) opposition to the new initiative, Mamta and Mauji take the hard lessons and skepticism in their stride and move further towards self-reliance.
There are some strong messages in Sui Dhaaga, told without leaning on the tested Bollywood supports of melodrama, bombastic dialogue and expendable characters.
As Mauji sets out on his path of self-sufficiency and independence—gently prodded on by his Mamta, we see his shadow on the ground being joined by that of his wife—matching steps with him. A woman empowered without anyone having to say so in as many words.
The other message is of optimism. For all the challenges he faces -- be it a domineering and abusive employer or an ailing mother or a career under threat – Mauji takes the knocks on the chin, with a positive ‘all is well’ attitude.
The third theme is of self-reliance and community. It’s not an easy journey, but as the couple takes a leap into entrepreneurship, pitfalls and all, they find support from within the community, including the grumpy father who finally acknowledges that his cautious way may not be the only way.
Dhawan has perfected the template for playing a simpleton. He brings a similar naiveté to Mauji, albeit endearingly. Sharma lifts the film with an understated, strong performance. Her role is well defined and she slips into Mamta’s synthetic sarees with ease, expertly interpreting her character and balancing Dhawan’s eagerness.
The climax is a tad contrived with a fashion show format that conjures up stylish phrases such as ‘slow fashion’ and ‘sustainable fashion’.
Anil Mehta’s cinematography, costumes by Darshan Jalan and Neelanchal Kumar Ghosh and Meenal Agarwal’s production design bring alive Mamta and Mauji’s intimate little world. Notice Dinesh Master’s subtle choreography too.
With the pitch-perfect supporting cast, including Yadav, Yamini Das and Namit Das (as Guddu, the opportunistic relative), Katariya sets a rhythm that seldom slackens. Sui Dhaaga is a well-meaning, simply woven, feel-good entertainer that delivers as much as it promises."

Mumbai: Twelve years after being awarded the coal-bed methane block, Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group will soon begin test production from the block, according to two sources aware of the development.
The block is the group’s only coal-bed methane (CBM) gas block located in Sohagpur (North) Madhya Pradesh, and is held by Coastal Andhra Power Infrastructure Ltd promoted by Reliance Power.
“Drilling and production testing work of exploration phase-I has been completed in one of the CBM blocks. Phase-II pilot testing work is being planned in this block"" Reliance Power said in its annual report for 2018.
The company did not reply to an email sent last week.
The company was awarded four coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks in 2006, of which the company relinquished three due to bad prospects.
Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries (RIL) also holds two blocks in the Sohagpur block — Sohagpur East and West.
CBM is a natural gas stored or absorbed in coal seams and contains 90-95% methane.
“Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group had Geopetrol International Inc as their partner in their block but they bought them out. Now Reliance Group is the owner and operator of the block. The company had applied to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons for a change of operatorship. They could be producing shortly,"" a source said on the condition of anonymity.
The Sohagpur block covers around 609 sq km, and till March 2018, the Reliance Group spent  ₹ 61 lakh towards expenditure on survey and prospecting activities, according to the company’s 2018 annual report.
The Cabinet on 1 August approved a policy allowing operators to explore all unconventional hydrocarbons, including shale, coal-bed methane and hydrates, in existing fields. This means the exploration of unconventional hydrocarbons can be carried out under existing production sharing contracts, CBM contracts and nomination fields. Also, the Uniform Licensing Policy, at present applicable to the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) and Discovered Small Field (DSF) Policy, will be applicable to all operating fields.
Oil companies are boosting production of CBM since they are free to sell it at market prices. Natural gas price is currently capped at $3.06 per million metric British thermal unit (mmBtu), while CBM gas fetches $5.7-$10.64 per mmBtu.
Natural Gas prices, however, is likely to increase by over 14% to $3.5 mmBtu from October 1, since they are reviewed every six months based on average rates in nations such as the US, Russia and Canada.
Companies ramping up CBM output include RIL, Essar Oil Ltd, and Great Eastern Energy Corp. Ltd (GEECL). State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) has also begun test production from its CBM blocks in West Bengal.
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case."

New Delhi: Reliance Communications on Wednesday said it has got relief from the telecom tribunal and will now be able to complete its planned spectrum sale, whose proceeds will be used to make payments to Ericsson India and RITL minority investors. 
New Delhi: Reliance Communications on Wednesday said it has got relief from the telecom tribunal and will now be able to complete its planned spectrum sale, whose proceeds will be used to make payments to Ericsson India and RITL minority investors.
In a regulatory filing to the BSE, RCom said it will receive  ₹ 975 crore from the sale of spectrum, and it will pay Ericsson  ₹ 550 crore and RITL (Reliance Infratel) minority investors  ₹ 230 crore.
“Reliance Communications has been granted relief by the...Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) vide its interim order dated 1 October 2018, whereby...TDSAT has stayed the demand of bank guarantee of  ₹ 2,900 crore by the Department of Telecommunications,"" it said.
Anil Ambani-led RCom noted it had challenged the “unjustly sought security for the alleged demands"" by the telecom department with regard to spectrum usage charges. “After multiple hearings since August 28, 2018 the Hon’ble TDSAT, vide its interim order dated October 1, 2018 has stayed the said demand and directed DoT to expeditiously grant its approval for trading of the spectrum,"" RCom added.
The debt-laden firm pointed out that 38 secured lenders of the group had already approved the spectrum sale. “...and the proceeds thereof will be used for making payments to Ericsson India Private Limited and to RITL Minority Investors, as per settlement terms,"" it added.
The company on Tuesday said it had learnt that unsecured creditor Ericsson India had filed a contempt petition on 1 October in the Supreme Court, in relation to the settlement amount of  ₹ 550 crore to be paid by RCom. RCom had also stated that it filed an application on 28 September in the apex court, seeking 60 more days for making payment to the Swedish telecom equipment maker. That matter is slated for hearing on 4 October, it pointed out.
“The extension has been sought purely due to the fact that, as approved by 38 secured lenders, and as per RCom’s undertaking, Ericsson is to be paid from the sales proceeds of spectrum being traded by RCom, and such sale could not be completed as yet owing to factors beyond the control of RCom,"" according to the filing.
The company was at that time awaiting the copy of the order passed by TDSAT.
Last year, Reliance Communications (RCom) signed a pact with Reliance Jio for the sale of wireless spectrum, tower, fibre and media convergence nodes assets — the proceeds of which were to be used to pare debt. From that deal, RCom far announced the completion of the sale of optical fibre assets worth  ₹ 3,000 crore and sale of its media convergence nodes worth  ₹ 2,000 crore to Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio Infocomm.

574,2018-10-05,Reliance,"What's been different about the correction in the past few sessions is that market heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, TCS and the HDFC twins were also punished

Asian equities slipped on Thursday on worries that a stronger US economy will result in interest rate hikes, and make emerging market assets even less attractive for foreign investors. Investors in Indian equities have a lot more to worry about. Not that anything materially new has emerged in terms of information, but the liquidity squeeze has forced investors to finally acknowledge the cracks in the India story. For quite some time now, the markets have been afloat using either the “earnings aren’t growing, but the macro is great"" argument or its counterpart, “there are worries on the macro-economy, but earnings are growing"". 
Asian equities slipped on Thursday on worries that a stronger US economy will result in interest rate hikes, and make emerging market assets even less attractive for foreign investors. Investors in Indian equities have a lot more to worry about. Not that anything materially new has emerged in terms of information, but the liquidity squeeze has forced investors to finally acknowledge the cracks in the India story. For quite some time now, the markets have been afloat using either the “earnings aren’t growing, but the macro is great"" argument or its counterpart, “there are worries on the macro-economy, but earnings are growing"".
There is no place to hide now, with earnings being downgraded at the same time when macroeconomic worries, such as a widening current account deficit and the need to slow down the economy, are causing investors to flee. It’s the proverbial perfect storm.
The rupee hit a fresh low of 73.80 against the US dollar on Thursday, despite the government’s desperate measures to curb the currency’s free fall. In a double-whammy, the price of Brent crude rose to $86 per barrel. In short, the country’s current account deficit will worsen further.
Consequently, the yield on benchmark 10-year bonds hardened, adding to the panic in the equity market. Expectations that the Reserve Bank of India will adopt an aggressive monetary policy stance on Friday also eroded the risk appetite.
The fear gauge, National Stock Exchange’s India VIX (volatility index) rose 9.65% to an intraday high of 19.68. But it’s still far below its peak of 20.015 in February.
What’s been different about the correction in the past few sessions is that market heavyweights such as Reliance Industries Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and the HDFC twins were also punished. Earlier, a correction in other stocks would lead to a flight to safety in the above-mentioned counters. But this had resulted in bizarre valuations in sectors such as IT services and a few other stocks. As such, they were ripe for a correction. 
It’s interesting that the IT and pharmaceutical stocks were the biggest losers on Thursday, despite the continuing slide in the rupee. Finally, the markets seem to have given up silly props such as “buy shares of exporters whenever the rupee falls, regardless of where valuations are"".
Investors have also been forced to reckon with the fact that earnings are under pressure. Hopes of a revival in corporate earnings have dimmed, thanks to input cost pressures. Besides, worries of a liquidity crisis in the NBFC (non-banking financial company) sector still loom. Public sector banks are still struggling to get rid of their bad loan baggage. What’s more, subdued sales of automobiles in September could well mean that the consumption story is faltering.
While all of this has led to a much-needed reality check on Indian stocks, valuations of Indian equities remain expensive. As the chart shows, the one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of MSCI India Index is much higher than that of its Asian peers, excluding Japan. While the gap has narrowed a bit compared to early September, it remains wide. And the India VIX suggests there is a fair bit of complacency in the markets.
But given the rapidly deteriorating situation on the macroeconomic front, the downgrade in corporate earnings and the liquidity shock, it shouldn’t be surprising if the markets continue in correction mode."

572,2018-10-08,Reliance,"Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) increased prices of seven key petrochemicals by 10-21% in the second quarter of this fiscal year while the year-on-year increase is 17-61%

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) raised prices of at least seven key petrochemicals in the last quarter to offset higher crude oil prices and counter the effect of a weakening rupee. Bulk chemicals traders, suppliers for RIL’s petrochemical products and analysts tracking the company said it raised prices by 10-21% in the second quarter of this fiscal while year-on-year increase is 17-61%. 
Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) raised prices of at least seven key petrochemicals in the last quarter to offset higher crude oil prices and counter the effect of a weakening rupee. Bulk chemicals traders, suppliers for RIL’s petrochemical products and analysts tracking the company said it raised prices by 10-21% in the second quarter of this fiscal while year-on-year increase is 17-61%.
These products include purified terephthalic acid (PTA), monoethylene glycol (MEG), polyester staple fibre (PSF), partially oriented yarn (POY), polypropylene or high density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear alkyl benzene (LAB).
“Its more about the rupee decline and crude price which have increased petrochemicals prices in Asia. There is not much change in terms of demand-supply. Besides, RIL commands the highest premium in the Indian petrochemicals market. If you see pricing for RIL’s key products, it has been consistently going up in past three months,"" an analyst tracking RIL said on condition of anonymity.
Crude prices, which have been on the rise, are expected to touch $100 per barrel in a few months. The rupee, on the other hand, weakened further and settled at 73.76 against the dollar on Friday.
“Sustained, substantial increase in crude oil prices has pushed up petrochemical feedstock prices over the past few months. Geopolitical situation and expectation of a tighter oil market has further impacted the raw material cost. Globally, petrochemical producers have absorbed a part of the higher feedstock costs while pricing products,"" said RIL in an emailed reply.
Analysts tracking RIL said the firm raised PTA prices to  ₹  81,600 a tonne till September against  ₹  50,750 a tonne last September. This August, PTA prices were at  ₹  69,000 a tonne. Prices for HDPE has gone up 24% to  ₹  104,720 a tonne against September 2017.
PTA is a raw material used in making multi-purpose plastics. HDPE is used for packaging household and industrial chemicals such as detergents.
“RIL has been revising prices upwards for its products. And given RIL enjoys a monopolistic situation in petrochemicals manufacturing, we don’t have an option but to buy from RIL. There is no corresponding increase in demand but RIL has been raising prices,"" said a PTA trader operating out of Mumbai’s Crawford Market, adding he has been a PTA trader with RIL for nearly two decades.
RIL is among the top 10 producers for key petrochemicals. Last fiscal, the company saw revenue from the petrochemicals segment increase sharply by 35.5%  ₹  125,299 crore. Operating profit in the segment was up by 63% to its highest ever level of  ₹  21,179 crore.
Prices for PVC, or polyvinyl chloride, however, were cut last week. “RIL had been increasing PVC prices for the last six months despite a low demand. Last week, however, the company dropped the prices to  ₹  78 a kilo against  ₹  81-82 a kilo earlier. Despite the price reduction, demand has not picked up,"" said another chemical stockist who operates out of Masjid Bunder in South Mumbai.
PVC is one of the most widely used polymers in the world extensively used in industries, building, transport, packaging, electronics and healthcare applications.
“In India, despite depreciating rupee and increased crude prices, Reliance has actually reduced finished prices for all its products, net of raw material price increases, to safeguard its customers and maintain the consumer sentiments,"" the company added in the emailed response. 
Still, the July-September quarter earnings from petrochemicals for RIL look robust. “Earnings momentum is likely to remain strong, in our view. After 19-21% earnings per share growth over FY17-18, we expect stronger 33% growth in FY19F, driven by petchem,"" said Nomura Research in a 27 September report. 
In January, RIL commissioned its refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) complex of 1.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) capacity along with downstream plants and utilities, culminating its $16 billion refining and petrochemicals expansion plan that it embarked on in 2014.
Commissioning of the plant will help the refiner double ethylene capacity and enter the league of top five petrochemical producers globally, in addition to lowering its fuel cost and boosting profits. There are nearly 270 ethylene plants globally with a combined capacity of over 170mtpa. RIL’s combined ethylene capacity is now close to 4 mtpa at five of its manufacturing sites."
571,2018-10-12,Reliance,"Reliance Industries Ltd's (RIL's) gross refining margin (GRM), which was $12 per barrel in the September quarter of 2017-18, fell to $10.5 per barrel in the first quarter of 2018-19

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), which operates the world’s single largest oil refinery, likely earned less out of each barrel of crude oil it processed in the September quarter due to costlier oil and a weak rupee, said analysts. 
Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), which operates the world’s single largest oil refinery, likely earned less out of each barrel of crude oil it processed in the September quarter due to costlier oil and a weak rupee, said analysts.
RIL has traditionally enjoyed higher gross refining margins, or GRM—what a refiner earns by turning crude oil into final products—than the benchmark Singapore GRMs thanks to its technical prowess.
“We expect Reliance’s refining margin premium to soften with realized margins 50¢ lower at $10.0/bbl,"" Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a 7 October note.
RIL’s GRM, which was $12 per barrel in the September quarter of 2017-18, fell to $10.5 per barrel in the first quarter of this fiscal. In the September quarter, the benchmark Singapore Complex GRM rose from $6.0 to $6.2, led mainly by higher fuel oil cracks. RIL however does not produce fuel oil. RIL is currently in the silent period ahead of announcing its September quarter results on 17 October, when it is also expected to disclose the September quarter GRM.
RIL’s Jamnagar refinery which can process 1.24 million barrels of oil per day has for years enjoyed over $4-5 premium to benchmark Singapore refining margins. This was helped by RIL’s superior technology that can process heavier and cheaper varieties of crude oil to yield the same quality of products that other refiners can make only with light and more expensive crude.
Most of the products at Jamnagar are exported, except for some such as cooking gas.
“Over the past few quarters, refining GRMs have relatively moderated from $12/bbl in Q1/Q2FY18 to $10.5/bb in 1QFY19. Also, with higher oil prices, the fuel and losses and operating costs have likely increased, impacting realised earnings. However, there will be a partial-offset from the weak rupee,"" Nomura Research said in a 27 September note.
In the September quarter, the rupee fell 5.55% while crude oil prices rose 1.58%. On Thursday, rupee ended at 74.13 to a dollar, up 0.12%. Crude oil fell 1.53% and was trading at 81.80 per barrel.
However, with the International Maritime Organization regulations taking effect by 2020 and RIL’s own expansion of its core projects, its GRMs are expected to rise. 
“Assuming even a $5/bbl improvement in diesel oil cracks, with 40% diesel production, we think RIL’s GRM could easily increase by $2/bbl,"" according to Nomura. “As the IMO regulations are to be applied from Jan-2020, the full benefit of these will be seen in FY21."" 
Under regulations issued in October 2016 by the IMO, ships must shift to fuel oil with sulphur content below 0.5% January 2020, against the present 3.5%. RIL has already upgraded to these standards as part of its massive refinery expansion.
Fuel oil or furnace oil is a by-product of crude oil distillation. It is used in ships, and for steam boilers in power plants and in industrial plants. With the impending shift to low-sulphur fuel oil, demand for the same is expected to rise. 
RIL’s Jamnagar refinery’s profitability would also improve as it completes its petcoke gasification project which will help it meet its entire fuel requirement at the refineries and eliminate its petcoke production of 6.5 million tonnes a year, generated from two of its cokers.
The technology for petcoke gasification will help RIL produce 23 mscmd (million standard cubic metres a day) of syngas (synthetic gas) substituting its LNG (liquefied natural gas) imports."

Within two years, India’s richest person turned the local mobile-phone market into the world’s biggest consumer of wireless data. But along the way, billionaire Mukesh Ambani laid waste to profits in the overcrowded industry by driving down prices to as low as zero. 
Within two years, India’s richest person turned the local mobile-phone market into the world’s biggest consumer of wireless data. But along the way, billionaire Mukesh Ambani laid waste to profits in the overcrowded industry by driving down prices to as low as zero.
Ambani leads Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., which has gone from zero to more than 200 million subscribers, all of them on a nationwide 4G network, since 2016. While the user growth has come at the expense of smaller rivals who’ve merged or quit the market, the thrust into the country’s No. 3 spot for wireless carriers has also ravaged profit at Bharti Airtel Ltd., and Idea Cellular Ltd. The latter has merged with Vodafone Group Plc’s India unit to overtake Bharti as the market’s biggest operator.
Meanwhile, Reliance Jio, a unit of Ambani’s energy-to-retail conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd., has reported two quarters of profit, driven by subscription growth that has continued even after the company began charging for data services. The company is due to report earnings Wednesday.
Consumers have been the clear winners, as the cost of sending and receiving data wirelessly has plummeted.
The plunge in prices has led to surge in data traffic to 1.5 billion gigabytes a month last year, according to Amitabh Kant, chief executive officer of NITI Aayog, India’s government policy think tank.
“Mobile data consumption is higher than USA & China put together,"" Kant posted on his Twitter account in December 2017.
While users benefit from declining prices, losses are expected to continue at the country’s big three surviving carriers. Bharti will probably report an 8.1 billion rupee ($110 million) net loss for the three months ended 30 September, according to the average of analyst estimates.
The Cellular Operators Association of India expects more losses ahead for the industry.
“I see at least another three quarters of losses,"" said Rajan Mathews, director general of the industry group. “I don’t think the present tariffs are sustainable.""
Prior to Jio’s entry into the market, India had more than 10 wireless providers, with the smallest five accounting for about 21% and Bharti, the largest, taking up 25%.
Since Jio stormed in with introductory free data and voice services, the market has consolidated into three big providers, including Vodafone Idea Ltd., which completed its merger at the end of August.

568,2018-10-17,Reliance,"Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail and RIL's petrochemical business are seen offsetting the refiner's weak gross refining margins in the September quarter (Q2)

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is likely to report an increase in quarterly profit in its September quarter (Q2) results to be declared today, driven by better margins from mainstay petrochemical business and fast-growing verticals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Reliance Retail, analysts have said. These will offset RIL’s weak gross refining margins in the quarter.  According to a Bloomberg poll of seven brokers, RIL's consolidated net sales is expected to come in at  ₹ 1.41 trillion; net profit is estimated at  ₹ 9,630.20 crore by 10 brokers.

""Earnings to rise 15% year-on-year, stable quarter-on-quarter—modest quarter-on-quarter decline in refining and chemicals offset by growth in Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail,"" said Macquarie Research in its report dated 8 October. According to the market research firm, refining segment’s operating profit will decline 30% year-on-year, due to lower product cracks, tighter crude differentials, and a temporary fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) shutdown.
As a result, gross refining margins (GRMs) are expected to be soft and come in between $10-10.2 per barrel. Gross refining margins is what a refiner earns by turning crude oil into final products.
RIL’s GRM, which was $12 per barrel in the September quarter of 2017-18, fell to $10.5 per barrel in the first quarter of 2018-19. In Q2, the benchmark Singapore Complex GRM rose from $6.0 to $6.2, led mainly by higher fuel oil cracks. RIL, however, does not produce fuel oil at its Jamnagar refinery in Gujarat. The facility, the world’s single largest oil refinery, can process 1.24 million barrels of oil per day.
""We expect RIL's GRM to come in at $10 per barrel, down $0.05 a barrel compared of the last quarter. While product margins should come in flat,"" said Goldman Sachs Equity Research in a report dated 10 October.
On the petrochemicals front, analysts expect RIL’s operating profit to be in double digits—mainly driven by higher sales volume and help from rupee depreciation.
During the July-September quarter, RIL had raised prices of its key petrochemical products to offset higher crude oil prices and counter the effect of a weakening rupee. Bulk chemicals traders, suppliers for RIL’s petrochemical products and analysts tracking the company said it raised prices by 10-21% in Q2 2018-19 while year-on-year increase is 17-61%.
In the September quarter, the rupee fell 5.55% while crude oil prices rose 1.58%.
On the telecom front, Morgan Stanley expects Reliance Jio to have added about 35 million subscribers in Q2. Average revenue per user (ARPU) was seen declining by 2% quarter-on-quarter, leading to 13% quarterly revenue growth. “Some increase in opex (operating expenditure) could compress the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) margin, but we expect 10% quarter-on-quarter ebitda growth,"" said Morgan Stanley research in a report dated 9 October.
Ebitda is the measure of operating profit of a company.
Reliance Retail, meanwhile, is expected to have grown 7% quarter-on-quarter in Q2—with stable margins and over 4% operating profit. Reliance Retail is India’s largest retailer by revenues.
 On the exploration and production front, RIL will continue to lag and is expected to report losses, analysts said."

According to an Economic Times report, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) could buy more than a 25% stake in each of these two companies to boost its high-speed broadband network. RIL had in July unveiled its fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) broadband plans.
Additionally, deals with Hathway and Den Networks will help Reliance Jio GigaFiber achieve last-mile connectivity, overcoming the challenges the company has been facing from local cable operators who stonewalled its expansion plans.
The deal may also bring down Reliance Jio’s FTTH capex of $130-140 per subscriber which will hasten the pay-back period, according to analysts.
“The talks have been on for over a year now. As per the agreed terms, the management of both Hathway and Den Networks will continue to run the company on a day-to-day basis with RIL taking a board seat. The transaction is similar to RIL’s previous investments in Eros International Media Ltd and Balaji Telefilms,"" said one of the two people cited above.
Reliance has been trying to tap the FTTH broadband segment which is largely an unorganized market controlled by smaller local cable operators and last mile operators with a direct tie-up with internet service providers (ISPs), said the second person aware of the matter.
RIL did not reply to an email while Hathway declined to comment.
Den Networks could not be reached. 
“RIL has in the past been in discussions with several local and regional broadband associations to form a tie-up or a joint venture but the talks have not been fruitful,"" the second person added. For both Den and Hathway, which continue to be highly leveraged, the deal is expected to augment revenue from the data business, which has been on a steady decline.
“The deal, will work in favour of all three companies involved. While for Hathway Cable, deleveraging its balance sheet is key, for Den Networks warding off increasing competition in the broadband business will bode well. For RIL, it will facilitate expansion of its broadband network. It was anticipated that RIL’s disruption in the telecom sector could have been replicated in the broadband sector,"" said an analyst tracking RIL. He spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Hathway Cable, which is owned 46% by Rajan Raheja and his family, has an enterprise valuation of nearly  ₹ 4,200 crore. The company has a debt of around  ₹ 1,700 crore. At the end of the first quarter, Hathway had a broadband subscriber base of 0.77 million in 16 cities.
Hathway’s promoters planned to infuse capital to bolster the balance sheet. “Hathway plans to deleverage its balance sheet by  ₹ 5 billion by end-FY20. Promoters have shown an intention to infuse  ₹ 3.5 billion by way of equity and unsecured ICDs ( ₹ 2 billion in the first tranche and the rest in 18 months) and balance  ₹ 1.5 billion from internal accruals,"" said Dipesh Mehta, analyst, SBICap Securities. 
On the other hand, Den Networks, in which Sameer Manchanda along with others holds a 36% stake, has a subscriber base of 106,000. Den plans to launch broadband services through a franchise model to counter threat from telecom companies and leverage its cable presence and relationship with last mile owners.
Till the first quarter of this fiscal, Den Networks had rolled out fixed-line broadband in 28 cities, with a monthly average rate per user or ARPU of  ₹ 562 as part of its the 100 cities plan to tap growth opportunities across its cable presence markets.
“Den hopes that subscriber addition will gather pace as it gradually expands its presence and rolls out services across 100 cities and is confident of adding 50,000 subscribers in FY19. Den expects an investment of  ₹ 300-400 million to roll out broadband services in 100 cities,"" said SBICap Securities in its report.
Den Networks lost 1.85% to close at  ₹ 74.25 per share on Tuesday on the BSE, while the benchmark Sensex gained 0.85% to close at 35162.48 points. Hathway gained 4.8% to  ₹ 30.35 and RIL rose 2.1% to  ₹ 1163.65 per share."

Srikanth, joint chief financial officer, RIL. “In FY18, we were at  ₹ 72,000 crore and FY19 (annualizing what we have done thus far) we are close to  ₹ 85,000 crore. We are talking about businesses where Ebitda has been doubling and tripling. As you know, consumer businesses (retail and telecom) can sustain long trends of increases,"" he said.
The Mukesh Ambani-controlled RIL has invested more than $30 billion over the last five years across its refining, chemicals, retail and telecom businesses to boost capacity.
RIL on Friday said its net profit rose 17.4% to  ₹ 9,516 crore in the September quarter (Q2), led by higher price realizations for petrochemicals and refinery products.
“Our integrated refining and petrochemicals business generated strong cash flows in a period of heightened volatility in commodity and currency markets,"" said Ambani, chairman and managing director.
Quarterly revenue at the energy-to-telecom conglomerate rose 55% to  ₹ 1.56 trillion from  ₹ 1.10 trillion in the year earlier.
RIL’s consolidated net sales were expected to come in at  ₹ 1.41 trillion, according to a Bloomberg poll of seven analysts. Net profit was estimated at  ₹ 9,630.20 crore, according to 10 analyst estimates.
Gross refining margin (GRM), or what the company earns from turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel, came in at $9.5 a barrel. RIL’s refining margin dropped below $10 for the first time after 15 quarters. Analysts had expected RIL’s GRM to be in the range of $10-10.5/barrel against the $12/barrel it reported a year ago.
RIL is the operator of the world’s biggest oil refinery complex, with a capacity of 1.24 million barrels of oil per day, at Jamnagar in Gujarat.
During the quarter, the benchmark Singapore Complex GRM rose from $6 to $6.2, led mainly by higher fuel oil cracks. RIL, however, does not produce fuel oil.
Crude oil price continued its upward trend in the September quarter. Average Brent crude price rose 45% from a year earlier and 1% from the preceding three months at $75 a barrel.
For Q2, revenue from the petrochemicals segment jumped 56.2% to  ₹ 43,745 crore, helped by an increase in volumes and price realizations.
ON Wednesday, RIL shares fell 1.27% to  ₹ 1,148.90 on BSE, while the benchmark Sensex shed 1.09% to 34,779.58 points. The earnings were announced after the end of trading in Mumbai.
Its mobile telephony arm, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, reported a profit of  ₹ 681 crore for the September quarter, a rise of 11.3% from  ₹ 612 crore in the preceding three months. Revenue from operations rose to  ₹ 9,240 crore from  ₹ 8,109 crore.
During the September quarter, Reliance Jio added 37 million customers, taking the total customer base to 252.3 million.
Its monthly average revenue per user (arpu) stood at  ₹ 131.7 per subscriber in the quarter. Bharti Airtel, which was the market leader before the Vodafone-Idea merger, reported an arpu of  ₹ 105 per subscriber per month during the June quarter.
Bharti Airtel, which hasn’t reported its earnings for the September quarter, has seen its arpu decline sharply during the past few quarters as a result of pricing pressures in the sector due to price wars.
“We, at Jio, are glad with our progress towards our mission with more than 250 million subscribers on our network within 25 months of commencement of services,"" Ambani said. “Our next generation FTTH (fibre-to-the-home) and enterprise services are now being made available to our customers to further enhance our value proposition to our customers.""
On Wednesday, RIL announced a strategic investment in Den Networks Ltd.

Reliance Jio had reported a net profit of  ₹ 612 crore on the back of an operating revenue of  ₹ 8,109 crore during the June quarter.
The Mumbai-headquartered telecom operator added 37 million customers during Q2, taking the total customer base to 252.3 million at the end of the September quarter.
Its average revenue per user (Arpu) stood at  ₹ 131.7 per subscriber per month during the quarter. Bharti Airtel Ltd, which was the market leader before the Vodafone Idea merger, reported Arpu of  ₹ 105 during the June quarter. Bharti Airtel, which hasn’t yet reported its Q2 results, has seen its Arpu decline sharply in the past few quarters as a result of pricing pressures in the telecom sector.
“We, at Jio, are glad with our progress towards our mission with more than 250 million subscribers on our network within 25 months of commencement of services,"" RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani said.
“Our next generation FTTH and enterprise services are now being made available to our customers to further enhance our value proposition to our customers,"" Ambani added.

563,2018-10-18,Reliance,"In the first six months of the year, Reliance Jio has spent about 44,000 crore in capital and operating expenses (excluding interest and depreciation). In the same period, it earned revenues of 17,350 crore.

To say that expectations from Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) are running high is an understatement. The company’s shares are among the best performers on the Street, and even after the recent correction—the stock is down 13% from its highs—valuations are rich. 
To say that expectations from Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) are running high is an understatement. The company’s shares are among the best performers on the Street, and even after the recent correction—the stock is down 13% from its highs—valuations are rich.
In this backdrop, investors may be disappointed that RIL’s September quarter earnings fell short of expectations. According to data collated by Bloomberg, analysts had estimated a 4% sequential increase in the company’s profit before tax. Instead, RIL has reported a 4% drop in pre-tax profit.
The mismatch is largely due to a higher-than-expected 25% increase in net interest costs. Given the sharp depreciation in the rupee, a higher interest cost burden on the company’s foreign loans isn’t entirely surprising; although analysts seem to have been caught a bit unawares. 
As far as business operations go, things played out more or less according to script. The refining business reported earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) of  ₹ 5,322 crore, almost the same as in the June quarter. While refining margins, at $9.5/barrel, were lower than analysts’ estimates, the weaker rupee helped the RIL maintain profits. 
Petchem margins were soft for a number of products too, except paraxylene, where spreads rose sharply last quarter. Put together, this resulted in a 3% increase in Ebit at the petchem division to  ₹ 8,120 crore. The fact that profits rose off the very high base of the June quarter will be heartening for investors.
Of course, much of the excitement around RIL’s shares has to do with its consumer businesses, namely telecom and retail. Neither of them disappointed, at least on profit growth. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd reported a 19% sequential jump in Ebit to  ₹ 2,042 crore, while the retail business reported a 16% increase in Ebit to  ₹ 1244 crore. Reliance Retail Ltd’s profit growth has come on the back of a rapid expansion in the number of stores, and the related benefits of leverage.
Together, the two businesses now account for nearly 20% of total profit at the company, compared to just 5% a year ago. Jio’s subscriber growth and average revenue per user were both ahead of analysts’ estimates.
Of course, there is still a long way to go. RIL said in its annual report for FY18 that its aim is to have the consumer businesses contribute as much as the energy and materials businesses in the next decade. And, from the looks of it, the company is leaving no stone unturned to achieve this.
In the telecom business, capex remained exceptionally high at  ₹ 16,000 crore in the second quarter. In the first six months of the year, Reliance Jio has spent about  ₹ 44,000 crore in capital and operating expenses (excluding interest and depreciation). In the same period, it earned revenues of  ₹ 17,350 crore. In other words, cash burn has remained at high levels. The investment phase is expected to continue, given that the company is still far behind its ultimate targets. 
While this is undoubtedly bad news for Reliance Jio’s competitors, it isn’t very comforting for its own investors either. With debt and interest costs rising, value left for equity owners may end up being lower than what investors had hoped for."

“We reiterate SELL given our concerns on persisting high capex, non-contributing C-WIP and rising debt levels, all of which constrain a sustainable improvement in return ratios and free cash flows in the medium term. The recent deterioration in refining and petchem margins may compound woes in the near term"", said Kotak Institutional Equities in a note.
Gross Refining margin (GRM) dropped to $9.5 a barrel for the first time after 15 quarters. Analysts had expected RIL’s GRM to be in the range of $10-10.5/barrel against the $12/barrel it reported a year ago.
“We expect Singapore GRM to average $6/bbl, going forward. High oil prices, combined with narrowing light-heavy differential and weak demand, are likely to result in poor refining margins in the near term, though"", said Motilal Oswal Seurities in a note to its investors.
Commercialisation of the petcoke gasification plant has been delayed again by about six months and is now due for commissioning by fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. Four gasifiers are scheduled for the DTA refinery by Q4FY19 from Q2 FY19 guided earlier while the timeline for another six in SEZ refinery are unclear.
“We cut our FY19 EBITDA/PAT by 5%/10%, building the petcoke gasification impact from Q4 (earlier Q3) and slightly lowering our base GRM assumption besides taking higher interest from the depreciation of the rupee"", Emkay Global said in a report.
Higher debt and capex also worried investors. RIL’s total capex remained higher at  ₹ 39000 crore in second quarter out of which  ₹ 16000 crore invested for Jio and  ₹ 13000 crore for its standalone operations which resulted debt increasing by  ₹ 20000 crore quarter on quarter to  ₹ 1.80 trillion. 
“We would wait for stabilization of capex at lower level and growth trajectory of Jio before assigning it a higher valuation"", said IDBI Capital in a note to its investors. The brokerage firm has downgraded the stock to Hold and maintained its target price to  ₹ 1200 a share.
“We expect significant monetization of GigaFiber business may take longer than expected time due to last mile connectivity issues. Though strategic investment in Hathway and Den would help speed up the work. Though, pricing pressure in Mobility business may keep ARPU at a lower level in near term."", the report added."

Mumbai: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which disrupted mobile telephony in India with rock-bottom tariffs two years ago, is set to do an encore in the broadband and cable market, through an aggressive pricing strategy and a gamut of product offerings.
“From our point of view, the tariff needs to make sense for the customer. The customer needs to see value in what they are paying and we will make sure they see value in it. I will not comment on the prevalent tariffs as most customers do not have a choice today as they are subscribing to services because there is a service provider that they need and an alternative is just to not have that service,"" said Anshuman Thakur, Reliance Jio’s strategy and planning head, post the company’s second quarter earnings conference on Wednesday.
Reliance Jio’s acquisition of Hathway Cable and Datacom Ltd and Den Networks Ltd are only seen as facilitators in the process.

“I think the right tariff to compare is to look at tariff with regard to the high-speed internet, getting the cable through the dish or otherwise and a landline. When you look at tariff, all these three come into play for relevant tariff comparison. Because the opportunities for fibre to home addresses all these in a single shot,"" said V. Srikanth, joint chief financial officer, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), of which Reliance Jio is a wholly-owned subsidiary.
In a presentation to analysts post its second-quarter earnings, RIL said it is in an exclusive position to connect homes and boost digital activity. The company is banking on its all-IP, pan India fibre, 1 Gbps ready network with average speed of over 100Mbps; 1,000 plus Reliance Jio centres and a distributed presence to service 50 million-plus homes and 10 million enterprises.
RIL on Wednesday said Reliance Jio has begun onboarding Jio GigaFiber customers and is ramping up resources wherever there is demand, connecting customers in all of these areas.
RIL plans to connect 50 million homes across 1,100 cities in the country with Jio GigaFiber. Its latest investments mean it will now be able to utilize the 27,000 strong local cable operators’ (LCOs) network of Hathway and Den broadband connections.
The LCOs provide RIL with direct access to 24 million homes, across 750 cities where Hathway and Den offer broadband connections.
Currently, the digital platforms for home broadband are largely people-dependent and inconsistent. RIL plans to revamp it with its digital platform for execution and performance, online ticket generation and support and provide an online platform for all field activities and services.

553,2018-10-22,Reliance,"The move is China’s latest effort to reduce its reliance on US soybeans, as Beijing and Washington remain locked in an outright trade war

 Beijing/Mumbai: China has dropped a years-long ban on rapeseed meal imports from India as the government seeks to diversify sources of protein used in animal feed, the customs administration said on Monday. 
 Beijing/Mumbai: China has dropped a years-long ban on rapeseed meal imports from India as the government seeks to diversify sources of protein used in animal feed, the customs administration said on Monday.
Rapeseed meal shipments from India can resume from Monday if they meet certain inspection and quarantine requirements, the General Administration of Customs said on its website.
The move is China’s latest effort to reduce its reliance on US soybeans, as Beijing and Washington remain locked in an outright trade war.
China buys 60% of the soybeans traded worldwide, processing them into soymeal to feed its vast pig herds. Soybeans are the top US agricultural export to China by value.
China was the top buyer of Indian rapeseed meal before the ban was imposed in 2011 over quality concerns. As Sino-US trade tensions escalated, India stepped up its lobbying for the restart of a trade worth $161 million in 2011.
Indian rapeseed meal exported to China must be from processing plants inspected and approved by the Export Inspection Council of India, and registered with China’s General Administration of Customs, the Chinese body said on its website.
“This is a very good development that we were expecting. But still exporters need to register with Chinese authorities and it is a lengthy process,"" said B. V. Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India, an industry body.
India has an ample surplus to export 500,000 tonnes of rapeseed meal to China every year, Mehta said.
Rapeseed futures in India jumped more than 1% on Monday to  ₹ 4,222 ($57.48) per 100 kg.
Farmers in India have started planting rapeseed, the country’s main winter-sown oilseed crop, a Mumbai-based trader of edible oils said.
“Farmers will expand the area under rapeseed if prices rise in the next few weeks due to Chinese demand,"" the trader said.
China imposed tariffs of 25% on a list of American products including soybeans on July 6, in response to US duties on Chinese goods worth a similar amount.
The retaliative measures will likely tighten supplies of the oilseed in the fourth quarter, when US beans usually dominate the market, and push up prices of soymeal.
Beijing is mulling capping protein levels in pig and poultry feed, and seeking ways to import more alternative meals such as rapeseed meal and sunflower meal.
In July, Beijing removed tariffs on soybeans, soymeal and rapeseed from five Asian countries including India."

Reliance Jio’s net revenue may have crossed Bharti Airtel Ltd’s wireless revenue in India last quarter, according to analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities Research.

If the Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) unit maintains the momentum, then it may emerge as the largest telecom company as early as the end of 2018.
“We expect Bharti Airtel’s net India wireless revenues (reported gross wireless revenues less estimated gross interconnect revenues) to be around  ₹ 87-88 billion for 2QFY19. Reliance Jio’s reported revenues of  ₹ 92.4 billion are net of interconnect revenues as the company adjusts interconnect revenues in the interconnect costs line,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities Research said in a note.
“If Bharti does not report a material beat on our estimated wireless revenues for the quarter, Reliance Jio has perhaps crossed Bharti on net India wireless revenues to become #2 after Vodafone Idea. If the current trends continue, Reliance Jio will likely become #1 on net revenues as early as 3QFY19E,"" the note said.
Reliance Jio’s focus remains on expanding its subscriber base but the ban on Aadhaar-based e-KYC can affect this. This, however, is seen as a temporary phenomenon. The trends indicate continued tough times for incumbent telecom companies which have to step-up capital expenditure (capex) while dealing with price erosion.
“We expect competitive intensity to remain elevated over the next 9-12 months as fight for subscriber share continues. Reliance Jio, over the weekend, introduced 100% cashback for all packages and various players have been tweaking with pricing and packs,"" Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a 19 October note.

560,2018-10-22,Reliance,"The sale of RCom assets to Reliance Jio brings the saga of Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani full circle and sets the stage for the next chapter in the story of one of India's greatest business dynasties

Over the past year, the fortunes of the two brothers at the helm of India’s wealthiest dynasty have grown apart—to more than $40 billion apart. 
Over the past year, the fortunes of the two brothers at the helm of India’s wealthiest dynasty have grown apart—to more than $40 billion apart.
Elder sibling Mukesh Ambani, 61, toppled China’s Jack Ma as Asia’s richest man, after driving a telecommunications revolution with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd that propelled his petrochemicals conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd into the $100 billion club. His net worth has swelled to $43.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, $5.2 billion ahead of Ma and just ahead of Microsoft Corp.’s former chief, Steve Ballmer.
Meanwhile Anil Ambani, two years his junior, has had a difficult year, with some of his businesses suffering legal and liquidity challenges that roiled stocks, cutting his personal fortune by almost half to $1.5 billion, according to the index.
Neither the brothers nor their groups responded to questions for this story regarding their wealth or business operations.
The tale of the two brothers’ diverging fortunes began 16 years ago, when their rags-to-riches father Dhirubhai Ambani, whose life inspired a Bollywood film, died of a stroke without leaving a will. The industrialist, who started out as a gas station attendant in Yemen, had built a vast business empire, financing massive factories by selling so many shares to small investors that stockholder meetings had to be held in a football stadium.
A feud between his two sons following their father’s death dogged the group until their mother, Kokilaben, stepped in during 2005 and brokered a truce. Mukesh got control of the flagship oil refining and petrochemicals, while Anil got the newer businesses such as power generation and financial services. He also took over the telecoms unit, which under Mukesh had expanded aggressively by bundling phones with mobile connections at throwaway prices.
Telecom lure
At the time, the wireless division seemed to give Anil some of the more promising opportunities. Crude oil prices had climbed to a then-record price of more than $60 a barrel in 2005, sparking concern that refiners’ margins may get eroded. India’s burgeoning mobile-phone market was hailed as the future.
A non-compete clause between the brothers kept Mukesh out of that arena until the agreement was scrapped in 2010. Mukesh quickly returned, pumping in more than  ₹ 2.5 trillion ($34 billion) over the next seven years to build a speedier 4G wireless network for his Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
“It was a very, very big bet,"" said James Crabtree, a professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore and author of the book The Billionaire Raj, which examined wealth inequality in India. Reliance Jio also gave Mukesh the chance to forge his own legacy beyond the shadow of the businesses he had inherited, he said. “Jio in that sense was an all-in bet.""
It took a long time to pay off. Reliance’s shares lagged S&P BSE Sensex index for most of the past decade as investors watched Mukesh pour money into his telecom network with little sign of a return at first.
Price war
When it came in 2016, the impact was dramatic. By September this year, less than two years after starting the service, Reliance Jio had signed up 252.3 million users and was making a profit. Rivals were bleeding as Mukesh’s upstart embarked on a devastating price war, offering monthly plans for as little as $2.

“Reliance’s strategy to diversify beyond the energy sector was the biggest game changer,"" said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice president at India Infoline Ltd. “Mukesh Ambani had the 10-year vision to foresee that data will be the next gold and he invested heavily.""
What financed that investment was Dhirubhai’s old oil and petrochemicals business, which, expanded by Mukesh, still accounts for 90% of Reliance’s profit. Cash flow from the business, together with a blue-chip rating gave Reliance Industries access to a large pool of cheap capital. “Mukesh Ambani has very adroitly used this competitive advantage,"" said Saurabh Mukherjea, founder of Marcellus Investment Managers.
Meanwhile, Anil has been selling assets to quell investor concerns around the indebtedness of some of his companies that contributed to declines in his shares.
Like his brother, Anil invested billions to expand his portfolio, but the younger brother didn’t have a cash cow like the oil refinery to finance growth. Instead, like other businesses in India and elsewhere, many of his companies increased debt.
The borrowing spree by local companies caused India’s banks to amass one of the world’s worst bad-loan ratios and when the Reserve Bank of India started cracking down on the resulting $210 billion mountain of stressed debt, highly leveraged companies came under pressure.
“The only options any indebted company has is to sell assets, seek refinancing or get new investors,"" said Crabtree in Singapore.
Of Anil’s businesses, shares of Reliance Naval & Engineering Ltd. saw the worst decline this year, losing 75%. Bought in 2015 as part of his bet on defence as the next engine of growth, the warship and submarine maker has proven hard to turn around.
Its loan accounts have been “ irregular or substandard"" since 2014, the company said in March. The defence contractor is in arbitration with ex-owners over the latter’s alleged breach of some warranties. Auditors in April cautioned against the firm’s ability to survive and two creditors have an ongoing lawsuit to send Reliance Naval into insolvency. In a stock exchange filing in April that sought to allay the auditor’s concerns, the company said it is engaged with its lenders and is confident on reaching a solution “to resolve the financial position of the company and to continue as a going concern.""
Other group units have also faced difficulties.
Another of Anil’s defence firms—Reliance Defence Ltd—has come under scrutiny over the 2016 negotiations between France and India for $8.7 billion of Dassault Aviation’s Rafale fighter jets. In a 20 August statement, Anil and his company denied allegations from opposition lawmakers that the deal unfairly benefited his company, saying the lawmakers had been “misinformed, misdirected and misled by malicious vested interests and corporate rivals.""
Missed payment
Anil’s Reliance Infrastructure Ltd, which built Mumbai’s first metro line, missed a bond payment in August as it waited for proceeds from the sale of power transmission assets to fellow billionaire Gautam Adani’s unit to cover the amount. It plans to be debt-free by next year, Anil said at a briefing in August.
Electricity generator Reliance Power Ltd, also part of Anil’s Reliance Group, has failed to stem a decade of overall decline in its shares since its record IPO in 2008, just as the global financial crisis hit.
The group’s profitable financial services firm Reliance Capital Ltd has also seen its shares decline this year, despite staying away from bad news.
But the biggest challenge for Anil’s empire came from his brother’s business.
Reliance Communications Ltd, once the flagship of Anil’s portfolio, was battered by the price war Reliance Jio started. Last month, RCom sold its 178,000km fiber-optic network for  ₹ 3,000 crore as part of a disposal that will see it divest of almost all of its wireless assets and exit from the mobile phone business.
The buyer was Mukesh’s Reliance Jio.
RCom “was the crown jewel given away to Anil Ambani after the family businesses split,"" said Bhasin. “Then the debt and interest burden spiraled.""
In May, Ericsson persuaded a court to begin insolvency proceedings for RCom before agreeing to an out-of-court settlement.
The sale of RCom assets to Reliance Jio brings the saga of the two brothers full circle and sets the stage for the next chapter in the story of one of India’s great business dynasties.
Anil is gradually unwinding RCom debts and refocusing the firm toward real estate. This month he told investors that a property development in Navi Mumbai, a planned city across the bay from India’s financial capital, will create 250 billion rupees in value for investors.
Late coming
“It may be a late coming but at least he is not running away,"" said Bhasin, who remains bullish on the group’s infrastructure, finance and power businesses.
Mukesh is gearing up for an even bigger gamble. In July he announced plans for an e-commerce foray that would marry the group’s telecom and retail business to take on global rivals Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.
ALSO READ | Inside Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance e-commerce plan
While the news helped boost shares of Mukesh’s Reliance Industries since the announcement, some investors are sounding a note of caution about another ambitious expansion. Reliance Industries’ total debt has risen in the past five years and non-core investments have shown muted returns on capital.
“There’s a reason investors put a discount on holding companies with diverse businesses,"" said Crabtree, explaining that telecom diversification worked but “taking it much further may be one too many rolls of the dice.""
In the past few weeks, Mukesh has faced his own challenges.
A verdict by India’s top court last month barred non-government use of a national biometric database that telecom operators including Reliance Jio had been using to sign up customers. The prospect of a multi-fold rise in verification costs for the telecom company, together with a slump in the rupee and rising oil prices contributed to a 11% drop in Reliance Industries’ stock this month.
Still, the media spotlight has been on Mukesh and his wife Nita, head of the Reliance Foundation, for a very different reason. Both their eldest son—Akash Ambani—and daughter—Isha Ambani—got engaged this year, putting the Mumbai and Bollywood elite on high alert for two epic Indian weddings. Judging by Akash’s lavish engagement party this June in the family’s $1 billion Mumbai home with 27 stories and 600-staff, they won’t be disappointed.
The saga continues."

 New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) will finalize the site for India’s first pod taxi prototype, the next generation transportation system, according to the terms of the deal between Reliance and SkyTran, announced last week. Pod taxi is a driverless personal rapid transit system, which runs along a predetermined course either through overhead suspension or magnetic levitation. 
 New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) will finalize the site for India’s first pod taxi prototype, the next generation transportation system, according to the terms of the deal between Reliance and SkyTran, announced last week. Pod taxi is a driverless personal rapid transit system, which runs along a predetermined course either through overhead suspension or magnetic levitation.
“As per the deal, the prototype will be built at the place decided by Reliance,"" said one person, who was part of deal negotiations, requesting anonymity. Once the pilot and subsequent trial runs are successful, the company will have to get into separate agreements with central and state governments to set up the infrastructure, according to the terms of the respective governments, he added. 
“For the prototype, some bits will be imported from the US, while most of it will be made in India. In return, Reliance will help SkyTran with multiple technologies to run the pod taxi, including communication technology, which is an important part of the deal.""
Last week, Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RIL, acquired a 12.7% stake in US-based technology company SkyTran. The strategic investment was made through stock financing, with an option to further invest up to $25 million in convertible notes, subject to the approval of SkyTran’s board.
SkyTran, which has partnerships with National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), has investments by Eric Schmidt, an American businessman and the former executive chairman of Google, and Timothy Cook Draper, an American venture capital investor.
“Reliance, Eric and Timothy if combined will have around 35-40% stake in SkyTran,"" said a second person aware of the terms of deal, also requesting anonymity. He said that for a prototype, “the ballpark number will be  ₹ 100 crore per km for bi-directional lines, which will include a reasonable number of vehicles"".
The person added that SkyTran’s market valuation is in “single-digit billion dollars"", but refused to disclose the exact figure.
The idea to introduce pod taxis in India was undertaken by Nitin Gadkari, the minister for road transport and highways, in 2016. Subsequently, in January 2017, a NITI Aayog panel had cleared the ministry’s proposal to test three rapid transport systems using pod taxis.
The three global companies in the fray were Ultra Global PRT, SkyTran and Metrino PRT.
Ultra Global is the only company whose technology has been tested and is in commercial use. Its pod vehicles are made of steel, have rubber tyres and run on specially made tracks. The Ultra Global system has been in use at Heathrow Airport in London, and runs at 45km/h.
SkyTran’s pod taxis run on its state-of-the-art passive magnetic levitation technology, while Metrino pods are suspended from overhead rails. The SkyTran technology is at the testing stage while Metrino has developed a prototype that was tested in 2007 in Poland, but is yet to be commercially operated.
Last year, New Zealand’s Metrino Personal Rapid Transit, however, decided to withdraw and called off its joint venture with an Indian partner after failing to get funds for the project.
The approval was given on the condition that the technologies should first be piloted on a 1km stretch, and the bidders will have to execute the testing at their own risk and cost. Furthermore, the government said that the pilot project should be executed in such a way that if it is successful then it can be further extended to 15-20km, and also ensure safety during trial runs.
The Niti Aayog expert committee had observed that the energy consumed per passenger km by such rapid transit systems is much lower than other modes of transport."

 New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) time till 15 December to clear the pending payment of  ₹ 550 crore towards telecom equipment manufacturer Ericsson India Pvt. Ltd. Delayed payment will attract an interest of 12% per annum. A two judge bench headed by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman made it clear that this was the last time extension for RCom and that the amount must be paid on or before 15 December. 
 New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) time till 15 December to clear the pending payment of  ₹ 550 crore towards telecom equipment manufacturer Ericsson India Pvt. Ltd. Delayed payment will attract an interest of 12% per annum. A two judge bench headed by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman made it clear that this was the last time extension for RCom and that the amount must be paid on or before 15 December.
""You (Reliance) ask for a reasonable period, we will give you and after that its over"", Nariman said.
Senior advocate Kapil Sibal said, “Jio has not given us a penny. We are waiting for DoT to give us NoC for the sale of assets. The moment DoT gives us the NoC, within a week we will pay.""
This was opposed by senior advocate Dushyant Dave appearing for Ericsson who disuaded the court from accepting the DoT's argument.
""This bogey of DoT's approval is being raised to avoid paying money. They have already sold assets worth thousands of crore,"" Dave told the court.
At the last hearing, RCom had told the Supreme Court that it would settle its dispute over dues with Ericsson India in 10 days.
The apex court was hearing a contempt plea by Ericsson for non-payment of  ₹ 550 crore by RCom by the 30 September deadline.
RCom moved the top court on 19th March, seeking a stay on the orders by the Bombay high court and the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), barring it from selling its wireless assets to Reliance Jio without the court’s prior approval. The company was joined as a co-petitioner by State Bank of India, which approached the court on 20th March, seeking approval for the sale of RCom’s assets to Reliance Jio.
The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had on 30 May stayed a corporate insolvency resolution process initiated against Anil Ambani-owned RCom and two group companies, Reliance Infratel and Reliance Telecom.
The NCLAT order came after Ericsson India, which had initiated the insolvency proceedings, accepted RCom’s offer to pay  ₹ 550 crore by 30 September.
Ericsson had signed a seven-year deal with RCom in 2014 to operate and manage its nationwide telecom network. After alleged non-payment of dues since 2016, Ericsson moved the NCLT against RCom and group companies, Reliance Infratel and Reliance Telecom, in September 2017.
With the insolvency process being stayed, RCom can now go ahead with its  ₹ 18,100 crore deal with Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd for the sale of its assets mortgaged with different banks to bring down debt.
Part of the deal with respect to the stay on sale of tower and fibre assets was cleared by the appellate tribunal on 29th May after Reliance Infratel’s offshore investors and minority shareholder HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd decided to withdraw their objections to the sale.
A stay imposed by the Bombay high court on the sale of the other assets—spectrum, media convergence nodes and real estate (in New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Jigni and Tirupati)—was vacated by the Supreme Court on 5th April.
RCom and its subsidiaries have a total outstanding debt of around  ₹ 45,000 crore.
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case."

 Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is testing its payments bank services among its employees, two executives aware of the matter said, similar to how it introduced Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd nearly three years ago. Formed in April 2018 as a 70:30 joint venture between RIL and State Bank of India (SBI), Jio Payments Bank is one of eight entities licensed to operate payments banks in the country.

Formed in April 2018 as a 70:30 joint venture between RIL and State Bank of India (SBI), Jio Payments Bank is one of eight entities licensed to operate payments banks in the country.
Allowing employees to use the service will allow the company test its network and infrastructure and help plug loopholes before a formal launch.
“We have begun live beta trials for Jio Payments Bank. We are also rolling out merchant solutions and the service is seeing good acceptance across offline and online,"" Anshuman Thakur, Reliance Jio’s strategy and planning head, said on the sidelines of a press conference to announce the company’s second quarter earnings on 17 October.
Telecom major Bharti Airtel Ltd was the first to launch a payments bank in India in November 2016. Paytm Payments Bank began operations in May 2017, while Fino Payments Bank started last June. 
Reliance Jio began similarly in August 2015 with a beta launch for its 100,000 employees, who were later allowed to invite others to join the network.
Payments banks can offer services such as small savings accounts, payments, and remittance services to small businesses and low-income households. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) sees payments banks as a faster route than traditional banks to bring more Indians under financial coverage.

Driven primarily by mobile technology, payments banks can ease the account opening process by making it technology-based and paperless. They can accept deposits only up to  ₹ 1 lakh per customer in a savings/current account, since their purpose is to reach out to the un-banked masses. They cannot offer loans.
RIL is also moving customers of its JioMoney prepaid mobile wallet to Jio Payments Bank, the second person cited above said.
In August, Reliance Jio integrated SBI’s Yono (you only need one) platform on to its MyJio mobile app.
SBI Yono is an omni-channel platform offering digital banking, commerce and financial services in one place. The features of SBI Yono can be accessed through the MyJio application.
Reliance Jio and SBI customers will benefit from Jio Prime, the customer loyalty programme by Reliance Jio. Jio Prime will offer exclusive deals from Reliance Retail, Jio partner brands and merchants. As part of the deal, Jio Prime will be integrated with SBI Rewardz, the bank’s loyalty programme to offer additional loyalty reward earning opportunities to its customers.
SBI, the country’s largest lender, will also engage Reliance Jio as a preferred partner for designing and providing network and connectivity solutions. The bank is looking to utilize Reliance Jio's extensive network to facilitate services like video banking and other on-demand services.
In the September quarter, Reliance Jio added 37 million customers, taking the total user base to 252.3 million. If it continues to grow at this pace, it will over take Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd as India’s largest telecom firm by end of 2018."
548,2018-10-25,Reliance,"The Hathway and Den Networks acquisitions give Reliance Jio access to 24 million cable-connected homes, a demography that Jio GigaFiber wants to tap into

Last week, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) said it was acquiring majority stakes in Hathway Cable and Datacom Ltd, and Den Networks for  ₹ 5,230 crore. While it seeks to pick up a 51.3% stake in Hathway for  ₹ 2,940 crore, in Den it will acquire 66% for  ₹ 2,290 crore. The acquisitions mark RIL’s further penetration into cable broadband through Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. In July, Reliance Jio had first announced its single service provider Jio GigaFiber, the high-speed fixed line broadband targeting 50 million users across 1,100 towns and cities. The service promised ultra-high definition entertainment on TV, virtual reality, gaming, smart home solutions and e-commerce. 
Last week, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) said it was acquiring majority stakes in Hathway Cable and Datacom Ltd, and Den Networks for  ₹ 5,230 crore. While it seeks to pick up a 51.3% stake in Hathway for  ₹ 2,940 crore, in Den it will acquire 66% for  ₹ 2,290 crore. The acquisitions mark RIL’s further penetration into cable broadband through Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.

The service promised ultra-high definition entertainment on TV, virtual reality, gaming, smart home solutions and e-commerce.
With the acquisitions of Hathway and Den Networks, Reliance seeks to hasten the pace of disruption in the media and entertainment industry. For starters, the move is a sure-fire winner for Reliance Jio, which will get access to 24 million cable-connected homes. Experts say, of these, approximately 2 million may have broadband. The total fixed broadband market in India is 18 million homes dominated by BSNL, MTNL and Bharti Airtel Ltd, among others. Reliance Jio could take advantage of the massive workforce of the two MSOs (multi-system operators) and their LCOs (local cable operators) to quicken the launch of Jio GigaFiber as these were homes which it was finding tough to enter.
The last-mile connectivity of these homes lay with the LCOs—nearly 27,000—whom it now has access to. This gives it an opportunity to offer triple-play services under the Jio brand, which includes voice, video and data—all provided under a single access subscription. And once it updates technology and improves service levels, it may up its ARPUs (average revenue per user) as well.
Agrees Mihir Shah, vice-president at research firm Media Partners Asia: “The recent cable acquisitions, combined with Reliance Jio’s own GigaFiber push will expedite fibre broadband adoption, reinvigorating growth in the country’s highly under-penetrated fixed broadband segment. Furthermore, Reliance will gain access to approximately 24 million Pay-TV homes to add to its mobile broadband reach of more than 250 million subscribers, making the company India’s largest distribution platform for linear and non-linear video content.""
Given the high subscriber fragmentation in cable and an under-penetrated fixed broadband market, CCI (Competition Commission of India) intervention is also unlikely. “We expect Reliance Jio might continue this path of inorganic growth focusing now on acquiring strong regional MSOs...while other smaller operators too might be compelled to join forces,"" Shah adds.
In contrast to traditional Pay-TV and telecom businesses, the consumer’s willingness to pay for home broadband remains high, especially with demand for internet access surpassing data caps set on mobile plans, Shah says. “The consumer experience is poised to improve with faster speeds, higher Fair Usage Policy limits, and a suite of new value-added services. Reliance Jio’s hybrid set-top boxes will enrich the viewing experience for online content, while higher speeds will also allow consumers to explore new use-cases of broadband.""
However, the impact on the broadcasting industry may not all be positive. With the scale it gets after acquiring Hathway and Den Networks, Reliance Jio will enjoy immense negotiating power over TV channels. For any distributor, 80% cost is content. And with numbers on its side, Reliance Jio will be in a position to negotiate this cost.
Says Shah: “With growing consolidation in the distribution value chain, the bargaining power is increasingly tilting in favour of large-scale platforms, making it difficult for broadcasters to drive growth for their subscription income. The new distribution behemoth will more likely seek to jointly negotiate in sourcing of linear and non-linear content feeds from broadcasters.""
The direct-to-home (DTH) industry is also likely to be impacted. Some say that it may survive and that DTH operators may move to higher ARPU customers. Yet others say it may be hit by customer churn and face pricing pressure. However, experts say that customer acquisition for DTH will be cheaper than for Reliance Jio as the company has to still enhance its fibre footprint and laying the last mile—fibre-to-the-home—does not come cheap. And it is still not clear how much subscription fee Reliance Jio will charge.
The good news, however, is that Reliance is infusing upwards of  ₹ 5,000 crore into the sector which can only benefit the cash-starved cable industry.

 Full text of Mukesh Ambani’s speech at India Mobile Congress:
Honourable Minister Shri Ravi Shankar Prasadji, Shri Manoj Sinhaji,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
A very warm good morning.
Dear Friends,
Today, we are living in an India of unprecedented hope and promise..…An India that is poised to embrace an immensely exciting future.
Just one data point…In my lifetime, I have always been told that India has the largest number of extremely poor people in the world. But that is no longer the case today.
A World Bank report indicates that India will have fewer than 3% of its population living under extreme poverty by 2021.
As per a United Nations report as many as 271 million people have been liberated from the prison of poverty in the last decade alone.
This is a truly historic achievement and the credit rightly belongs to all our citizens. 
Today India is among the fastest growing large economies in the world.
This has happened due to a combination of force-multiplying factors.
Most notable among these is the visionary leadership of our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modiji.
During the past five years he has galvanised India. He has launched more number of transformative initiatives than in a comparable period anywhere in the world.
An equally important factor is the contribution of Indian entrepreneurs, especially those in the telecom, IT and digital space.
Never before has India witnessed such an explosion of entrepreneurial spirit.
India has moved from 155th rank in mobile broadband penetration to being the number 1 nation in mobile data consumption in the world in less than two years. 
This is the fastest transition anywhere in the world from 2G/3G to 4G.
By 2020, I believe that India will be a fully-4G country and ready for 5G ahead of others. 
Every phone in India will be a 4G enabled phone and every customer will have access to 4G connectivity.
At Jio, we are committed to connecting everyone and everything, everywhere always with the highest quality and the most affordable price.
Friends,
What gives me special satisfaction is the silent revolution taking place in Rural India.
I am personally excited about the promise and prospect of bringing Digital Revolution to India’s villages to agriculture and rural enterprises to women and to marginalized communities everywhere.
I am equally excited about connecting millions of small shop keepers in India.
The Digital Connectivity Revolution can transform Rural India most comprehensively.
In the past eight months alone as many as 50 million villagers have got affordable smartphones.
For most of them it is not only their pehla phone but also their pehla radio and music player.
Pehla TV, pehla camera and pehla Internet in their lives.
Imagine what this 5-in-1 means for the aspirational explosion in India.
And imagine how it can transform India when it becomes 6-in-1… with Indians getting the revolutionary power of pehla Artificial Intelligence in their hands.
All this at only 100 rupees per month.
This combination of connectivity with affordability is unparalleled in the world.
I would like to acknowledge the contribution of the Government’s BharatNet program in providing high-quality connectivity in some of the remotest areas of our country.
This transformation will accelerate as we get ready for a 5G world driven by the pro-active approach of the Government. 
Today at the IMC, you can experience 5G and its various use-cases in our pavilion. 
Friends, 
With JioGigaFiber, we have now begun an ambitious push in fixed broadband through Fiber-to-the-home and premise.
Jio is committed to building a deep-fibre network across the country and ensuring that every premise is connected with the highest quality network.
All of us are proud that India has become the world’s largest mobile data consuming nation. 
We now have a similar opportunity to replicate this success in fixed broadband as well.
I believe India will rise from a lowly 135th rank to be amongst the top three nations in fixed broadband at a pace that will surprise the world.
And from day one, JioGigaFiber will offer complete fixed-mobile convergence where Indians will travel seamlessly between mobile and fixed broadband networks 4G and 5G when on the move and Wi-Fi when indoors. 
Friends,
We can together create a period of unprecedented growth, empowerment, employment and prosperity for everyone across our great nation…… In a future that will be shaped by the fourth industrial revolution……a future founded on the robust pillars of connectivity, computing and data. A future powered by path-breaking digital technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Blockchain, Internet of Things, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. A future of exponential growth and immense opportunities for 130 crore connected Indians. 
This Revolution will open the floodgates of limitless possibilities for India… and Indians… especially young Indians.
I assure you that our Industry will play the role of a catalyst in this mission of propelling our nation towards this bright future.
We have to be mindful that data is the most important resource in this new world.
And India and Indians will generate humungous amount of data. 
It is important that we utilise this rich-resource for the benefit of India and Indians, with adequate safeguards. 
With universal connectivity and extreme affordability, our Prime Minister’s inspiring idea of ease of living for all can now be realised.
With world-class digital infrastructure in place, India is now ready to not only embrace but actually lead the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
This is because, each one of the 130 crore people of India can now productively participate in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
We can solve the largest unsolved problems facing humanity right here in India.
Let me mention only four.
First: The Fourth Industrial Revolution can realise the Prime Minister’s promise of doubling the incomes of 150 million Indian farmers.
Second: It can realise the Ayushman Bharat scheme’s promise of bringing healthcare to 500 million people ─ the largest health insurance initiative in the world.
Third: It can bring quality education to 200 million students in Indian schools and colleges.
Fourth: And not the least it can create more jobs with the digitally-connected and AI-powered marketplace of small merchants and small enterprises ─ which I call new commerce for new India.
India will demonstrate the greatest digital transformation in people’s lives in world history.
Friends,
India will be among the largest digital markets in the world. 
Every enterprise must have an ‘India First’ vision to participate in this market.
We will need to reinvent to grow and nurture this market to its full potential.
This will be a win-win for the entire industry, for India and for the entire world.
To achieve this, we need a grand coalition – of everyone in the industry, government, civil society and the citizens.
I strongly believe that India will enable every citizen to realise her fullest potential on the back of this grand coalition. 
May God bless our great nation India. 
Thank you!"

 New Delhi: India’s top three telecom operators gave contradictory views on the future of mobile telephony in the second edition of the India Mobile Congress.
While Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) chairman Mukesh Ambani said India will be a fully-4G country by 2020, ready for 5G, Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Mittal urged the government to offer tax relief, and Vodafone Idea chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla asked for leveraging technology and investments before moving to 5G.
At the inaugural session of the three-day event on Thursday, Reliance Jio demonstrated multiple live 5G trials ranging from driverless cars, surveillance drones, and aerial disaster management vehicle SKYSHIP, with facial recognition features for rescue activities. Airtel also showcased a 5G-enabled self-operated drone for disaster response and monitoring. 
The ongoing tariff war post the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016 has forced several telcos to shut shop or merge with bigger peers to survive.
“While India’s consolidation has not happened in an orderly fashion, other than the Vodafone-Idea merger, many operators have had to go through significant pain, a lot of job losses have happened...$50 billion have been written off...but we have finally arrived at a point where we are at a right industry structure,"" said Mittal.
While Bharti Airtel acquired Telenor India and Tikona Digital Networks, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular merged to become the largest telecom operator in India. Aircel is in the midst of insolvency proceedings, while Reliance Communications awaits final approval to sell its assets to RIL’s Jio.
Revenues of all operators, except Jio, fell in the past several quarters. According to data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, the sector’s adjusted gross revenue was  ₹ 36,552 crore in April-June, a 8.1% drop from a year earlier.
“The sector is facing many challenges...and is in considerable financial stress,"" said Vivek Badrinath, chief executive, Africa Middle East Asia Pacific, Vodafone Group.
 “Each rupee can only be spent once, so a new balance must be struck between fiscal requirements and the need to enable investment to support economic development.""
Operators, who are liable to pay 3-5% and 8% of the adjusted gross revenue as spectrum usage charges and licence fees, respectively, to the government, have for long been pitching for a cut in levies.
“On one hand, we have the Prime Minister’s vision of a digitally-enabled India, which requires tremendous investments, and on the other, we keep spectrum prices very high, licence fee is high, spectrum charges are high and GST is at 18%, which is almost at the highest tax bracket. We cannot have these two competing positions in the industry, said Mittal. 
“On one hand, a very important industry which is enabling India to be embracing digital medium, on the other hand, this industry remains taxed like the tobacco industry."" While rivals complained of financial stress, Ambani said India offered “unprecedented hope and promise"". 
“India has moved from 155th rank in mobile broadband penetration…to being the number 1 nation in mobile data consumption in the world… in less than two years. This is the fastest transition anywhere in the world from 2G/3G to 4G. By 2020, I believe that India will be a fully-4G country… and ready for 5G ahead of others.""

 New Delhi: Reliance Jio on Friday said telecom tariffs in the country cannot be raised as there are a large number of people who still use feature phones and companies need to innovate around data to perform.
“There are still around 400 million Indians who use feature phone and hence tariff can’t be raised to reach out to them,"" Reliance Jio president Mathew Oommen said at the India Mobile Congress.
He said companies need to focus on innovation or they will be displaced.
“As a service provider, we need to know are we going to make GB (gigabyte) cost a little bit lower and make money or little bit higher and make money -- that is not the mechanism. We have to innovate or we will get displaced,"" Oommen said.
He cited the example of US and Chinese internet giants who have grown rich on the basis of data.
“We live in gigabyte economy and not product economy. We as service providers are the enablers for any digital transformation. That digital transformation is enabled by ultra broadband. We need to be invested in data science, artificial and machine learning -- that is going to enable us transform quickly,"" Oommen said.
Talking about 5G deployment, he said the ecosystem will be ready by 2019-20 but affordable devices for mass adoption of the service will start coming in India in 2021.
“5G ecosystem will be available sometime in 2019-2020. We in india need to take 5G to every part of India. For that, 2021 is when we will have devices that will be affordable. 5G as a technology impact is not just in telecom but it is across, reshaping every single industry,"" Oommen said.
He said that mobile devices on 5G technology are not available yet and are expected to come in 2019.
“In end-2020 (or) 2021 when technology evolves... it is difficult for me in 2018 to predict what will be the cost structure in 2021. Right now we have to leverage the assets we have today and grow in capacity and experience till such time,"" Oommen said.
Jio has been allocated spectrum in 28 gigahertz to run 5G trials. The company showcased demonstration of driverless car using 5G technology from Swedish telecom gear maker Ericsson.
Ericsson’s head-South East Asia, Oceania and India, Nunzio Mirtillo, said cost of data on per gigabyte basis will be far cheaper in 5G technology compared to 4G.
“We have done a study in India. 5G will enable a $27 billion business opportunity in India by 2026 and big part of this market will be captured by operators like Jio,"" Mirtillo said.

542,2018-10-29,Reliance,"Reliance's refineries processed crude from the nearby Middle East and sold fuel to fast-growing markets in North Asia including China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. That began to change when India's oil demand surged

Singapore/New Delhi: Reliance Industries, currently India’s second most valuable listed company, got rich by trading fuel across Asia, Africa and Europe while effectively ignoring its home market. Reliance’s refineries processed crude from the nearby Middle East and sold fuel to fast-growing markets in North Asia including China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. That began to change when India’s oil demand surged, overtaking Japan as the world’s third-biggest consumer. Reliance took more interest in the country’s retail fuel sector and has opened more than 1,300 service stations. 
Singapore/New Delhi: Reliance Industries, currently India’s second most valuable listed company, got rich by trading fuel across Asia, Africa and Europe while effectively ignoring its home market. Reliance’s refineries processed crude from the nearby Middle East and sold fuel to fast-growing markets in North Asia including China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. That began to change when India’s oil demand surged, overtaking Japan as the world’s third-biggest consumer. Reliance took more interest in the country’s retail fuel sector and has opened more than 1,300 service stations.
This push into the domestic fuel market may stumble after India’s government imposed cost controls on Oct. 4 on petrol and diesel prices to rein in recent record highs.
Reliance’s shares plunged 6.9 percent on the day of the announcement and are down about 20 percent since their record close on Aug. 28. The decline has pushed Reliance’s market capitalization down to  ₹ 6.64 trillion ($90.47 billion) and it is no longer India’s most valuable company, sitting behind Tata Consultancy Services Ltd at  ₹ 6.77 trillion.
The price shock, driven by soaring crude import costs, angered consumers and triggered riots by farmers, forcing the government to react at the cost of its refiners’ health. For now, Reliance is staying with its retail plans despite the recent trouble.
“When prices are cut, you have to effectively match it,"" said Venkatachari Srikanth, Reliance’s joint chief financial officer, during their earnings presentation on Oct. 17. “We are not going to let this alter broadly our strategy on retail petroleum.""
In line with that, Reliance is planning as many as 2,000 retail stations with oil major BP Plc over the next three years, local media reported on Tuesday.
Reliance’s domestic push made sense in an Asian fuel market that is increasingly crowded with new refinery capacity from the Middle East, Southeast Asia and China.
The new capacity, combined with soaring crude prices, has eroded profit margins for producing refined fuels.
With the domestic market now also under pressure from price controls, some analysts have been spooked.
Sukrit Vijayakar, director of Indian oil consultancy Trifecta said the government move could “be disastrous for Reliance.""
The retail move puts Reliance into competition against government controlled refiners like Bharat Petroleum Corp, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Indian Oil Corp, the country’s biggest refiner.
Reliance’s domestic strategy initially won the backing of investors and the retail fuels group was touted by company Chairman Mukesh Ambani in a speech at its annual general meeting in July.
Between January and August, Reliance’s shares soared 45 percent, far outpacing the state-owned refiners as well as India’s main stock index, the Nifty 50, which gained 12.5 percent.
But rising crude prices, which jumped from under $70 per barrel in early 2018 to around $85 in early October, and a tumbling rupee combined to push domestic fuel prices to records, undermining Reliance’s retail strategy despite some relief from a dip in crude prices in recent weeks.
Still, Rohit Ahuja, senior vice president of India’s BOB Capital Markets, which has a buy rating on Reliance, said signs of an “oil price shock"" in India were “already visible.""
Reliance may gradually mothball its retail stations because of the cost controls, said Macquarie Capital Ltd Analyst Aditya Suresh in a note on Oct. 5, though the bank expects no meaningful impact on its earnings.
EXPORT MARKET & IMO 2020
Reliance may be better placed to thrive on exports despite the increasing competition in Asia and the Middle East.
The company operates the world’s biggest refinery complex at the port of Jamnagar in Gujarat. The first Jamnagar plant can process 663,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude while the second site can process another 709,000 bpd.
Reliance’s refining margins last quarter were at a premium of $3.40 per barrel over the average Singapore margin, the benchmark for Asia.
However, the Singapore margin has dropped by about 50 percent since mid-2017 because of rising crude prices. Reliance also said in its results that fewer refinery outages last quarter meant global run rates were high.
Still, Reliance’s refineries benefit from being among the most modern in the world. Several units process residual fuel oil, the leftovers after crude oil is initially refined, into higher-value petrol and distillate products as well as remove pollutants such as sulphur. 
That ability to cut its high-sulphur fuel oil output to nearly nothing while maximising its diesel fuel output gives Reliance an advantage as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will require new low-sulphur fuel oil used in ships starting in 2020.
“IMO regulations are positive because of our mid-distillate configuration,"" said Reliance’s Srikanth.
With a move towards cleaner fuels as part of IMO, BOB Capital’s Ahuja said Reliance’s gross refining margins could rise by up to $5 per barrel. 
Beyond IMO 2020 and the Indian fuel price turmoil, the oil industry is threatened by the rise of electric vehicles and alternative fuels that could reduce oil’s use as a transport fuel. Refiners are looking at petrochemicals to replace potentially lost demand in the transport sector.
“If I have to look at it from a ‘oil demand hit from electric vehicles’ perspective, it’s going to be petrochemicals that’s going to survive for them (Reliance) beyond ten years,"" said Ahuja.
Combined, Reliance’s refining and marketing group along with its petrochemicals division contribute more than 90 percent of the overall company revenues, its latest annual report showed.
Under Reliance’s “Oil to Chemicals Journey"" strategy the company is seeking to “upgrade all of our fuels to high value petrochemicals"" over the next decade.
“We are focusing to produce and sell at every level,"" said Reliance’s Srikanth. “Between whether to sell domestically or on bulk, whether we will export, every day is an analysis of which is a better option."""

Mumbai: In June 2015, when Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) chairman Mukesh Ambani said retail and telecom would be the sunrise sectors for the company, many investors were sceptical. Three years on, Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd have jointly crossed revenues of RIL’s petrochemicals business, for long its second-largest revenue generator after oil refining and marketing. 
Mumbai: In June 2015, when Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) chairman Mukesh Ambani said retail and telecom would be the sunrise sectors for the company, many investors were sceptical. Three years on, Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd have jointly crossed revenues of RIL’s petrochemicals business, for long its second-largest revenue generator after oil refining and marketing.
During the July-September quarter, RIL’s retail, media and telecom businesses recorded a combined revenue of  ₹ 44,615 crore, exceeding the  ₹ 43,745 crore sales reported by the company’s petrochemicals segment. Refining and marketing continues to be RIL’s biggest revenue generator, fetching  ₹ 98,760 crore in the quarter.
Revenues in Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio grew 121% and 52%, respectively, during the quarter compared with those a year earlier, while revenue from petrochemicals grew 56%. RIL’s consolidated revenue for the quarter stood at  ₹ 1.56 trillion, up 54.5% from  ₹ 1.01 trillion a year ago. 
“This is a marked change for a company, which was identified by its refining and petrochemicals businesses,"" an analyst tracking RIL said on condition of anonymity.
Revenues of the digital services business, or Reliance Jio, grew 52% to  ₹ 10,942 crore. The telecom company added 37 million subscribers during the quarter, compared with 28.7 million in the preceding three months. RIL’s media business saw its revenue grow almost fourfold to  ₹ 1,237 crore from what it was a year ago.
Speaking at an awards ceremony in London in March, Ambani had credited his son Akash and daughter Isha, for inspiring him to enter the telecom segment in 2011.
“Isha and Akash belong to India’s young generation that is far more creative, far more ambitious and far more impatient to become the best in the world,"" Ambani had said. “These young Indians convinced me that broadband internet is the defining technology of our age and India cannot be left behind.""
RIL has pumped nearly $31 billion into its digital services business, forcing smaller telecom companies to shut shop and pushing Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd into a merger that has relegated Bharti Airtel Ltd to the second position. Reliance Jio is seen overtaking Vodafone Idea and Airtelto become India’s largest telecom firm by 2018-end, according to a Mint report on 22 October.
Meanwhile, Reliance Retail, which operates across various product categories and formats, saw its revenue more than double to  ₹ 32,436 crore. Reliance Retail now has 9,146 stores across more than 5,800 towns and cities.

“If it’s not big, it’s not exciting for RIL. So, when we realized that the concept of fresh fruits and vegetables could be turned into an organized retailing segment, we began our operations with Reliance Fresh,"" an RIL executive said on condition of anonymity. “And our bets turned sweeter with the consumption boom that is happening in India.""
Last year, Ambani had set Reliance Retail a target of 30% annual growth over the next 10 years.
This growth, the executive cited above added, would be led by higher contribution from sales of high-margin goods, including electronics and apparel.

Mumbai: Dena Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, two dissenting financial creditors of debt-ridden textile maker Alok Industries Ltd, have withdrawn their applications against the resolution professional (RP) from the bankruptcy court, after being assured of recovery at par with lenders who had approved the resolution plan, court documents showed.
“It is further requested that Dena Bank shall be treated at par with the assenting financial creditor for payment of the money under the resolution plan dated 12 April, 2018, in view of the order passed by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) dated 12 September,"" said an order by the Ahmedabad NCLT on 22 October.
Dissenting financial creditors are those lenders who have either abstained from voting or voted against the resolution plan approved by the committee of creditors (CoC). 
The appellate tribunal—NCLAT—had clarified in its order in a different case on 12 September, 2018 that “no discrimination can be made between the financial creditors in the resolution plan on the ground that one has dissented and voted against the resolution plan or the other has supported and voted in favour of the resolution plan"".
Both banks had earlier objected to Reliance Industries (RIL)-JM Financial ARC resolution plan for Alok Industries which envisaged buying the company, which owes lenders  ₹ 29,600 crore, for just  ₹ 5,050 crore. The liquidation value of Alok Industries is  ₹ 4,200 crore, while the resolution plan from Reliance offered  ₹ 5,050 crore upfront.
A lawyer aware of the development said, both the lenders have been assured by the committee of creditors (CoC) that they will be at par with other creditors in terms of loan recovery. “Kotak Mahindra Bank was the first one to approach the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and Dena Bank followed,"" he said.
Emails send to Dena Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, resolution professional Ajay Joshi and Reliance Industries did not elicit any response.
The textile company is among the 12 large stressed assets identified in June 2017 by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), where lenders were directed to initiate proceedings under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
The company’s resolution plan was initially rejected by lenders in April 2018 after only 70% voted in its favour. However, lenders re-voted on the proposal in June 2018 after the government lowered the CoC approval threshold from 75% to 66%. This time, 72% lenders approved RIL’s resolution plan.
The Financial Express reported on 26 April that steps taken by the resolution professional (RP) for Alok Industries to recover trade outstanding to the tune of  ₹ 11,622 crore from 5,293 debtors of the textile company remained unsuccessful as 2,467 of them could not be traced.
“Debtors were not locatable at the addresses that were provided by Alok Industries,"" the Financial Express said, citing documents, understood to have been made available to the CoC ahead of a meeting scheduled for 13 April under the IBC process.

HSBC Holdings Plc. has executed a trade finance deal using blockchain for an export by Reliance Industries Ltd to US-based Tricon Energy, marking the first ever overseas blockchain payment from India. Mint explains what it means for the payments ecosystem. 
HSBC Holdings Plc. has executed a trade finance deal using blockchain for an export by Reliance Industries Ltd to US-based Tricon Energy, marking the first ever overseas blockchain payment from India. Mint explains what it means for the payments ecosystem.
Why was blockchain used in a trade finance deal? 
In the case of Reliance Industries, the letter of credit (LC) was issued by ING Bank for Tricon Energy USA, the importer. HSBC India was the advising and negotiating bank for Reliance Industries. In LC-based trade finance transactions, physical documents have to be validated by multiple parties from across different countries, making these a time-consuming affair (5-10 days). With blockchain, the data can be segregated and the whole process completed within, say, 24 hours, and in a transparent manner, with the status of the process visible to every party.
How has blockchain been adopted for such transactions? 
In March, HSBC and ING Bank executed a live trade finance deal for Cargill using enterprise blockchain firm R3’s Corda scalable blockchain platform and the help of tech services provider CryptoBLK. The exchange was done in 24 hours, said HSBC. On 23 September, SBI Ripple Asia said a Japanese consortium of 15 banks would use Ripple’s blockchain tech for payments and settlement. On 24 October, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Wells Fargo, Brighann Cotton undertook a transaction involving a shipment of cotton from Texas to Qingdao using a distributed ledger for all parties.
How many banks are on a blockchain? 
JP Morgan announced the expansion of its Interbank Information Network to include over 75 banks. Banks in India formed “Bankchain"" alliance to explore blockchain-based solutions.
Can blockchain be used for remittances? 
Remittance transactions cost a small fortune as these involve third parties. Blockchain solutions may cut transaction costs and make the process faster. Platforms specializing in remittances such as Bitspark and BitPesa use block-chain tech to send money across borders. TransferGo Now lets Indian customers make instant money transfers to India from Europe using Ripple’s blockchain tech, which it claims is faster than using the payment system of the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication.
What has RBI said? 
Though RBI said that banks could set up a “private blockchain for their internal purposes"", there are security concerns. First, block-chain should not be positioned as a cure for all banking ills. Second, a June McAfee report warns against placing undue trust in blockchain implementation. Third, most such implementations are permissioned (private). In a permission-less blockchain such as bitcoin, anyone can set up a node and join the network. The question, then, is: Does a permissioned blockchain qualify as a true blockchain implementation?"
530,2018-11-06,Reliance,"Reliance Jio sources indicated that the operator has a plan on alternate digital KYC and will roll it out soon

New Delhi: Large telecom operators including Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel have begun rolling out an ‘alternate digital KYC process’ for new connections, which will replace Aadhaar-based electronic verification process. 
New Delhi: Large telecom operators including Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel have begun rolling out an ‘alternate digital KYC process’ for new connections, which will replace Aadhaar-based electronic verification process.
Reliance Jio sources indicated that the operator has a plan on alternate digital KYC and will roll it out soon.
However, it is not immediately clear if telecom service providers are, for now, continuing Aadhaar eKYC for verification of new subscribers.
In the wake of the recent Supreme Court verdict on Aadhaar, the Telecom Department had, last week, issued detailed instructions to telcos on stopping the use of Aadhaar-based electronic-know your customer (e-KYC) and had asked them to report compliance by November 5. But operators, subsequently, approached the government requesting that they be allowed to continue with Aadhaar-based eKYC process till November 20, while they implement the new digital process. Sources in the Bharti Airtel told PTI that the alternate digital KYC process has begun in select circles including Delhi, UP (East) and UP (West) and will be extended to other locations in the coming days.
The official who did not wish to be named said the new digital KYC process entails scanning of the proof of address and identity, embedding live customer photo and online customer acquisition form, and that the entire process will be digital.
The official further pointed out that the company will be phasing out the eKYC process, as the digital KYC system is rolled out to new locations, and stablises.
An email sent to Bharti Airtel in this regard remained unanswered.
Vodafone Idea, in a statement, confirmed its new digital KYC process is live and is being rolled out nationally, and added that the DoT instructions allow for provisional roll out of digital KYC.
Reliance Jio did not respond to an e-mail query but sources indicated that for alternate digital KYC process, the company has a plan in place and will start rolling it out soon.
Aadhaar issuing-body Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) could not be reached for comments. However, a person familiar with provisions of Aadhaar Act was of the view that it may be difficult for the UIDAI to immediately pull the plug on telecom-related authentications as Section 32(3) of the Act prohibits it from collecting or maintaining any information about the specific purpose of an authentication. The Supreme Court had in a landmark verdict in September restricted the use of Aadhaar by private entities in the absence of a legal provision. 
On October 26, the telecom department asked operators to stop using Aadhaar for electronic verification of existing mobile phone customers as well as for issuing new connections to comply with the SC order. The Department of Telecom (DoT) in its October 26 circular had also taken note of the fact that the industry mooted an alternate process for KYC (know your customer) which entailed customer acquisition forms to be embedded with live photo of the subscriber and scanned images of proof of identity and proof of address -- thereby digitising the end-to-end process for on-boarding of new mobile subscribers and making it paperless.
Accordingly, all telecom service providers were asked by the Department of Telecom (DoT) to ensure readiness of their systems and offer the proof of concept of the proposed digital process by November 5 for approval.

 Mumbai: At least three companies will see their respective initial public offering (IPO) approvals from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) expire this month, almost 12 months after receiving the regulator’s nod. 
The companies—Anil Ambani-led Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd, Baring Private Equity Asia-owned CMS Infosystems Ltd and shipping company Seven Islands Shipping—had filed their draft red herring prospectus in September-October 2017. Collectively, the firms planned to raise  ₹ 3,500-4,000 crore from the markets. 
According to Sebi’s website, while Seven Islands Shipping’s IPO approval lapses on 10 November, those of Reliance General Insurance and CMS Info Systems expire on 29 and 30 November, respectively.
Sebi’s approval for an IPO is valid for one year. Last month, Gandhar Oil Refinery (India) Ltd‘s approval lapsed after it failed to launch its IPO within the 12-month period. 
Several companies allowing their IPO approvals to lapse reflects the difficult conditions in India’s primary markets, which have also seen several high-profile deals get postponed due to lack of investor enthusiasm. Secondary market volatility and other macroeconomic headwinds, such as crude price and rupee depreciation, have also impacted investor interest in  public offers. 
“Markets have been very volatile this year and valuations, especially, in the mid- and small-cap segments have corrected significantly compared to last year. As a result, pricing deals is a challenge from all perspectives,"" an investment banker, who advises clients on IPOs, said on condition of anonymity. 
Some companies might file their offer documents again and take fresh approvals with the hope that markets will improve early next year or after the general elections next year, he added. 
Recently, Prince Pipes and Fittings Ltd re-filed its draft prospectus with Sebi. The company had earlier filed its draft papers in September 2017. 
“The management is evaluating all possible options and is yet to take a final decision on re-filing, given the volatility in the market and uncertainties surrounding the general elections,"" said a Gandhar Oil Refinery spokesperson. 
Emails sent to Reliance General Insurance, CMS Info Systems and Seven Islands Shipping, enquiring about their IPO plans, remain unanswered till press time. 
In 2017, 36 companies had raised  ₹ 67,147 crore through the IPO route, while 24 companies have raised  ₹ 0,959 crore so far this year, data from primary market tracker Prime Database show."

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has begun work on its  ₹ 10,000 crore Jio Institute, which is slated to be a centre for medicine, liberal arts and sports, and was accorded the “institution of eminence"" tag by the centre under the greenfield category, triggering controversy. The Jio Institute, which will operate under the Reliance Foundation Institution of Education and Research (RFIER), a company under the ambit of Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, is consolidating land.
“RIL is setting up the institute in Karjat, Raigad. RIL plans to add more land to the existing bank of 800 acres. This is necessary as land is needed in parcels for a world-class institute to be set up,"" said an official aware of the development.
RIL chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani and his wife Nita Ambani will be the first members of the governing council of Jio Institute, while daughter Isha Ambani is a director at RFIER.
The governing council of the institute shall include a chancellor, a vice chancellor, a maximum of six members who shall be experts in academia, industry and other fields, besides a maximum of seven members will be nominated by Reliance Foundation, including the permanent members.
RIL has been planning to set up the institute for nearly a decade. At RIL’s 37th annual general meeting in 2011, Ambani had announced his plan to set up a “world-class, multi-disciplinary university"" in Maharashtra. He had also announced the formation of Reliance Foundation with a planned contribution of  ₹ 500 crore from RIL.
“We do not have institutes that figure in top 500 in the Times Higher Education and QS World University Rankings. So the idea is to set up an institute that can figure in these rankings. Besides, we would have an international mix of students and faculty. It should also have sufficient land and financial, academic and administrative autonomy,"" said the official quoted above.
Phase one of the Jio Institute will be completed in 3-4 years. It should be able to qualify in international rankings within 10 years.
“It is a tough calling, and Reliance Industries is putting in place all the resources,"" said another official, requesting anonymity.
A total of 114 institutions had applied for the “institutions of eminence"" tag.
Public institutions that have the tag would get  ₹ 1,000 crore in special funding and autonomy to bolster their efforts to become world class institutes. Private ones would, however, get only the autonomy. The ministry of human resource development (HRD) had faced flak after it conferred the “institute of eminence"" tag on Jio Institute.
The HRD ministry named three public and three private institutes as recipients of the tag. The list includes Jio Institute, Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, and the Indian Institutes of Technology in Mumbai and Delhi.
Jio Institute beat 27 existing private institutions, including Ashoka University, O.P. Jindal University and Azim Premji University, which had applied, to get the coveted tag. Jio Institute also plans to invest surplus money lying with RFIER in securities, including debentures, debenture-stocks, bonds, and any other money market instrument, subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013."

Mumbai: Reliance Jio has been the only gainer in the telecom sector in August from a revenue-per-user as well as profitability perspectives, helping it increase the market share sweepstake to 20.8%, says a report. 
Mumbai: Reliance Jio has been the only gainer in the telecom sector in August from a revenue-per-user as well as profitability perspectives, helping it increase the market share sweepstake to 20.8%, says a report.
The Mukesh Ambani-led teleco’s market share rose to 20.8% in August from 19.6% in July, against Vodafone Idea’s subscriber market to 37.9%, making it the market leader.
Jio, already the third biggest by number of subscribers, added the maximum number subscribers at 12.2 million, driven majorly by its 4G feature phone launch, it said, adding the competition reported flat numbers or even a decline from the year-ago levels.
On the average revenue per user (Arpu) front, the incumbent telcos have taken a hit due to Jio’s aggressive marketing strategy over the past two years, it said.
At an Arpu of Rs135, Jio is an “outlier"" as this was the highest in the industry in Q1 as against 100-105 for competition. But the same fell steeply to Rs131.7 per user in the second quarter but still managed to report higher net income of Rs681 crore.
Against this, Bharti Airtel, which was the largest player before the Vodafone-Idea merger reported a steep 65.7% plunge in net income for the September quarter to Rs118.80 crore as its Arpu declined 29% to Rs101 from Rs142 in the same period last year.
The merged entity of Vodafone Idea will announce its second quarter numbers Wednesday.
Key players are now focussing low tariff plans coupled with large data allowance at a low price, which is further putting downward pressure on Arpu levels, it said.
From a profitability perspective, it said Jio’s pretax margins were stable at 32% for the last two quarters, but the same period saw second largest telco Bharti Airtel’s margins sliding by 4.40%.
“Bharti has lost 12% of its annual revenue in India during the last six months, mostly to Jio. Also, Bharti’s margin declined to 31% in the first half from 38% a year ago, attributable to increased competition and low Arpu realisation,"" it explained.

New Delhi: Dassault Aviation’s chief executive officer (CEO) Eric Trappier on Tuesday said it was his company that chose Reliance Defence as its offset partners in the Rafale fighter jet deal and that the choice was not dictated by the Indian government as claimed by former French President Francois Hollande. 
New Delhi: Dassault Aviation’s chief executive officer (CEO) Eric Trappier on Tuesday said it was his company that chose Reliance Defence as its offset partners in the Rafale fighter jet deal and that the choice was not dictated by the Indian government as claimed by former French President Francois Hollande.
The remarks, made in an interview to ANI news agency, come as a blow to the Congress, whose president Rahul Gandhi has led the attack against the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government on the issue. According to Gandhi, the French manufacturer of the medium multi-role combat aircraft was forced to choose Reliance as its offset partner.
The Dassault Aviation CEO also said that his company’s investments were not being put into Reliance but in the joint venture Dassault Reliance Aerospace Ltd.
“We chose Ambani by ourselves,"" Trappier said. “We already have 30 partners other than Reliance. The Indian Air Force is supporting the deal because they need the fighter jets for their own defence to be at the top,"" he said. 
“We are not putting any money in Reliance. The money is going into the joint venture. We are supposed to put in this company together some  ₹ 800 crore as 50:50,"" he said.
The Rafale deal is in the eye of a storm with the Congress party accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government of corruption and ordering 36 of the planes at a much higher price than what was negotiated by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government. 
The Rafale was shortlisted in 2012 but with India deciding to buy 18 in a fly-away condition and seeking to manufacture 108 in the country, Dassault Aviation entered into talks, which became protracted, with state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) on manufacturing the aircraft in India. 
On Monday, the NDA government told the Supreme Court that the contract negotiations could not be concluded then mainly because of lack of agreement between HAL and Dassault Aviation on issues, including the number of man hours needed to manufacture the Rafale in India. 
French journal Mediapart on 21 September quoted former president Hollande as saying Dassault Aviation was given no choice but to partner Reliance Group.

522,2018-11-15,Reliance,"A more aggressive stance from Vodafone Idea will make the market share battle against Reliance Jio and Airtel uglier. As such, things may get worse before they get better on the profitability front

Vodafone Idea Ltd is down but not out. Its financial results are a mess. The recently merged company reported a pro forma Ebitda of  ₹ 977 crore for the September quarter, at margins of just 8.1%. At the time Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd announced their merger, margins were far more healthy at 26.5% and profits were more than five times higher than current levels. Bharti Airtel Ltd had also reported Ebitda margins of about 21% for its India wireless business last quarter. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. 
Vodafone Idea Ltd is down but not out. Its financial results are a mess. The recently merged company reported a pro forma Ebitda of  ₹ 977 crore for the September quarter, at margins of just 8.1%. At the time Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd announced their merger, margins were far more healthy at 26.5% and profits were more than five times higher than current levels. Bharti Airtel Ltd had also reported Ebitda margins of about 21% for its India wireless business last quarter. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Vodafone Idea will be quick to point out that this great divide with Airtel’s margins will get bridged after accounting for synergy benefits. But note that even after these savings kick in, profit will be merely enough to meet interest costs.
“Current annualized Ebitda plus synergy gains could mean a baseline Ebitda of  ₹ 10,000-12,000 crore. This would not leave much to spend on capex after paying interest,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients.
What’s more, Vodafone Idea’s net debt stands at about 10 times these estimated Ebitda figures. As such, there is a desperate need to deleverage and raise funds for capital expenditure. Though Airtel is smaller in revenue terms, its capex is more than 2.5 times that of Vodafone Idea.
Capex constraints are reflecting in revenue market shares. Vodafone Idea’s pro forma revenues fell 7.1% sequentially in Q2, much higher than the 2.2% decline reported by Airtel.
It’s against this backdrop that the company has announced fundraising plans of  ₹ 25,000 crore (about $3.5 billion), of which more than  ₹ 18,000 crore will come from the promoters. At the current share price, this could mean a dilution of around 69% in the company’s equity. However, the news could lead to a rally in the stock, leading to lower dilution.
Vodafone Group Plc has indicated that it will bring in about $1.5 billion, which is a positive surprise. When the merger was announced, the UK-based company seemed keen on reducing its exposure to India, rather than increasing or even maintaining its stake. For now, plans to bring down its 45% stake in the Indian business on a par with that of the Aditya Birla Group (which is currently at 26%) seem to have been put on the back burner. Note that the Vodafone Group can raise funds by selling its stake in the Infratel-Indus Towers firm, and needn’t necessarily tap the parent company for a fresh infusion of funds. Vodafone Idea also said that it is looking at some asset sales to raise more cash.
ALSO READ | Vodafone Idea is India’s largest telco and also its most vulnerable
A moot question is if the ammunition provided by the fundraise will make things better or worse on the tariff front. It’s quite likely that a more aggressive stance from Vodafone Idea will make the market share battle uglier, especially as Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is still a long distance away from its target of 50% revenue market share. As such, things may get worse before they get better on the profitability front.
Of course, it goes without saying that Vodafone Idea has little choice but to raise cash quickly and deleverage, and provide room for its capex plans to defend its market share. Whether this will be enough is anybody’s guess."

Saudi Aramco and Adnoc signed agreements to invest in a proposed 60-million tonne refinery in Ratnagiri, Maharashtra, while Rosneft and partners acquired Essar Oil Ltd.
Shell has restarted retailing gasoline and diesel in the country, while Total partnered the Adani Group to set up liquefied natural gas import terminals and fuel retailing business. Last year, BP Plc expanded its partnership with Reliance to retail auto fuels.
Demand for fuel in India and the Middle East will make the two regions bigger oil consumers than the European Union by 2030, driven mainly by diesel for trucks and petrochemicals feedstock, according to the IEA.
Reliance is looking to process the dirtiest and heaviest crude and may focus on producing feedstock for petrochemicals, the people said.
The expansion plan is still under discussion and hasn’t been finalized, the people said. A feasibility report is likely to be prepared by the end of next year, once the recently-expanded petrochemicals capacities stabilize, and Reliance is expected to make the final investment decision with an aim to start work in 2020, the people said.
The company had considered expanding its refining capacity in the past, and in 2013-14 it sought environment approval for the project. Reliance didn’t move ahead with the plan as it focused on increasing downstream chemicals capacities and building the telecom business."
515,2018-11-21,Reliance,"If anything, Reliance Jio may need to step the ante, considering that incremental market share gains may be more difficult to come by from Airtel and Vodafone Idea

Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd jumped 9.3% and 16.5%, respectively, last Friday, and have retained most of those gains so far this week. Some investors got excited about rumours that Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is set to raise tariffs. While there is little doubt that an increase in tariffs will bring much relief to telecom companies, the big question is if such a move is on the cards to begin with. 
Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd jumped 9.3% and 16.5%, respectively, last Friday, and have retained most of those gains so far this week. Some investors got excited about rumours that Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is set to raise tariffs. While there is little doubt that an increase in tariffs will bring much relief to telecom companies, the big question is if such a move is on the cards to begin with.
Reliance Jio hasn’t shied away from high amounts of cash burn to grow its market share at a quick pace. In less than two years of operations, it has grown to 23% of the market. Its share has risen further in the September quarter, although industry numbers are yet to be released by the sector regulator. Even so, the company is still a long distance away from its aspirational target of a 50% market share.
In this backdrop, analysts are surprised that such a move is being considered in the first place. “It would be premature, in our view, to presume Reliance would lift tariffs soon given its clear intent for market leadership,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients. 
The brokerage firm estimates that competitive pressures may not ebb for another 9-12 months, given Jio’s clear focus on subscriber addition.
“The timing of the rumoured move is suspect, especially given Vodafone Idea’s recent announcement of a $3.5 billion fundraising plan,"" says an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm. 
If anything, Reliance Jio may need to step the ante, considering that incremental market share gains may be more difficult to come by from two fairly well-capitalized companies, as opposed to early gains that came partly from firms that were on their way out.
Of course, it must be noted here that Jio’s stance thus far has been to maintain tariffs at levels that are about 20% cheaper than competition. If it raises tariffs, incumbents may be expected to maintain the differential by raising their own tariffs. Not that they would complain, given the rising cash burn in their own operations. But given this dynamic, it will be interesting to see how tariffs are calibrated, if at all."

New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm will serve the country’s largest and most sought-after accounts in telecom - the railways - from January 1, with officials saying it is likely to slash the national transporter’s phone bills by around 35% at least. 
New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm will serve the country’s largest and most sought-after accounts in telecom - the railways - from January 1, with officials saying it is likely to slash the national transporter’s phone bills by around 35% at least.
Railways has been using Bharati Airtel for over six years as its telecom provider for 1.95 lakh mobile phone connections used by its employees in closed user group (CUG) across the country for which the railways paid around  ₹ 100 crore bill per year, they said. Its validity will expire on December 31 this year. A Railway Board order issued on November 20 said it “had assigned the responsibility to RailTel (railway PSU) for finalisation of fresh CUG scheme for Indian Railways as the validity of the existing scheme is expiring on December 31, 2018. Fresh CUG scheme had since been finalised by RailTel and Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited has been awarded the contract to implement the scheme."" “The fresh CUG will come into effect from January 1, 2019,"" said the order which detailed the tariff rates to be provided by the company. Closed User group (CUG) is a supplementary service provided by the mobile operators to subscribers who can make and receive calls from any member associated within the group. This service is applicable for SMS also.
Under the scheme, Reliance Jio, the latest entrant in the telecom market, will provide 4G/3G connections and calls will be free of charge. The company will provide four packages to railways - one for its senior most officials (two percent subscribers) - a 60 GB plan with a monthly rental of  ₹ 125, a 45 GB plan at a monthly rental of  ₹ 99 for its joint secretary level officers (26% subscribers), a 30 GB plan at a rental of  ₹ 67 for Group C staff (72% subscribers) and a  ₹ 49 rental plan for bulk SMS. For regular subscribers, a 25 GB plan of Jio is available for  ₹ 199 and subscribers have to pay  ₹ 20 per GB thereafter to top up their plans. Railway employees have to pay  ₹ 10 for 2 GB of extra data they use and more thereafter, according to the plan worked out by Jio.
While under the present scheme railways is charged for calls outside CUG, the plan from January 1 will not do so. Also, the 3G/4G data pack in effect from next year is much cheaper than the present packs available to railways. “While Airtel is serving around 1.95 lakh railway subscribers, Jio will serve 3.78 lakh personnel of the railways, and because of the increase in the numbers, we are getting a better deal from the service provider. As a result of this, we are likely to reduce our phone bill by around 35%,"" a senior official said. Last month, Reliance Jio Infocomm had emerged as the lowest bidder for the account beating Airtel and Vodafone. Sources say that while railways had demanded free calls from the bidders and got it from all of them, it was the low cost data that pushed Jio as the frontrunner.

Mumbai: Entities linked to one of the promoters of Yes Bank have paid  ₹ 400 crore to two mutual funds from whom they had raised funds by pledging shares. The entities are understood to be linked to the close family members of Rana Kapoor, the chief executive and one of the promoters of the bank.
While Rana Kapoor and his family own 10.7%, Madhu Kapur, his sister-in-law and the widow of the 26/11 victim Ashok Kapur and her family, own 9.8% in the fifth largest private sector lender.
The Kapoor family paid  ₹ 200 crore each to Reliance Mutual Fund and Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund, sources said Monday, adding this was a prepayment of the due amount.
With this payment, the overall outstanding of the promoter group’s borrowing has come down to  ₹ 1,400 crore, they added.
The promoter group entities are understood to have borrowed by pledging shares for investing in other ventures and have paid off once the adequate liquidity was available, they said.
After the Reserve Bank of India curtailed Rana Kapoor’s tenure at the helm of the bank to 31 January 2019, the share price of the bank has more than halved, which raised concerns among the mutual funds, as the shares were the primary security against which the loans were given and fund houses feared booking mark-to-market losses.
Kapoor reportedly invited the regulatory ire after the bank had underreported NPAs worth more than  ₹ 10,000 crore in FY16 and FY17.
The overall security cover is valued at  ₹ 5,000 crore at the current stock price, which is over three times the outstanding, the people claimed—though it is not exactly known at what price the shares were trading, when they were pledged or when the money was raised.
Kapoor had said he did not intend to sell his holding in the bank, even after he leaves the bank.
A news report on Monday said there was no breach of covenants in borrowing against shares done by the promoters/promoter family and added the scrip may witness choppy trade.
On Monday, Yes Bank shares fell 3.9% to  ₹ 187.95 on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex rose 1.07% to end the day at 35,354.08 points."
518,2018-11-26,Reliance,"Smartphones and Reliance Jio are driving content consumption in Rural India

Over the past year, several young founders boasting impeccable academic credentials and work experience have been moving to small town India, launching hyperlocal news apps funded by venture capital firms (VCs), like LocalPlay, Lokal, Awaaz, and Circle.  
Over the past year, several young founders boasting impeccable academic credentials and work experience have been moving to small town India, launching hyperlocal news apps funded by venture capital firms (VCs), like LocalPlay, Lokal, Awaaz, and Circle. 
LocalPlay is focused only on Moradabad, Circle gives you news about Agra, Mathura, Vrindavan; Lokal focuses on three districts across Telengana and Andhra Pradesh; and Awaaz across Uttar Pradesh. All are non-English and primarily use video snippets.
Smartphones and Jio driving content
Traditionally, Indian hyperlocal news has been the backwaters of print and regional TV. There wasn’t a serious business model for the largely ad-led nature of our media business, which meant any product catering to rural small town readers was unattractive for advertisers. Given this, it is interesting to see the sudden surge of interest in hyperlocal vernacular video news apps. 
What has changed that we are seeing a number of startups emerging in this space? Two recent inter-related trends matter—spread of smartphones, which total about ~380 million at last count, deep into India2 (my short hand for the less-affluent non-English speaking India), the Jio effect, which has seen data prices fall by a tenth, and over tenfold rise in data consumption since its launch.
India2 doesn’t consume much text, instead it gorges on video. Increasingly short-form video content has emerged as the dominant media unit of India, spurring the emergence of homegrown social networks such as ShareChat, Clip, and Mooshak, as well as the rise of news aggregators such as DailyHunt, NewsPoint and NewsDog. And now they are driving the rise of hyperlocal news apps built around video. 
Monitoring, monetizing challenges
The short video content in these apps is typically supplied by newspaper / TV “stringers"". They are paid  ₹ 50-250 per video, though the odd likely-to-go viral video may well be purchased for a higher amount. Supply is not an issue —there is enough free content as well, which however needs to be authenticated, and “produced"" or upgraded for release. 
A start-up I spoke to estimated their annual cost for sourcing, authenticating, producing and distributing content (20-25 videos per day) to be close to  ₹ 40 lakh a year per district. The authentication part is critical, given what we see with the spread of fake news and rumours across Whatsapp and Facebook, especially with elections around the corner. The other business challenge is monetization. This isn’t a worry for now, because the VCs are paying for the product, which is free to consumers. All of the hyperlocal players believe at some point that they will be able to monetize their audiences via ads. I am not so sure, for in India, there has always been a considerable discount on vernacular audiences.
Market sizing, second order effects
The number of digital local language news consumers varies anywhere from 106 million (KPMG & Google, ’16) to 180 million (Reverie Inc. , an Indian language translation start-up). The ad market that caters this audience is pitifully small— ₹ 750 crore for FY18 in my estimate. This comprises  ₹ 300 crore for digital audiences of TV channels like Aaj Tak,  ₹ 250 crore for those of print news sites like Bhaskar and another  ₹ 200 crore online news sites such as DailyHunt.
So, 180 million audiences and  ₹ 750 crore =  ₹ 4 per user per year! Given that each district should yield about 50,000 monthly active users, we are looking at annual revenues of  ₹ 2 lakh. But, perhaps local newspapers are a better proxy, given that hyperlocal apps are high engagement products like them. Vernacular newspapers have 350 million readers and get  ₹ 15,000 crore print ads, that is,  ₹ 400 per user, which we can discount to say  ₹ 100 per user (excluding metro audiences and national ad flows). This has a potential annual ad revenue per district of  ₹ 50 lakh.
That said, these apps aren’t sitting still. They are expanding fast. With 30-40 districts and larger audiences, they will have access to national ads. And we will soon see new interaction models and use cases emerging, which will spur new business models as well—via subscriptions or as a platform for e-commerce or government interactions or like a social network like Nextdoor. As they grow, we will see established players such as Jagran or Eenadu, or perhaps even Chinese firms (as we saw with NewsDog, Helo) flock to this sector, attracted by the fast growth and valuations. 
Thanks to smartphones and cheap data, an entirely new sector has emerged. Only time will tell how it evolves and who will win.

Mumbai: HSBC on Tuesday raised its rating on Indian equities to “neutral"" from “underweight"", citing recent underperformance and more reasonable valuations.
“Since end-August, India underperformed because of issues in local banks, currency weakness and oil price volatility,"" HSBC analysts said in a note.
“Despite recent underperformance, these risks remain for Indian equity market. But investors’ holdings now lowest relative to history, valuations more reasonable, 2019e (expected) earnings growth highest in region,"" they said, adding, “We raise Indian equities from underweight to neutral in a regional context."" 
BSE’s 30-share Sensex rose 0.45% to close at 35,513.14 points on Tuesday, while the National Stock Exchange’s 50-share Nifty rose 0.54% to 10,685.60 points.
HSBC analysts said MSCI India EPS (earnings per share) growth consensus expectations are for 18.8% in 2018 and 24% in 2019, which means India is one of the fastest growing markets across the region.
However, five stocks—State Bank of India, Reliance Industries Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd—account for nearly half of all 2019 earnings growth, they said, expressing concerns that they estimate 65% market-cap weighted average earnings growth for these five stocks.
Against this background of high growth and the much-anticipated rate hikes, India’s valuation now appears fair and almost in line with the five-year average 12-month forward PE (price to earnings), they said, adding that it was still far from cheap as India trades at 17.4 times whereas MSCI AxJ trades at 11 times.
“Meanwhile, investors’ weights in India are now at historically low levels and there is an opportunity to add to this. In the past, elections have tended to be a key catalyst for performance,"" HSBC analysts said. “A key risk is the dependency on a few large-cap stocks for growth. These are mostly banks. Thus, rising NPLs (non-performing loans) can quickly and significantly change India’s earnings outlook,"" they warned.
The currency could weaken from here, prompting more interest rate hikes, while lower oil prices are supportive now, HSBC said, though it expects oil to rise in 2019-20."

The third follow-on fund offer (FFO) for the CPSE Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), which opened on 27 November, will close on 30 November. The CPSE ETF, a passive fund created to help the government manage its divestment in Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSE), was first launched in March 2014.  
The third follow-on fund offer (FFO) for the CPSE Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), which opened on 27 November, will close on 30 November. The CPSE ETF, a passive fund created to help the government manage its divestment in Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSE), was first launched in March 2014. 
The new fund will mirror stocks in the NSE CPSE Index which currently has 11 stocks across  seven industries.
However, you can also buy it after the ETF lists on stock exchanges. You will be able to buy and sell through the exchanges and will require a demat account to hold the fund units in.
What works?
The CPSE ETF is being managed by Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd and there is an upfront discount of 4.5% for all investors. This is a big advantage as you will get to buy the scheme in the FFO at a price lower than the current aggregate price of the portfolio. The AMC aims to raise  ₹ 8,000 crore in the FFO.
The expense ratio of this ETF is a low 0.0095% per annum. There has been a change in the composition of the underlying NSE CPSE Index with the inclusion of four new stocks from the power and construction sector and a reduction in exposure to oil and gas sector. The stocks in the portfolio are trading at a significant valuation discount as compared to Nifty 50 stocks and this, the asset manager feels, presents a good opportunity for upside.
What doesn’t?
Given that this is a part of the government’s disinvestment program, the choice of stocks is restricted. Public sector enterprises in the portfolio are trading at a discount which could be an opportunity for capital gains, but this also shows that these companies are struggling for market expansion and profitability.
It is a very concentrated portfolio, inherently making the structure high-risk; price fluctuations in one stock can impact overall net asset value heavily. Around 60% of the portfolio exposure comes from oil, petroleum and power sectors which makes the returns vulnerable to change in fortunes of stocks from these three sectors.
Invest if you want to take advantage of the discount, but the discount itself cannot assure gains as market prices could fall further. The long-term outlook of the underlying stocks relative to other large-cap private sector companies remains uncertain.

503,2018-11-30,Reliance,"Supreme Court directs Reliance Realty to furnish 1,400 crore as corporate guarantee to the govt within two days for the RCom-Jio deal

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the sale of spectrum by Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Communications Ltd to elder brother Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJio) on the condition that the seller furnishes  ₹ 1,400 crore as corporate guarantee to the government within two days.
This corporate guarantee, to be furnished by Reliance Realty, a unit of Reliance Communication Ltd (RCom), is in addition to the land parcel that has to be given as security, as directed by the Telecom Disputes and Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) in an October order.
The Supreme Court also asked the central government to grant a no-objection certificate (NOC) for the takeover of telecom assets with RJio within a week from receiving the corporate guarantee.
The centre had challenged a TDSAT October order, which rejected DoT’s plea seeking bank guarantees before approving the RCom-Jio deal. The tribunal had also asked RCom to not sell a land parcel worth   ₹ 1,400 crore for the time being so that it could act as a guarantee against the government’s demand for dues.
Kapil Sibal, counsel for RCom, opposed the furnishing of a bank guarantee as sought by the centre as the company was undergoing insolvency. He agreed that Reliance Realty would provide a corporate guarantee instead.
A corporate guarantee is enforceable against a corporate person and, therefore, may not be immediately cashable as opposed to a bank guarantee that is immediately cashable against a bank. The bank would then enforce its rights against the borrower.
Sibal asked for the NOC to be granted in time, saying, “If the NOC is not given in time, they will lose   ₹ 10,900 crore.""
Additional Solicitor General P.S. Narasimha opposed the furnishing of land parcels, telling the court that they did not belong to RCom, “Please see if this security is enough. We can’t go from pillar to post to recover money... one has to look at titles and the deal.""
Narasimha told the Supreme Court that the centre was looking for some kind of a security for the outstanding spectrum dues. He said the centre did not have details of encumbrance of the land offered by RCom as a guarantee.
Narasimha further argued that the telecom guidelines clearly mandate the government to secure outstanding dues only by bank guarantees, and by no other method.
In response to the centre’s plea, Sibal had said RCom was not in a position to make the payment as it was undergoing insolvency proceedings.
In October, TDSAT rejected a plea by the telecom department seeking bank guarantee of around   ₹ 2,940 crore for its outstanding liabilities before approving the RCom-RJio assets sale. 
The beleaguered telecom operator, which had been struggling with a mountain of debt and a failed merger with Aircel, finally decided to wind up its wireless business in December 2017.
Earlier, it had said that RCom will essentially become a business-to-business entity instead of a business-to-consumer company, and will provide submarine cable systems with latest technology to meet India’s growing cloud infrastructure and data capacity demand from global enterprises and over-the-top service providers.
It had also announced a deal with Reliance Jio under which RCom’s assets, including 122.4MHz of 4G spectrum in the 800/900/1,800/2,100MHz bands, more than 43,000 towers, 178,000 route km of fibre with a pan-India footprint and 248 media convergence nodes covering 5 million sq. ft, used for hosting telecom infrastructure, would be bought by Reliance Jio. RCom wanted to seal the deal by March 2018, but all assets have not been sold yet.
In August, RCom said it had completed the sale of its media convergence nodes and related infrastructure assets worth   ₹ 2,000 crore, besides the sale of fibre worth   ₹  3,000 crore to Reliance Jio. However, the spectrum sale was stuck after DoT sought bank guarantees.
“This order is welcome because it protects the exchequer and, by that logic, the taxpayers’ money as well. It’s good to see that the court has protected the right of government to recover outstanding spectrum fees"", Ameet Datta, partner at law firm Saikrishna and Associates.

502,2018-12-03,Reliance,"While RIL and Reliance Jio together raised 27,500 crore, Reliance Industrial Investments raised 8,000 crore

Mumbai: Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) raised nearly  ₹ 36,000 crore this fiscal year by selling bonds and equity, Bloomberg data showed, as the company finances operations, refinances loans and expands its consumer businesses. The funds were raised by RIL and its two subsidiaries Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL) and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. While RIL and Reliance Jio Infocomm together raised  ₹ 27,500 crore by selling 281,000 shares through debentures, RIIHL raised  ₹ 8,000 crore through 778 million optionally convertible preference shares.

The funds were raised by RIL and its two subsidiaries Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL) and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. While RIL and Reliance Jio Infocomm together raised  ₹ 27,500 crore by selling 281,000 shares through debentures, RIIHL raised  ₹ 8,000 crore through 778 million optionally convertible preference shares.
RIL did not reply to an email sent on Monday. The company already has shareholder approval to raise  ₹ 20,000 crore through non-convertible debentures (NCDs).
“Once a net zero-debt company, RIL has been borrowing heavily to fund its telecom expansion and buy stakes in companies to build an attractive bouquet of applications through the Reliance Jio app. In addition to funding acquisitions, RIL also needs funds to refinance its existing long-term debt and replace short-term debt,"" an analyst with a domestic brokerage said on condition of anonymity. 
At the end of September quarter, RIL’s debt had expanded to  ₹ 2.59 trillion from  ₹ 2.19 trillion as on 31 March. The company’s rating that’s higher than India’s sovereign rating helps it raise cheaper debt. Its cash and cash equivalents of  ₹ 76,740 crore are in bank deposits, mutual funds, government bonds and other marketable securities.
In the September quarter, RIL had incurred a capex of  ₹ 39,000 crore, including about  ₹ 5,000 crore of capitalization of foreign exchange losses. 
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd incurred capex of  ₹ 16,000 crore during the same period. 
According to an October report of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, RIL had spent about  ₹ 5,000 crore in the joint venture with music app Saavn, which showed up as capex for the quarter. The core businesses consumed  ₹ 13,000 crore in capex, of which  ₹ 1,000 crore each was in exploration and production (E&P)/real estate and  ₹ 2000 crore was in the ongoing projects at Jamnagar.
Most of the ongoing expenditure at Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd was for the mobility part of the business, which is likely to achieve its target of 99% population coverage by the end of the fiscal year, RIL said in October. 
It has planned investments for its fibre-based broadband services, JioGigaFiber, that it will launch across 1,100 cities this fiscal. Analysts said although spends on mobility should reduce, RIL’s ambitious fiber-based broadband services and the purchase of telecom assets from Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) will add to its expenses. 
“Jio still has to pay  ₹ 20,000 crore to Reliance Communication—as it awaits some approvals/clearances,"" added the Bank of America Merrill Lynch report."

The Supreme Court on November 30, had asked the Department of Telecom (DoT) to give a no-objection certificate (NoC) to Reliance Communications to sell its spectrum to Reliance Jio, provided a corporate guarantee of the said amount is furnished by its group firm in favour of government.
“As per the order....of the Supreme Court of India, Reliance Realty Limited, a 100 per cent subsidiary of RCOM, has submitted the corporate guarantee of  ₹ 1,400 crore to the DoT. As per the said order, DoT is to approve the spectrum trading within this week,"" RCom spokesperson said in a statement.
RCom said that the proceeds from the spectrum deal will be used to clear the dues of Ericsson and RITL (Reliance Infratel) minority investors, and added that Reliance Communications’ asset monetisation blueprint is moving as per plan.
Late last week, a bench headed by Justice R F Nariman said the NoC would be given to Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), a Anil Ambani group firm, by the Telecom Department, if Reliance Realty furnishes the corporate guarantee within two days.
The order came on a petition filed by the Telecom Department against the order of Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) which had allowed RCom to sell spectrum to Reliance Jio without providing the bank guarantee of around  ₹ 2,900 crore to the DoT.
The TDSAT, in its last month order, had rejected DoT’s plea seeking bank guarantee of around  ₹ 2,900 crore before it permits sale of RCom spectrum to Reliance Jio.
RCom has signed an agreement with Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd to sell its spectrum and other telecom assets for an estimated  ₹ 25,000 crore and partially clear its debt of about  ₹ 46,000 crore.

496,2018-12-04,Reliance,"Facebook Inc., WhatsApp's parent, and India's richest man, who started Reliance Jio, are teaming up to draw hordes of customers with cheap phones, rock-bottom rates and handy messaging services. Facebook's role in all this is so central that, in rural regions, handsets with Net access are dubbed WhatsApp phones.

Bengaluru: One recent afternoon in the Indian city of Pune, a 35-year-old mason named Om Prakash Gaekwad gets a crash course in technology. He watches a street-corner skit explaining the virtues of WhatsApp’s messaging service and Reliance Jio’s wireless network. He then climbs aboard a truck to find out how to set them up. Half an hour later, he’s made up his mind: He’ll upgrade to a new phone so he can negotiate masonry rates on WhatsApp — and let his six-year-old play mobile games.

Half an hour later, he’s made up his mind: He’ll upgrade to a new phone so he can negotiate masonry rates on WhatsApp — and let his six-year-old play mobile games.
Such pitches — part tutorial, part kitsch — are boosting web adoption in what is already the world’s fastest-growing major internet market. Facebook Inc., WhatsApp’s parent, and India’s richest man, who started Reliance Jio, are teaming up to draw hordes of customers with cheap phones, rock-bottom rates and handy messaging services. Facebook’s role in all this is so central that, in rural regions, handsets with Net access are dubbed “WhatsApp phones.""
The two companies are building a massive user base that will boost their own fortunes. At the same time, they’re creating the foundation on which business like online retail, digital payments and food delivery can be built. Reliance Jio and WhatsApp wouldn’t comment directly on future plans, but experts see more collaboration as inevitable.
“It’s a natural alliance because it gives WhatsApp access to tens of millions of new customers through Reliance Jio,"" said Nandan Nilekani, technology investor and co-founder of tech outsourcing giant Infosys Ltd. In turn, Reliance gets a lift because millions of neophytes see WhatsApp as the first step in entering the rest of the internet.
India already has 480 million internet users — about 75% more than the US and second only to China. That figure is projected to grow to 737 million by 2022, according to Forrester Research Inc. “The next 500 million users are yet to be captured,"" said Satish Meena, a forecast analyst at Forrester.
Facebook, reeling from crisis after crisis in the U.S., faces challenges in Asia too, such as criticism that it hasn’t done enough to combat the spread of violence in Myanmar. In India, its Free Basics, which offers a minimalist web for emerging markets, was banned for violating net neutrality, while WhatsApp has been used to circulate fake videos and rumors that have led to dozens of lynchings. The government has threatened legal action if the company doesn’t do more to clean up the problems.
The scandals have Facebook’s stock on pace for its worst annual performance since 2012, the year it made its public debut.
Yet India is evolving into perhaps its most promising opportunity. The country is already WhatsApp’s biggest market, with more than 200 million users -- so important that Chris Daniels has visited twice since becoming CEO in May. The messaging service is free to use, but Facebook charges businesses to communicate on the platform and is expected to introduce advertising. WhatsApp will become more crucial to Facebook’s bottom line as the social network matures.
“A lot of our growth is coming from markets in Asia; our top growth countries were India, Indonesia and the Philippines,"" David Wehner, chief financial officer, said on the most recent earnings call.
Facebook’s recent momentum in India stems from its alliance with Mukesh Ambani, chief of the conglomerate Reliance Industries. In a seismic shake-up of the telecom industry, Ambani invested $35 billion to launch the country’s most advanced wireless network two years ago. He offered free voice calls and bargain-basement digital connectivity through inexpensive feature phones across India, appealing to those fazed by smartphones. Millions of impoverished Indians were yanked into the digital age almost overnight. Most of Ambani’s rivals -- including his own brother -- were quickly driven into irrelevance.
In just two years, his network has grown to more than 250 million subscribers, more than AT&T Inc. or Verizon Communications Inc. Ambani has aspirations to use this sprawling base to build his digital empire: He’s piloting a digital payments bank, moving into television and movies and exhibiting Bezos-like ambitions to dominate all aspects of e-commerce.
The pitch in Pune shows how Facebook and Reliance Jio operate. In the city’s teeming Kondhwa Market, a team of traveling performers dressed in green WhatsApp T-shirts reprise their skit throughout the day. It opens with a rowdy game of cricket, then friends share the excitement of taking selfies and creating WhatsApp friends’ groups. “Dhoom macha rakhi hai,"" WhatsApp has created a big stir, said one performer.
There is a dark side, another points out. Forwarded videos can incite fear and hatred, shattering social unity. The performers warn about identifying fake messages, and quitting groups created by strangers. After government criticism, WhatsApp limits forwarding to five people per message.
As the skit nears its end, Mitesh Patil stands inside the open truck, ready to field questions from visitors. The chatty 19-year-old is taking a break from college to work as a “WhatsApp ambassador."" Aside from queries on how to download WhatsApp, he is asked about the JioPhone’s price and whether an old feature phone can be exchanged for new device. He directs them to Reliance stores nearby.
“Many people who can’t read and have no idea how an internet-ready phone works, came here asking to buy one and download WhatsApp,"" says Patil. “An internet-connected mobile phone has become a basic necessity in India.""
As the sun sets over Pune, the crew takes their role-playing tutorial across the city to Handewadi Road, a busy warren of streets lined with middle-class homes. Within minutes, a crowd descends on the van. Among them is Sunita Kamble, a beautician who provides doorstep service. She’s been on the Jio network for 18 months, watching YouTube videos on body polishing, haircuts and makeup on her battered Oppo phone. “I saved 50,000 rupees by learning via the internet instead of taking a make-up course,"" says the 37-year-old, with tunic pants, salwar kameez and a traditional bindi dot on her forehead.
Kamble is now ready for a big step: learning English and brushing up her cooking skills on a new JioPhone she intends to buy. “I can message my clients and schedule all my appointments on WhatsApp,"" she said.
Still, there’s a note of caution in the air. Many customers leap from poverty and isolation to a digital age where messages can inflame religious and cast prejudices. That afternoon, the skit ends with a message in Hindi that plays on the word Jio, which means “to live,"" and urges “respect and honor."""

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd will focus on premium customers and expand its broadband service across India’s top 100 cities, instead of copying Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s ambitious plan to create a fibre-optic network across the country. The New Delhi-based telecom operator’s fibre-based broadband internet strategy is akin to what it has recently announced for its wireless customers, wherein it will only hold onto users who spend at least  ₹ 35 a month on recharges, so that the network experience improves for all customers.

The New Delhi-based telecom operator’s fibre-based broadband internet strategy is akin to what it has recently announced for its wireless customers, wherein it will only hold onto users who spend at least  ₹ 35 a month on recharges, so that the network experience improves for all customers.
“Airtel’s plan is clear...to stay focused on the top 100 cities... stay focused on the high income, stay focused on high-rise buildings rather than horizontal deployment, as this business model is more economical and logical,"" a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on condition of anonymity.
The commercial launch of Reliance Jio GigaFiber is expected to disrupt the wired broadband market in a similar way it disrupted the wireless market.
Reliance Jio has launched the registration process for Jio GigaFiber with an aim to connect 50 million homes but has not announced the pricing plans yet.
Reliance Jio GigaFiber would also be the largest greenfield fixed-line broadband rollout globally, with simultaneous introduction in 1,100 cities across India, which would connect homes, merchants, small and medium enterprises and large enterprises, Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambani said in July.
Airtel, on the other hand, plans to cater to better-paying customers and aggressively expand this market. It has 2.2 million wired broadband customers as of 30 September. According to data available with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), there are 18 million wired broadband subscribers in the country. Reliance Jio has not yet commercially rolled out its broadband service.
“As long as it is the mid- to high-end of the market, Airtel will compete there very hard and match any prices offered by rivals,"" the person cited earlier said. “Two years ago, the company used to do half-a-million home passes every year. Last year it did one-and-a-half-million home passes. In 2018-19, Airtel is deploying 2.5 million home passes. In the next few years, the plan is to end up doing 8-10 million home passes. It already has 10 million home passes. This will make that a total of 20 million.""
In the wired internet segment, fibre is distributed to homes via an optical distribution frame, with a single fibre dedicated to each customer’s home, which is termed a home pass. This pass may or may not result in conversion of a customer.
Airtel believes that catering to the upper segment would be prudent as home broadband is a costly exercise and also requires more committed spending from the customer compared with a wireless subscriber and hence the company should focus on ensuring that consumption goes up.
ALSO READ | Airtel steps on the gas before Reliance Jio broadband launch
“Given that deployment of fibre is time-consuming and expensive, Airtel’s strategy to focus on the high-end consumers makes sense as it will generate healthier cash flows. It seems wise for the company to not invest heavily in areas where returns are going to be too far away in the long run,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India.
To ensure customer stickiness, Airtel also plans to build a digital platform, Airtel Homes Platform, wherein it will offer bundled services.

Airtel is also currently piloting in Andhra Pradesh the Airtel Homes Platform, whereby a customer can buy all three (broadband, DTH, SIM card) together.""
The platform will also offer not just products from Airtel’s stable, but also ancillary services such as home security and surveillance available through a third-party vendor, but serviced by Airtel.

Similarly, Reliance Mutual Fund has invested in Morgan Credits, Yes Capital India of Yes Bank and Aasan Corporate Solutions of Piramal.
“We do not comment on specific investments. There are numerous holding company borrowings by issuers from India’s top business houses and all the large asset managers regularly invest in these holding companies/core investment company. This has been standard industry practice for years,"" said a Reliance spokesperson.
Aasan’s paper is backed by guarantee of Shri Krishna Trust (SKT), a promoter group firm of Piramal Enterprises, according to disclosures by rating agencies. SKT, according to disclosures on BSE, holds a 39.66% stake in Piramal Enterprises.
“Aasan own several assets. The borrowing of  ₹ 270 crore to Reliance funds (ultra short term) is against normal course of business of Aasan and it is not secured against any securities,"" said a spokesperson for Piramal group. 
Brickwork Ratings, in its rationale of Ma Multi Trade, said the company did not have any operational business, activities and acts as a borrowing and investing company for the Shishir Bajaj group.
An email sent to Ma Multi Trade was not answered till publishing of this story.
There has been no pledge of shares held by the promoters in WGC or any of its operating companies for the purpose of securing any borrowings for the company, said a person close to the Wadhawan group. “Instruments with this rating are considered to have the highest degree of safety regarding timely servicing of financial obligations. Such instruments carry lowest credit risk,"" he said.
“As long as the pledge or encumbered shares are being disclosed in its entirety, there is no issue. Only when the investors are not aware does this pose an issue. The other important issue is the end use of these funds—whether these are going to company expansion or promoter use,"" said a senior debt fund manager. In some cases, firms disclose a consolidated pledge data while omitting individual company pledge details."

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) seeking a probe against Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd, on complaints of cartelisation by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. 
New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) seeking a probe against Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd, on complaints of cartelisation by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
The anti trust body had approached the Supreme Court in January this year challenging an order of the Bombay High Court, which set aside a probe against the telecom companies.
“We are dismissing it,"" said a three-judge bench headed by Justice A.K. Sikri.
On September 21, 2017, the Bombay High Court had ruled that the CCI had no jurisdiction to interpret contract conditions or policies of the telecom sector, which was governed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) Act, 1997.
The order was passed on a plea by Idea Cellular, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) seeking to quash the CCI order directing an investigation into allegations of cartelisation made by Reliance Jio.
Reliance Jio had questioned the jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court and said the case must be heard by the Delhi High Court since the CCI order was passed in Delhi. This was rejected by the court.

494,2018-12-06,Reliance,"Vodafone Idea has sought want spectrum-related payments to be spread over 18 years from the current 16 years, but Reliance Jio has opposed that proposal

New Delhi: Telecom operators are unlikely to get any financial relief on spectrum-related payments due to the exchequer unless all three companies—Vodafone Idea Ltd, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd—come together and agree that the industry is undergoing financial stress, a senior government official said requesting anonymity. 
New Delhi: Telecom operators are unlikely to get any financial relief on spectrum-related payments due to the exchequer unless all three companies—Vodafone Idea Ltd, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd—come together and agree that the industry is undergoing financial stress, a senior government official said requesting anonymity.
This comes after Vodafone Idea chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla last month met officials from the finance ministry and department of telecommunications (DoT) to discuss the firm’s pending spectrum-related liabilities. He had also flagged concerns on liquidity crunch in the sector.
This was followed by a letter from the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) to the DoT seeking financial relief.
Under present norms, an operator has to pay some amount at the time of purchase of spectrum. From the date of purchase, there is a two-year moratorium, after which the operator has to make the remaining payment over 16 years.
Vodafone Idea had sought increasing this period from 16 years to 18 years. But Reliance Jio has opposed that proposal, and hence there is no agreement among operators.
“The problem is that they are not able to come together as an industry and say there is stress,"" the official said. “We could have initiated some action if they could come together. If one player is opposing everything, and two players are saying they want relief, then what will the government do""?
Vodafone Idea faces spectrum liabilities worth  ₹ 3,000 crore due in March 2019 and an additional   ₹  12,000 crore due in mid-2019-2020, Credit Suisse said in a note dated 22 November.
The telecom sector is undergoing a fierce battle after the entry of Reliance Jio, which brought tariffs to the rockbottom. As a result of year-long consolidation among multiple operators, only two other private players are left: Bharti Airtel and the merged entity of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.
Vodafone Idea posted  ₹ 4,970 crore loss in the September quarter, while Airtel posted a  ₹ 118 crore profit.
Meanwhile, the government has initiated action on the industry’s demand for reviewing import duties on telecom equipment. In October, the government raised basic customs duty on telecom equipment, including base stations and optical transport equipment, from 10% to 20%. Products that enjoyed zero percent import tax were slapped with a 10% customs duty.
“COAI had asked for import duties to be reviewed on telecom equipment. There’s a committee comprising of members of Department of Revenue, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and DoT which is looking into it,"" the official said."
493,2018-12-07,Reliance,"There is an aggressive new entrant (Reliance Jio), a mature player (Airtel) and a third player which is going through strenuous amalgamation (Vodafone Idea)

New Delhi: Six months ago, Bharti Airtel Ltd was the undisputed leader in India’s telecom market with the largest subscriber base, highest profit and maximum revenue market share. The entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd however resulted in a bruising tariff war, which forced even a large corporate house like the Tata Group to exit the industry. Following a year-long consolidation, only two other private players were left in the field—Bharti Airtel and entity resulting from the merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.

Following a year-long consolidation, only two other private players were left in the field—Bharti Airtel and entity resulting from the merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.
Although the dust in the telecom battleground has settled largely with three players remaining, the sector is at the cusp of an anomaly with no clear market leader emerging on key growth metrics and no distinct industry hierarchy in sight.
Sample this. Vodafone Idea Ltd, India’s largest telecom operator by users and revenue market share, is also the only loss-making company among the three—posting a  ₹ 4,970 crore loss in the September quarter. Reliance Jio, which had 252 million subscribers compared with Vodafone Idea’s 435 million as of end-September, made a profit of  ₹ 681 crore in the same period.
The third player, Bharti Airtel, saw revenue from its India business fall 11% on-year in July-September. It lost 2.3 million users in September alone when Reliance Jio added 13 million.
So, who is the real number one telecom company?
“Vodafone Idea may have the most subscribers and revenue market share but clearly can’t be called the number one player or the industry leader if you look at all the parameters,"" a Mumbai-based analyst said, requesting anonymity.
The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) believes this abnormality is because of industry dynamics, which changed after the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016. “The fundamental issue is that the industry has transformed from a voice-only network to an all-data network. The whole network has got more complex. As a result, we are wondering what are the right metrics to look at,"" COAI director general Rajan Mathews said.
The lobby group believes that in the current situation, the amount of data flowing on the network and the operator’s 4G coverage would be better metrics. “4G capacity will determine tomorrow’s leader. Who has the most subscribers is not a relevant metric anymore,"" Mathews said.
On 4G coverage, Reliance Jio is targeting 99% population coverage by March. Airtel has over 90% 4G coverage with an aggressive plan to grab the user’s primary 4G SIM slot. Vodafone Idea is the laggard with 50% 4G coverage. It plans to cover 70% of the country in the next six months, and 80% in 2019-20.
“Airtel and Jio are best placed to grab the low-hanging fruits and quickly upgrade customers from 2G to 4G in areas where Vodafone Idea doesn’t offer 4G currently,"" an industry executive said requesting anonymity.
Jio’s 4G user base of 252 million is almost twice of Airtel and Vodafone Idea combined.
“At this time, it is not quite clear which is the industry leader among telecom operators. But this should change over a year or two as the competition is forcing telcos to focus on their product and marketing,"" said Amresh Nandan, vice president and analyst (tech industry), Gartner. “The fight for the lead position would eventually not be based on subscriber size but revenue, profitability and even quality of revenue.""
Vodafone Idea is deploying technologies to handle 2G spectrum refarming to 4G.
With plans to raise up to  ₹ 25,000 crore, Vodafone Idea also faces spectrum liabilities of  ₹ 3,000 crore due in March and an additional  ₹ 12,000 crore due in the middle of the next financial year, Credit Suisse said in a note on 22 November.

RNEL, which is controlled by Reliance Infrastructure Ltd, had in its petition said ONGC has refused to take delivery of the eighth vessel and also invoked a bank guarantee. The high court ruled that when there is a clause giving the parties to the agreement the option of going for arbitration, the companies must do so rather than filing cases in court. 
“We are of the considered view that this can be done in the arbitration proceedings, which are provided under the contract if the parties choose to do so or in the civil suit if the petitioner (RNEL) desires to take recourse to the same,"" ruled a bench comprising justices B.R. Gavai and Riyaz I. Chagla. “In that view of the matter petition is rejected, relegating petitioner to the ordinary remedy available to it in the law,"" it said.
The company, part of billionaire Anil Ambani’s diversified Reliance Group, was seeking a refund of more than $6.6 million (about  ₹ 45 crore), which ONGC invoked as performance bank guarantee, along with $15.46 million as payment for eighth offshore vessel that it built for India’s largest explorer. RNEL also sought court’s intervention to direct ONGC to take delivery of the eighth vessel.
“Undisputedly, in the present case, the vessels were not delivered to respondent (ONGC) within a period of 30 months as provided in the contract,"" the court observed in its order of 30 November.

Industry-leading rivals Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd lack the “stomach"" to battle Reliance Industries Ltd’s Reliance Jio, which is luring away users with free voice services and inexpensive phones, Lane and Chen wrote in a report published 10 December.
Reliance Jio launched a free-for-life call service last year that triggered a price war and consolidation in one of the world’s most crowded mobile markets. Its free introductory nationwide 4G wireless service started in 2016, instantly roiling the world’s largest telecommunications sector after China’s.
Two years later, Reliance Jio—which began charging for data in 2017—has 227 million users and has become profitable as it brings connectivity to remote Indian villages.
The ensuing disruption forced smaller operators to quit, merge or go bankrupt. Newly merged Vodafone Idea has toppled Bharti Airtel to become India’s top operator, while Reliance Jio has quickly added subscribers to gain the No.3 spot.
Bernstein wrote that it expects Reliance Jio to keep selling its subsidized Jio Phone, the 4G feature phones it sells for a refundable deposit of $23 (about  ₹ 1,500), until it reaches the No.1 position.

Bernstein said average revenue per unit (arpu) would probably rise for Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea this year as they cancel user contracts that generate little revenue. The research firm does not expect 3G/4G pricing to start to creep up until 2020. Bernstein lowered its price targets for Airtel to  ₹ 450 a share and Vodafone Idea to  ₹ 40 a share.

The board also cleared a similar proposal pertaining to transfer of its tower infrastructure “on a going concern basis, to a separate company"", it added.
The schemes are subject to statutory and regulatory approvals, it added but did not provide details.
Jio has 2.20 lakh towers and nearly three lakh kilometres of optical fibre assets -- all of which are leveraged for captive use so far. The latest move would give the company the leeway to lease out the infrastructure in the fast-growing telecom market, sources said.
Reliance Industries’ telecom arm -- seen as the most aggressive telecom player in the market -- had reported a standalone net profit of  ₹ 681 crore for the September 2018 quarter, against a net loss of  ₹ 271 crore in the year-ago period.
On a quarterly basis, its profit grew around 11 per cent from  ₹ 612 crore in the April-June period.
Having amassed 252 million mobile subscribers, the company is now looking to foray into optical fibre-based broadband services in the country and accordingly announced  ₹ 5,230 crore majority stake acquisition plan in two fixed line broadband firms -- Den Networks and Hathway Cable.

New Delhi: Switching to another mobile phone operator is set to become a quicker process and operators will have fewer discretionary powers to scuttle a porting request, according to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s new rules (Trai) issued on Thursday. 
New Delhi: Switching to another mobile phone operator is set to become a quicker process and operators will have fewer discretionary powers to scuttle a porting request, according to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s new rules (Trai) issued on Thursday.
Besides, the regulator has suggested imposing a penalty of  ₹ 10,000 on telecom operators every time they provide false information regarding a mobile number porting request and for each wrongful rejection of a porting request.
Several small telcos, including Reliance Communications and Aircel, recently shut wireless operations, posing problems for many subscribers.
“ To make the porting process faster and convenient, for all the cases except corporate porting cases; in the revised process for validation of conditions and generation and delivery of unique porting code (UPC); it has been provisioned to establish a query response mechanism to enable the Mobile Number Portability Service Provider to query the database of the donor operator on real time basis,"" Trai said in the Telecommunication Mobile Number Portability (Seventh Amendment) Regulations, 2018, made public on Thursday.
For porting requests in the same telecom circle, the timeline has been set at two working days, while for requests to port numbers to another telecom circle, the timeline has been kept at four working days. Currently, a subscriber must stay with one operator for at least 90 days before switching to another. Previously, the maximum time that could be taken to facilitate porting was seven working days, except in Jammu and Kashmir, Assam and the North-East, where it was 15 working days.
The validity of the unique porting code has been kept at four days in place of 15 earlier for all telecom circles except Jammu & Kashmir, Assam and North East for which the validity of UPC remains unchanged.
For cases of corporate porting, the current limit of 50 numbers in a single authorisation letter has been enhanced to 100. Earlier, the porting request was processed without evaluation of the eligibility conditions, and the subscriber was told the reason of rejection only after four days.
However, under the new norms, the unique porting code will be generated only for mobile numbers that meet the eligibility criteria set by the regulator.
The industry will have six months to implement the changes after which the new regulations will come into force. Moreover, to tackle instances of technical errors, Trai will issue appropriate quality of service norms as well.
Trai had floated a consultation paper on the issue in April and announced draft norms in September."

While the pre-wedding celebrations were held lavishly in Udaipur with the who’s who of Bollywood, American pop sensation Beyonce, former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and other VVIPs in attendance, the wedding will be a smaller affair.
Guards armed with automatic rifles led the baraat, ahead of a brass band from Jaipur playing choicest of numbers to which the guests, including the groom’s father Ajay Piramal, swayed.
Anand Piramal, the cynosure of all eyes, followed them all in a vintage Rolls Royce.
Guests started trickling-in soon after, and included former president Pranab Mukherjee, ex-US secretary of state and first-lady Hillary Clinton, the Bachchans, Priyanka Chopra along with her husband Nick Jonas, and Aamir Khan from the tinsel town, and Sachin Tendulkar.
Isha Ambani’s marriage will be held at the Ambani residence in a tony locality off Peddar Road. The 27-storey Antilla, one of the world’s most expensive private residences, has been decked up with lights and flowers.
While media reports had estimated the pre-wedding extravaganza guest list to be of around 2,000 in Udaipur, the wedding guest list has been pruned down to around 600. More than half of the invitees are close relatives of the bride and groom, besides friends. The wedding festivities are expected to cost more than $10 million (Rs 72 crore), according to PTI.
Industrialist Ajay Piramal’s son and real estate developer Anand Piramal, 33, is a childhood friend of Mukesh Ambani’s only daughter, Isha Ambani, 27. While Anand is a Harvard Business School graduate, Isha got her MBA degree from Stanford this year.
Anand is credited to have founded two start-ups—a healthcare start-up, Piramal eSwasthya, and Piramal Realty, a real estate start-up. Both are now part of the $4 billion family-run conglomerate, Piramal Enterprises. Isha, on the other hand, is on the boards of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Reliance Retail Ltd.

New Delhi: Reliance Group chairman Anil Ambani on Friday welcomed the Supreme Court order on the multi-billion dollar Rafale jet deal, saying it established the falsity of politically motivated allegations against his firm.
In its ruling on a batch of petitions seeking a probe into the deal, the apex court said there was no occasion to doubt the decision-making process in the procurement of the 36 Rafale fighter aircraft from France.
Dassault Aviation, the makers of Rafale, had entered into an agreement with Ambani’s Reliance Defence Ltd (RDL) for fulfilling offset obligations.
“I welcome the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court today summarily dismissing all PILs filed on the Rafale contracts, and conclusively establishing the complete falsity of the wild, baseless and politically motivated allegations levelled against Reliance Group and me personally,"" Ambani said in a statement.
The Congress had alleged that the government had put pressure on Dassault Aviation to select RDL as its offset partner. The government, RDL and Dassault Aviation rejected the charges.
“We remain committed to India’s national security and to making our humble contribution towards the Make in India and Skill India policies of the government in the critical area of defence, including our offset partnership agreement with our valued partner, Dassault Aviation of France,"" said Ambani.

After all, if Reliance Jio sees the need to raise funds by selling minority stakes in its fibre and tower assets, an end to its relentless “raise debt, burn cash"" strategy may finally be in sight. At least, that’s how some investors see it.
But those hoping for an improvement in the industry’s fundamentals may be disappointed. “If anything, a strategy of raising funds through asset or stake sales points to a view that Reliance Jio isn’t particularly keen on raising cash flows by increasing tariffs,"" says the head of a multinational brokerage. “It would rather reduce leverage ratios by decreasing the numerator, that is, the quantum of debt on its books.""
For now, Reliance Jio’s competitors and their investors will have to be content there is at least some constraint on how much Reliance Industries Ltd can spend. But this is a thin silver lining around a large, dark cloud. The deleveraging exercise, if any, would only help Reliance Jio create more room to borrow and continue with its aggressive expansion plans. An email sent to a Reliance Jio spokesperson about whether the hive-off is part of an eventual stake sale plan remained unanswered at the time of writing.
For backdrop, there is little doubt that Reliance Jio needs to deleverage. Its debt has been rising at a scorching pace. Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd estimate that the telecom unit’s net liabilities will rise 50% this fiscal to  ₹ 2.1 trillion. That would amount to an extremely high leverage ratio of 13.8 times trailing 12 months’ earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda).
Rating agencies typically start getting jittery when leverage ratios of top rated firms start inching above the 2.5-3 times Ebitda mark. Still, Reliance Jio enjoys a top-notch rating and is able to raise debt at highly competitive rates simply because, as the rating agency Crisil puts it, “(its ratings are) based on the strength of the irrevocable and unconditional guarantee from its parent, Reliance Industries Ltd"".
Reliance Industries’ leverage ratios are far lower at around 3.5 times, though Jefferies estimates they will rise to 3.8 times by this fiscal-end, after adding the cash burn at Jio, besides digesting its acquisitions.
With leverage at the parent also inching up, creating breathing room through some asset sales makes sense, both to keep rating agencies at bay and continue enjoying competitive borrowing rates.
The worrying bit for investors in incumbent telcos is that there are no attempts to reduce leverage by raising tariffs and trying to increase profits and cash flows. As such, to assume that market repair will happen because current tariff levels are unsustainable is imprudent.
“Market repair has to happen because one, it is unsustainable; two, it is making India uncompetitive; three, even Reliance Jio is burning cash,"" Vodafone Idea chief executive officer Balesh Sharma said last month, after reporting large losses for the September quarter. Analysts say the firm’s leverage ratios, even after accounting for synergy benefits, could be in double digits.
While incumbents await market repair, Reliance Jio has been racing towards the pole position in terms of revenue market share. Some analysts say Reliance Jio will become number one by the end of this fiscal, if not this quarter. Still, it’s quite a distance away from its targeted 50% revenue market share. Till it gets there, market repair may well be a distant dream."

Al-Falih, who has known Ambani for over a decade now, travelled to Udaipur earlier this month to attend the pre-wedding festivities of Ambani’s daughter Isha Ambani’s marriage with Ajay Piramal’s son Anand Piramal. During that visit, he also held talks with Ambani but choose to tweet about those discussions only this week.
In an Arabic tweet, which was translated using online tools, Al-Falih said he was delighted to meet Ambani. At the meeting “we discussed opportunities for joint investments and cooperation in petrochemical, refining and communications projects."" He also tweeted a picture of the meeting where Ambani is dressed in a business suit, a sharp contrast to other pictures of his in traditional attire during the pre-wedding festivities held on 8 and 9 December.
No details of the meeting were available from Reliance.
Reliance operates two refineries at Jamnagar with a total capacity of 68.2 million tonnes per annum. Reliance plans to expand its only-for-exports SEZ refining capacity to just over 41 million tonnes from current 35.2 million tonnes but does not have any plans to set up a new refinery in the country.
It is presently focused on expanding petrochemical and telecom business, industry people said.
Crude oil is the basic raw material for the manufacturing of petrochemicals.
Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is keen to get a foothold in the world’s fastest-growing fuel market so as to get a captive customer for crude oil it produces.
Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil company, and its partner Abu Dabhi National Oil Co. (Adnoc) have picked up 50% stake in a planned $44 billion Ratnagiri refinery in Maharashtra but the project is facing problems in acquiring land due to protests from local politicians.
Saudi Aramco and Adnoc will together hold 50% stake in the 60 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) refinery and adjacent 18 mtpa petrochemical complex planned to be built at Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra by 2025. The two will supply half of the crude oil required for processing at the refinery.
Like other major producers, the two are looking to lock in customers in the world’s third-largest oil consumer through the investment. Kuwait too is looking to invest in projects in return for getting an assured offtake of their crude oil.
Saudi Aramco is also keen on retailing fuel in India. A refinery in India can also be a base for it to export fuel to deficit countries in Europe and the Americas. India has a refining capacity of 247.6 million tonnes, which exceeded the demand of 206.2 million tonnes.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), this demand is expected to reach 458 million tonnes by 2040."

The DoT rejected the deal to trade airwaves as it did not conform to its guidelines, the paper said, adding that as per the trading norms, the buyer is liable for dues that are not recovered from the seller.
Jio informed the DoT that it won’t be held liable for RCom’s past dues related to airwaves, according to the report.
The DoT move comes as a surprise as the it was widely expected to approve the transaction, though a day later than the original timeline due to last-minute paperwork, ET reported on Tuesday. 
The transaction was key to the debt-laden telecom operator’s restructuring plan, announced earlier this year, which entailed the sale of telecom assets such as towers and airwaves to Jio.
The plan to sell the assets had followed a settlement with telecom gearmaker Ericsson for partial payment of dues owed by RCom to the Swedish company.
The companies were not immediately available for comment, while the DoT could not be immediately reached for comment.

New Delhi: Reliance Jio continues to lead in 4G speed download chart published by telecom regulator Trai for November, despite witnessing a slight dip in its network performance at average speed of 20.3 megabit per second (Mbps).
The Mukesh Ambani-led firm was fastest 4G operator with its average peak download speed in October at 22.3 Mbps.
Performance of Bharti Airtel’s 4G network slightly improved in November to 9.7 mbps from 9.5 mbps in October, according to the data published by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on MySpeed Portal.
Though Vodafone and Idea Cellular have merged their businesses and now operate as Vodafone Idea, Trai published their network performance separately.
4G download speed on Vodafone network too improved marginally to 6.8 mbps in November from 6.6 mbps in October, while that of Idea dipped to 6.2 mbps from 6.4 mbps.
Idea, however, continued to top the chart in terms of 4G upload speed with a speed of 5.6 Mbps during the month despite decline in performance. The company had registered average upload speed of 5.9 mbps in October.
The download speed plays an important role when a user watches any video, browse the Internet, access emails; and a good upload speed is required when a user wants to share data like images, videos and any other files through email or social media applications.
Vodafone regained second spot in November with improvement in 4G upload speed at 4.9 mbps, while Jio slipped to third with decline in upload speed to 4.5 mbps. Airtel network registered slight improvement in average upload speed at 4 mbps in November.
Both Jio and Idea have continued to maintain their leadership in their respective segments since last several months.
The average speed is computed by Trai based on data it collects with help of its MySpeed application on a real-time basis.

“Data colonization is as bad as the previous forms of colonization,"" Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd and Asia’s richest man, said at an event Wednesday in Mumbai. “India’s data must be controlled and owned by Indian people -- and not by corporates, especially global corporations.""
The comments feed into a debate on how India should balance user protections with support for its digital economy in the world’s fastest-growing major internet market. Foreign companies and hundreds of home-grown startups have flourished amid a dearth of regulation, with research firm eMarketer estimating e-commerce sales will more than double to $72 billion by 2022.
Ambani himself has supercharged internet adoption, helping crash data prices with the launch of his telecom venture in 2016. He also plans to create an online-to-offline platform that would take on the likes of Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc, which are both betting big on India’s e-commerce market.
The growing competition has put a spotlight on the evolving privacy push. India is reworking a set of proposed e-commerce rules after a draft sparked criticism for its protectionist overtones. The government is also considering a draft of a data privacy bill, which recommended restrictions on the transfer and storage of information by global giants from Facebook Inc. to Google.

New Delhi: With its spectrum deal virtually in a limbo, Reliance Communications on Thursday urged the telecom department to grant it the “long-awaited no-objection certificate"" to comply with the Supreme Court order in “letter and spirit"".
The statement came a day after senior officials of Reliance Communications and Reliance Jio met the telecom secretary to discuss outstanding issues raised by the Department of Telecom (DoT) over payment related to the spectrum sale deal between the two companies.
The Anil Ambani-owned company on Thursday said it remained committed to discharge any outstanding or disputed amount subject to final adjudication.
In a statement, Reliance Communications asserted that the requirement of giving the bank guarantee according to the telecom department’s demand had been substituted by the orders of the telecom tribunal and the Supreme Court, and that its unit Reliance Realty had provided a non-disposal undertaking and corporate guarantee.
“Hence, compliance with the trading guidelines is met,"" RCom statement said.
Also read: RCom shares plunge on report of govt blocking Reliance Jio deal
The DoT, so far, held to its position that it was not possible to clear the deal unless there was clarity on payment of dues and associated charges, particularly as the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio refused to take any payment liability of his younger sibling’s firm RCom to conclude the spectrum trading deal between the two firms.
“Reliance Communications Limited, being a continuing licensee with the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), remains committed to discharge any outstanding or disputed amount subject to final adjudication. The requirement of giving the Bank Guarantee as per DoT’s demand has been substituted by the orders of the TDSAT (Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal) and the Hon’ble Supreme Court, with Reliance Realty Limited providing a non-disposal undertaking and corporate guarantee,"" RCom said on Thursday.
The firm said it was “sincerely hoping"" that DoT would comply with the December 14 order of the Supreme Court in “letter and spirit"" and “grant the long-awaited NOC/consent"".
The statement further noted that the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had adjourned the Ericsson matter to January 22, 2019 to take into consideration the outcome of the decision of the Supreme Court, where the related matter is pending consideration.
“RITL (Reliance Infratel) minority investors’ matter has also been adjourned to 22 January 2019. A copy of the detailed NCLAT order is awaited,"" it added.
RCom has offered the telecom department corporate guarantee of  ₹ 1,400 crore issued by Reliance Realty Limited (RRL) and an undertaking from RRL not to alienate property for a value of  ₹ 1,400 crore, towards approving sale of its spectrum to Reliance Jio.
DoT’s reluctance to give a go-ahead to the spectrum deal arises from Jio’s purported denial to take on past liabilities of RCom. The department had been of the opinion that under circumstance where both the parties were not in position to take the responsibility of payment of dues, it was not possible for the telecom department to take the deal on record.
Ericsson and RITL filed insolvency pleas against RCom for failure to clear their dues. RCom has promised to clear them once its spectrum sale to Jio is completed.
Last year, RCom signed a blockbuster deal with Reliance Jio for the sale of wireless spectrum, tower, fibre and media convergence nodes assets, the proceeds of which were to be used to pare its  ₹ 46,000 crore debt. From that deal, RCom so far announced the completion of the sale of optical fibre assets worth  ₹ 3,000 crore and sale of its media convergence nodes worth  ₹ 2,000 crore to Reliance Jio Infocomm.
RCom has promised to pay dues of  ₹ 550 crore to Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson, and about  ₹ 230 crore to minority stakeholders of Reliance Infratel . The NCLAT has put on hold insolvency proceedings against RCom after the promise made by the company.

New Delhi: India’s No.2 telecom firm, Bharti Airtel Ltd, has formed a special committee to explore and evaluate fundraising options with an aim to strengthen the company’s capital structure and balance sheet as it battles Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in the telecom battleground. The committee will place its recommendations before the company’s board for final approval, Airtel said in a filing to the exchanges. 
New Delhi: India’s No.2 telecom firm, Bharti Airtel Ltd, has formed a special committee to explore and evaluate fundraising options with an aim to strengthen the company’s capital structure and balance sheet as it battles Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in the telecom battleground. The committee will place its recommendations before the company’s board for final approval, Airtel said in a filing to the exchanges.
The company did not specify the potential amount it aims to raise.
Airtel is in the midst of a heated battle for market share with rivals Reliance Jio, the telecom subsidiary of the cash-rich Reliance Industries Ltd, and Vodafone Idea Ltd, which plans to raise as much as $2.5 billion through its promoters.
Reliance Jio’s strategy to garner subscribers through cheap data tariffs has made in imperative for rivals to pump in funds in the cash-guzzling telecom sector.

In October, Bharti Airtel had said that half a dozen marquee investors, including Warburg Pincus Llc, Temasek Holdings, Singapore Telecommunications Ltd and SoftBank Group Corp, will invest a combined $1.25 billion in Airtel Africa ahead of a potential initial public offering (IPO) and the funds would be used to trim Airtel Africa Ltd’s debt of $5 billion and expand operations in that continent.
As part of its steps to cut debt and monetise assets, Airtel in August sold a 20% stake in its satellite television arm, Bharti Telemedia Ltd, to private equity firm Warburg Pincus for $350 million.
In February this year, Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (Singtel) said it would will indirectly raise its stake in Airtel by investing  ₹ 2,649 crore in Bharti Telecom Ltd, the promoter company of Airtel, through a preferential allotment of shares.
The board on Thursday also approved transfer of up to 591.87 million equity shares or 32% of Bharti Infratel Ltd’s stake owned by Airtel to its wholly owned subsidiary Nettle Infrastructure Investments Ltd (Nettle) as it deems fit. This is part of the company’s overall strategy to monetize its stake in Bharti Infratel, which is also in the process of a merger with Indus Towers Ltd.
Airtel had in November last year offloaded 83 million shares of its subsidiary Bharti Infratel for  ₹ 3,325 crore through secondary share sale in the stock market to use the proceeds from this sale to pare its debt. The sale was carried out by Airtel via Nettle Infrastructure Investments.
Prior to that, Airtel had sold 3.65% of its stake in Bharti Infratel in August last year to raise more than  ₹ 2,570 crore and before that in March last year it sold 10.3% stake in the tower unit to a consortium of investors to raise  ₹ 6,193.9 crore. At present, Bharti Airtel—along with its Nettle Infrastructure Investments—holds 53.51% stake in Bharti Infratel.
On Thursday, Bharti Airtel shares fell 1.89% to  ₹ 316.15 apiece on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex ended the day 0.14% lower at 36,431.67 points."

Jakarta/Seoul: Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd plans to start producing electric cars in Indonesia as part of an around $880 million auto investment in the country, the deputy minister for industry said on Thursday. Hyundai’s move to set up its first car factory in Southeast Asia fits into the South Korean carmaker’s strategy of cutting its reliance on China, where competition is intense and its sales have suffered from diplomatic tensions between Seoul and Beijing. 
Jakarta/Seoul: Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd plans to start producing electric cars in Indonesia as part of an around $880 million auto investment in the country, the deputy minister for industry said on Thursday. Hyundai’s move to set up its first car factory in Southeast Asia fits into the South Korean carmaker’s strategy of cutting its reliance on China, where competition is intense and its sales have suffered from diplomatic tensions between Seoul and Beijing.
Hyundai, which together with affiliate Kia Motors is the world’s No.5 automaker, plans to build a factory in Indonesia with a capacity of about 250,000 units, including for electric cars, Indonesian deputy minister for industry Harjanto told Reuters.
Indonesia has ample reserves of nickel laterite ore, a vital ingredient for the lithium-ion batteries used to power electric vehicles.
The minister noted the plan was to export 53% of the cars manufactured in the proposed Hyundai plant, mostly to Southeast Asia and Australia, while the remaining 47% would be for the domestic market.
Hyundai said in a statement on Friday that it was “considering various ways to expand"" in new markets, including Southeast Asia. It added however that nothing had been decided regarding new production facilities in the region.
Japanese rivals
Hyundai briefed South Korean union officials earlier this year about a plan to build a factory in Indonesia, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. One of the challenges it identified was building sales networks, the people said.
Hyundai-Kia’s think tank vice president Lee Bo-sung said on Thursday the Asean market was difficult to “penetrate"" as it was dominated by Japanese rivals such as Toyota and Honda.
In Indonesia, Hyundai sold only 1,372 vehicles during the January to October period, compared with Toyota’s 463,565 vehicles, according to data from market researcher LMC Automotive.
Hyundai does not have a car factory in Southeast Asia, although it has some assembly operations in Vietnam. Last month, Hyundai announced a $250 million investment in Grab, the Singaporean ride-hailing firm, and a plan to offer electric vehicles to Grab drivers in Southeast Asia.

476,2018-12-21,Reliance,"Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea had complained that Trai predatory pricing rules, quashed by TDSAT, would benefit rival Reliance Jio

New Delhi: A week after a telecom tribunal quashed the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai’s) rules on predatory pricing and discounted offers, the regulator has appealed the tribunal’s verdict in the Supreme Court, arguing that it dismantles the regulatory framework for tariff assessment and places consumers at the mercy of service providers. 
New Delhi: A week after a telecom tribunal quashed the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai’s) rules on predatory pricing and discounted offers, the regulator has appealed the tribunal’s verdict in the Supreme Court, arguing that it dismantles the regulatory framework for tariff assessment and places consumers at the mercy of service providers.
The regulator, in an appeal filed on Friday, has also asserted that the tribunal’s judgement hinders it from performing its statutory functions.
The Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) had on 13 December quashed Trai’s predatory pricing order, in a relief for Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd, which had complained that the rules would benefit rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
Trai had set the new rules arbitrarily and without deliberation or effective consultation, TDSAT had ruled. The tribunal rejected Trai’s new definition of “significant market player"" (SMP), besides sparing telecom firms from disclosing on their websites segmented offers or tariff discounts aimed at retaining customers.
“The tribunal has erred in taking the view that it would not be necessary for telecom service providers to disclose details of segmented offers and if there is any other sensitive information which they feel would affect their business interests, they would be at liberty to withhold such information by offering a written explanation to Trai,"" the regulator said.
In February, Trai directed telcos to transparently disclose segmented offers and set the penalty for violations at  ₹ 5,000 for each day of delay, subject to a maximum of  ₹ 2 lakh.
Moreover, under the new rules, Trai could examine tariffs of an SMP—an operator holding a share of at least 30% of total activity in a relevant market—to check for predatory pricing.
The new definition of “total activity"" was based on any of two parameters—subscriber base and gross revenue—while an earlier definition included subscriber base, revenue, switching capacity and volume of traffic. According to other operators, excluding traffic from the definition of SMP would help Reliance Jio, which enjoys huge traffic on its network.
While Airtel and Idea approached TDSAT against the Trai rules, Vodafone challenged them in the Madras high court, alleging that the order would result in an unfair advantage to Reliance Jio, as it took away the three rivals’ flexibility to compete and retain customers in a circle in which they are significant market players.
In the appeal, Trai has also said that the tribunal’s judgement grants liberty to private operators to withhold information of segmented offers and discounts provided to existing customers, which is against the objectives of transparency and non-discrimination.
Moreover, the verdict quashes the operator’s requirement to disclose such discounts to the regulator which has created an anomalous situation where Trai’s power to regulate tariffs has been made redundant, Trai said in the appeal."

New Delhi: On planes, trains and buses, Indians, increasingly, are glued to their phone screens. In public, they may be on WhatsApp or watching cricket highlights, but what do they do in private? The men, at least, watch porn–and a lot of it. Google Trends, which quantifies search interest in particular terms or topics across regions, and over time, is a particularly useful tool for analysing porn interest. Search terms can often reveal what people are truly interested in. 
New Delhi: On planes, trains and buses, Indians, increasingly, are glued to their phone screens. In public, they may be on WhatsApp or watching cricket highlights, but what do they do in private? The men, at least, watch porn–and a lot of it. Google Trends, which quantifies search interest in particular terms or topics across regions, and over time, is a particularly useful tool for analysing porn interest. Search terms can often reveal what people are truly interested in.
Mint examined the popularity of a collection of porn-associated terms (“sex video"", “porn"", “porn website"", “free porn"", “porn video"", “xxx video"") searched on Google over the last decade, to find that search interest in these terms has increased steadily.
The search interest in porn seems to have spiked especially since September 2016, when Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambani shook up the telecom industry with the launch of Reliance Jio, precipitating an industry-wide decline in data tariffs, which has brought down the costs of accessing online porn.
The scale of this interest in porn, though, is better illustrated when compared with other search terms. Porn-related queries far exceed queries on more innocuous Indian passions, such as recipes, cricket and Bollywood. For example, over the past year, the number of porn-related searches were at least 10 times cricket-related searches or Bollywood-related searches.
Even by global standards, Indians are among the most fervent pursuers of porn. After adjusting for search volumes, only Bangladesh, Nepal, Ethiopia and Trinidad and Tobago make more porn-related queries than India.
Of course, Indians do not just search for porn, they also consume it in large doses. According to data from Pornhub.com, the world’s largest pornographic website, Indians are the third largest consumers of porn in the world (behind the US and the UK in terms of website traffic) and spend an average of 8 minutes on the website. The bulk of these visits come from men (70% of traffic) browsing via mobile phones (more than 90% of total traffic). All this comes even as the government tries to clamp down on porn: Since 2013, Indian visits to Pornhub have more than doubled.
Sites like Pornhub, which hosts an estimated 115 years worth of video material, offer a diverse selection of porn. But yet in this buffet of porn, Indians, more than others, stick to home comforts. Among the most searched terms on Pornhub over the last five years, ‘Indian sex’ and ‘Hindi’ featured most prominently. Indians also seem to have a familial fetish with ‘bhabhi’, another popular search term. This domestic preference extends to regions within India and, especially, South India. Examining regional Google Trends data for porn-related terms, we find that the most commonly related queries are simply regional porn variations. For instance, over the last decade in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, commonly related queries to a porn-related term are variations of ‘Telugu sex video’, likewise for Tamil Nadu (‘Tamil sex video’) and Kerala (‘Malayalam sex video’). 
While South Indians may be interested in regional porn, the east of the country is simply interested in porn. City-wide analysis suggests that places such as Siliguri, Guwahati and Bhubaneswar are the hotbeds of pornographic Google searches.
India’s erotic searches are not limited to just heterosexual content. Despite overall conservativeness towards homosexuality in surveys, on Google, at least, search interest in homosexuality is increasing over time and is in line with other countries. Examining Google search interest for a collection of same sex-related terms (e.g. “gay sex video"") reveals that, over the last decade, queries from India are in the same range as English-speaking countries (such as Australia, the US and Britain).
What does all this porn mean for society? Some critics argue that excessive porn can lead to sexual violence. Others argue the opposite, claiming that porn provides an outlet for suppressed sexual desires and decreases violence. Globally, the evidence is inconclusive. India, with its rising porn consumption and sexual violence problems, may provide a definitive answer in the coming years.
This is the second of a three-part data journalism series on what Google searches reveal about India’s taste and preferences. The next part will explore how Indians search for films and filmstars online.

473,2018-12-27,Reliance,"Reliance's acquisitions in entertainment space triggered consolidation in the industry

As we look back at the year gone by, several developments in the media and entertainment industry stand out. Among them, an important event was the Supreme Court ruling on the Star India Pvt. Ltd versus the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) case on tariff order. It was also the year when Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) showed its might as a great disruptor in the entertainment industry by picking up stakes in a clutch of companies. Another key occurrence was the coming of age of the video streaming platforms which vied with one another to grab eyeballs through their slates of original content. 
As we look back at the year gone by, several developments in the media and entertainment industry stand out. Among them, an important event was the Supreme Court ruling on the Star India Pvt. Ltd versus the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) case on tariff order. It was also the year when Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) showed its might as a great disruptor in the entertainment industry by picking up stakes in a clutch of companies. Another key occurrence was the coming of age of the video streaming platforms which vied with one another to grab eyeballs through their slates of original content.
But first let’s look at how the SC ruling is set to change the media landscape. On 30 October, SC paved the way for Trai’s tariff order and interconnect regulations for pricing and packaging of TV channels offered to subscribers. Under the new dispensation, broadcasters have to spell out the price of each channel separately for the consumer. This is likely to have an adverse impact on broadcasters who were pushing some of their smaller channels on the back of the more popular ones by bundling them in a bouquet. The move could affect new channel launches as well as impact revenues of some of the less popular ones.
However, the matter still needs clarity as Trai has filed a special leave petition seeking clarification on the 15% discount cap on channel pricing. According to Jehil Thakkar, partner at management consulting firm Deloitte India, “If SC upholds that discounts cannot be more than 15% of MRP, then channel prices are bound to go up,"" he says. So the broadcasters may see their revenues dip if consumers pick and choose their channels and abandon the less popular ones. Experts say that if the cost of TV entertainment goes up, consumers may be more inclined towards cord-cutting giving a boost to video streaming platforms.
Private broadcasters could be further stressed by the information and broadcasting ministry’s proposal this year to bring in a law for mandatory sharing of all sports of national importance with public broadcaster Doordarshan (DD) on all platforms—not just on its terrestrial network or its direct-to-home service Free Dish. Essentially it means that private broadcasters who pay millions of dollars to buy sports rights will not be able to keep their telecast exclusive. If implemented, this could destroy the sports ecosystem in the country. “This will lead to a drop in value of sports rights significantly as its scarcity value goes down. If broadcasters buy at a lower cost, team revenues will go down and they will stop investing in players. The long-term ramification will be lower investment in sports per se,"" says Thakkar. 
RIL’s acquisitions in the entertainment space has triggered consolidation in the industry. Earlier this year, the Mukesh Ambani-owned company bought a 5% stake in the NYSE-listed Eros International Plc through a subsidiary (in 2017 it had bought stakes in production houses Balaji Telefilms and Roy Kapur Films). In October, the company said it was acquiring majority stakes in Hathway Cable and Datacom Ltd and Den Networks for  ₹ 5,230 crore. With these acquisitions Reliance Jio gets access to 24 million cable-connected homes enabling a quick launch for Jio GigaFiber and offering triple-play services. “Reliance is revolutionizing the content business through both horizontal and vertical integrations across the ecosystem on the back of Jio,"" says Raj Nayak, media industry veteran and chief executive, Colors.
According to Thakkar, Reliance will be a catalyst in driving consolidation as others will seek partners. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd has, for instance, already stated its plan to get a strategic foreign partner for technology. “With the Star-Disney merger playing out soon, the media and entertainment space is clearly moving towards a consolidated industry with 3-4 key players making big strides towards changing the face of the business,"" says Nayak. In 2018, the OTT video streaming services also saw phenomenal growth. “OTT players are really making a huge mark in the Indian content space with multiple big-ticket properties,"" says Nayak. A recent Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report said that 82% of the OTT users in the Indian market are currently engaged on advertising-led video-on-demand platforms (AVoD) versus 18% who pay for content on subscription-led (SVoD) services. By 2023, there will be 40-50 million users paying for SVoD content while 600 million will be engaged on AVoD platforms.

New Delhi: ‎Reliance Industries and its partner BP plc of the UK have brought a deepsea pipeline laying ship to their Bay of Bengal block KG-D6 to help bring newer gas finds to production by 2020-21, the British firm said.
Reliance-BP are targeting to bring to production the R-Series and satellite fields in KG-D6 block by 2020, just around the time KG-D6 block’s currently producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields cease to produce.
These fields along with the ultra deep MJ find are to produce 30-35 million standard cubic metres per day of peak natural gas.
McDermott’s DLV2000 vessel will install deepsea pipelines to connect the R-Series and satellite cluster discoveries to production system.
“2019 will see work pick up speed, three projects on track to bring gas on shore,"" BP India tweeted and attached a blog on DLV2000.
DLV2000 is a class 3 dynamic positioning vessel combining a 2,200-tonne revolving crane with a deepwater underdeck S-lay pipeline system configured to install pipelines with diameters ranging from 4.5 to 60 inches in water depths up to 10,000 feet.
“On 26th December, we completed the as planned mobilization of the ‎DLV2000 on Reliance R / S Cluster 8 well OBO development project in Bay of Bengal, East Coast India for season 1 offshore campaign,"" BP said in the blog. OBO refers to fields operated by others.
“Today a new milestone has been achieved in gas development in the east coast of India with ultra deep water installation completed in 2000 meters water depth,"" BP India said in a separate tweet.
“Congratulations to the offshore team for this brilliant milestone achievement - first in India,"" it said in another tweet. “Milestone achieved installed the Deep Water PLEM (Pipeline End Manifold) foundation pile. It is located approximately 57 km south of the CRP (controller riser platform) in KG-D6."" Reliance is the operator of KG-D6 block with 60 per cent interest while BP plc holds 30 per cent stake. Niko Resources of Canada holds the remaining 10 per cent.
The D1 and D3 fields, the first of the one-and-a-half dozen gas discoveries in KG-D6 that were brought to production in April 2009, will cease to produce by end-2019 or early 2020.
This shutdown will coincide with upgradation, modification, and preparation of facilities and operating system to connect new fields, sources said, adding the R-Series is likely to give first gas in mid-2020 while satellite and MJ field may begin output in 2021 and 2022.
Reliance has till date made 19 oil and gas discoveries in the Krishna Godavari basin. Of these, D26 or MA -- the only oil discovery in the block -- was the first field to begin production (in September 2008). D1 and D3 fields went onstream in April 2009. ‎ MA field stopped production this quarter, sources said, adding that the field at its peak had produced 1,08,418 tonnes of oil in May 2010. Output has been declining since then. It produced 0.14 million barrels (1,960 tonnes) in the April-June quarter.
MA also started producing gas from April 2009, just when D1 and D6 went live. It peaked to 8.4 mmscmd in August 2010 before sand and water ingress forced shutting down of wells.
D1 and D3 fields too peaked that year in March with an output of 61.4 mmscmd. Output thereafter has only declined. KG-D6 output in April-June averaged at 4.7 mmscmd. This comprised production from both D1-D3 and MA fields."

New Delhi: Reliance Communications and Reliance Jio announced on Monday that they have extended the terms of an agreement for sale of wireless assets of the Anil Ambani owned firm.
The move comes at a time when Reliance Communication’s spectrum sale deal has been hanging fire, pending requisite clearance from the telecom department.
“Reliance Jio lnfocomm Limited, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited, extended the term of the definitive agreement for the acquisition of specified assets of Reliance Communications Limited and its affiliates to 28th June 2019,"" Reliance Industries said in a regulatory filing on Monday.
The acquisition is subject to receipt of requisite approvals from governmental and regulatory authorities, consents from all lenders, release of all encumbrances on the said assets and other conditions, it said.
In a separate filing, Reliance Communications said the company and Reliance Jio have “extended the validity of the agreements signed on 28th December 2017 for sale of towers, fiber, MCNs and spectrum of RCOM and its affiliates to 28th June 2019"".
“The transactions are to be consummated subject to various approvals that are presently in progress,"" RCom added.
Reliance Communications has been urging the telecom department to grant it the “long-awaited no-objection certificate"" to comply with a Supreme Court order in “letter and spirit"".
Senior officials of Reliance Communications and Reliance Jio had also met the telecom secretary this month to discuss outstanding issues raised by Department of Telecom (DoT) over payment related to spectrum sale deal between the two companies.
The Anil Ambani-owned company had maintained that it remains committed to discharging any outstanding or disputed amount subject to final adjudication.
Reliance Communications had earlier asserted that the requirement of giving bank guarantee as per DoT’s demand has been substituted by the orders of telecom tribunal and the Supreme Court, and that its unit Reliance Realty had provided a non-disposal undertaking and corporate guarantee.
“Hence, compliance with the trading guidelines is met,"" RCom had asserted in an earlier statement.
However, the DoT has, so far, held to its position that the deal cannot be cleared unless there is clarity on payment of dues and associated charges, particularly as the Mukesh Ambani-led Jio has refused to take any payment liability of his younger sibling’s firm RCom to conclude the spectrum trading deal between the two firms.

Mumbai: Indian shares closed little changed on the last day of the year after a volatile session. The Sensex rose over 200 points in the opening trade and the Nifty 50 surged past the 10,900 level boosted by positive sentiment in global markets following progress on US-China trade relations. However, the benchmark indices erased gains as investors turned cautious.

Marico shares traded 1.39% down at Rs 372.85 per share after the government increased MSP for copra to by Rs 20-21 per Kg to Rs 95.21 - Rs 99.2 per kg.“We do not see negative impact of increase in copra MSP on Marico’s profitability as the actual procurement price and MSP do not have correlation. Further, with price declines, we continue to believe that Marico would gain at the operating level,” said Dolat Capital Market.“Going ahead, we believe that the company would pass on some benefits of lower copra prices on consumers to gain volume growth.

465,2019-01-03,Reliance,"That Reliance Jio has added close to 10 million users almost every month in 2018 implies that the pressure on Vodafone Idea and Airtel in unlikely to abate

New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has wrested market share from Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd, as the relatively new entrant in the telecom sector continued to add a large number of users even as its bigger rivals lost customers. Reliance Jio added 10.5 million users in October while Vodafone Idea and Airtel lost 7.3 million and 1.8 million users, respectively, according to data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on Wednesday. India’s overall wireless user base grew by just 724,725 subscribers during the month. 
New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has wrested market share from Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd, as the relatively new entrant in the telecom sector continued to add a large number of users even as its bigger rivals lost customers. Reliance Jio added 10.5 million users in October while Vodafone Idea and Airtel lost 7.3 million and 1.8 million users, respectively, according to data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on Wednesday. India’s overall wireless user base grew by just 724,725 subscribers during the month.
Till now, the growth of Reliance Jio was largely attributed to smaller companies exiting the market because of the brutal tariff war triggered by its entry in late 2016. The wave of telecom sector consolidation that followed has left just three operators in the market. That Reliance Jio has added close to 10 million users almost every month in 2018 implies that the pressure on Vodafone Idea and Airtel in unlikely to abate.
In September, Reliance Jio added 13.02 million subscribers, while Vodafone Idea lost 6.68 million subscribers and Airtel lost 2.35 million users. Before September, Vodafone and Idea competed as separate entities. Airtel did not lose subscribers in the first eight months of 2018.
“It would appear that while incumbents are shedding marginal subscribers, Reliance Jio is acquiring new ones. However, it would be useful to know the number of subscribers who use Jio as their primary SIM,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India. “The incumbents are undoubtedly under great pressure and are struggling to compete. The large debt sitting on their books further impacts their ability to raise funds and invest in their networks.""
Vodafone Idea reported a  ₹ 4,970 crore loss in the September quarter, while Airtel posted a meagre profit of  ₹ 118 crore.
In contrast, Reliance Jio made a profit of  ₹ 681 crore during the same period.
In a strategic shift to boost profitability, Airtel and Vodafone Idea in November also introduced minimum recharge plans starting at  ₹ 35 a month, with an aim to reduce the number of low-paying and inactive customers, rein in selling expenses and focus on improving services to better-paying customers. This, the two operators believe, would improve average revenue per user, or arpu, as customers would do more recharges.
However, it seems that the competitive pressure on incumbents is likely to linger for some more time, especially given that Reliance Jio is not only grabbing subscribers but also cornering a large portion of the revenue market share. In the July-September period, Reliance Jio more than doubled its revenue market share to 26.1%, compared with just 11.6% in the same quarter in 2017.

During the same period, Airtel’s revenue market share was almost constant, while Vodafone Idea’s share shrank from 36.2% to 32.8%.
“Reliance Jio, the erstwhile challenger in the market, is now dictating terms in the telecom sector. And this year, it may well emerge as the number one player by both subscriber base and revenue market share,"" said Uppal."

New Delhi: Edelweiss Asset Management Ltd has won the mandate to manage India’s first exchange traded fund of public sector firms’ debt securities, two people aware of the matter said.  
New Delhi: Edelweiss Asset Management Ltd has won the mandate to manage India’s first exchange traded fund of public sector firms’ debt securities, two people aware of the matter said. 
The other asset management companies (AMCs) in the fray were SBI Funds Management Pvt Ltd, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Ltd, and UTI Asset Management Co. Ltd. Edelweiss won despite being the smallest AMC in terms of asset under management (AUM), with an average AUM of  ₹ 14,161 crore in the July-September quarter.
Edelweiss Asset Management declined to comment.
Earlier on Thursday, the five AMCs, including Edelweiss, had made presentations to the department of investment planning and asset management (Dipam) for the planned debt ETF. 
“Edelweiss was ranked number three on their technical expertise after Aditya Birla and Reliance Nippon. However, Edelweiss won the mandate on account of offering a 5 bps expense ratio,"" said one of the persons mentioned above.
“During the presentations, the fund houses focused on bringing out a good product for the retail investor which will serve as an alternative to fixed deposits. The ministry focused on the lowest and technically sound bidder,"" said the second person quoted above. Both of them spoke on condition of anonymity.
The chief executive officer (CEO) of one of the bidders said they would not have liked to compromise on economics. “We had bid for the debt ETF but would not have liked to compromise on profits and growth,"" said the CEO on condition of anonymity. 
The AMC would need to spend  ₹ 20 crore on every  ₹ 10,000 crore of AUM collected by the debt ETF for awareness and road shows, according to the government directive. An additional two basis points would also need to be spent on investor education as mandated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
Only AMCs with debt AUM of  ₹ 15,000 crore in the July-September quarter were eligible to apply. Edelweiss would also need to balance the economics as it incurred a loss of  ₹ 19 crore in FY18. 
Following up on a Union Budget 2018 announcement, Dipam on 16 November had invited AMCs to set up a debt ETF. Bids were to be submitted by 17 December. 
Edelweiss will need to work with the government and an external adviser for creating, launching and managing the debt fund, including additional tranches and fund offers. 
“Bonds, promissory notes, credit notes and debentures issued by leveraged good quality companies would make up the debt ETF. The ETF would be benchmarked or mirror a new index,"" said a fund manager, who did not wish to be named. 
The debt ETF would be made of AAA-rated bonds with defined maturity. The units of the fund then will be subscribed by investors, he added. 
A second fund manager explained that the AMCs have suggested four-five structures. 
“Both open-ended and close-ended have been proposed. Close-ended seems a more manageable structure. To create liquidity so that the ETF is easily tradable, market makers will be employed. The government is yet to finalize a structure,"" he said."

The Jio juggernaut continues to roll on, with the new entrant reporting the highest addition in active subscribers for the fourth consecutive month. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd added 8.5 million active subscribers in October, much better than Bharti Airtel Ltd’s tally of 3.4 million, shows data compiled by Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd.

Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd added 8.5 million active subscribers in October, much better than Bharti Airtel Ltd’s tally of 3.4 million, shows data compiled by Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. Vodafone Idea Ltd’s active user base eroded by 2.9 million. Its shares unsurprisingly fell 2%.
Interestingly, Reliance Jio’s parent, Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL’s) shares also fell 1.5% despite the gains in subscriber base. It may be gaining ground, but its focus on subscriber additions and cost-effective feature phones are limiting earnings expectations. “We note that the chase for feature phone subscriber market share has led to the roll out of low-average revenue per user plans,"" Motilal Oswal said in a note, referring to the Jio Phone offering. In any case, investors are already pricing in a far higher market share for Reliance Jio in RIL’s current valuations. The monthly subscriber addition numbers can do little to increase bullishness on the stock.
Besides, the subdued trend in subscriber additions at incumbents does not necessarily mean commensurate revenue market share gains. After all, Airtel and Vodafone Idea have been looking to weed out low-value subscribers. They introduced minimum recharge plans, requiring subscribers to mandatorily recharge to stay active on the network. In fact, this may lead to further subscriber share losses, as the full impact of the tariff hike is yet to be seen.
According to Motilal Oswal, around one-third of (35%) of Airtel and Vodafone Idea subscribers are low-paying customers (sub-₹15). As the tariff hikes kick in, the broking firm sees significant churn in this part of the user base. 
“A drop in the number of subscribers, per se, isn’t something that will worry incumbents,"" says an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm. Of course, it’s another matter if Reliance Jio starts weaning away high-value subscribers as well. Revenue market share numbers till the September quarter show that the new entrant has been more successful in markets outside the metros, indicating that incumbents have done reasonably well in holding on to high-value subscribers.
Much also depends on how dual-SIM users react to the tariff hikes. If a large section of customers prefers to retain Reliance Jio as their primary telecom connection, then it can make a notable dent to incumbents’ revenue base, say analysts."

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday issued notice to Anil Ambani on a plea by Ericsson India Pvt. Ltd seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against the chairman of Reliance Communication Ltd (RCom) for allegedly not complying with its order to clear dues of   ₹ 550 crore towards the completion of the asset sale with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. 
Ericsson had also sought that the Ambani be “detained in civil prison"" unless the payment is made.
A bench headed by Justice R.F. Nariman also allowed RCom to deposit   ₹ 118 crore towards its dues with the Supreme Court registry. RCom had offered to pay the amount by way of two demand drafts. 
The court also highlighted the need for RCom and Reliance Jio to sit together and resolve the issue over past dues. “Sit down and resolve this between yourselves, it is not for us. Till you don’t resolve between yourself, we can’t do anything,"" Justice Nariman said. 
The court also questioned Reliance Jio if it was willing to provide an undertaking to abide by the spectrum trade guidelines. Reliance Jio expressed difficulty in doing so. Senior lawyer Harish Salve, appearing for Reliance Jio said, “Knowing the problems with prior dues and when giving physical guarantee, we can’t take the risk.""
The court was responding to a contempt petition by RCom against the department of telecommunications (DoT) claiming that it failed to furnish a no-objection certificate clearing RCom’s spectrum deal with Reliance Jio even after the court had directed it to do so.
This means that the proposed asset sale, announced in December 2017 and initially expected to be cleared by March 2018, will be delayed, affecting repayment to the lenders of RCom.
The Supreme Court had on 30 November cleared the sale of spectrum by the Anil Ambani-controlled RCom to elder brother Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio on condition that the seller furnishes   ₹ 1,400 crore as corporate guarantee to the government within two days. This corporate guarantee, to be furnished by Reliance Realty, a unit of RCom, was in addition to the land parcel that had to be provided as security. The Supreme Court had also asked the central government to grant a no-objection certificate within a week of receiving the corporate guarantee.
But the DoT, on its part, refused to furnish the no-objection certificate after Reliance Jio did not agree to assume payment liabilities of RCom to complete the spectrum trading deal between the two companies. Under the government’s spectrum trading guidelines, the DoT has the right to recover these dues.
The apex court had on 23 October last year asked RCom to clear the dues by 15 December, holding that interest of 12 per cent per annum would be attracted for delayed payment.
Senior executives of RCom and Reliance Jio had last month met telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan to resolve issues flagged by the DoT around payment related to the spectrum deal between the two companies.
Reliance Jio has also extended the term of the definitive agreement for the acquisition of specified assets of RCom and its affiliates to 28 June 2019, Reliance Jio’s parent Reliance Industries Ltd said in an exchange filing on 31 December.
The RCom-Reliance Jio deal is crucial for the Anil Ambani firm as the beleaguered telecom operator, which had been struggling with a mountain of debt and a failed merger with Aircel, finally decided to wind up its wireless business in December 2017 and announced a deal with Reliance Jio in which RCom’s assets, including 122.4MHz of 4G spectrum in the 800/900/1,800/2,100 MHz bands, more than 43,000 cell towers, 178,000 route km of fibre with a pan-India footprint and 248 media convergence nodes covering 5 million sq. ft used for hosting telecom infrastructure, would be bought by Reliance Jio.

New Delhi: Just over a year ago, India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani offered a bailout option for younger brother Anil Ambani’s beleaguered company Reliance Communications Ltd, signing a deal in which Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd would buy the latter’s telecom assets that would potentially save it from insolvency. Today, the picture is starkly different and perhaps more complicated. 
New Delhi: Just over a year ago, India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani offered a bailout option for younger brother Anil Ambani’s beleaguered company Reliance Communications Ltd, signing a deal in which Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd would buy the latter’s telecom assets that would potentially save it from insolvency. Today, the picture is starkly different and perhaps more complicated.
The proposed sale of RCom’s spectrum assets, announced in December 2017 and initially expected to be cleared by March 2018, is in limbo.
Reliance Jio has expressed difficulty in providing an undertaking to the government to settle RCom’s dues till it is protected from RCom’s past liabilities by a bank guarantee. Such an undertaking is mandatory under spectrum trading norms before the government accords final approval for RCom’s asset sale to Reliance Jio.
In the absence of this undertaking, the department of telecommunications (DoT) has refused to issue a no-objection certificate for the RCom-Jio deal.
“It is totally up to the two companies now to figure a way out. DoT is not going to look at options for them. If Jio doesn’t give the undertaking, the government will not clear the deal,"" a senior DoT official said requesting anonymity.
Under spectrum trading guidelines, DoT has the right to recover these dues.
RCom’s ability to repay its lenders hinges on the Jio deal, especially with operational creditor Ericsson repeatedly taking RCom to court and asking it to detain Anil Ambani unless the payment is made.
But equally important for Jio is the fact that it currently shares spectrum with the company, especially in the premium 800 MHz band, ideal for 4G services.
“Since RCom will cease to be a wireless operator, DoT’s only recourse is to ask Jio to provide an undertaking for any liabilities that may arise. If the deal fails, RCom’s spectrum will end up back with the government which will auction it and Jio will have to bid for it. Rival operators will bid for it too. Jio will end up paying a higher price for the same asset. But for Jio too, it is difficult to give an undertaking without a definitive idea of the size of the past dues that could arise,"" a telecom lawyer said requesting anonymity.
Meanwhile, Reliance Jio has extended the term of the definitive agreement for buying specified assets of RCom and its affiliates to 28 June 2019, Jio’s parent Reliance Industries Ltd said in an exchange filing on 31 December.
“Right now, both parties need to sit together and try to figure out the extent of the past unknown liabilities and how much Jio needs to be protected. Some business risk will have to be taken by Jio also. Right now, it is a commercial disconnect between the two brothers and if RCom can satisfy Jio, then the deal goes through. If not, RCom will have to go through the entire NCLT route again,"" Saurav Kumar, partner, IndusLaw, said.
The Supreme Court too on Monday asked the brothers to jointly resolve the issue. “Sit down and resolve this between yourselves, it is not for us. Till you don’t resolve between yourself, we can’t do anything,"" Justice R.F. Nariman said.
RCom has completed the sale of its media convergence nodes and related infrastructure assets worth  ₹ 2,000 crore, besides selling fibre worth  ₹  3,000 crore to Reliance Jio. However, the spectrum sale is still stuck as it has not received DoT’s approval.

However, gains were capped as exports grew at the slowest pace in three months at 0.34% in December, they added.

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) reports its December quarter (Q3) results on Thursday. Here’s a look at its mainstay businesses and how the company is expected to fare. 
Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) reports its December quarter (Q3) results on Thursday. Here’s a look at its mainstay businesses and how the company is expected to fare.
Refining: Benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM), a key measure of profitability for refining firms, averaged $4.3 a barrel in Q3, a multi-quarter low. Accordingly, ICICI Securities Ltd estimates the company’s GRM for the December quarter to be at a 16-quarter low of $8.7 a barrel, and down from $9.5 a barrel in the September quarter.
Petchem: In the first two quarters of the year, Reliance’s petrochemicals business did the heavy lifting, as far as driving profit growth went. Q3 may be different, because although the polyesters business fared stronger, the chemicals business was soft. “The petchem business will be flattish to better in Q3,"" says an analyst.
Telecom: Analysts expect Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s revenue and profits to increase sharply sequentially, supported by a robust increase in its subscriber base and steady tariffs. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities estimate revenues and operating profit to increase 14% and 20%, respectively, on a sequential basis.

Retail: Reliance Retail Ltd has recently become meaningful in size, accounting for 7.1% of overall operating profit in the first two quarters, up from 2.8% in the year-ago period. The retail business is expected to have gained in scale in Q3. According to Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd, the retail business should see strong revenue growth as well as higher margins, thanks to the festival season.

The nub: While the share of consumer businesses has risen sharply already this year, the trend is likely to not only continue, but also accelerate in Q3. Apart from the weakness in the refining business, incremental growth in the petchem business is also likely to be muted. The telecom and retail businesses, on the other hand, are expected to fire away.

All said, given that the mainstay energy businesses are expected to be a drag, consolidated profit is estimated to be flat on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Analysts at Jefferies and Kotak both expect Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) in RIL Q3 results to remain flat at around Q2 levels.
However, analysts at Jefferies add, “Rising debt at telecom & retail is likely to leave consolidated net liabilities about $2.5bn higher sequentially to  ₹ 3.2 trillion."" Flat profits and rising debt is something that should worry investors."

The new e-commerce project would empower 1.2 million shopkeepers in Gujarat, Ambani said, adding the company was committed to making the western Indian state a fully digital one. 
The company declared its December quarter earnings Thursday and for the first time, its consumer businesses, mostly the telecom and retail operations, contributed one-fourth to the revenues. Petrochemicals contributed 42% and refining almost 26%.
Speaking at RIL’s 41st annual general meeting last year, Ambani had said the company aimed to more than double its revenues by 2025 as contributions from the retail and telecom arms came to match that of the hydrocarbon business.
The oil-to-telecom conglomerate posted consolidated revenues of  ₹ 430,731 crore in 2017-18 and a profit after tax of  ₹ 36,075 crore.
The company’s consolidated net profit of  ₹ 10,251 crore for October-December was 7.7% higher than the September quarter. Consolidated revenues came in at  ₹ 1,71,336 crore, up 9.6% from the immediately previous quarter.

Reliance Jio reported a 65% increase in its December quarter net profit to  ₹ 831 crore from  ₹ 504 crore a year ago. The company added a net 28 million subscribers during the quarter, taking its total subscriber base to 280.1 million.
The retail business continued to witness strong traction with 89.3% and 177.2% growth, year on year, in revenue and EBITDA, respectively, during the quarter led by the festive season and opening of new stores.
“Continued excellent growth of retail and strong subscriber additions in RJio are positives. Until more clarity emerges on the refining and petrochemical outlook and RJio’s deleveraging plans, we retain our hold rating"", said ICICI Securities in a 18 January note.
According to Sharekhan, the consumer-centric businesses like retail and digital services are expected to witness strong traction with plans to launch an array of new services like fixed-line broadband, cable TV and payment bank, which will create long-term value for RIL.
Its petrochemicals operations reported a 43% surge in EBIT while revenue grew 37.1%. The EBIT margin stood at 17.8% in the quarter against 17.1% a year ago.
RIL announced the transfer and eventual sale of its tower and fibre assets which, analysts expect, should lead to lower leverage and could trigger value creation. 
“A demerger of non-core telecom assets could prove to be a game changer—in one go, RIL deleverages sharply, while also monetising these assets potentially at a large premium to book value. With the petcoke gasifier on schedule for March 2019 and an imminent FTTH rollout, there are multiple triggers for an upside"", said brokerage firm Edelweiss Securities Ltd in a 17 January note.
“We reiterate ‘sell’ given our concerns on persisting high capex, non-contributing C-WIP and rising debt levels, all of which preclude a sustainable improvement in return ratios and free cash flows in the medium term. The recent sharp deterioration in refining and petchem margins may compound woes in the near term"", said Kotak Institutional Equities in a 17 January note."

Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) have risen 22% in the past year, compared to a 6% decline in the Nifty 500 index. This is despite the fact that refining margins are subdued right now and spreads in the petrochemicals business have come off. While the consumer businesses—Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Reliance Retail—are growing at a brisk pace, they account for roughly a fifth of overall profits. As such, the heavy lifting, as far as driving growth goes, stays with the mainstay refining and petrochemicals businesses.

RIL’s December quarter (Q3) results show things have indeed slowed down in these segments. Together, their earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) rose 1% on a quarter-on-quarter basis, down from 1.9% in the September quarter and 11.2% in the June quarter. This translated into sluggish growth at the consolidated level as well, with Ebitda (Ebit plus depreciation and amortization) growing by only around 1% sequentially.
While this may be on expected lines, flat profit is a worry because RIL’s debt has been rising at a rapid pace. Ahead of the results announcement, analysts at Jefferies India said in a note to clients, “Rising debt at telecom & retail is likely to leave consolidated net liabilities about $2.5bn higher sequentially to   ₹ 3.2 trillion."""

The Delhi High Court has set aside the over  ₹ 4,500-crore arbitration award in favour of Reliance Infrastructure subsidiary DAMEPL, which had pulled out from running the Airport Express metro line over safety issues, saying that the arbitral tribunal had not considered that the tracks were certified as safe for commercial operations.
The arbitral tribunal in its May 2017 award had accepted DAMEPL’s claim that the running of operations on the line was not viable due to structural defects in the viaduct through which the train would run.
The decision by a bench of justices Sanjiv Khanna and Chander Shekhar came on Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s (DMRC) appeal against a single judge order of March 6 last year upholding the arbitral award in favour of Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Ltd (DAMEPL).
The court said the tribunal had ignored and did not consider vital evidence of certification for commercial operations accorded by Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) while deciding the question of civil structure faults and instead it held that no effective steps to cure the defects were taken. “The reasoning virtually over-rules, negates and rejects statutory certification accorded by CMRS. Arbitral Tribunal without reason has held that the permission accorded and subsequent satisfactory commercial operations were not relevant and inconsequential. Pertinently certification/permission was granted by CMRS after due verification of the civil structure including the defects in girders.
“Cumulative effect of the aforesaid discussions is that the award shocks conscience of the court. Consequently, the award on the said finding would falter and fail,"" the bench said in its 97-page judgement which was pronounced on January 15 but made available on its website on Friday.
The court gave liberty to both DMRC and DAMEPL to invoke arbitration clause for fresh adjudication on their claims and counter claims. Under the agreement between the two, if the contract to run the Airport metro line was terminated due to DAMEPL’s fault, DMRC would have to pay 80 per cent of the debt, while if it was the metro’s fault, then the PSU would have to pay 100 per cent of the debt and 130 per cent of the equity.
DAMEPL had borrowed from 11 banks -- Axis Bank, UCO Bank, Punjab and Sind Bank, Andhra Bank, Central Bank of India, Dena Bank, Allahabad Bank, Canara Bank, Bank of India, IIFC UK and Canara Bank London -- to carry out operations on the line.
DMRC in its appeal had said that it has been running the airport line since June 2013 when DAMEPL had “abandoned"" the project despite repairs of structural defects in November 2012.
DAMEPL, on the other hand, has claimed that the CMRS certificate was granted with the conditions that the trains have to be run at reduced speeds and frequency, which would make the operations commercially unviable for it.
The concession agreement between the two was signed on August 25, 2008. Under the agreement, DMRC was to carry out the civil works, excluding at the depot, and the balance, including the project system works, were to be executed by DAMEPL, a joint venture of Rinfra and a Spanish construction company -- Construcciones Y Auxiliar De Ferrocarriles -- with a shareholding of 95 and five per cent respectively.
The Airport Express line was commissioned on February 23, 2011 after an investment of over   ₹ 2,885 crore, funded by the DAMEPL’s promoters’ fund, banks and financial institutions.

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) on Thursday said fiscal-third quarter (Q3) profit rose 8.82% from a year earlier, driven by higher price realizations in its petrochemical, telecom and retail businesses. Net profit rose to  ₹10,251 crore in the three months ended 31 December from  ₹9,420 crore in the year earlier. Revenue grew 56% to  ₹1.71 trillion from  ₹1.09 trillion. The company was expected to post a profit of  ₹9,476.3 crore on a revenue of  ₹1.4 trillion, according to consensus estimates of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
“In an oil price environment that witnessed heightened volatility through the quarter, we’ve delivered strong Q3 results on a consolidated basis,"" said chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani.
RIL’s consumer businesses reported Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) growth of 25% in Q3.
“In our new-age consumer businesses, we maintained robust growth momentum across retail and jio platforms and the share of consumer businesses is steadily increasing its contribution to the overall profitability of the company,"" he added.
Ambani is betting on the company’s consumer businesses—Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio—to double sales in about seven years and expects the businesses will contribute nearly as much to overall earnings as its energy and petrochemical businesses.
Its telecom arm, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, saw its profit grow 65% to  ₹831 crore from  ₹504 crore a year ago, its fifth straight profitable quarter. Revenue for digital services rose 51% to  ₹12,302 crore. During Q3, Reliance Jio added 28 million users for a total of 280 million.
“Jio phones have done quite well. Subscriber run rate has been good. Jio’s performance there with multiple things going on in the previous quarter, there were some special schemes that were contributing. Arpu (average revenue per user) is  ₹130 and we see strong engagement of voice, data and apps,"" said Anshuman Thakur, head (strategy) at Reliance Jio.
RIL’s organized retail business saw profit nearly triple from that of last year because of better festive sales and aggressive store expansion. Reliance Retail’s revenue rose to  ₹35,577 crore from  ₹18,798 crore in the year earlier. Healthy festive season sales and new store openings resulted in another robust quarter, the company said.
Product prices for the refining and petrochemicals business increased in line with Brent crude oil price, which was 10.4% higher on average. The higher volumes in the petrochemical business were on account of stabilization and ramp-up of new petrochemical facilities.
Gross refining margin (GRM), however, came in at a 16-quarter low of $8.8 per barrel against $11.6 per barrel that it reported a year ago. GRM is what a refiner earns by turning a barrel of crude oil into refined products.
Oil prices fell sharply during Q3 with Brent averaging at a five-quarter low of $67.5. Refining margins fared worse, falling to an eight-year low of $4.3 per barrel. Singapore gross refining margin declined to a nine-year low in December to average $2.9/bbl from $4.7/bbl in the previous month.
RIL’s debt rose to  ₹2.74 trillion at the end of December from  ₹2.19 trillion as on 31 March.
“You have seen the announcement about that we are going to demerge our tower and fibre business. It all means that eventually, you are going to see a lot more of the reverse cash flow and strengthening of the balance sheet. The intensity of capital expenditure will also come down,"" said V.

Gandhinagar: Top industrialists pledged further investments on Friday after Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit that India is poised to be placed among the top 50 countries in ease of doing business by 2020.
Top executives from companies such as the Tata Group, Reliance Industries, Adani Group, Aditya Birla Group, Russian oil and gas explorer Rosneft and Suzuki Motor Corporation praised Modi government’s performance in the last four-and-a-half years, at the inaugural function of the three-day event in Gandhinagar.
Vibrant Gujarat, a biennial event aimed at drawing investments to the state, is the brainchild of Modi when he was the chief minister of Gujarat. The first edition in 2003 attempted to rekindle investor confidence in a state wracked by a devastating earthquake in 2001 and communal violence in 2002.
“India is now ready for business. In the last four years, we have jumped 65 places of global ranking of ease of doing business. I have asked my team to work harder to ensure India is on the top 50 next years,"" Modi said at the inauguration. 
Tata Group chairman N. Chandrasekaran said the summit has set an example in India on how to bring different stakeholders together for progress, development and economic growth.
Chandrasekaran praised the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in the centre and said its accomplishments are enormous, laying a platform to propel India to significant growth for several decades.
“We are in discussion with the state government for significantly increasing our capacity at Tata Chemicals to reach one million tonnes of soda ash and we have an electric vehicle (EV) plant here (at Sanand) and we want to make further investments, not only in building electric vehicles but also in putting lithium ion battery projects here and we will also be investing in producing renewable energy,"" Chandrasekaran said.
Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) chairman Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, said the group has invested close to  ₹3 trillion in Gujarat and created and catalysed more than a million livelihood opportunities there.
“In comparison to the past decades, Reliance will double this investment and employment numbers over the next 10 years,"" Ambani said.
The RIL chairman, who has been attending the Vibrant summits since the first edition in 2003, said that it was very satisfying to see how every other Indian state has followed Gujarat’s transformative template. 
Ambani called Modi a visionary leader and said that under his leadership India has become the fastest growing economy in the world.
Meanwhile, the Adani Group aims to invest  ₹55,000 crore in the next five years in Gujarat.
“Over the next five years, our investments will include the world’s largest Solar Hybrid Park in Khavda. The anticipated investment is this park is  ₹30,000 crore. We also plan to establish a one gigawatt Data Center Park in Mundra, a one million tonne of copper smelting and refining project, a cement and clinker manufacturing unit in Lakhpat, an integrated lithium battery manufacturing complex and expand our photovoltaic manufacturing capabilities. Overall, we anticipate a total of  ₹55,000 crore of investment in all these projects,"" Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani said.
Modi has fundamentally reshaped India, Adani said, adding that nowhere in recent history has such a massive segment of the population been given the opportunity for upliftment in such a short period of time.
Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla promised an investment of  ₹15,000 crore in Gujarat in various sectors. “Gujarat has seen exponential growth without compromising on macroeconomic stability. It’s on the back of the remarkable business-friendly environment that Aditya Birla Group has rapidly increased investments in the state,"" said Birla. 
Guangda Xiang, founder and chairman of Tsingshan Industry, China, said, “Our first step towards India was in Vibrant Gujarat 2017 when we signed an MoU for setting up a big scale stainless steel complex in Mundra in cooperation with Indian partners. Within one year of signing the MoU we started construction of our first phase project, which will be completed in record time of 14 months."" 
Suzuki Motors chief executive officer Toshihiro Suzuki said his company will continue to introduce cutting-edge technologies in India, along with the Make in India concept, and contribute to sustainable mobility solutions.
Didier Casimiro, the global head of downstream for Rosneft, the world’s largest publicly traded oil and gas company, said Vibrant Gujarat has graduated from an investment promotion event to a forum to forge strong relationships.
Rosneft, which holds a majority stake in Nayara Energy that runs a 20 million tonne refinery at Jamnagar, aims to further invest $850 million for expansion in Gujarat, according to Casimiro.
The leaders of five countries—Uzbekistan, Rwanda, Denmark, Czech Republic and Malta—along with industrialists from various sectors and more than 30,000 delegates from India and abroad are taking part in the Vibrant Gujarat event.
Modi said that international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have shown confidence in India’s economy and the reforms undertaken in recent times. “We have also made ‘Doing Business’ cheaper. The implementation of GST and other measures of simplification of taxes have reduced transaction costs and made processes efficient.

New Delhi: Reliance Industries has asked its partner Niko Resources to withdraw from eastern offshore KG-D6 gas block over default in payments for field development cost, but the Canadian firm has sought to stall the move by invoking arbitration, the companies said.
Niko, which defaulted on payment of loans to its lenders, has been unsuccessful in seeking a possible buyer for its 10% stake in Bay of Bengal block KG-D6 or securing financing for its share of the $5-6 billion R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ development projects in the block.
In its third quarter earning statement last week, RIL stated that N‎iko ""defaulted on cash calls and accordingly default notice was issued as per the provision of Joint Operating Agreement (JOA)"".
""Since Niko did not cure the default within the default period, RIL and BP issued notice to Niko for withdrawal from Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and JOA and assign the participating interest to RIL and BP,"" RIL said. ""In response to the notice, Niko has served notice of Arbitration.""
Reliance is the operator of KG-D6 block with 60% stake and UK's BP plc has 30% interest.
Niko, in a corporate update, said that it has on 17 December 2018 ""received a notice from the non-defaulting parties requiring the subsidiary to withdraw from the KG-D6 PSC and JOA"".
The company said it was evaluating its legal options regarding the notice.
Niko decided not to pay a KG-D6 Block cash call that was due in early October, 2018. This led to Reliance slapping a default notice under the production sharing contract (PSC).
Under the terms of the joint operating agreement (JOA) between the participating interest holders in the D6 PSC, during the continuance of a default, the defaulting party shall not have a right to its share of revenue (which shall vest in and be the property of the non-defaulting parties who have paid to cover the amount in default).
In addition, if the defaulting party does not cure a default within 60 days of the default notice, the non-defaulting parties have the option to require the defaulting party to withdraw from the D6 PSC and JOA.
Niko had previously withdrawn from eastern offshore NEC-25 block due to cash crunch. Its 10% interest was assigned to Reliance and BP. Subsequent to that, Reliance now holds 66.6% interest in NEC-25 and BP the remaining 33.37%.
Niko said it has asked its lenders for a loan to fund its KG-D6 Block expenditures. ""None of the Lenders is under any obligation to provide this loan facility and, to date, none of the Lenders have offered to provide this loan facility,"" it said.

446,2019-01-21,Reliance,"Vodafone Idea is wearing the mantle of market leader uncomfortably On an apples-to-apples comparison, Reliance Jio may have already overtaken incumbents' revenues in Q3

The Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd juggernaut continues to gather steam. The three months ended 31 December marked the third consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential growth for the telecom firm. With a quarterly revenue of  ₹10,383 crore, Jio has in all likelihood overtaken Bharti Airtel Ltd’s India wireless revenue. Most analysts expect Airtel’s third-quarter revenue to decline slightly from the  ₹10,250 crore level in the September quarter.
But that is fairly well known. A moot question is whether Jio has also overtaken Vodafone Idea Ltd. The market leader reported wireless revenue of around  ₹11,300 crore in the September quarter, and it’s unlikely the revenue would have fallen over 8% sequentially in the December quarter. So perhaps, Vodafone Idea can wear the mantle of market leader for another three months.
But note here that we aren’t comparing apples to apples. Jio’s revenue does not include interconnect fees received from other telcos, while those of its competitors do. Interconnect charges are payable by a telecom operator whose subscriber makes a call to the telco whose subscriber receives the call. While incumbents may claim that these are legitimate charges and must form part of revenue, the fact remains that they will be abolished in less than a year from now. As such, a comparison that excludes interconnect usage charge (IUC) receipts makes sense.
Jio had a revenue market share of around 31.4% in the September quarter using this measure, marginally short of Vodafone Idea’s 31.8% share, according to analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. With Jio’s revenue having grown in double digits in the third quarter, it would have easily overtaken Vodafone Idea, even if the latter reports flat revenue. Kotak’s calculations involve myriad assumptions and calculations, which are best left alone. But whatever the assumptions, it’s fair to say Jio will be crowned market leader on revenue adjusted for IUC receipts, after incumbents report their third-quarter earnings.
Note that Jio has raced from upstart to market leadership in a little over two years since its commercial launch. As if that wasn’t bad enough from the incumbents’ point of view, they need to prepare for far worse. After all, while announcing third-quarter earnings, Jio told analysts it sees no need to tinker with tariffs. Current tariffs are in a sweet spot, the firm seems to think, as these are supporting double-digit sequential growth and inducing subscriber churn at incumbents.
For incumbents, there is nothing sweet about the current tariff levels. Airtel and Vodafone Idea are running large pre-tax losses already, and the only way out is higher tariffs. Jio’s statement that it is happy with the current tariff levels sent shares of Airtel and Vodafone Idea down 6.5% and 5%, respectively on Friday.
The hope that Jio might raise tariffs to reduce its own cash burn seems to be fading. In the third quarter, it reported a cash profit of about  ₹2,500 crore and a capital expenditure of  ₹14,000 crore, which shows that cash burn remains high. As a result, indebtedness at its parent, Reliance Industries Ltd, has climbed to around  ₹3 trillion, or about four times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
But Reliance’s answer to this is to look for opportunities to monetize its tower and fibre assets, rather than raising tariffs and cash flows. Investors should note that such sales involve some give and take. The higher the tower assets are valued, the higher will be the rentals the buyer of the assets demands, as is typical of any sale and leaseback transaction. As such, while debt may reduce a bit, so will profitability.
For now, investors don’t seem to be too bothered by all of this: Reliance shares rose 4.5% on Friday, with investors presumably enthused about the telco arm’s increasing dominance."
445,2019-01-21,Reliance,"Reliance Health Insurance CEO Ravi Vishwanath shares his views on resolving consumer complaints and making health insurance simpler for consumersThe growth rate of standalone health insurers in comparison with public and private general insurers is higher

You are among the youngest health insurance companies in India right now. What is the most significant development in the health insurance segment according to you at present? How will Reliance Health Insurance be different from Reliance General Insurance that is from the same group and also offers health insurance? 
From the customer point of view, exciting things are happening. The market size has increased from  ₹3,000 crore in 2008 to  ₹38,000 crore in 2018. We are quite sure it will go to about  ₹1 trillion by 2021. So there is a lot of opportunity. Also, consumers are appreciating the need of health insurance products. Then, more people are coming to standalone health insurance companies. The growth rate of standalone health insurers in comparison with public and private general insurers is higher. And standalone health insurers are predominantly focussing on retail business. 
Reliance Health Insurance is focussed on the retail space, and the end customer. It is too early to quantify, but as we go forward you will see that a substantial share of our portfolio will be retail. That focus is the difference. 
How do you look at the health insurance market in India right now? 
More and more products and services in health insurance will become customised based on individual needs. A lot of data will be used for that. 
The claims process, with the help of technology, is also expected to get a lot smoother. A part of the Ayushman Bharat program that will happen over time is health records and coding across hospitals getting standardised. As those things start happening, it will make the claims process a lot more data-driven, rule-based and much faster. So customer experience will improve. 
Also, the average coverage will increase and it needs to increase because most people having health insurance are underinsured. One thing that Ayushman Bharat has done besides highlighting the need for health insurance, is to put minimum coverage at  ₹5 lakh, which is more than what many people covered under health insurance have. 
As a new entrant, what will be your focus? 
Our focus will be customer experience. Our research tells us that the two main pain points are finding the right hospital and, when they are in the hospital, figuring out pre-authorisation for health insurance and how to make sure that discharge is fast and smooth. 
How will you do this? 
We have integrated our systems with all our network hospitals, so the process is completely electronic. The hospital can log into our system and make a request through that. The second thing is our contracts with hospitals. I think we are unique in that we are giving incentives to hospitals to give our customers better service. If our customer gives a better rating to a hospital at the time of claim, there is an incentive to the hospital. It is a small amount, but it is to recognise that the hospital provided good service. 
Another important aspect is underwriting. It is important to understand and accept the risk and tell the customer what is covered and what is not. We don’t want a customer to have a bad experience at the time of claim because we didn’t do the underwriting. 
While talking of underwriting, a lot of companies are giving out health policies without doing medical check-ups. How do you see this practice? 
It is important for us to know what is the risk that we are taking. It is very important that we do not cause inconvenience to a customer at the time of claims, that is the wrong time to ask questions. So we will do underwriting upfront. 
We do a medical check-up for every customer above age 45 or having a coverage of  ₹15 lakh and above. These decisions are data driven. Data shows that beyond 45 years, the risk of non-communicable diseases increases significantly. 
We also ask specific questions at the time of application. Based on the answers, we decide if we need more information or a medical test. Going for a medical check-up is not required in all the cases. 
A lot of complaints are about denial of claims or exclusions. How can that be resolved? 
The regulator is working on standardisation of exclusions. The earlier it happens, the better it will be. Some of the consumer complaints are justified because typically health insurance products are complicated. So can the products be simplified? We are trying to simplify ours. For instance, we have removed all the sub-limits. We also try to explain the product simply. In our policy document, if somewhere it is written that a pre-existing condition is covered after three years, we explain what this means just below that. Typically, if something is mentioned on, say, page 16, the explanation is on page 64. Standardising exclusions and definitions is needed, which the regulator is doing. 
We also have an extended policy cancellation period of up to 90 days, which is beyond the 15-day free-look period. Up to 90 days, we are ready to pay 100% of the money back. During this period, we also try to explain the policy details to customers. Even from the 91st day to the 364th day, a customer cancelling the policy will get pro-rated refund. 
If everyone follows these things, I think consumer complaints will go away. 
It’s been a few months since Ayushman Bharat was launched. Are some changes already visible due to the scheme? 
The first benefit to the industry—even if it is not participating in the scheme to the extent it was anticipated—is there is increase in awareness among the masses. The second aspect is the realisation that if someone below poverty line is getting a  ₹5 lakh cover, and if I have  ₹3 lakh health cover and want better quality healthcare, then I am underinsured. 
Reliance Health Insurance Ltd is among the newest standalone health insurers in the country—it got the regulator’s final approval in October 2018 and started operations in December 2018. CEO Ravi Vishwanath shares his views on resolving consumer complaints and making health insurance simpler for consumers"
447,2019-01-22,Reliance,"The move will help reduce Jio’s debt, make it asset-light and transfer future capex to new entitiesJio’s profit rose to  ₹831 crore in the December quarter from  ₹681 crore in the preceding three-month period

Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd may pare debt by monetizing its fibre and tower assets through the infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) route, analysts said after a meeting with top executives of parent Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).
Reliance Jio, which decided to separate the telco’s tower and fibre assets last month, said this will help Jio become an asset-light digital services company. Jio is spinning off its fibre and tower businesses into Jio Digital Fibre Pvt. Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt. Ltd, respectively. 
“The end objective will be to have different set of investors who would want to run these companies. This means that these assets go off our balance sheets, so the liabilities also go down,"" RIL’s joint chief financial officer Srikanth Venkatachari told reporters on Thursday. 
Jio’s profit rose to  ₹831 crore in the December quarter from  ₹681 crore in the preceding three-month period. 
""The planned monetization of fibre and tower assets through a transfer to two separate entities, in three to six months, which is likely to follow an InvIT structure, will help reduce Jio’s debt, make it asset-light, and transfer future capex to the new entities,"" wrote Citi Research in its report dated 18 January. 
InvIT is a mechanism that enables developers of infrastructure assets to monetize them by pooling multiple projects under a single entity or a trust structure. InvITs are long-term instruments structured as funds with a very long tenure or open-end structure. InvITs pool small sums of money from multiple investors for investing in assets that ensure cash flow over a period of time. Investors receive part of the cash flow back, in the form of dividend. 
Jio will be open to sharing the infrastructure with other telecom operators on market-based pricing and it does not view the sharing of the assets as a loss of competitive advantage. Analysts, however, say that Jio’s intent to monetize its own fibre assets could create more competition in the fibre sharing business."
444,2019-01-22,Reliance,"A bench headed by justice R.F. Nariman issued notices to Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, and Reliance Jio InfocommTDSAT had highlighted the need for “objective” yardsticks to introduce vital changes relating to SMP and non-predation

The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear a plea by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) against the 13 December ruling of the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) quashing the regulator’s tariff order on predatory pricing.
A bench headed by justice R.F. Nariman issued notice to telecom companies Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone, and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
Companies such as Airtel and Vodafone contended that these rules on predatory pricing would give undue advantage to new players such as Reliance Jio Infocomm.
The telecom regulator had, through its order, sought to introduce the concepts of “significant market power"" and “non predation"" and also permit non-reporting of “segmented offers/discounts"" by telecom service providers.
TDSAT had, while setting aside Trai’s Telecommunication Tariff (Sixty Third Amendment) Order, 2018 (1 of 2018) of 16 February, 2018, highlighted the need for “objective"" yardsticks to introduce vital changes relating to SMP and non-predation including “variable cost"" concept.
“The yardsticks must be objective and known to all telecom service providers or else the task must be left to be dealt with under the competition laws so that a competent authority can decide a complaint alleging predation,"" the appellate tribunal said. 
It also found the consultation process adopted by the telecom regulator to develop a new concept of SMP and non-predation ineffective.
Trai, however, contended that the appellate tribunal had, by setting aside its tariff order, exceeded its jurisdiction and thus virtually dismantled the statutory framework in force since 1999.
“The impugned judgment seriously acts against the interest of the consumers and deserves to be interfered with and ought to be set aside,"" it said."
443,2019-01-22,Reliance,"Just as Reliance gets ready to push ahead, the Indian government has tweaked its e-commerce rules and made them more onerous for Amazon and Walmart-FlipkartReliance Jio’s digital investments have already exceeded $40 billion

The battle for the Indian consumer was never going to be an all-American affair.
Walmart Inc.’s splashy acquisition last year of Flipkart Online Services Pvt., the homegrown e-tailer giving Amazon.com Inc. a solid run for its money, might have given the impression of a two-horse race. But as I argued (here and here), billionaire Mukesh Ambani wasn’t going to watch from the sidelines.
And last week India’s richest man jumped right into the fray. Ambani, chairman of the petrochemicals-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd., has a four-legged plan to connect India’s 30 million small retailers with consumers. One, neighborhood marts will be connected to Reliance Retail Ltd.’s footprint of almost 10,000 stores, offering them common inventory-management, billing and tax platforms as well as low-cost payment terminals. That will give the expanded retail network formidable sourcing power.
The second hook is Ambani’s telecom business. Consumer e-commerce in India is dominated by the urban middle class. Out of the country’s 500 million Internet users, almost 200 million live in rural areas where one out of four goes online less than once a month. No wonder the number of online consumers, while growing rapidly, is expected to be only about 120 million this year. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. alone has 280 million digital subscribers.
The ubiquity of Jio as a 4G telecom carrier, and the revolution it has unleashed in lowering data prices, means even shops in villages and semi-rural towns can now profitably transact with less affluent customers by using a hybrid offline-online model.
Third, Indians are watching almost 5 billion hours of video a month on their mobile phones and fiber broadband connections with Jio. That stickiness gives Ambani heft to promote private-label fashion, currently housed under the brand AJIO.
Finally, Ambani’s ability to influence policies in his home market shouldn’t be underestimated. Just as Reliance gets ready to push ahead, the Indian government has tweaked its e-commerce rules and made them more onerous for Amazon and Walmart-Flipkart. Until now, foreign retailers had found ways around a law that allows them to act only as pure marketplaces that don’t stock their own inventories or offer discounts. Now that the loopholes are being plugged starting next month, Ambani is pitching the idea that Indians’ shopping data should be stored locally.
Reliance Jio’s digital investments have already exceeded $40 billion. But in India’s hyper-competitive telecom market, the average revenue it can get from users isn’t even $2 a month. One way to make a carriage- and content-centered business spew out profits is to make it a triple play by throwing commerce into the mix, and lacing it with good, old-fashioned lobbying.
The Indian government is forcing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to compete with one hand tied behind his back. He could still beat Ambani, but he won’t be able to avoid getting bruised.

439,2019-01-23,Reliance,"Telecom firm’s board okays rights issue for existing shareholdersThe telco needs resources to meet its spectrum liabilities to the government and expand its 4G network coverage

The board of Vodafone Idea Ltd, India’s largest telecom operator by subscriber base, approved a rights issue of  ₹25,000 crore for existing shareholders in line with the recommendations of a capital raising committee it had set up in November, the company said on Wednesday.
It is critical for the company to raise resources to compete in a telecom market disrupted by the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016 that brought down tariffs and hit revenue streams of operators.
Moreover, Vodafone Idea, which posted a loss of  ₹4,970 crore in the September quarter, needs resources to meet its spectrum liabilities to the government and expand its 4G network coverage from the existing 50%.
“The board has considered and approved the offer and issue of fully paid-up and/or partly-paid up equity shares of the company and/or other securities convertible into equity shares of the company, including, but not limited to, compulsorily convertible debentures, for an amount aggregating up to  ₹25,000 crore, by way of a rights issue to existing eligible equity shareholders of the company,"" Vodafone Idea said in stock exchange filing.
The board had authorized the capital raising committee to decide on the terms and conditions of the rights issue, including the instrument, issue price, rights entitlement ratio, record date and timing of the issue, besides others.
“The company’s promoters Vodafone Group and Aditya Birla Group have reiterated to the board that they intend to contribute up to  ₹11,000 crore and up to  ₹7,250 crore, respectively, as part of such a rights issue,"" the company said.
The promoter shareholders have also said that in case the rights issue is under-subscribed, each promoter shareholder reserves the right to subscribe to a part or the entire amount of the unsubscribed portion.
Following the entry of Reliance Jio, the consolidation in the telecom sector has ended, with only two private entities—Bharti Airtel and the merged entity of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular—pitted against the Mukesh Ambani-owned telco.
To provide more balance sheet flexibility, Vodafone Idea is also exploring a sale of the company’s fibre network, comprising more than 156,000 km of intra- and inter-city fibre routes, it had said in November.
In November, Vodafone Idea chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla had met officials from the finance ministry and department of telecommunications to discuss the firm’s pending spectrum-related liabilities worth  ₹3,000 crore, due in March 2019. It has an additional  ₹12,000 crore due in the middle of the next financial year, Credit Suisse had said in a note dated 22 November 2018.
Under existing norms, an operator has to pay a part of the amount to buy spectrum. This is followed by a two-year moratorium, after which the operator has to make the remaining payment over 16 years.
Vodafone Idea has requested the period be increased from 16 years to 18 years, apart from a two-year moratorium on interest charges for spectrum instalments.
The company also plans to increase its 4G coverage from the current 50% to cover 70% of India in the next six months, and 80% in 2019-20, Vodafone Idea CEO Balesh Sharma had said in November."
437,2019-01-23,Reliance,"It must ratchet up the scale of its ambition, and rediscover the audacity that lay behind its original success

eliance Jio fired the most dramatic opening salvo of the new year with its announcement that it was venturing into the e-commerce space. It also served notice to its powerful competitors by suggesting that data of Indians should be controlled by Indian companies. Whatever be the trajectory of Reliance’s e-commerce ambitions, much can be learnt from its declaration. First, there must be a clear realization that the internet is a melting pot where connectivity providers, search engines, social media companies, device manufacturers and e-commerce platforms are engaged in stiff competition with each other, even as they cooperate in various ways to provide services to customers. For instance, Google’s search engine competes with Amazon in e-commerce by providing comparison shopping services. Second, the competitive advantage in this game will be seized by the company that is able to gather the most amount of data from customers and use it in the most effective manner. Third, bending the still nascent rules of the game to one’s advantage will constitute a key pillar of market leadership. Fourth, a stratospheric level of ambition is a necessary condition for mere survival in this market. And finally, the ability to “mess with the minds of competitors"" using jaw-dropping announcements followed by razor sharp execution is key.
It seems almost superfluous to mention that as of January 2019, Jio seems to have established a clear advantage over Airtel and Vodafone Idea. It is not even clear whether Jio regards them as its primary competition in the long run. So far, Jio’s growth was largely attributed to smaller telecom companies exiting the market. However, in October 2018, with all small firms having already exited the market, Jio added 10.5 million users while Vodafone Idea and Airtel lost 7.3 million and 1.8 million users, respectively.
In terms of its recent loss of subscriber numbers, the most plausible hypothesis is that the incumbents are losing 2G, 3G, and the 4G mass market customers. The 4G premium customers may have no reason to move and may even be averse to the Jio brand. Airtel’s problems with the mass market segment can be tackled by the introduction of a 4G feature phone, the simplification of its pricing plans to match the clarity of Jio’s plans, and bringing more flexibility in its data plans by setting monthly data limits rather than daily limits.
But to address the problems of Airtel and Vodafone Idea in terms of subscriber numbers would be to miss the point. The game today is not about allowing subscribers to connect to the internet but, rather, helping them to solve problems and becoming a part of the way they live, work and play. In the case of Airtel, it is also about stopping being seen as the follower and recovering its leadership position. In terms of subscribers, the company is still the leader with 343.5 million. It caters to a large percentage of technology startups in India. But in the battle for the mind of the customer, it seems to be a step slower than the new kid on the block.
To reclaim its lost leadership brand, Airtel should draw a leaf out of the politician’s playbook. The Congress party has recently come back from the dead by targeting farmers, SMEs, and unemployed youth. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) has held off the challenge of the mahagathbandhan by a slew of welfare measures, including a successful scheme for giving doles to farmers. The challenges of the mass market can be best addressed by a similar targeting strategy. Here are three possible ideas that could help.
First, an agri-tech platform to provide farm-related services via the farmer’s mobile phone. Farmers residing in rural areas have started using popular communication apps. With its partner IFFCO Kisan Sanchar Ltd, Airtel can bring in efficiencies on a massive scale by filling knowledge gaps related to weather predictions, mandi rates, trader contact details, updates on government policies and subsidy details. Once they grow data-rich, Airtel’s platform can provide insights and data-driven recommendations moderated by expert opinion on crop selection. It can evolve into a complete e-commerce platform exclusively for farmers.
Second, an all-India weather portal that can be used by farmers, insurance companies, logistics providers, aviation companies and energy utilities. The weather solution can work off connectivity provided by sensors placed all over the country.
Third, a “Come to India"" initiative that aims to turbocharge India’s highly underutilized tourism potential, both for international and domestic tourists, by the creation of millions of competent travel guides, waste warriors, tour operators and travel agents in partnership with government agencies. This could be synergized with a skills development and jobs portal for the youth of the country, especially those looking for jobs in the range of  ₹15,000-25,000 a month.
In short, Airtel has to transform itself from a connectivity provider to a cause-driven company that aims to radically improve the lives of ordinary Indians. It must ratchet up the scale of its ambition, and rediscover the audacity that lay behind its original success. The journey will probably require a rewiring of its culture.
As Louis Gerstner, the CEO responsible for making IBM an internet-compatible company, said: “Until I came to IBM, I probably would have told you that culture was just one among several important elements in any organization’s makeup and success… I came to see, in my time at IBM, that culture isn’t just one aspect of the game; it is the game.""
We look forward to a jaw-dropping announcement or two from India’s pioneering communications company.

441,2019-01-23,Reliance,"The new rules could hit online expansion, but it is still unclear if offline retailers will reap benefits. Of course, the consumer loses outAmazon, Flipkart are working on new legal structures that will allow the companies to continue discounting and maintain their private brand businesses

BENGALURU :
 In December 2016, the founders of Flipkart and Ola railed against the financial firepower of their respective American rivals, Amazon and Uber. “What we need to do is what at some level China did. They told the world that we need your capital but we don’t need your companies,"" Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal said then. Two years later, after Bansal’s company was taken over by the American retail giant Walmart Inc., the government seems to have granted Bansal’s wish, albeit in an entirely unwitting manner.
Late last month, the government announced a new set of policies for e-commerce companies that may reshape the retail business, hurting the e-commerce giants Flipkart and Amazon India and benefitting domestic firms like Reliance and Future Group as well as small traders. The government banned online retailers from selling products of companies in which they own stakes, disallowed them from entering into exclusive deals for merchandise, put restrictions on their wholesale arms, reiterated that discounting was prohibited and instructed them to stop selling private labels, among other changes.
While Flipkart and Amazon will be hit hardest, other well-capitalized online retailers such as BigBasket, Grofers, Pepperfry and many others will also need to make changes to their operations and legal structures in order to comply with the new policies.
The new policies, which followed years of furious lobbying by small traders who are seen as a core voter base for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, come into effect on 1 February. Both Flipkart and Amazon confirmed that they have sought more time from the government to implement the new policies. It’s not clear if the government will agree to the extensions.
“We remain committed to be compliant to all local laws, rules and regulations. We await clarifications from the government on the new policy changes. As we seek clarity, we have written to the government requesting an extension of four months. With over 4 lakh sellers and hundreds of thousands of transactions happening daily on the Amazon India Marketplace, we need adequate time to understand the details of the policy,"" an Amazon spokesperson said.
Impact on e-commerce
The new measures came nearly three years after the government in a statement titled ‘Press Note 3’ in March 2016 had released similar policies that clarified the rules governing foreign direct investment (FDI) in online marketplaces. Then, it had allowed 100% FDI in online retail of goods and services under the so-called marketplace model, but had banned the inventory model. It had also disallowed discounting by online marketplaces and prescribed the maximum sales of an individual seller on any marketplace.
Flipkart, Amazon and others quickly got around those policies by adopting new legal structures. Consumers continued to enjoy discounts and Flipkart and Amazon continued to grow even as organized offline retail expanded sluggishly. It was business as usual for the e-commerce firms that were flush with funds and eager to deploy them to boost growth.
This time experts say that Flipkart, now owned by Walmart, and Amazon are in far more serious danger. If the policy is strictly implemented, both companies will have to restructure their businesses in a big way.
Amazon will be forced to give up its shareholding in two of the largest sellers on its marketplace. Amazon had also purchased significant minority stakes in offline retail firms Shoppers Stop and More. It could now be stopped from forming any business partnership with these retailers. Flipkart-Myntra, too, will have to offload stakes in some important brands on their platforms as well as give up their booming, high-margin private label businesses. Third-party sellers on both platforms will suffer because of restrictions on their wholesale arms from which thousands of sellers source merchandise.
Sales of online retailers in India surged more than sixfold to $24 billion in 2018 from $4 billion in 2014, according to RedSeer Management, a consulting firm focused on internet businesses. That fast growth in online retail has come on the back of deep discounts, exclusive partnerships entered into by e-commerce firms with phone makers such as Xiaomi, Motorola and OnePlus and the control of operations of key sellers that allow online retailers to consistently and quickly deliver original and high-quality products to customers.
All of this could end with the new policy measures.
“If the policy is implemented ‘to the T’ it will seriously slow down online expansion,"" said Harminder Sahni, managing director of consulting firms Wazir Advisors. “Those who stand to lose from the fallout of this policy are very clear (Flipkart, Amazon and other online retailers), but there are no clear winners. It’s not a license that has been taken away from one person and given to someone else. It’s just a chance for someone to do business, and offline retailers always had the opportunity to do e-commerce. In the end, the consumer is losing, and everybody else in between is confused.""
To be sure, it’s not clear how strictly the new policy will be implemented. Apart from seeking extensions, Amazon and Flipkart are working on new legal structures that will allow the companies to continue discounting and maintain their private brand businesses, two people familiar with the matter said. Still, offline retailers, which have seen e-commerce firms lure customers away with low prices and wider product assortments over the past few years, hailed the new policy. It is widely believed that the new policy measures will benefit Future Group and Reliance Retail.
The truth behind offline gain
As if on cue, last week Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambani said the company will launch its e-commerce platform in Gujarat as part of a national expansion plan. RIL has a large footprint with 4,000 Reliance Retail stores, about 50 warehouses and 4,000 Reliance Jio outlets. It plans to offer customers an omni-channel experience although the exact nature of its e-commerce plan will only become clear over the coming months. After the new policy was announced, Future Group chief executive Kishore Biyani told The Economic Times newspaper in December that “it’s a game-changer for us.""
In an interview with Mint, Future Group joint managing director Rakesh Biyani said that the policies will bring about “a level playing field because the spirit of the law wasn’t being adhered to before."" “But if marketplaces decide to violate the spirit once again, then again the level playing field will be put aside. As long as the regulatory authorities take the responsibility of ensuring that right practices are adopted in India, nobody should be complaining,"" Biyani said. He added that the company’s business plan or e-commerce strategy will not change because of the new measures. “We’ve never participated in obnoxious discounting, or in doing something that crippled the business model for anybody. For us, our share of e-commerce is very small overall. We will continue to build it over a period of time but we are very focused on a business that is more profit oriented,"" Biyani said.
Vasanth Kumar, managing director of department store chain Lifestyle International Pvt. Ltd, said there will be “some"" benefits for offline omni-channel retailers if the policy is implemented strictly. “Instead of discounts, going deeper and further for brands that are available commonly there will be some (level playing field between offline and online). It’s not only discounting by online marketplaces that has taken away market share. Between 2014 and 2018, the square feet of organized retail doubled but demand didn’t double. New customers have definitely come but (at least some) existing customers have been getting shared between online and offline. Both factors dampened like-for-like growth for offline retailers, and when you add deep discounting to it, it became a lethal combination (for offline retailers),"" he said.
Some experts, however, said it was a stretch to believe that the new policy has handed a magic wand to offline retailers.
The offline shopping experience in India is still relatively poor. The product assortment and convenience offered by online retailers to customers as well as the technology and supply chain expertise of e-commerce firms cannot be matched by offline retailers. Plus, while the growth of online retail has been significant over the past five years, it is still only about 2.8% of the overall $850 billion retail market, according to RedSeer estimates. There’s significant room for both e-commerce and organized offline retail to grow.
“A lot of categories like smartphones were actually created by online retailers (over the past five years) and then they took a big portion of that pie. For example, it was when Flipkart and Amazon started bringing in value players from China, that’s when the mobile phone market became significant,"" said Anil Kumar, founder of Redseer. “Yes, online retail has been growing at around 35% while offline is growing at 12%. (But) that doesn’t mean that if online goes away, the offline growth will get a few additional percentage points of growth. There’s huge room for both to grow so there’s very limited cannibalisation happening now.""
Devangshu Dutta, founder of consulting firm Third Eyesight, agreed. “I don’t think we can say (the new policy) has levelled the playing field a lot because if offline retailers were so gung-ho about the online opportunity, they should have gone online in a much more aggressive manner much earlier. In any case, over the last 2-3 years, discounts by online retailers have moderated, which has given the offline players a lot of breathing space. There was a drop in footfall earlier due to discounting but after that customers came back because retail stores have their own selling points. It is not a like-for-like comparison with the online store. The demand hasn’t been impacted that much, the market has expanded to a certain extent across the board, so the offline retailers are hurting less than they were earlier,"" Dutta said.
Finally, the trader lobby
The new policies have been years in the making. Apart from the Press Note of March 2016, leaders such as Future Group’s Biyani and small traders, represented by Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), have protested for years against the discounting by online retailers. Experts have pointed out that it may not be a coincidence that such far-reaching policy measures against online retailers have finally been enacted in an election year—small traders are seen as a key voter base for the BJP.
This year, pressure has increased on the government to clamp down on e-commerce firms. In August, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said that the discounting practices by Flipkart may have to be reviewed by the relevant authorities, putting pressure on regulators to clamp down on discounts on online platforms. It was an unusual move for the CCI, whose remit is anti-trust law.
Mint had reported on 10 August that the observations by the competition regulator on the discounting practices of Flipkart may trigger a regulatory probe of all online marketplaces.
CCI made the comments while clearing the $16 billion takeover of Flipkart by Walmart. The regulator was responding to complaints by small traders led by CAIT who had alleged that Flipkart and Amazon were funding discounts and giving preferential treatment to specified sellers on their marketplace.
CAIT national secretary general Praveen Khandelwal said in an interview that the trader group wants the government to apply the new policy measures to Indian organized offline retailers, not just e-commerce firms. “We have already asked the government that whatever restrictions have been imposed on FDI in e-commerce, the same terms should also apply to domestic players; otherwise people like (Reliance) who are entering into the foray, and (other) already established players, will do the same thing that Walmart-Flipkart and Amazon, etc., were doing—i.e. predatory pricing, deep discounting, and exclusivity. Then there won’t be any meaning for the restrictions imposed on FDI in e-commerce.""
He added that CAIT will meet the commerce minister and secretary next week and “we will impress upon them to ensure speedy actions in this regard.""
Flipkart declined to comment. Reliance Retail did not respond to a request for comment."
442,2019-01-23,Reliance,"Deloitte ranked 250 firms for its annual report based on their retail revenues for fiscal year 2017In case of Indian companies, Deloitte factored revenue for year ended March 2018

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Retail jumped 95 spots on Deloitte’s Global Powers of Retailing 2019, to reach the 94th spot, buoyed by the homegrown retailer’s ability to rapidly increase it revenues, the consulting firm said in a report on Tuesday.
Deloitte ranked 250 firms for its annual report based on their retail revenues for fiscal year 2017.
In case of Indian companies, Deloitte factored revenue for year ended March 2018.
Reliance first entered Deloitte’s global retail ranking last year, becoming the first Indian retailer to be part of the list that tracks 250 retailers the world over. In this year’s ranking, it moved up significantly.
“Europe had the highest number of top 250 retailers, individual companies from other regions such as Amazon and Reliance did exceptionally well by climbing 2 and 95 spots respectively on the strength of exceptional retail growth,"" Deloitte said in a statement. Amazon saw a retail growth of 25.3 % while Reliance nearly doubled its retail revenue in FY17, Deloitte said.
Reliance Retail is India’s largest retail chain, both by revenue and the total number of stores. It sells a range of goods including grocery, electronics, and apparel under various retail brands such as Reliance Digital, Reliance Smart and Reliance Trends among others. To be sure, the company’s retail business also includes sales points for its Jio telecom business and its fuel retail business.
In the financial year 2017-18, Reliance Retail clocked revenue of  ₹69,198 crore. As of September 2018, the retailer operated 9,146 stores in over 5,800 cities in the country."
440,2019-01-23,Reliance,"The refinery processed 18 mt of crude during the quarter, higher than 17.7 mt in the Sep quarterRIL operates the world’s biggest single-location refinery at Jamnagar in Gujarat

MUMBAI :
Refining business that has traditionally done the heavy-lifting at Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is catching its breath, thanks to weak global demand and higher exports by the US and China. Until new shipping norms mandating higher-quality fuel take effect next year, conditions are not expected to improve much either.
In the December quarter, RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM)—or what it earns from processing each barrel of crude oil—touched a 16-quarter low of $8.8. However, the refinery processed 18 million tonnes of crude oil during the quarter, higher than 17.7 million tonnes in the September quarter.
JPMorgan India Pvt. Ltd sounded gloomy in a 18 January report: “Overall, RIL did highlight that while gasoline remains under pressure, the outlook is also not very robust at this point, given weak demand and higher exports out of US and China. In our view, the overall refining environment as of now is weak, given a combination of weak demand and higher Chinese exports.""
A day earlier, at its earnings announcement, responding to a query on whether RIL’s double-digit GRMs are history, joint chief financial officer Srikanth Venkatachari said the company is not “as negative"" on GRMs, while adding it is tough to say where GRMs would be headed.
RIL operates the world’s biggest single-location refinery at Jamnagar in Gujarat, with the technology to process cheaper, heavier crude.
Thanks to its technical prowess, it has traditionally enjoyed higher GRMs than Singapore GRMs, considered a global benchmark. In the December quarter too, RIL’s GRM was $4.5 higher than the Singapore benchmark.
During the last quarter, oil prices fell sharply, with Brent prices averaging at a five-quarter low of $67.5 per barrel. During the period, Singapore GRM fell to an eight-year low of $4.3.
“The prognosis for refining margins continues to appear weak in 2019, before new International Maritime Organization (IMO) bunker fuel regulations kick in 2020, on 2,000 barrels of oil per day (mbpd) of impending capacity addition, as against a demand growth of just 1.4mbpd,"" said Antique Stock Broking Ltd in its report. RIL too is pinning hope on the IMO norms to lift its GRMs. This, however, would take effect only in January 2020. Under IMO regulations issued in October 2016, ships must shift to fuel oil with sulphur content below 0.5% in January 2020, against the present 3.5%. The tougher quality standards for fuel oil powering ships are expected to boost RIL’s refining margins.
“As a result of our robust and flexible configuration, we are also uniquely positioned to take advantage of emerging opportunities in view of IMO 2020,"" Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of RIL, had said at the company’s 41st annual general meeting on 5 July 2018. RIL has already upgraded to these standards as part of its massive refinery expansion it undertook a few years ago. Fuel oil, also called furnace oil, is a by-product of crude oil refining. It is used in ships, and for steam boilers in power plants and in industrial plants. With the impending shift to low-sulphur fuel oil, demand for the same is expected to rise.
RIL, however, won’t be the sole winner due to the shift. State-owned refiners—Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd—too stand to benefit, as they too have already begun producing low-sulphur fuel."

436,2019-03-13,Reliance,"Changes in consumer behaviour and lifestyle will drive growth of 24-hour stores

Last fortnight a subsidiary of Kishore Biyani’s Future Retail Ltd announced its plans to set up 7-Eleven brand of convenience stores in India. Biyani, founder and group CEO, Future Group, said the company was targeting a revenue of $1 billion in the next seven-eight years. 7-Eleven has over 60,000 outlets worldwide, which function as small-format convenience stores that stock both fresh and packaged foods, beverages as well as items of daily use. In India, Biyani emphasized, 7-Eleven will be urban-centric. “We will be open 24 hours wherever we can...I think the urban markets are ready for a format where customers can get their lunch, breakfast, dinner, a lot of food and convenience items,"" he said.
India doesn’t really have a tradition of 24-hour convenience stores. Examples of firms dabbling in round-the-clock stores are few and far between. However, retail experts say the 24-hour grocery store has potential in this market. “But this potential is restricted to the top four or five cities,"" says Ankur Bisen, vice-president, retail and consumer products, at consulting firm Technopak. He feels that modern retail has evolved and it now has several sturdy pan-India players such as DMart, Future Retail and Reliance Retail. A recent Deloitte report pegs the share of modern retail trade at 9% of the overall retail trade as of 2017. By 2021, the share of modern trade is expected to go up to 18%, driven by a consumer shift towards convenience formats, says the report. 
For the 24-hour format, retail companies need to temper their expectations and restrict them to certain clusters. “There is no urgency for round-the-clock convenience stores beyond the top few cities,"" Bisen says. The 24-hour convenience stores make sense in high footfall areas or high density travel destinations. “Although convenience stores are not there for your monthly ration shopping, they serve a big top-up need. So, they must have a presence in neighbourhoods as well,"" says Bisen, adding that in some places real estate supply may not support such stores. The location must ensure easy access and footfalls as well as justify the unit economics of the store. The 24x7 formats could work in mixed-used developments, condominiums and office spaces. “Samir Modi’s 24-hour format convenience stores branded 24Seven are present in mixed-use locations and boast of high density in NCR. They are doing a reasonably good job,"" says Bisen. 
Bhasker Canagaradjou, head of business consulting at Ipsos India, agrees that 24Seven has been “successful after a roller coaster ride in the last 10 years of operations in India"". The firm has aggressive growth plans for the next four-five years wherein it plans to add stores in other regions via the franchisee model which will help it to scale faster. “It changed its retail strategy by increasing the store size and added more product stock keeping units. The decor was changed to appeal to the modern consumer. The brand is more focused on providing better customer experience through digitization, food vending machines and cashless service,"" he says. 
Changes in consumer behaviour and lifestyle will drive growth of 24-hour convenience stores. “People’s retail needs are more spread out today. There are call-centre workers on night shifts, late night flights, people living in hostels, single living. All these may boost the need for convenience stores,"" says Bisen.  In several markets, the 24-hour convenience stores are used by consumers to grab some food, snacks, drinks and everyday products on the go. Generally they are no-frills stores with little emphasis on the decor. 
“Traditionally, these stores target urban customers and customize the store offerings to local tastes and requirements to increase the footfall. In many markets, these stores provide other services wherein customers can pay their phone and utility bills, take a photocopy, and pick up online Amazon shopping. To achieve this customer orientation, most of the stores are operated by franchisees who understand the local customer and environment,"" says Canagaradjou. Will this concept work for India? With the growth in modern trade, India has tremendous potential. The country’s organized grocery stores registered a strong 22% growth in sales, according to a report titled Reformatting Retail in India by insights firm Nielsen India. Yet for the 24-hour convenience store format to click, retail companies need to find a unique proposition for customer experience. As a late entrant, for 7-Eleven “the challenge will be to find the best available locations and manage the cost of operations"", he says.   Besides, customization of services, such as offering facilities for utility bills payment or laundry pickups, could be key.

MUMBAI :
Canada-based Brookfield Asset Management’s India Infrastructure Trust, an InvIT, is acquiring Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL’s) loss-making entity East West Pipeline for  ₹13,000 crore, RIL said on Thursday.
“Brookfield has filed the preliminary placement memorandum, in terms of which India Infrastructure Trust, an InvIT set up by Brookfield as sponsor and 90% investor, will invest  ₹13,000 crore to acquire the East West Pipeline,"" RIL said.
The InvIT will acquire 100% equity interest in Pipeline Infrastructure Private Limited (PIPL) which currently owns and operates the East West Pipeline.
Following this acquisition by Brookfield, the existing pipeline usage agreement has been reworked and the reserved capacity reduced to 33 million metric standard cubic metres per day (MMSCMD) against the 56 MMSCMD. Additionally, any unutilized capacity payment by RIL will be the difference between the  ₹500 crore a quarter and actual revenue earned by PIPL.
“RIL will continue to be entitled to transport gas, either by itself or of any customers, free of cost against any outstanding unutilized capacity payments,"" the statement added.
That means, at the current approved final tariff of  ₹71.66 per million metric British thermal unit or MMBTU, if the average volume of gas transported is 22 MMSCMD, RIL will not be liable to make unutilized capacity payments, RIL said.
According to the terms and conditions agreed to, a review of tariff in April 2020 will also consider upward revision to tariff arising from determination of lower revised capacity of the pipeline, said RIL.
Given RIL and its partner BP India’s renewed investments of  ₹40,000 crore in the KG basin; the growing liquefied natural gas imports and ability to swap gas, the average volume expected to be transported through the pipeline is expected to be significantly higher compared to the current levels.
Thus, RIL will be entitled to a significant participation in the net earnings of PIPL under the mechanism specified in the pipeline usage agreement.
“RIL’s current investment in preference shares valued at Rs. 4,000 crore to continue and will be converted into equity at the end of 20 years,"" said RIL.
Additionally, at the end of 20 years, RIL has the right to acquire equity shares of PIPL held by the InvIT at an equity value of Rs. 50 crore, the company said."

Mumbai: Cube Highways and Infrastructure, the Indian roads and highways platform of global infrastructure fund I Squared Capital, on Thursday said that it has agreed to acquire DA Toll Road Pvt.

The enterprise value of the transaction is around  ₹3,600 crore, RInfra said in a statement. The proceeds will be utilized for debt reduction.
On completion of the transaction, the Cube Highways portfolio will have over 4,500 lane-km of highways across India, the statement said. Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.
Investment bank Ambit Pvt. Ltd acted as financial adviser to Reliance Infra.
DA Toll Road operates the 180-km, six-lane Delhi-Agra highway (NH2). The road is a 26-year concession granted in 2010 for strengthening and widening the four-lane highway to a six-lane configuration and began collecting tolls in October 2012.

This investment reinforces Cube Highways’ position as a leading player in the Indian highway sector and furthers its disciplined growth plan of acquiring strategically located roads from leading construction companies and developers,"" said Gautam Bhandari, director of Cube Highways and Partner, I Squared Capital.
The completion of the transaction is contingent upon fulfilment of regulatory and lender approvals.
“DA Toll Road forms a core part of NH2, a main artery of the national highways network connecting North to East and Central India. The road has robust growth potential as it connects major industrial and tourist centers in north India including Delhi, Faridabad, Mathura and Agra. We anticipate even further growth following completion the entire NH 2 road project,"" said Harikishan Reddy, chief executive officer of Cube Highways Advisors.

New Delhi: Tata, Reliance and Airtel emerged as the top three Indian brands of 2019, according a report published by Interbrand, part of the Omnicom Media Group, an advertising and public relations conglomerate.
Tata continued to hold the top position in the best Indian Brands ranking as its brand value grew by 6%, mainly due to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Knocking its competitor Airtel off from the second spot, Reliance's brand value grew by 12%, bolstered by the success of Jio. This also explains the 13% degrowth in Airtel’s brand value. Following Airtel at number three, HDFC Bank, LIC, State Bank of India, Infosys, Mahindra, ICICI Bank and Godrej rounded off the top 10 list.
The Interbrand’s annual ranking is based on three key components — financial performance, the brand's role in influencing customer choice and strength, and the premium price that the brand commands. The combined value of the top 40 brands stood at  ₹50.03 billion in 2018, a 5.2% growth over the previous year. Financial services and automobile contributed the most to the year’s Top 40, with 27% and 10% growth in brand value, respectively.
In its sixth year, the Best Indian Brands ranking saw retail making its presence felt. Kishore Biyani-owned Big Bazaar grabbed the 33rd spot with  ₹26.86 billion, along with supermarket chain DMart at 37 with  ₹20.15 billion. Along with Big Bazaar and DMart, Nerolac Paints, which came in at 39 with a brand value of  ₹19.19 billion, were the three new entrants in this year’s ranking.
Automobile sector grew at an average 16% with brands such as Royal Enfield, Bajaj Auto, Ashok Leyland, Hero, Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra demonstrating a higher than average growth.
Tata’s jewellery and accessory brand Tanishq, motorbike brand Royal Enfield, Kotak, Bajaj Auto, Ashok Leyland and Britannia were amongst the fastest-growing brands. Meanwhile, Reliance Group and Canara Bank exited this year’s list.
“Many brands that are creating value are actually reinventing the category. The best example of a global brand is Amazon and the local counterpart is Jio, which has enabled digital life in the country,"" according to Ashish Mishra, managing director, Interbrand India.
While the luxury sector registered a 42% growth in brand value, Mishra said many brands outside the luxury category were adopting the luxury mindset. “They offer personalised experiences to customers, excellence in craftsmanship and community. Automobile brands have improved their dealerships and introduced innovations. In the retail sector, a brand like Big Bazaar has adopted a luxury mindset by changing its design language and store formats,"" he added."

NEW DELHI :
State-run telecom firm BSNL said Friday the pending February salaries of its 1.76 lakh employees have been cleared.
The company also announced the launch of various schemes to increase its market share and revenue.
""We have disbursed salary of all employees that was pending for the month of February. BSNL employees have ensured that customers services run uninterrupted despite issues that they were facing.

He had stressed that with the telecom department's support, there would be no delay in salary disbursement in coming months.
BSNL Friday announced free voice call on its 'Wings' mobile app and free broadband services for a period of 30 days to attract new customers.
Under the scheme, BSNL landline and mobile customers can make unlimited calls across India for free for a period of 30 days through its Wing mobile application and make calls to any landline or mobile number in India for  ₹1.2 per minute when they are travelling abroad.
""The Wings app annual activation charge is  ₹1,100 but we are giving it to all students at 20 per cent discount, all central and state government at 50 per cent discount and BSNL employees for 75 per cent discount,"" BSNL Wings (OSD) AK Jain said.

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal reserved Wednesday its order on a petition by Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) seeking release of income tax refunds to clear dues to Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson Inc. Lenders of RCom have opposed the plea, saying that it will lead to outgo of public money for settling payments of a private party.
After hearing both sides, the NCLAT bench—headed by chairperson S.J Mukhopadhaya—reserved the order in the case.
The chairman said that both the parties should see the RCom-Ericsson dues case as a resolution process rather than seeing it as a suit and that the principle of resolution is to save the company so that creditors get the maximum out of an asset.
Mukhopadhyay said that in case liquidation proceedings are invoked against RCom, then all the creditors—including Ericsson—will have to pay back the amount that they have received from RCom and projected valuation of company's asset of  ₹38,000 crore may fall to  ₹2,000-3,000 crore. ""Ericsson will get 20-30% from it,"" he said.
The NCLAT bench was hearing the petition of RCom to release  ₹259.22 crore received from income tax refund from the Trust and Retention Account (TRA) held with the State Bank of India. All receivables of RCom are deposited in the TRA account controlled by lenders. 
Appearing for Anil Ambani-led RCom, senior lawyer Kapil Sibal appealed for payment to be made to Ericsson from the TRA. Lenders of RCom, led by State Bank of India, opposed the application of the company.
Senior lawyer Neeraj Kishan Kaul, appearing for SBI, argued for rejection of the RCom's appeal, contending that it will lead to an outgo of public money for settling payment of a private party.
He said that RCom's asset monetization deal failed because Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd refused to take responsibility of past dues of the Anil Ambani-led firm before the DoT and hence it is not liable to make payment on behalf of RCom.
RCom has been asked by both the Supreme Court and the NCLAT to pay  ₹550 crore to Ericsson. The company has paid  ₹118 crore to Ericsson and if it fails to pay the rest of the amount, then RCom group chairman Anil Ambani may have to face three-month jail-term for contempt of court. 
Sibal said if  ₹259 crore is released from TRA, RCom will look at raising rest of the amount to clear all of Ericsson's dues. 
The Supreme Court has given RCom time till 19 March to pay out Ericsson."

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio was the fastest telecom network in February, registering average download speed of 20.9 megabit per second on its network, according to the Trai data.
Performance of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone remained almost flat at 9.4 mbps and 6.7 mbps compared to their performance in January, the data published by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) showed.
The average download speed on Idea's network improved to 5.7 mbps in February from 5.5 mbps in January.
Though Vodafone and Idea Cellular have merged their businesses and now operate as single entity Vodafone Idea, Trai published their network performances separately.
Vodafone was at the top in terms of the average upload speed. Its network registered an upload speed of 6 mbps in February from 5.4 mbps in January.
Idea and Airtel registered a slight decline in average 4G upload speed at 5.6 mbps and 3.7 Mbps respectively in February, while Jio witnessed marginal improvement with 4.5 mbps average upload speed.
Download speed plays an important role when a user watches any video, browse the Internet, and access emails; and a good upload speed is required when a user wants to share data like images, videos through email or social media applications.
The average speed is computed by TRAI based on data it collects with help of its MySpeed application on a real-time basis.

427,2019-03-16,Reliance,"Darshan Patel, who sold Paras Pharma in 2006, has made a come back with Vini Cosmetics, while Crompton Greaves's Gautam Thapar is looking to re-enter the consumer spaceEven Mukesh Ambani came back to telecom with Reliance Jio after 11 years. Ajay Piramal seeks to do something similar in pharma 

Mumbai: Darshan Patel was 45 when he sold Paras Pharmaceutical Ltd to Actis Capital for $43 million in 2006. He wanted to retire with all the money he received, but the feeling of sitting idle scared him.
In 2010, Patel founded a new company, Vini Cosmetics, the maker of Fogg perfumes.
According to Nielsen, Fogg is one of the top brands in the men’s perfume category. The product is giving a tough fight to former market leaders, including Hindustan Unilever’s Axe and McNROE Consumer Products Pvt. Ltd’s Wild Stone.
Today, Patel is an established entrepreneur in his second coming, a feat that was rare a few years ago, but is now gaining momentum. For instance, it took Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, a good 11 years to make a comeback in the telecom space—a business he had successfully built during his father Dhirubhai Ambani’s reign, but had to give up after a bitter family split.
“Naya venture to mujhe karna hi tha (I had to start a new business),"" Patel said in a phone interview.
Patel was the man behind re-positioning cult products, which included pain reliever Moov, hair serum Livon, Dermicool prickly heat powder, and Set Wet hair gel, for Paras Pharmaceutical Ltd.
His family owned business was later acquired by UK-based Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc in 2010 for  ₹3,260 crore.
There are many like Patel who have exited their businesses successfully only to come back in a similar space to do something even bigger.
Yogesh Mahansaria, the former chief executive of Alliance Tire Co., first sold a part of his stake in the company to private equity firm KKR and Co. for $522 million, and subsequently sold the entire business to Japanese tyre maker Yokohama Rubber Co. for $1.2 billion in 2016, before finally exiting in 2017. In December, Mahansaria founded a two-wheeler tyre manufacturing company. His family entered a joint venture with Swedish engineering company Trelleborg, where the former will hold a 76% stake.
Piramal Group, which sold its pharmaceutical solution business to US’s Abbott Laboratories, is also making a comeback in the healthcare space.
The Ajay Piramal-led Piramal Enterprises Ltd is considering a re-entry into the domestic formulations business, eight years after selling its portfolio to Abbott. Piramal sold its domestic formulations business, which manufactured, marketed and sold branded pharmaceutical products in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka in finished form, for $3.72 billion in 2010.
Similarly, Gautam Thapar, who sold his entire 34.37% stake to Temasek Holdings, among others, in Crompton Greaves’ consumer business, is also set to re-enter in the consumer space. Email queries to Piramal and Crompton spokespeople did not elicit any response till press time.
Of course, the entrepreneurs are making a comeback after the non-compete period ended. Piramal’s non-compete ended in September 2018.
For instance, the agreement between Mukesh Ambani and his younger brother, Anil, prevented the former from launching Reliance Jio earlier. Mahansaria, however, is able to enter the tyre manufacturing business because earlier he used to manufacture off-road tyres and not two-wheeler tyres.
Serial entrepreneurs usually feel “they have a lot of energy"" and a desire to build something rather than taking a retirement route, according to Amit Tandon, chief executive of proxy advisory firm Institutional Investors Advisory Services (IiAS)."

Bengaluru: Anil Ambani-led Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) said on Monday it terminated a deal to sell its telecom assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, the mobile telecom firm controlled by Anil's elder brother and Asia's richest man, Mukesh Ambani.
RCom and Reliance Jio ended the deal after failing to get approval from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), objections from RCom's lenders and its decision to approach the bankruptcy court to resolve its debt, RCom said in a regulatory filing.
On Monday, RCom shares fell 9.30% to  ₹4.00 apiece on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex gained 0.19% to end the day at 38,095.07 points.

Mumbai: Ericsson SA has received  ₹462 crore ($67.42 million) from Indian telecom firm Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), the Swedish company said on Monday, potentially saving billionaire Anil Ambani and two RCom directors from a jail term.
Late last month, the Supreme Court found Anil Ambani, chairman of the debt-laden firm, guilty of contempt of court for wilfully failing to pay the Swedish telecom equipment maker. SC had ordered Ambani and two RCom directors to pay Ericsson  ₹450 crore within four weeks or face a three-month jail term for contempt of court.
RCom, which owes a total  ₹571 crore to Ericsson, including a one-time settlement of  ₹550 crore and interest payments of about  ₹15 crore, had already deposited  ₹118 crore with the Supreme Court in February.
The Swedish firm signed a deal in 2014 to manage and operate RCom's network and last year approached the court over the unpaid dues.
RCom has struggled for cash partly a result of a price war triggered by market entrance of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, controlled by Anil Ambani's elder brother and Asia's richest man, Mukesh Ambani.
RCom had also sought approval from its lenders to release tax refunds of a further  ₹260 crore to Ericsson.
Additionally, the company was also looking at selling its real estate assets to pay Ericsson, people aware of the matter had told Reuters in February.
RCom did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.

422,2019-03-19,Reliance,"Shares of RCom rose as much as 10% RCom called off the sale of its telecom assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm citing failure to get approvals from lenders and the government

MUMBAI :
Shares of Anil Ambani-led Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) were locked in the upper circuit on Tuesday after his elder brother Mukesh Ambani helped pay off debt owed to Sweden's Ericsson.
Telecom equipment maker Ericsson received  ₹4.62 billion from RCom as unpaid dues from a deal it had signed in 2014, a spokeswoman said on Monday.
India's richest man Mukesh Ambani, who controls oil-to-telecoms powerhouse Reliance Industries, appears to have offered support to ensure Anil Ambani paid off total dues of  ₹5.5 billion to Ericsson.
The nature of the backing or how it was delivered was unclear, but in a statement Anil Ambani thanked his billionaire brother ""for standing by me during these trying times, and demonstrating the importance of staying true to our strong family values by extending this timely support"".
RCom called off the sale of its telecom assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm, the mobile telecoms firm controlled by Mukesh Ambani, citing failure to get approvals from lenders and the government.
India's top court had last month ordered Anil Ambani and two RCom directors to pay Ericsson  ₹4.5 billion within four weeks or face a three-month jail term for contempt of court.
Share of RCom rose as much as 10% to  ₹4.4, in their biggest daily percent gain since Feb. 26.

421,2019-03-19,Reliance,"Anil Ambani thanked his brother Mukesh, after Reliance Communications completed the required payment 'I and my family are grateful we have moved beyond the past,' said Anil Ambani

Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani has helped his younger brother avert a stint in jail, stepping in to make an $80 million payment for his sibling Anil whose telecom-to-infrastructure empire is struggling under the weight of debt.
The embattled former billionaire, Anil Ambani, thanked his brother Mukesh, and his sister-in-law, after Reliance Communications Ltd. completed the required  ₹5.5 billion ($80 million) payment to the local unit of Ericsson AB for past maintenance services. Repeated failures to pay and Ambani’s personal guarantee landed him in trouble in February, with the top court giving him a month’s notice to comply or spend time in prison.
“My sincere and heartfelt thanks to my respected elder brother, Mukesh, and Nita, for standing by me during these trying times, and demonstrating the importance of staying true to our strong family values by extending this timely support,"" he said in a statement from Reliance Communications. “I and my family are grateful we have moved beyond the past, and are deeply grateful and touched with this gesture.""
The last-minute twist underscored family ties despite their turbulent relationship more than a decade. After they carved up the conglomerate, the older brother’s oil and petrochemicals business flourished, while Anil Ambani’s businesses ranging from telecom to power and infrastructure strained under massive debt, with the tycoon fending off creditors in multiple court cases.
As a result, the younger sibling’s net worth has shrunk to about $300 million, from at least $31 billion in 2008 based on the current foreign-exchange rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, marking his stunning fall. That is in stark contrast to the success of Mukesh, whose net worth now is $54.3 billion and added $10 billion this year alone, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
The decline in Anil’s wealth ranks among the largest and fastest implosions in modern history ranking alongside the reported $70 billion loss Japan’s Masayoshi Son suffered during the dot-com crash after SoftBank Group Corp.’s stock tumbled.
Rare Distinction
Brazil’s Eike Batista was worth more than $30 billion at the start of the decade, according to the index. But his commodities and logistics empire evaporated under a mountain of debt and insider trading investigations. He gained the rare distinction of “negative billionaire"" in 2015 when his net worth sank to more than $1 billion in debt.
The Times of India, citing a person working for the Anil Ambani group, reported that the bailout money was an outright grant from his elder brother.
Shares of RCom, as the telecom carrier is called, had slipped 9.1 percent on Monday in Mumbai before the announcement. The stock plummeted 60 percent in 2018 as Anil Ambani struggled to close a 2017 deal to sell spectrum, signal towers and fiber to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., a new service provider controlled by his elder brother, for 173 billion rupees.
RCom said Monday that the two companies have mutually agreed to terminate the pact, adding RCom is committed to “a comprehensive resolution"" of overall debt through the National Company Law Tribunal.
Personal Guarantee
As regulations delayed the completion of his biggest deal, creditors such as Ericsson began demanding past dues. The Swedish equipment maker’s relentless legal pursuit led to a settlement under which RCom was to pay half of the past claims, or  ₹5.5 billion -- an offer backed by a personal guarantee from Ambani.
Failure to keep this promise after a personal guarantee from Ambani escalated into a contempt case, with the court eventually setting the deadline.
The threat of a prison term to Ambani also came as a rare warning to some of India’s richest borrowers whose firms have turned defaulters. The nation’s policy makers and courts have been cracking down hard on delinquency to help banks saddled with the world’s worst bad-loan ratio.
The Ambani brothers used to serve as executives at their father’s company. In 2005, three years after their father’s death, the two settled to split the empire into two. Anil Ambani got newer businesses such as telecom, power generation and financial services.
Mukesh Ambani also re-entered telecom with the creation of Reliance Jio Infocomm. The nationwide 4G network, which debuted with free services in 2016, disrupted the industry, forcing rivals including RCom to bleed, merge or exit.

The government’s further fund offer (FFO) of CPSE ETF will open to retail investors today and will be open till 22 March. The FFO was opened to anchor investors on 19 March and seeks to raise  ₹3,500 crore with an option to retain up to  ₹5,000 crore in case of oversubscription. The exchange-traded fund (ETF) is managed by Reliance Nippon AMC. Investors are being offered a 4% discount on the ‘reference market price’ of the underlying ETF shares. The reference market price is the average of the full day volume weighted average price of the constituents of the Nifty CPSE Index on the NSE over 20 and 22 March.
The CPSE ETF was launched in 2014 and has seen three FFOs since then. The current offering is the fourth FFO. Investors who bought the ETF at its initial launch were offered a 5% discount and bonus units if they held the ETF for more than one year. Investors in the subsequent three offers were also offered discounts of 5%, 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively. The CPSE ETF has 11 public sector companies. Just four companies in the power, coal and oil sectors make up as much as 77% of the ETF—ONGC, NTPC, Coal India and IOC. These are not the same PSUs as the original composition of the CPSE ETF in 2014. A few PSUs such as GAIL India, NTPC, Container Corporation of India and Engineers India have been dropped while others like NLC India, SJVN and NBCC India have been added. “The CPSE ETF is trading at very attractive valuations. As of 28 February, the dividend yield of the index was as high as 5.52% compared to 1.25% for the Nifty 50. The PE ratio was 8.43 compared to 26.32 on the Nifty. In addition, the government is also giving a 4% discount to investors,"" said Vishal Jain, head, ETFs, and fund manager, Reliance Nippon AMC.
Should you invest?
Experts are divided on this question. Shyam Sekhar, chief ideator and founder, iThought, came out in support of the ETF on valuation and macroeconomic grounds. “PSUs are extremely under-owned and have a lot of short-term negatives priced in. Overall, the economic growth has been muted in the last five years as there was no investment cycle revival. This is likely to change in the next five years regardless of who wins the election. CPSEs in the energy sector will benefit from this revival and an ETF is a good way to access them,"" he said.
Samant Sikka, founder, Sqrrl, an online mutual fund platform, also favoured the investment due to its ability to give low-cost exposure to multiple public sector firms. “Investors in the CPSE ETF are well served by the basket of companies, which spares them the time and effort needed to buy individual companies. The product is also highly transparent, liquid and low-cost,"" he said.
However, some believe that the CPSE ETF may not be a good idea from a long-term perspective. Deepak Khemani, a Mumbai-based wealth manager recommends the ETF only as a short-term play due to the discount. “Ideally, people should invest in ETFs for the long term. However, in PSU-dominated ETFs like CPSE, investors usually enter only for the discount and exit soon after listing. I would not recommend it as a long-term investment. However, someone who wants to capture the discount can do so,"" he said.
Mint’s take
The CPSE ETF consists wholly of the government-owned companies and this comes with certain risks. Government companies are often managed from a welfare or political point of view rather than the profit motive. For example, in January 2018, ONGC was forced to buy HPCL from the central government to help meet the government’s disinvestment target. The CPSE ETF has also delivered poor returns in the past. Its returns since launch stand at 6.62% CAGR (as on 19 March 2019). Valuations of the ETF are indeed attractive compared to the broader market but this may just be a reflection of the poor performance of the ETF constituents and the lack of market confidence in them. The discount can offer short-term gains to investors who exit immediately after listing. However, short-term market plays are not a tactic that we recommend."
417,2019-03-20,Reliance,"Vodafone Idea shareholders will be able to buy 87 shares for every 38 shares held for an issue price of  ₹12.50 apiece, a 60% discountThe rights issue will increase the number of Vodafone Idea shares by 229%, diluting it to 28.74 billion outstanding shares

New Delhi: Vodafone Idea Ltd, India’s largest telecom firm by subscribers, announced Wednesday a  ₹25,000 crore rights issue that came at a steep discount to its prevailing share price as it sought to attract enough subscribers.
Vodafone Idea would issue 20 billion new shares at  ₹12.50 apiece. This is a 61% discount to prevailing prices and led to shares of Vodafone Idea falling about 7% intraday, before recovering to close 3.3% higher at  ₹33.10.
“The rights entitlement is determined as 87 equity shares for 38 equity shares held by the eligible shareholders. The issue will open on 10 April 2019, and will close on 24 April 2019,"" the company said in a statement.
Analysts said the deep discount underscores the challenging business environment in the telecom sector and the urgent need of operators to raise funds to compete with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
“Vodafone Idea is clearly underwater. The company is desperate to raise funds,"" a Mumbai-based analyst said, requesting anonymity. “It’s a huge discount to sweeten the deal for shareholders to subscribe, because if they don’t the promoters will have to make good the shortfall and then their stake in the company would go up,"" said the analyst.
Vodafone Idea had in January approved the rights issue for existing shareholders.
“The discounting is in line with past rights issues in India. The discount may appear large also because the size of the rights issue is large compared to the market capitalisation of the company,"" a senior official from Vodafone Idea said, requesting anonymity.
It is critical for Vodafone Idea to raise resources as it faces stiff competition from Reliance Jio, which has hit the revenue streams of other operators since it entered the telecom sector in September 2016 with cheap tariffs.
Earlier this month, the board of Bharti Airtel Ltd approved a rights issue of  ₹25,000 crore, as well as the raising of  ₹7,000 crore through foreign currency perpetual bond issues, taking the total capital raise to  ₹32,000 crore.
Vodafone Idea, which posted a loss of  ₹5,004 crore in the December quarter, also needs resources to meet its spectrum liabilities to the government and expand its 4G network coverage from the existing 62%. Its most immediate payment for  ₹6,300 crore to the telecom department is due in April.
Vodafone Idea also plans to raise up to  ₹5,000 crore by monetizing its stake in Indus Towers and has also separately announced plans to sell its fibre network comprising more than 156,000km of intra- and inter-city fibre routes.
“The proceeds from the rights issue coupled with the monetization of our stake in Indus will allow us to make the required investments in the business to achieve our strategic goals,"" said Vodafone Idea CEO Balesh Sharma.
The company had in January said that its promoters, Vodafone Group and the Aditya Birla Group, intend to contribute up to  ₹11,000 crore and up to  ₹7,250 crore, respectively, as part of such a rights issue. In case the rights issue is under-subscribed, each promoter shareholder reserves the right to subscribe to a part or the entire amount of the unsubscribed portion.
The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) believes that the pricing of financial instruments in the market place reflects the sentiment. “You always want the issue to be fully subscribed and you have to give a discount when there is negative sentiment in the industry. However, the promoters of Vodafone Idea are sending a signal that they are more bullish than general market sentiment and see long term interest in the sector,"" said Rajan Mathews, director general, COAI."
416,2019-03-20,Reliance,"TRAI chairman R.S. Sharma said the operators were consulted over the 5G base price and the govt has not sought any further review on it so farExperts say TRAI's suggested base price of  ₹492 crore per unit of 3500 MHz 5G spectrum is much higher than  ₹65 crore per unit in Korea

TRAI chairman R.S. Sharma on Wednesday put the ball back into the operators' court after they complained that the 5G spectrum reserve prices were higher, saying the operators were consulted over the base price and the government has not sought any further review on it so far.
""If the government thinks the price is on the higher side, they will make a reference to TRAI. Somebody says it is on the higher side or the lower side, it is their call.
""How many times do I take into consideration, did I not consult everybody when we gave the recommendations. Only after the consultation process, TRAI gave the recommendations.
""We have consulted every stakeholder and given our recommendations on the reserved price of spectrum for 5G,"" the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) chairman told IANS in an interview.
Sharma's comments came amidst the complaint against the higher base prices suggested by TRAI, with some operators even saying that given their poor financial health, they will not be able to bid if the Department of Telecom (DoT) takes up the auction this year.
Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal had said the 5G spectrum price recommended by TRAI is not appropriate.
An operator would need to pay at least  ₹9,840 crore to buy 5G spectrum on a pan-India basis as the regulator has suggested it ""should be put to auction in the block size of 20 MHz"".
The recommended base price is 30% of the price of 1800 MHz band and the regulator has proposed a limit of 100 units of spectrum per bidder to avoid monopolisation, another telco said.
""The government had two failed auctions. Do they want to have five more failed auctions?"" Mittal has said at an industry event.
""Spectrum is required, spectrum will be bought, India will get into 5G but the only thing that will stand in the way is pricing,"" he added.
The government wants to ring in 5G services in 2020 and the auction is likely to happen in 2019.
Industry experts said TRAI's suggested base price of  ₹492 crore per unit of 3500 MHz 5G spectrum is much higher than  ₹65 crore per unit at a recent 5G auction in Korea.
""TRAI's 5G spectrum base price is 7.5 times the market-discovered price in Korea,"" an industry expert said.
The TRAI proposes 20MHz blocks in the 3,300-3,600MHz band at a price of  ₹492 crore per unit in 5G spectrum bands.
The DoT which follows TRAI in pricing the spectrum broadly accepts the regulator's recommendations on spectrum base prices before auction most of the times.
However, in case of 700Mhz spectrum band, where TRAI had earlier proposed a price of  ₹11,485 crore per unit, DoT had asked TRAI to revise it after the spectrum band failed to be sold in 2016 spectrum auction.
The TRAI after reference recommended a 43% cut in the base price for premium 4G airwaves in the 700MHz band at  ₹6,568 crore a unit.
The telecom sector has witnessed intense competition after the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in 2016, which brought down tariffs to rock bottom and hit revenue streams of other operators."
415,2019-03-20,Reliance,"Reliance Jio dominated growth by adding over 93 lakh new mobile customersThe net increase of telecom subscriber in January was 59 lakh, compared to over 1 crore subscribers added by the three players

NEW DELHI :
The country's telecom subscriber base for the third time crossed 120-crore mark with Reliance Jio, BSNL and Airtel adding new customers in January, according to a report released by telecom regulator Trai.
""The number of telephone subscribers in India increased from 1,197.87 million at the end of December 2018 to 1,203.77 million at the end of January 2019, thereby showing a monthly growth rate of 0.49 per cent,"" the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India said in monthly subscriber report for January 2019.
Earlier, the subscriber base crossed the 120-crore mark in July 2017 and May 2018.
The mobile customer base grew to 118 crore in January from 117 crore in December. The wireline connection in the country slid to 2.17 crore in January from 2.18 crore in December.
Reliance Jio dominated growth by adding over 93 lakh new mobile customers. State-run telecom firm BSNL followed Jio by adding 9.82 lakh mobile subscribers. Bharti Airtel returned to growth track, after losing mobile customer in December, by adding over 1 lakh new customers.
The net increase of telecom subscriber in January was 59 lakh, compared to over 1 crore subscribers added by the three players. However, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices jointly lost close to 44 lakh mobile customers.
The country's biggest telecom operator Vodafone Idea lost 35.8 lakh mobile customers, Tata Teleservices 8.4 lakh and state-run MTNL 4,927 mobile customers.
The wireline connections declined mainly because of BSNL losing 90 thousand connections. Private operators Bharti Airtel and Vodafone added 29,930 and 6,386 connections.
Broadband connections in the country grew 4.15% to 54 crore in January from 51.8 crore in December. The mobile devices-based broadband connections accounted for over 96 per cent of total base with over 52.1 crore subscribers while wireline connections reached 1.82 crore.
Top-five service providers constituted 98.63% market share of the total broadband subscribers at the end of January. Reliance Jio led the market with 28.94 crore broadband subscribers. It was followed by Bharti Airtel with 11 crore connections, Vodafone Idea 10.98 crore, BSNL 2 crore and and Tata Teleservices Group 22.6 lakh connections.
BSNL maintained lead in the wireline broadband segment with 91.7 lakh connection. It was followed by Airtel with 23 lakh connections, Atria Convergence 14 lakh, Hathway Cable & Datacom 7.9 connection and MTNL 7.7 lakh connections.

414,2019-03-20,Reliance,"Vodafone Idea had to resort to a deeper discount, given the competition from the Airtel rights issueVodafone Idea's balance sheet is also far more precarious when compared to Bharti Airtel's

Academic research shows that a rights issue that’s priced at a deep discount does not signal negative information about a company’s equity value. A deep discount is often used by companies to ensure full subscription to the issue, as this paper published in the Journal of Financial Economics points out.
Still, equity investors are often puzzled when they are faced with a deeply discounted rights issue. So when Vodafone Idea Ltd announced a rights issue price of  ₹12.50 per share, which was nearly a 60% discount to prevailing prices, public investors seemed a bit at sea. Vodafone Idea shares first fell by about 7% intraday, before recovering those losses and eventually ending the day 3.3% higher at  ₹33.10.
Investors eventually warmed up to the rights issue price on the belief that the discount would do the trick and attract enough non-promoter shareholders.
The company’s promoters are already doing the heavy lifting, having committed to pick up about 73% of the  ₹25,000 crore issue. They have also said that they retain the right to subscribe to more shares, in the event of under-subscription.
It’s also important to note that the announced rights issue price is at a 32% discount to the theoretical ex-rights price (TERP), or the price the stock is likely to trade at after the rights issues is completed. In the case of Bharti Airtel Ltd, which is also in the process of raising  ₹25,000 crore through a rights issue, the discount to TERP was at around 26%.
It isn’t surprising that Vodafone Idea is leaving no stone unturned to ensure its rights issue gets enough subscribers. Its balance sheet is far more precarious when compared to Bharti Airtel’s as well. While Bharti Airtel has a net debt to Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio of 4.2 times, Vodafone Idea’s leverage ratio is at 25.2 times. The leverage ratio has been calculated using annualized earnings for the quarter ended December 2018.
And as the chart above shows, Vodafone Idea’s stretched balance sheet has meant that it has had to curtail capital expenditure at levels that are far lower compared to its peers. This has resulted in market share losses.
“Despite the fact that the balance sheet may improve because of opex synergies and planned fund-raising, net debt to Ebitda is still stretched and limits the company’s ability to get close to both Jio and Bharti Airtel on 4G anytime soon on a pan India basis,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd said in 12 March note.
As one analyst puts it, the funds raised through the rights issue, coupled with the existing cash on the books, is expected to last a little over a year from now. Apart from the need to monetize assets such as its fibre network, the company may well have to look at another issuance, he adds.
Keeping these risks in mind, at least some analysts are advising clients to rather participate in the expected recovery in Indian telecom by investing in Bharti Airtel.
Perhaps what Vodafone Idea has in its favour, apart from the deeper discount, is much higher leverage. For investors who like to take risks, any gains will be disproportionately higher if Vodafone Idea manages to bounce back strongly from its current position."
413,2019-03-21,Reliance,"At least three vessels chartered by Reliance supplied refined products to Venezuela in recent weeksIn a statement last week, Reliance said its US unit has completely stopped all business with PDVSA

New Delhi/Mexico City: India's Reliance Industries, operator of the world's biggest refining complex, has turned to selling fuels to Venezuela from India and Europe to circumvent sanctions that bar US-based companies from dealing with state-run PDVSA, according to trading sources and Refinitiv Eikon data.
Reliance had been supplying alkylate, diluent naphtha, and other fuel to Venezuela through its US-based subsidiary before Washington in late January imposed sanctions aimed at curbing the OPEC member's oil exports and ousting Socialist President Nicolas Maduro.
At least three vessels chartered by the Indian conglomerate supplied refined products to Venezuela in recent weeks, and another vessel carrying gasoil is expected to set sail to the South American nation as well, according to the sources and data.
Reliance, an Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has significant exposure to the financial system of the United States, where it operates subsidiaries linked to its oil and telecom businesses, among others.
The Indian market is crucial for Venezuela's economy because it has historically been the second-largest cash-paying customer for the OPEC country's crude, behind the United States.
Additional sanctions against Venezuela are possible in the future, as US President Donald Trump's administration has not yet tried to prevent companies based outside the United States from buying Venezuelan oil, a strategy known as ""secondary sanctions.""
Refinitiv Eikon trade data shows that Reliance shipped alkylate, a component for motor gasoline, to Venezuela on vessels Torm Mary and Torm Anabel in recent weeks. Those originated in India and passed through the Suez Canal.
It also shipped a gasoline cargo using tanker Torm Troilus to Venezuela and is preparing to send 35,000 tonnes of gasoil in a vessel called Vukovar to the South American nation.
""Reliance is also supplying some products from its Rotterdam storage,"" a source familiar with Reliance's operation said.
Reliance did not respond to emails seeking comment. PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment.
In a statement last week, Reliance said its US unit has completely stopped all business with PDVSA. Reliance also halted all supply of diluents including heavy naphtha to Venezuela and does not plan to resume such sales until sanctions are lifted, according to the release.
Venezuela has overall imported some 160,000 barrels per day of fuel and diluents for its extra heavy oil output since the US measures were imposed, according to PDVSA and Refinitiv data, below levels prior to the sanctions but still enough to supply gas stations and power plants.
Reliance is among the biggest buyers of Venezuelan oil, although the company has recently said it has not increased crude purchases from Venezuela. In 2012, Reliance signed a 15-year deal to buy between 300,000 to 400,000 bpd of heavy crude from PDVSA.
Ship tracking data obtained by Reuters showed that Reliance's average purchases from Venezuela were less than 300,000 bpd in 2018 and in the first two months of this year.
Venezuela has suspended its oil exports to India, its main cash market, Azerbaijan's energy ministry said on Tuesday, citing Manuel Quevedo, Venezuela's oil minister and PDVSA president. Quevedo met with the Azeri minister of Industry and Energy Parviz Shahbazov in Baku.
But Venezuela's crude exports to India have not stopped. A very large crude carrier (VLCC) is anchored off Venezuela's Jose port waiting to load oil bound for India, and at least six other vessels of the same size are underway to India's Sikka and Vadinar ports, according to the Refinitiv data.
PDVSA's second largest customer in India is Nayara Energy, partially owned by Russian energy firm Rosneft , one of PDVSA's primary allies.

411,2019-03-22,Reliance,"The Saudi government’s reliance on a firm from Israel offers a glimpse of a new age of digital warfare governed by few rulesThe US laws governing this new age of digital warfare are murky, outdated, and ill-equipped to address rapid technological advances

The man in charge of Saudi Arabia’s ruthless campaign to stifle dissent went searching for ways to spy on people he saw as threats to the kingdom. He knew where to go: a secretive Israeli company offering technology developed by former intelligence operatives.
It was late 2017 and Saud al-Qahtani — then a top adviser to Saudi Arabia’s powerful crown prince — was tracking Saudi dissidents around the world, part of his extensive surveillance efforts that ultimately led to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In messages exchanged with employees from the company, NSO Group, al-Qahtani spoke of grand plans to use its surveillance tools throughout the Middle East and Europe, like Turkey and Qatar or France and Britain.
The Saudi government’s reliance on a firm from Israel, an adversary for decades, offers a glimpse of a new age of digital warfare governed by few rules and of a growing economy, now valued at $12 billion, of spies for hire.
Today even the smallest countries can buy digital espionage services, enabling them to conduct sophisticated operations like electronic eavesdropping or influence campaigns that were once the preserve of major powers like the United States and Russia. Corporations that want to scrutinize competitors’ secrets, or a wealthy individual with a beef against a rival, can also command intelligence operations for a price, akin to purchasing off-the-shelf elements of the National Security Agency or the Mossad.
NSO and a competitor, Emirati firm DarkMatter, exemplify the proliferation of privatized spying. A monthslong examination by The New York Times, based on interviews with current and former hackers for governments and private companies and others as well as a review of documents, uncovered secret skirmishes in this world of digital combat.
The firms have enabled governments not only to hack criminal elements like terrorist groups and drug cartels but also in some cases to act on darker impulses, targeting activists and journalists. Hackers trained by US spy agencies caught American businesspeople and human rights workers in their net. Cybermercenaries working for DarkMatter turned a baby monitor into a spy device.
The FBI is investigating current and former American employees of DarkMatter for possible cybercrimes, according to four people familiar with the investigation. The inquiry intensified after a former NSA hacker working for the company grew concerned about its activities and contacted the FBI, Reuters reported.
The rapid expansion of this global high-tech battleground has prompted warnings of a dangerous and chaotic future.
“Even the smallest country, on a very low budget, can have an offensive capability,"" or initiate online attacks against adversaries, said Robert Johnston, founder of cybersecurity firm Adlumin and a key investigator on Russia’s 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee.
A security gap, exploited
Before NSO helped the Saudi government track its adversaries outside the kingdom, and helped the Mexican government hunt drug kingpins, and earned hundreds of millions of dollars working for dozens of countries on six continents, the company consisted of two high school friends in northern Israel.
Using technology developed by graduates of Intelligence Unit 8200 — Israel’s equivalent of the NSA — Shalev Hulio and Omri Lavie started a company in 2008 that allowed cellphone firms to gain remote access to their customers’ devices to perform maintenance.
Word spread to Western spy services, whose operatives spotted an opportunity. At the time, US and European officials were warning that Apple, Facebook, Google and other tech giants were developing technologies that allowed criminals and terrorists to communicate through encrypted channels indecipherable to intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
Hulio and Lavie offered a way to circumvent this problem by hacking the endpoints of the communications — the phones themselves — after the data were decrypted.
By 2011, NSO had developed its first prototype, a mobile surveillance tool the company called Pegasus. NSO’s tool could do something seemingly impossible: collect vast amounts of previously inaccessible data from smartphones in the air without leaving a trace — including phone calls, texts, emails, contacts, location and any data transmitted over apps like Facebook, WhatsApp and Skype.
“Once these companies invade your phone, they own it. You’re just carrying it around,"" Avi Rosen of Kaymera Technologies, an Israeli cyberdefense company, said of NSO and its competitors.
The company soon had its first client for Pegasus: the government of Mexico, which was engaged in a crackdown on drug cartels. By 2013, NSO had installed Pegasus at three Mexican agencies, according to emails obtained by The Times. The emails estimated that, altogether, the firm had sold the Mexican government $15 million worth of hardware and software. Mexico was paying the firm some $77 million to track a wide array of targets’ every move and swipe of their phone.
Spying on citizens
NSO’s first client, the Mexican government, was also using the hacking tools for darker purposes — as part of a broader government and industry surveillance effort. The government used NSO products to track at least two dozen journalists, government critics, international investigators looking into the unsolved disappearance of 43 students, even backers of a soda tax, according to Times investigations and research by Citizen Lab, part of the University of Toronto.
Those targets were subjected to a stream of harassing text messages that contained malware. Some messages warned that their spouses were having affairs, others that a relative had passed away.
Though NSO says it sells its services for criminal and anti-terrorism investigations, none of the Mexicans known to have been targeted were suspected in criminal or terrorism investigations.
“NSO technology has helped stop vicious crimes and deadly terrorist attacks around the world,"" the company said in a statement. “We do not tolerate misuse of our products and we regularly vet and review our contracts to ensure they are not being used for anything other than the prevention or investigation of terrorism and crime.""
The company has established an ethics committee, which decides whether it can sell its spyware to countries based on their human rights records as reported by global organizations like the World Bank’s human capital index, and other indicators. NSO would not sell to Turkey, for example, because of its poor record on human rights, current and former employees said.
But on the World Bank index, Turkey ranks higher than Mexico and Saudi Arabia, both NSO clients. A spokesman for Israel’s Ministry of Defense, which needs to authorize any contract that NSO wins from a foreign government, declined to answer questions about the company.
Spying on americans
The proliferation of companies trying to replicate NSO’s success and compete in what Moody’s estimates is a $12 billion market for lawful intercept spyware has set off a fierce competition to hire American, Israeli and Russian veterans of the world’s most sophisticated intelligence agencies — and for the companies to poach talent from one another.
DarkMatter has origins in another company, an American firm called CyberPoint that years ago won contracts from the UAE to help protect the Emirates from computer attacks. CyberPoint obtained a license from the US government to work for the Emiratis, a necessary step intended to regulate the export of military and intelligence services. Many of the company’s employees had worked on highly classified projects for the NSA and other US intelligence agencies.
But the Emiratis had outsize ambitions and repeatedly pushed CyberPoint employees to exceed the boundaries of the company’s American license. CyberPoint rebuffed requests by Emirati intelligence operatives to try to crack encryption codes and to hack websites housed on American servers — operations that would have run afoul of US law.
So in 2015 the Emiratis founded DarkMatter — forming a company not bound by US law — and lured at least a half-dozen American employees of CyberPoint to join. Marc Baier, a former official with the NSA unit that carries out advanced offensive cyberoperations, became one of the firm’s top executives. DarkMatter employed several other former NSA and CIA officers, according to a roster of employees obtained by The Times, some making salaries of hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
DarkMatter is effectively an arm of the state that has worked directly with Emirati intelligence operatives on numerous missions such as hacking government ministries in Turkey, Qatar and Iran and spying on dissidents inside the Emirates. Besides its breaches of foreign government ministries, DarkMatter also broke into Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail accounts, according to former employees.
The company did not respond to a request to comment, nor did a spokesman for the Emirati government. Asked whether the ministry had given a license for the former Israeli intelligence operatives working for DarkMatter, a spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defense declined to comment. A lawyer for Baier also declined to comment.
Current and former employees of the spy agency have a lifelong obligation to protect the United States’ secrets, said Greg Julian, a spokesman for the NSA.
The Justice Department’s case, run by prosecutors in Washington, focuses on internet fraud and the possibly illegal transfer of spying technology to a foreign country. But the prosecutors face headwinds, including diplomatic concerns about jeopardizing the United States’ relationship with the UAE and worries about how pursuing the case could expose embarrassing details about the extent of the cooperation between DarkMatter and US intelligence agencies.
And there is the reality that US laws governing this new age of digital warfare are murky, outdated, and ill-equipped to address rapid technological advances.
“You’ve got a lot of people entering the arena that are new and don’t play by the same rules,"" said Brian Bartholomew, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, a digital security company. “It’s like putting a military-grade weapon in the hands of someone off the street.""

Before Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd came on the scene, only one-sixth of all active wireless subscribers had broadband connections on their mobile devices. In January 2019, or less than 30 months since Reliance Jio’s launch, over half of all active telecom subscribers were broadband users, shows data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. Reliance Jio, of course, offered only broadband connections, forcing competitors to follow suit.
Lower tariffs have also resulted in growing adoption of smartphones. In absolute terms, the number of wireless broadband users has risen from 154 million in August 2016 to 521.8 million in January 2019.
In January itself, the industry added 21 million broadband subscribers, the highest in more than a year. Bharti Airtel Ltd led the growth, adding 10 million subscribers. Additions at Reliance Jio slowed from a high of 13 million in September 2018 to 9.3 million in January 2019, points out a report by Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. Even so, Reliance Jio continues to hold the lion’s share (55.5%) of the wireless broadband market.
According to Ravi Menon, analyst at Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd, two factors are driving the broadband subscriber base. One is the bundled plans. The second is the network effect where growing usage of internet applications (such as apps) pulls in more users.
This works well for the telecom industry, as bundled packages are generally priced higher than plain vanilla voice plans. But encouraging high data usage also entails high capex, which is why all telcos have been burning a lot of cash. Unless tariffs rise from current levels, the situation is unlikely to improve."

Asset management companies (AMCs) would wish their fortunes were not linked to the ebbs and flows of the market. In the past few months, inflows into mutual funds have ebbed, rather than flowed. As such, AMC stocks are meandering, undershooting the broader markets.
In the last four months, net inflows into equity funds have been shrinking. From more than  ₹12,600 crore in October 2018, net equity inflows have dipped to around  ₹5,100 crore. Inflows to equity funds depend largely on the performances of schemes and market sentiment.
Mutual fund performance in the past year has been all over the place. A few large-cap funds have clocked some gains, but most mid- and small-cap funds have seen negative returns. All but a handful failed to outstrip the bellwether indices. This raises concerns about inflows into equity funds, say analysts.
“Lump-sum investors like to take opportunistic shots at the market. Such opportunities have not been seen. Most investors who make bullet investments are redeeming at the moment. SIPs are structural investments by nature. There have been some cancellations here, but unless the market goes into a tail-spin it will not impact SIP inflows. That should keep the boat steady, but not enough to move the AUM throttle higher in a huge way,"" said an analyst on condition of anonymity. SIP is systematic investment plan and AUM is assets under management.
Second, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and index funds, which are low-cost index trackers, have been gaining traction in the overall AUM sweepstakes. These funds made up about 14.46% of equity funds under management in February. Five years ago, that figure was 0.95%. If the trend gains momentum, the quantum of fees that fund houses make through managing active funds could shrink.
Lastly, a larger concern is the cut in the total expense ratio by the regulator, which kicks in from 1 April. Some bigger fund houses could see up to a 25% reduction in their asset management fees. Fund houses have the option of cutting distributor fees on their already built AUM books. However, much hinges on how much of the burden asset managers can actually pass on.
Nevertheless, there may be a bigger impact on new fund inflows. Equity funds are pushed products. Hence, higher distributor commissions actually drive equity fund penetration. With lower commissions, distributors may not be inclined to drive more equity fund sales.
To top it all, the challenging markets also leave fund flows susceptible to volatility. Analysts reckon that during the election season, investors may remain on the fence rather than invest in the market. As a result, they are worried that AMCs may not be able to hold on to their Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margins.
Both HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd and Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd have seen their price-earnings multiples correct marginally to 30.1 times and 21.26 times, respectively. However, analysts reckon these valuations could come further under the scanner, unless margins sustain on stable equity flows and fund management fees."

Mukesh Ambani owned Reliance Jio is testing a 'Triple Play Plan' for its upcoming Fiber To The Home (FTTH) service, Jio GigaFiber. 
With the Triple Play Plan, users can access Jio GigaFiber, Jio Home TV and Jio Apps in a single pack. Yes, Jio is rebranding its GigaTV service to Jio Home TV. 
According to a TelecomTalk report, the plan was seen on the GigaFiber account dashboard of Jio employees. The plan offers 100GB data, unlimited voice calling along with access to Jio Home TV and subscription to Jio Apps. 
Reliance Jio has already started offering GigaFiber connections in areas of select cities that have shown the most interest in the service, but is yet to announce official plans and its final rollout schedule. The company has also not started the official rollout of Jio Home TV.
Reliance, at its Annual General Meeting (AGM) last year, announced that the Jio GigaTV will come with a new set-top box that will have the ability to use the internet to offer services such as live TV channels. Another service, namely Jio TV Call will allow the Jio GigaTV owners to connect with many people via video conferencing on the TV. Users would be able to make calls to anyone who owns the Jio GigaTV, as well as a mobile or a tablet connected to any network."

MIAMI :
Acting US Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan warned any nations that might be considering anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons tests like the one India carried out on Wednesday to ""not make a mess"" in space, noting the debris that can be left behind.
""My message would be: we all live in space, let’s not make it a mess. Space should be a place where we can conduct business. Space is a place where people should have the freedom to operate,"" Shanahan told a small group of reporters on Wednesday, without saying whether he believed India's test left debris.
He said the United States was still studying the Indian test.
""You cannot make (space) unstable. We cannot create the debris problem that ASAT tests create. So, thoughtfulness goes a long way.""
India's foreign ministry played down any risk of debris, noting the test was in low-earth orbit, and said the remnants would ""decay and fall back on to the earth within weeks.""
India would only be the fourth country to have used such an anti-satellite weapon after the United States, Russia and China, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.
The United States ran the first anti-satellite test in 1959, when satellites themselves were rare and new.
Shanahan noted that, given the increasing global reliance on space, it was importance to create rules of the road for space.
""I think not having rules of engagement is worrisome. So, how people test and develop technologies is important,"" he said, adding: ""I would expect anyone who tests does not put at risk anyone else's assets."""

New Delhi: Dhanbad, which hosts India’s biggest coal mining companies and formed the backdrop of Bollywood film Gangs Of Wasseypur, has a new feather in its cap: it’s the city with the best 4G network availability in India.
Dhanbad, in Jharkhand, is the “hottest city"" for 4G availability, according to a report released on Thursday by Opensignal, a London-based company specializing in wireless coverage mapping. 
The city scored 95.3% in Opensignal’s measurements, followed by neighbouring Ranchi, which scored 95%. Out of 50 cities covered, no other city crossed the 95% mark.
Srinagar, with a 4G availability score of 94.9%, grabbed the third spot, while Raipur in Chhattisgarh came fourth with a score of 94.8%. Patna was fifth with 94.5%.
Top metros scored low, with Delhi and Mumbai at the 39th and 40th spots, respectively, with scores below 90%, the report said. The two metros also trailed Ahmedabad (92.7%), Bengaluru (92.3%) and Hyderabad (90.5%).
To be sure, Opensignal’s 4G availability metric does not look at coverage or geographic spread of a network, but measures the proportion of time someone with a 4G device and subscription can get a network connection in the places they most commonly visit. If an operator has a 4G availability score of 90%, it means users on that network were connected to 4G 90% of the time.
The report is based on data collected for November, December and January.
Although Bharti Airtel Ltd was the first operator to launch 4G services in Kolkata, 4G network in India went through the roof after the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in September 2016, which made it the only operator in India with a 4G-only network.
While Reliance Jio is targeting 99% population coverage by March-end, Airtel has over 90% 4G coverage with an aggressive plan to grab the user’s primary 4G SIM slot.
Vodafone Idea has 62% geographical 4G coverage in the country at present with plans to reach 80% in 2019-20, the company had told investors in November last year. This is expected to help close the 4G coverage gap with rivals which have so far outpaced Vodafone Idea on this metric."

MUMBAI :
Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) may ask Oberoi Group to manage hotels and serviced apartments that RIL plans to build in Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), said two officials, requesting anonymity.
RIL through its real estate venture, Maker Maxity, owns land in BKC. The first phase of the project included five grade-A office buildings, which were constructed and sold in FY10. In the second phase, a retail mall, membership clubs, a rooftop drive-in theatre and a multiplex mall are under construction. The third phase will involve development of two luxury hotels over 1.2 million sq ft comprising three basement levels, ground floor and 16 stories. The properties will be leased. “For the upcoming hotel, there were earlier talks with several international firms ...but now they are going ahead with Oberoi Group,"" the first person said. RIL, through its subsidiary Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd, holds 18.53% in East India Hotels Ltd, which runs the luxury Oberoi hotels.
Initially operated as a drive-in theatre, the project was owned by Maker Group. It diluted it’s ownership to 35% post investments by Reliance promoters and PE funds.
In FY05, Reliance promoters and PE fund Xander Group had picked up 25.1% and 20% , respectively, in the project. Two years later, Urban Infra bought a 19.9% stake.
In FY17, Reliance Promoters increased their stake to 45% by buying over the 19.9% stake held by Urban Infra. In 2018, RIL bought 45% held by Reliance promoters and 20% by Xander Group for  ₹1,100 crore.
RIL did not respond to an email query sent on Thursday. Oberoi Group in an emailed response said, “We do not comment on market rumours or speculations.""
The Maker Maxity project is spread over 20 acres, of which 12 acres are being developed in phase two and three. According to officials,  ₹1,500 crore has already been spent as of FY17. “It is possible that the investment may go up to over  ₹2,000 crore with phase two and three under development,"" the second official cited above said on condition of anonymity.
He added that the project would be funded primarily by RIL with some debt exposure. It was designed as an ultra-luxury hotel project. The luxury hotel was supposed to comprise 400 hotel rooms and a 90 room serviced apartment. It will take three-four years at least to complete the project, said the first person mentioned above.
“For Reliance, it’s more of a real estate play than getting into hospitality. Maker group is a huge real estate firm. RIL is an investor in EIH and my understanding is that they have been a passive player in the hospitality space. They don’t guide EIH on what is to be done,"" said the first person cited above.
An analyst tracking RIL said that given the prominence of BKC as an upcoming retail and entertainment hub, the project will have commercial and operational synergies with its 7-8 million sq ft convention centre that is also being built at BKC."

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd, whose digital content includes music streaming app Wynk Music and video streaming app Airtel TV, will soon launch Airtel Books, featuring a collection of e-books for smartphone users.
The launch is aimed at upgrading Airtel’s subscribers to higher tariff plans and retaining them on its network in this hyper-competitive wireless services market where it battles rivals Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd.
The digital content strategy of telcos has become crucial as cheap data tariffs have ceased to provide a meaningful competitive edge in the telecom industry. Airtel has 284.2 million paying subscribers on its network as of December-end. Wynk has 120 million users, while Airtel TV has 80 million users.
“In the past, we made good progress on the entertainment side and we were studying many categories apart from music and video. We realized e-books is a niche and strong category, especially as Airtel has high-quality customers on its network. Also, it’s an uncluttered space,"" said Sameer Batra, chief executive officer (CEO), content and apps, Bharti Airtel.
Rival Reliance Jio's apps include JioMags, a library of magazines, and JioNewsPaper, but not a curated offering for books.
Available to both Airtel and non-Airtel customers in iOS and Android, Airtel Books will initially offer more than 70,000 titles from leading Indian and international authors across genres, including crime, romance, business, history and politics, fitness, diet, spirituality, and classics.
In December 2017, Bharti Airtel had announced the acquisition of a strategic equity stake in digital publishing platform Juggernaut Books through its wholly owned subsidiary Nettle Infrastructure Investments Ltd. Juggernaut Books was co-founded by Durga Raghunath and Chiki Sarkar two years ago. It also has Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and former CEO of Infosys, on board as an investor.
Airtel will rely on the curation expertise of Juggernaut to grow this application.
All Airtel Books users will get a complimentary 30-day trial. The Readers Club subscription for six months is priced at  ₹129 and  ₹199 for 12 months. 
Users can also pay for any single book title.
“As e-books is a niche category, we believe the propensity to pay will be higher compared to other kinds of content. We also plan to offer special benefits for Airtel subscribers and are exploring how to bundle the e-books offering with our rewards programme Airtel Thanks. If you are a high-paying Airtel subscriber, we may give some complimentary benefits also,"" Batra said.
Airtel Books has many English titles and few offerings in Hindi, but plans to diversify into other regional Indian languages as well, a strategy it has adapted for Wynk Music.
“We want to do regional content in books also and our team is also working on this. We also want to build a writers platform wherein people can write their own stories. We also want to experiment with audio books,"" Batra said.
Driving data usage through content is key for Airtel. The data usage per customer for Airtel almost doubled to 10,528 megabytes in the December quarter from a year earlier.
Airtel recorded an average revenue per user (Arpu) at  ₹104 in the December quarter, which was a slight increase from  ₹100 in the September quarter."

NEW DELHI :
New Delhi: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has issued a fresh direction to telecom companies—including Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone Idea Ltd and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd—asking them to submit by 18 April details of discounted tariffs offered to their customers in the last financial year. The regulator has directed them to mention the name and validity of offers and the number of subscribers who signed up for them.
It has sought these details on a monthly basis for each telecom circle from April-March 2019. Thereafter, for each month from April 2019, Trai has asked operators to submit these details within 10 working days from the last day of the month. Disclosing segmented or discounted offers has become a bone of contention in the telecom sector.
In February 2018, Trai had directed telcos to disclose segmented offers and set the penalty for violations at  ₹5,000 for every day of delay, with a maximum penalty of  ₹2 lakh. The firms had then argued that information on segmented offers were a trade secret and its disclosure would help rivals.
The telecom firms then moved the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), which issued an order on 13 December stating that operators no longer needed to disclose segmented offers or discounted tariffs to the regulator.
The order said that instead of telcos reporting all segmented offers/discounts, Trai may call for details of any segmented offer about which it receives complaints. Moreover, the regulator cannot impose any penalty and should reconsider the provisions related to predatory pricing and segmented offers within six months, TDSAT had ruled.
In Wednesday’s directive, Trai also asked operators to submit a declaration that the benefits of such segmented offers have been made available to all the existing customers falling in the segment and the principle of non-discrimination has been strictly followed.
“Our members are studying the direction issued by Trai and they will subsequently discuss and directly engage with Trai on the feasibility of the same,"" said Rajan Mathews, Director General of Cellular Operators Association of India.

390,2019-04-04,Reliance,"Report shows 96% of Indians get promotional messages daily; banks are biggest spammers

Rahul Kumar, a software engineer in Noida, is flooded with marketing calls and messages from unknown numbers every day. Despite using an app that can identify such messages and calls and block them, a new unwanted call or text message pops up on his phone’s screen frequently.
Kumar isn’t alone in his exasperation with mobile marketing spam. According to a December 2018 report by Truecaller, India was second on the list of countries worst affected by spam calls last year. Another survey by online community platform LocalCircles shows 96% of Indians get promotional text messages every day and half of them reported getting 4-7 such messages on a daily basis. In case of spam calls, the Truecaller report claims that 91% of them are made by operators themselves, while in case of messages, banks are allegedly the biggest spammers.
Apps like Truecaller and Trai’s Do Not Disturb, or DND 2.0, allow users to report spam calls and messages and then use the crowd-sourced data to warn users about the flagged numbers. However, these tools are not fully effective.
One reason: Savvy marketers in the US, for instance, use voice over internet protocol (VoIP) technology to make these unwanted calls instead of using a traditional telephone line. This allows them to imitate a different phone number every time and bypass spam identification networks, explained Paul Dunlop, product manager, Google Phone app, in a Google blog post.
In countries like India where these services are not allowed by operators, marketers use multiple connections and frequently switch SIM cards. Free SMS and unlimited calling offered by some operators allow such networks to thrive at a low cost. “Existing rules require telemarketers to register their numbers and check the DND registry before making unsolicited calls. However, many unregistered telemarketers work outside the system. Even if customer’s report them, they quickly change their number which makes regulating them difficult,"" rues Rajan S. Mathews, director general, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI).
Persistent failure to curb spam calls can be attributed to the lax attitude of operators and the passive attitude of users to some extent. Mathews says only 30% subscribers have registered on the DND registry so far.
Operators, too, have not taken major steps to check spam calls, and left it to the consumer to protect themselves, which was rarely done due to lack of awareness or time. As a result, the frequency of mobile spam has increased rather than decreased, says Tarun Pathak, associate director, mobile devices and ecosystems, Counterpoint Research. While Reliance Jio clamped down on the misuse of unlimited calls and messages by putting a cap of 300 minutes on voice calls per day, the fact remains 91% spam calls are made by telcos themselves.
Faisal Kawoosa, founder and chief analyst, techARC points out that brands behind telemarketing campaigns also need to take an ethical stand. For instance, most marketing calls in the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector are made by sales agents who call users multiple times even if they have said no to the same service earlier.
Instead of multiple agents calling users, if the banks consolidate their services, and reach out to users with a single number, these agents will use the number conscientiously, suggests Kawoosa.
Mathews of COAI believes a new order issued by Trai in July of 2018 against unwanted calls and messages—which will be implemented by the industry in the next few months—will be an effective weapon against this nuisance. But part of it also depends on customers registering with this new directory that will be set up by telecom operators.
The platform will use Blockchain (a distributed ledger technology that is best known for powering cryptocurrencies) to regulate telemarketers. It will ensure only registered ones can access users’ phone numbers , and their consent to receive such communication will be explicitly required. Till, then, it appears that consumers will have to bear the annoyance of being bombarded with spam messages and calls.
How to avoid spam texts and calls 
■ Apps such as Truecaller and DND 2.0 use crowdsourced data to warn users of spam calls and messages
■ Users can register their number with the DND directory by sending an SMS saying START 0 to 1909
■ To partially block spam calls, users need to send an SMS to 1909 saying START with the number between 1 and 7 specified for each industry"
392,2019-04-05,Reliance,"Walmart, which has put mom-and-pop stores out of business in the US, is a supplier to kirana stores in IndiaBarred from opening retail stores, Walmart started its wholesale business in India in 2009 and bought Flipkart last year

Mumbai: Walmart Inc. is making friends in India with the kind of competitors that it spent decades putting out of business in the US—mom and pop stores.
These unlikely allies are part of the latest attempt by the Bentonville, Arkansas-based behemoth to crack India’s giant consumer market, taking on e-commerce rival Amazon.com Inc. and Asia’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani.
Years of lobbying by global retailers failed to persuade the Indian government to open its market to foreign competition, because of fears that it may put out of business many of the 12 million neighbourhood stores that account for almost 90% of the country’s retail sales. Walmart’s attempt to build an e-commerce business was also hampered by new regulations.
So the US company is now rolling out a plan to more than double its wholesale chain in India over the next four years—supplying the local storeholders instead of competing with them. The move intensifies the three-way brawl with Amazon and Ambani. Each has a different strategy, but they all need to woo the owners of the ubiquitous neighbourhood shops.
“Our single biggest agenda is: ‘How can they become more loyal to us?’’ Krish Iyer, chief executive officer of Walmart’s India unit said in an interview in the company’s newest outlet in the southern city of Karimnagar. “The expansion phase will continue because the opportunity in India is huge.""
Barred from opening retail stores, Walmart started the wholesale business in India in 2009, but continued to try to find a way to sell direct to the public. Its most recent attempt—the $16 billion purchase of homegrown e-commerce leader Flipkart last year—was dealt a blow when the government came out with new rules designed to protect the 12 million small shopkeepers from online competition too.
Walmart’s biggest competition comes from Ambani, who isn’t subject to the restrictions on foreign companies and already controls India’s largest bricks-and-mortar retail chain, as well as a network of wholesale stores that is twice the size of Walmart’s. Now, Asia’s richest man plans to use his 290 million-subscriber mobile phone network to create an e-commerce giant. India’s small shopkeepers are key to that too.
Meanwhile, Amazon is working to recruit shopkeepers in small towns and villages, arming them with smartphones to place orders for local residents and relying on them to deliver goods in communities that often have no street names or house numbers.
Amazon and Reliance Retail did not reply to requests for comment.
“More and more aggressively they are trying to on-board kiranas,"" said Rajat Wahi, a partner at Deloitte’s consumer services practice in New Delhi. “All the volumes go through that channel, albeit in very small lots. So the objective of these players is: how do I get more active selling to these mom-and-pop stores.""
Walmart’s Iyer wouldn’t say how much the firm is investing to win these shopkeepers over, but he said 26 more of its Best Price wholesale stores were planned by 2023, with each location costing between $8-10 million.
Walmart’s strategy allows shopkeepers to see and touch items before purchasing—unlike Amazon—and doesn’t compete with its customers by selling direct to consumers—which Ambani does. “Our members when they come here, they will not find their customers shopping in the store,"" Iyer said, without naming any competitor. “I’ll sell only to small resellers.""He said no integration with Flipkart is planned—the e-commerce firm has its own board and CEO, while Walmart India is a wholly owned subsidiary of the US parent."

Billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Sunil Bharti Mittal are considering competing bids for a stake in a troubled Indian television network, people with knowledge of the matter said, as their telecom carriers race for content in the world’s second-biggest mobile market.
Mittal’s Bharti Airtel Ltd. has started due diligence of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. and is expected to make a formal proposal soon, one of the people said, asking not to be identified citing confidentiality. Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. is also considering a bid, the people said. Deliberations are preliminary and may not lead to a transaction, they said.
A representative for Zee said the company doesn’t comment on speculation though it is in “steady dialogue"" with potential partners. Reliance Jio Infocomm and Bharti did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment.
A successful deal would help the winning bidder add a slew of video services in the scramble for user revenue as the government prepares to auction 5G airwaves this year. Some of the world’s largest telecommunications companies including AT&T Inc., Vodafone Group Plc and KDDI Corp. have been buying film and television production and cable TV assets to bolster earnings as subscribers level off.
Bidding for such assets has accelerated as entertainment providers themselves gather content to offer programming via the Internet and compete with upstarts like Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime service.
Zee, the heavily-indebted broadcaster controlled by former rice trader-turned-media mogul Subhash Chandra, is seeking a strategic investor to help fend off competition from Netflix, Amazon and hundreds of local TV channels vying to tap India’s booming demand for content.
Zee, which boasts 1.3 billion viewers across 173 countries through its 78 channels and 4,800 movie titles, has previously attracted interest from Sony Corp. and Comcast Corp. but hasn’t found a buyer yet. The television network has offered to sell half of the controlling family’s shares, of which 59 percent is pledged as collateral to lenders.
Jio stormed the market in 2016 with free calls and cheap data and forced some rivals to retreat or merge. Bharti, once No. 1, has been relegated to second position after Vodafone’s local unit combined with billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Idea Cellular.
War Chest
While Bharti has been adding some digital services to its portfolio, such as apps for e-books and music, its scale hasn’t matched Jio, which already offers a bouquet of services including Saavn, a music app, television, news and movies.
In February, Bharti revealed plans to raise as much as 320 billion rupees ($4.6 billion) from a rights issue and bond sales to build a war chest as competition with Jio intensifies. Last year, Bharti entered into a content deal with Zee for exclusive videos on Airtel applications.
In a January interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos to Bloomberg Quint, Mittal said Airtel will have to provide subscribers content from the likes of Zee, Netflix and Amazon to get them to use more data and boost revenue.

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on Monday said it would decide on the insolvency of debt-ridden Reliance Communications (RCom). The Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group firm has pleaded the tribunal to go ahead with insolvency proceedings against it as it is unable to pay dues to its lenders.
Swedish telecom gear maker Ericsson AB, which received its unpaid dues of  ₹550 crore from RCom last month following a Supreme Court order, is opposing the move. 
A two-member bench headed by Chairman Justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya also observed that if insolvency proceedings against RCom are allowed, then Ericsson would have to return the payout.
""Why one party will take amount and let the financial creditors suffer,"" said the NCLAT, adding that either it may quash RCom bankruptcy proceedings in National or allow bankruptcy case to proceed.
The appellate tribunal also said that it would consider the reply filed by the Department of Telecom (DoT) over the RCom’s plea against the show cause notice issued by it over spectrum charges due on 30 April, the next date of hearing.
""DOT reply would be considered on 30 April. Let us be very clear which are the assets of corporate debtor, whether they have some right of asset. Can you take away licence? If yes, what is the value of the company (RCom) then,"" the NCLAT said.
The NCLAT's direction came during the hearing of applications moved by three RCom executives. 
On 4 February, NCLT had said that until further orders of the NCLAT or the Supreme Court, no one can sell, alienate, or create third-party rights over RCom assets.
The NCLAT had on 26 March put a stay on the two notices issued by the DoT to RCom over cancellation of its spectrum licence for a delay in payment. Its two-member bench had also stayed the DoT's letter dated March 20, 2019, to Axis Bank to encash the bank guarantee of  ₹2,000 crore given by the Anil Ambani group firm.
On 15 May 2018, the Mumbai bench of NCLT had admitted an insolvency petition filed by Ericsson against Reliance Communications and two of its subsidiaries seeking to recover unpaid dues.
However, on May 30, NCLAT granted a conditional stay on insolvency proceedings against RCom and its subsidiaries—Reliance Infratel and Reliance Telecom.
The tribunal had directed RCom and its subsidiaries to pay  ₹550 crore to Ericsson India in 120 days, failing which it will direct insolvency proceedings against the company.
On 1 February, RCom had informed that it has decided to opt for insolvency proceedings following its failure to sell assets for paying back its lenders.
Last month, Anil Ambani warded off a possible jail term as RCom cleared dues of Ericsson on March 18 with money received from elder brother Mukesh Ambani.
Anil Ambani made a  ₹550 crore payment, including interest, to Ericsson just a day before the expiry of the deadline set by the Supreme Court to clear dues or face a three-month jail term.

386,2019-04-09,Reliance,"Reliance Retail was the single largest driver of Reliance Industries's valuations in the past yearRevenues from Reliance Jio recharges, device sales and fuel retail contribute about 54% to RIL's retail's revenue

Reliance Retail Ltd’s phenomenal growth is well- known and has done more than its bit to impress parent Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL’s) investors. We wrote here how the retail business was the single largest driver of RIL’s valuations in the past year. In fact, just last week, on 1 April, the RIL stock touched a 52-week high on the National Stock Exchange, in keeping with the buoyant mood in the broader markets.
But, of course, given that the detailed profit and loss account of the retail business is unavailable, many details are still coming to light. For instance, the company’s earnings presentation does not reveal the contribution from JioPhone sales, included in retail revenues. However, Kotak Institutional Equities estimates revenues from Reliance Jio recharges, JioPhone (and other Jio-related devices) sales and petroleum retailing have brought about 54% to overall retail revenue in the trailing four quarters.
“We note that device sales may form around one-third of revenue from the consumer electronics segment over the past four quarters and, thereby, explain a portion of strong growth delivered by the company,"" said Kotak in a report on 29 March. The chart above has the details. The consumer electronics segment constitutes about 30% of the retail business revenue.
However, it’s difficult to accurately carve out the Ebitda margin of just JioPhone device sales. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Of course, from a valuation perspective, Ebitda would be far more relevant.
The retail business revenue growth is being driven by the low-margin telecom segment. Overall margins have improved, thanks to the sheer scale of the expansion. According to RIL’s December quarter earnings presentation, the overall retail Ebitda margin was 4.7%. This has risen from 3.2% in the same period last year. This includes Jio recharges and fuel retailing.
In its core retail business, Ebitda margin for the December quarter stood at 7.2% compared to 6.1% a year ago. Core retail includes grocery, consumer electronics, and fashion and lifestyle.
Once again, when the March quarter results are announced, investor focus will be on RIL’s consumer businesses: Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio. After all, refining margins are nothing to write home about. Meaningful refining capacity additions are expected this year and demand growth outlook for refined products isn’t that bright. 
“Reliance Retail will see a bumper quarter this time around, much better than other retailers,"" said an analyst requesting anonymity.
“We are witnessing even higher aggression from Reliance Retail as seen from the increased advertising on television for its retail formats (Reliance Digital and Ajio.com) and very strong store expansion,"" Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd’s analysts noted in a report on 1 April.
Investors have no reason to complain. Returns in FY19 have topped 50%. Based on Bloomberg data, the RIL stock trades at 20 times estimated earnings for FY20, suggesting a larger proportion of the brighter picture has been factored into the price."
385,2019-04-09,Reliance,"Reduction in TER (total expense ratio) and banning upfront commissions are good measures for the investorSundeep Sikka says our focus has been on building the SIP book and today RNAM have 30 lakh SIPs that contribute over  ₹10,000 crore on an annualized basis

Sundeep Sikka, executive director and CEO, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management (RNAM), believes what is good for the investor is good for the industry. It is in this spirit that he steers RNAM’s retail-focused growth. With presence in 100 locations where no other AMC is present and 3 million SIPs that contribute over  ₹10,000 crore on an annualized basis, the company is proud of the contribution it has made to increase the reach of mutual funds
What is the status of the sale of Reliance Capital Ltd’s stake in Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management to Nippon Life Insurance Co.?
Reliance Capital has communicated to the stock exchanges that it has offered JV (joint venture) partner Nippon Life the option to buy out its stake. Discussions are ongoing and there’s nothing new to add at this point of time.
Nippon Life is a valuable partner in two JVs with Reliance Capital—in asset management and in insurance. It came into the AMC with 26% in 2012 and has increased its stake in stages.
I wouldn’t like to comment on reports about other foreign investors being approached for the stake sale. As a listed company, a number of big global investors are already invested in RNAM. Since our listing, various international investors have shown interest and their interest goes beyond this specific transaction.
Did the recent rationalization of costs hurt RNAM more, given its retail focus and dependence on the retail distribution channel?
Our primary focus has always been on IFAs (independent financial advisers). But it is also important to recognise support from partner banks. Reduction in TER (total expense ratio) and banning upfront commissions are both good measures for the investor and what is good for the investor is good for all the stakeholders, including distributors and asset management companies (AMCs). The reduction in TER is a reality and the way to compensate is to increase volumes and improve operational efficiency.
We are happy to see the retail portion grow and are proud of the contribution we have made to increasing the reach of mutual funds. Today we are present in 100 locations where no other asset management company is present.
This is a business in which you have to invest for the long term, especially when you are building up a retail book—this is not easy. Our focus has been on building the SIP book and today we have 30 lakh SIPs that contribute over  ₹10,000 crore on an annualized basis.
Technology is one big area we are investing in: over 31% of our transactions are through the digital platform. This improves operational efficiency and brings down costs.
How do you approach the complicated task of taking debt products to retail investors given that debt investing is nuanced?
Nothing is easy when you are acting in a fiduciary capacity. The infrastructure we have created to help fund managers make the right decisions is because we recognise our responsibility in our fiduciary capacity to 8.8 million investors. We have not been involved in any accidents that have happened in the industry. Our trustees believe that we need to have a conservative approach for debt as investors may not realise there is a downside risk—just like in equities—as they view debt MFs more like fixed deposits.
If you are taking debt to retail investors, it is important to have research capability. In our 18-member debt team, 11 are analysts. We have a separate head of research. A large research desk is neither a regulatory requirement or an industry norm. We do it as part of our internal risk management process. We believe that in our fiduciary capacity, we have to take all the protection.
Moreover, unlike equity markets, debt markets are not liquid which makes selection important. We have developed our own rating capabilities too. We track the downgrades to upgrades in our portfolio and for every one downgrade, there are 2.64 upgrades in the last financial year; 92% of our portfolio is AA- and above. It is a very conservative approach. This is about managing risk and not about higher returns. The core for any AMC is the risk management framework.
How do you align product offerings with investor interest? Is India a developing market for passive investments?
We are a balanced fund house. We believe any portfolio needs debt, equity, money market and commodities. We believe in having the investor at the centre of all our strategies. We have seen our equity assets increase from 34% of overall assets to 38% in the last 12 months. But we do not want investors to create a portfolio of only equity assets. Like a balanced meal, there should be a little of everything—equity, fixed income, gold and commodities. We offer everything that the investor may need and let them choose. We also have a US fund, Japan fund and a Hang Seng fund to give investors options for geographical diversification. You offer a scheme if there is a need for it in the investor’s portfolio and you can add value, and it is scalable and not cyclical.
As for passive investments, markets will keep maturing. There are the educated, savvy investors who look at ETFs (exchange-traded funds), especially in large-caps where alpha generation may reduce and higher expenses may eat away the returns. When we acquired Benchmark and Goldman Sachs, it was a  ₹7,433 crore portfolio. Today, we are in excess of  ₹29,000 crore. Today 90% of the traded ETF volumes on the stock exchanges are our ETFs. This is critical because there are two things that matter most to ETF investors—tracking error and impact cost. And impact cost reduces when there is greater liquidity. As much as 56% of the total ETF investors in India are RNAM investors.
Do you see a crisis of confidence in the mutual fund industry as far as investors are concerned with all the recent negative news such as the emergence of poor quality bonds in the portfolios of debt funds and slowing inflows?
I don’t see these events permanently keeping investors away. On the contrary, I see a great future for the industry. Whether it is the assets under management (AUM) of the industry as a percentage of GDP (gross domestic product) or as a percentage of bank deposit, they show there’s significant headroom for growth. The industry has added more than a million SIPs (systematic investment plans) in the last year—this is encouraging as market returns have not been the best, given the volatility.
RNAM’s focus is retail and we see no slowdown in flows. We continue investing in the growth of the industry. The reality is that MF investing has become a household phenomenon, even in small towns.
Are trends like mobile apps and direct investing bringing in “hot money"" into the industry? How do you see the future of MF investing through the direct option?
Investors who use these apps are self-directed and there is no reason to believe that they are any less sticky than others. One has to recognise that, on the one hand, in India you have Bharat and a generation of investors who still like to come to the branches and visit distributors. And then there is the new generation of investors who are comfortable with mobile technology. We have to cater to both these segments.
At any given point of time, investor behaviour will always depend on market conditions and that is why it becomes critical to have access to advice. Direct investing can be good for 1% of the investors who know what they want. But our interactions with retail investors say that most do not know what they need and the advisors and distributors help them direct their savings in the manner that is most beneficial to them to achieve their goals.
If there was one reform that you would like to see implemented soon, what would it be?
Easy on-boarding of investors is important for the industry to grow. Today there is a separate KYC for capital markets which is one more step that can actually be eliminated. If a person has a bank account, it means that the identity and address has already been verified with an entity governed by the Reserve Bank of India, then that KYC (know your client) should be universal. Just like the Aadhaar card and PAN (permanent account number) card are standard documents for all transactions, so should KYC process be too.
Things go wrong in the industry in the race for acquisition of AUM. Another change I would like to see is the disclosure of number of folios and not just AUM numbers. It is a better measure of the investor participation in mutual funds."
384,2019-04-09,Reliance,"Hotstar, Voot, ZEE5, Arre, SonyLIV, ALT Balaji, Reliance Jio, Netflix and Eros Now, have adopted a self-regulatory Code of Best PracticesWhile streaming platforms have the right to acquire the uncensored version of a film, most players prefer the CBFC version

New Delhi: A couple of weeks ago, YouTube put an age restriction on filmmaker Anand Patwardhan’s acclaimed documentary 'Raam Ke Naam', opening the film with a disclaimer saying it may be ‘inappropriate for some users’. The 27-year-old film that explores the campaign waged by the Vishva Hindu Parishad to build a Ram temple at the site of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, and the communal violence it triggered, had been passed by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) with a ‘U’ (acceptable for universal audiences) certificate during release, aired on Doordarshan and won the National Film Award for Best Investigative Documentary.
YouTube did not respond to Mint’s queries on its censorship policies but 'Raam Ke Naam' is not the only instance of a film losing out on some sections of an online audience, a space traditionally considered free and conducive to creative expression. Adult comedy 'Hunterrr', currently available on Netflix and Amazon Prime, has several sequences cut on the latter, besides being taken off services such as Hotstar and Viu after backlash on social media for its explicit content. Movies like 'The Dirty Picture' have also been censored massively on Amazon.
To be sure, nine video-streaming platforms, including Hotstar, Voot, ZEE5, Arre, SonyLIV, ALT Balaji, Reliance Jio, Netflix and Eros Now, have adopted a self-regulatory Code of Best Practices under the aegis of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), prohibiting the showcasing of certain kinds of content online, classifying it into age-appropriate categories and providing a mechanism for grievance redressal. However, there is no specific mandate on films already certified for theatrical exhibition.
“At present, The Cinematograph Act doesn’t cover over the top (OTT) platforms, the censor certificate is only issued for (films meant for) theatrical exhibition. In the absence of any regulation or act, any platform will be framing and executing its own policies and guidelines. So the whole question of why an OTT platform alters content does not arise from a legal perspective,"" according to Girish Dwibhashyam, head, content, consumer engagement and business development at Indian video -treaming service Spuul.
Today even a platform such as Facebook employs 30,000 people to monitor user-generated content, Dwibhashyam added. Some other services use artificial intelligence and machine learning. So different methods are being used to streamline content, censorship only being one of them.
“And as of now, they have the right to do that,"" Dwibhashyam added.
Also responsible is the open and free nature of the web itself.
“Though the digital world is supposed to be democratic, the pressures are the same as when one is bringing a film to theatres,"" said 'Hunterrr' director Harshvardhan Kulkarni, referring to the backlash for his film after which it was taken off Hotstar and Viu.
“The kind of policing and mob mentality you witness is bizarre. And unlike the CBFC, it’s not just one board. Everyone is a critic online,"" Kulkarni said. The pressure for writers and directors to compromise and abide by the radicals whom the Internet has given a platform to, wasn’t prevalent earlier.
To be sure, while all streaming platforms have the right to acquire the uncensored version of a film, most players currently prefer the CBFC version.
“Principally, it can be done (taking the uncut version) because there is no norm or rule saying it can’t. But it’s a call that the streaming platform takes and these (self-regulation and censorship) principles work well from the point of view of catering to the lowest common denominator (among the audience),"" according to Ali Hussein, chief operating officer, Eros Now. Hussein was referring to the common tactic employed by streaming platforms — to play as safe as you possibly can with content according to the nature of your brand and target audience to reach out to bigger numbers. Not too much happened as far as (the censoring or lack of it) theatrical content on digital platforms was concerned, but there should be developments soon, he added.
“For every fan, there is a cynic. That has always been the case, but there was no social media earlier (to make it evident). But I do not think that will change as long as there are quality narratives, in fact audiences will have more responsibility for stories that are told (by being able to criticise freely) ,"" Hussein said."
383,2019-04-09,Reliance,"At the 11th edition of HT Brand Studio Live—a series that deals with marketing innovations and more—it was discussed why content should be at the heart of every business

One of the quickest ways to engage with a consumer, says studies, is through content. So much so that content is now an inherent part of a brand’s marketing strategy.
However, what exactly constitutes good content, and how do businesses create content that customers care about?
The same was taken up for discussion at the 11th edition of HT Brand Studio Live in Mumbai on Tuesday.
HT Brand Studio Live is a series that gets the brains behind India’s top brands to decode marketing innovations and more. The event is co-hosted by HT Brand Studio and DMAasia.
Speaking on the occasion, Jyoti Kumar Bansal, CEO, PHD India, said, “As brands, we must ask ourselves whether we are telling enough engaging stories. Are we telling the stories in a way that makes a customer stop and see what they are all about? And, when they start engaging, are we ready to give them the information required to engage with our brands?""
“The story is what matters, and it is what brands ride on,"" said Manav Sethi, Group Chief Marketing Officer, Eros International PLC, while further highlighting why storytelling is vital to a brand’s success. According to him, content drives a brand and leaves a deep impression on the consumer.
The mantra for creating meaningful stories was outlined by Rajshree Bakshi, Senior Vice President-Marketing, Reliance Industries Limited. As stated by her, content that engages is backed by data.
Citing the example of the TV series House of Cards, Bakshi said it was created based on what consumers wanted, which was made possible through research.
“Today, there is a lot of content out there. As a brand, am I being able to serve something to you that is entirely of your interest?"" Bakshi highlighted in this regard.
The event also saw a conversation on the rising popularity of over-the-top (OTT) platforms.
“OTT has played on the consumer’s psyche; it has allowed them to watch what they want at their own convenience,"" said Divya Dixit, Senior Vice-President and Head of Marketing, ALTBalaji.
Dixit also spoke about how OTT platforms have especially struck a chord with small-town consumers.
“In small towns, OTT content is now a conversation starter among people. It is a break in their otherwise mundane lives,"" she said, while adding how OTT has led to the “massification"" of content.
Agnello Dias, Creative Chairman, Dentsu Aegis Network, and Co-founder, Taproot Dentsu, presented a picture of how content is created in the advertising industry.
“Creativity has different languages. An idea that is best expressed in words in advertising may not be best expressed in other art forms,"" said the leading professional.
Dias also pointed out that brands need to rethink how they approach marketing briefs.

382,2019-04-11,Reliance,"Income inequality in the West is near historic highs, wealth gaps are even worse and economic insecurity is widespread

Despite ever-improving conditions for millions of people around the world—documented by entities like the University of Oxford’s Our World in Data and highlighted by scholars like Steven Pinker—popular discontent is on the rise in many places. The reason is simple: whereas the first trend is being driven by low- and middle-income countries, the second is concentrated in high-income countries.
Throughout the developed world, conditions for many workers are deteriorating, with no recovery in sight. Income inequality is near historic highs, wealth inequality is even higher, and economic insecurity is widespread.
As the United Kingdom tears itself apart politically and constitutionally over Brexit, many of its citizens struggle with low-quality jobs, inadequate housing, and poverty so severe that they rely on food banks. France’s Yellow Vest protests have been hijacked by violent extremists, but they reflect real grievances about the growing challenge of maintaining living standards. In the United States, the Economic Report Of The President touts the supposed elimination of poverty, but life expectancy does not decline in a prosperous country.
In short, the post-World War II social contract in many of today’s developed economies is breaking down. And even more uncertainty and insecurity are on the way, as new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and robotics take root.
Though the pace and scope of the next wave of automation is impossible to predict with precision, the impact will be profound. Like other digital technologies, AI and robotics will boost the value of some skills while reducing the value of others. And, by reinforcing social biases, extensive algorithmic decision-making risks amplifying existing inequalities further.
It is impossible to uninvent technology. But we should not fall into the trap of technological determinism. The forces that drive structural economic change are always refracted through policy decisions, which can help ensure that technological innovations contribute to a more prosperous future.
Given the depth of the transformation ahead, however, it is not just the policies themselves that must change, but the very framework on which they are based. This means abandoning the idea—which has shaped public policy for more than a generation—that the “market"" must be the organizing principle for collective decision-making.
The market, in this sense, is an abstraction—one that has little to do with actual markets, which are social institutions as varied and multitudinous as Leo Tolstoy’s unhappy families. It embodies the assumption that, overall, we secure the best economic outcomes if producers compete to respond to the desires of individual consumers (in line with their purchasing power). And its performance is measured according to the number of contemporaneous exchanges taking place.
This is unlikely to be the best metric. For one thing, it does not account for the depreciation of assets, from houses in California destroyed by wildfires to insect species at risk of extinction. It also fails to account for the fact that a growing proportion of exchanges in the digital economy involve “public goods"", the consumption of which is non-rivalrous (the good can be shared by any number of people without being depleted).
But there is an even more fundamental problem with assessing an economy’s welfare according to the satisfaction of individual choices. As the late William Baumol pointed out, if you assume that economic agents are independent, you will conclude that independent choices maximize their well-being. This is circular reasoning.
In fact, economic agents are not as independent as conventional wisdom would have us believe. People’s consumption preferences are not discovered through introspection and then upheld permanently; they are shaped socially and change over time. In the age of social media “influencers,"" this may be truer than ever, with turbocharged network effects amplifying the impact of one individual’s choices on others.
Likewise, in production, there is far-reaching potential for economies of scope and scale—potential that grows even larger in high-tech domains. This means that one firm’s production decisions affect production by others in the same market.
The conceptual underpinnings of policymaking need to be updated to reflect this economic reality. For starters, governments need to recognize that their decisions shape the structure of production, and develop strategies to support particular strengths in production (through innovation policies or procurement frameworks) or to address weaknesses (in areas such as skills). Economists like Dani Rodrik and Justin Yifu Lin have led the way in proposing ways to think about modern industrial strategy.
Governments must also improve the opportunities available to those left behind in today’s fast-changing economy. This means ensuring that all citizens have access to quality public education, public transportation and broadband infrastructure, adequate health care, and decent housing. Such basic services are more important than income subsidies, because they are public goods, which the market—where decisions are made by aggregating individual demand—will not provide.
The organization of millions of interdependent individuals in a technologically complex society will always be difficult to manage. With productivity flatlining and public anger growing, it is clear that existing policies are not up to the challenge. Without a new approach, it is difficult to imagine a prosperous future for Western societies.

New Delhi: The department of telecommunications (DoT) has accorded conditional approval to the merger between Bharti Airtel Ltd and Tata Teleservices Ltd, subject to Airtel providing bank guarantees of up to  ₹8,500 crore.
Bharti Airtel, however, plans to move the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) seeking a stay on the DoT order. “DoT has raised the demand for bank guarantees to cover for one-time spectrum charges as part of the merger. While  ₹7,500 crore will cover dues relating to Tata Teleservices Ltd, the balance accrue from Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd,"" one person aware of the development said, requesting anonymity.
An email query to Bharti Airtel remained unanswered till press time.
One-time spectrum charges are payable by companies wanting to convert their administered spectrum—spectrum not bought in an auction—to liberalized or auctioned spectrum. Auctioned spectrum can be deployed flexibly for any purpose, unlike administered spectrum.
Airtel had earlier moved TDSAT challenging a similar DoT demand during its merger with Telenor. The tribunal had subsequently ordered the government to clear the deal without demanding a bank guarantee. DoT had then challenged the tribunal’s verdict in the Supreme Court, which in May 2018, had dismissed the petition.
Airtel had also moved the tribunal for a similar demand by DoT for dues relating to its merger with Tikona Digital.
In October 2017, the Tata Group had announced that it would sell its consumer mobile business to Bharti Airtel on a debt-free, cash-free basis, except for a fraction of the unpaid spectrum fees that the Tata Group owes to the DoT.
Airtel will absorb Tata’s mobile phone operations in 19 circles, 17 under Tata Teleservices and two under Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd.
The Airtel-Tata Tele merger will bolster Airtel’s spectrum footprint and 4G coverage, besides its ability to compete with rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. Airtel will get access to 178.5 megahertz (MHz) spectrum (of which 71.3MHz is liberalized or free to trade) in the 850MHz, 1,800MHz and 2,100MHz bands.
The transaction will also give Airtel the right to use part of the existing fibre network of Tata companies."
380,2019-04-13,Reliance,"Neither the period of the tax concession nor the subject matter of the concession relate even remotely to the Rafale procurementIndia’s plans to buy 36 Rafale aircraft off the shelf in 2015 has attracted controversy with the opposition accusing the government of favouring big businesses

NEW DELHI :
India’s defence ministry on Saturday dismissed as inaccurate a report in a French newspaper that said the French government had waived taxes for Indian industrialist Anil Ambani after India announced plans to buy 36 French built Rafale fighter aircraft off the shelf in 2015.
“We have seen reports drawing conjectural connection between tax exemption to a private company and procurement of Rafale fighter jets by Government of India,"" the statement said.
“Neither the period of the tax concession nor the subject matter of the concession relate even remotely to the Rafale procurement concluded during the tenure of the present Government,"" the ministry said,
“Any connections drawn between the tax issue and the Rafale matter is totally inaccurate, tendentious and is a mischievous attempt to disinform,"" it added. India’s plans to buy 36 Rafale aircraft off the shelf in 2015 has attracted controversy with the opposition accusing the government of favouring big businesses in the award of offset contracts that come as spinoffs in big defence deals.
The statement was in response to the report in the Le Monde newspaper on Saturday which said that Anil Ambani’s France-based company was given a tax waiver of 143.7 million euros, six months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the deal for purchasing 36 fighter jets in April 2015 — suggesting a quid pro quo in the matter.
Anil Ambani’s Reliance Defence is an offset partner in India’s Rafale jet deal with France announced by Modi.
Ambani’s France-based Reliance Flag Atlantic France is a subsidiary of Reliance Communications and deals with under-sea cabling.
The company was investigated by French tax authorities and found liable to pay 60 million euros in taxes for the period between 2007 and 2010. Reliance had made an offer to pay 7.6 million euros as a settlement. The French tax authorities, however, refused this offer and conducted another investigation between 2010 to 2012. And after this, the French authorities demanded the payment of an additional 91 million euros in taxes, the French newspaper reported.
A statement from Reliance communications on Saturday said the “Reliance Flag tax issue pertains to 2008, nearly 10 years old,"" -ie predating India’s Rafale deal with France— and “the tax demands were completely unsustainable and illegal.""
Denying any favoritism or gain from settlement, the statement said that “Reliance Flag settled tax disputes as per legal framework in France available to all companies operating in France.""
“During the period under consideration by the French Tax Authorities - 2008-2012i.e. nearly 10 years ago, Flag France had an operating loss of  ₹ 20 Crs (i.e. Euro 2.7 million). French tax authorities had raised a tax demand of over  ₹ 1100 crore for the same period. As per the French tax settlement process as per law, a mutual settlement agreement was signed to pay  ₹ 56 crore as a final settlement,"" the Reliance statement said."

Corporate earnings for the March quarter and elections are expected to be key drivers of equity markets in this truncated week. Indian markets are shut for trading on Wednesday and Friday. Most analysts expect volatility in the markets is likely to continue till general elections are over.
Jimeet Modi, Founder and CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote, said the current corrective phase in the markets has just begun and it may last till the middle of May, however, the undertone of the market will not be weak. ""The amount of price correction would be difficult to estimate but the markets will take their own time till May to correct. The markets are witnessing a whipsaw phase where neither the bulls nor the bears could make headway during the week. This is typically a corrective phase which the markets are undergoing after witnessing a strong rally. Statistically, similar such corrections in the past have taken around a month’s time.""
As India is set to see a new government post elections, analysts and investors will be keenly watching out for commentary and guidance by companies, which are expected to be indicative of economic and business growth. The surge in crude oil prices in the January-March period is expected to further delay a recovery in corporate earnings.
While private banks, cement and utilities, which have been a drag on earnings, are likely to post good numbers, the performance of former champions such as metals, auto, retail, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) is likely to moderate in Q4FY19, Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a 5 April note.
Major companies that will declare Q4 earnings this week are Reliance Industries, Wipro, HDFC Bank, RBL Bank, Mindtree and ICICI Lombard General Insurance.
This week investors are likely to react to TCS and Infosys stocks as the IT majors announced their March quarter earnings after market hours on Friday. Infosys reported a mixed bag in Q4FY19, with margins below expectations even as revenue was in-line. For the full year FY19, Infosys has posted 9% revenue growth in constant currency terms versus a guidance of 8.5- 9% and EBIT margin of 22.8% versus guidance of 22-24%. It has provided 7.5-9.5% growth guidance and has lowered its margin guidance by 100 basis points (bps) to 21-23% for FY20 – both lower than the street’s expectations. Analysts believe that lower-than-expected growth and margin guidance may lead to a cut in street’s earnings estimates.
“We believe Infosys is being conservative in terms of its revenue guidance for FY19, given that YoY constant currency growth was 11.7% in Q4FY19, with robust order wins also reflecting underlying revenue strength,"" Reliance Securities Ltd said.
TCS ended FY19 with full-year constant currency (CC) revenue growth of 11.4% YoY, EBIT margin of 25.6% and net income growth of 22.5% YoY.

New Delhi: India’s largest wireless operator Vodafone Idea Ltd has asked the telecom regulator to abandon its plan to scrap the interconnection usage charges (IUC) from 1 January and instead raise it to 20 paise a minute from 6 paise now, a top company official said.
Vodafone Idea, which has 387 million active users, believes that abolishing IUC will hurt the earnings of the operator. The company is already struggling in a hyper-competitive telecom market and had posted a loss of  ₹5,004 crore in the December quarter, while its rivals Bharti Airtel Ltd and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd posted profits of  ₹86 crore and  ₹831 crore, respectively.
“It will impact our books for sure,"" Vodafone Idea chief executive officer Balesh Sharma said in an interview. “It (scrapping IUC charges) should not happen... I would actually want it back to 20 paise a minute which we are fighting for. If not, it can’t go to zero,"" Sharma said.
IUC charge is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks and is a major source of revenue for Airtel and Vodafone Idea. In September 2017, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) ordered a reduction in IUC to 6 paise per minute from 14 paise effective 1 October 2017, and an end to IUC from 1 January 2020, to bring down telecom tariffs. Telecom operators, other than Reliance Jio, were hit hard by the order. It worsened the financial health of the industry that was already reeling from a bruising price war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio, backed by India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, in September 2016.
As a result, Bharti Airtel’s quarterly profit plunged 39% to  ₹306 crore in three months ended 31 December 2017, while Idea Cellular’s quarterly loss more than tripled to  ₹1,285.6 crore in the same quarter.
Reliance Jio, on the other hand, benefited from the IUC cut as more calls originate from its network than terminate, and reported a profit of  ₹504 crore in December 2017 quarter, a first for the company, from a loss of  ₹271 crore in the preceding quarter. 
IUC has been a contentious issue in the telecom sector. In fact, at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February, Nick Read, chief executive of Vodafone Group Plc, said that for the last two years, many regulatory outcomes in India worked against every operator in the market except Reliance Jio. 
Zero IUC means operators would make no money for receiving calls on their networks.
“Bringing down the IUC from 14 paise to 6 paise... I see that as a modelling issue. But 6 paise to zero is a principle issue. Somebody has to pay me for the termination of the call on my network. The logic used for getting to zero was that by that time, industry traffic would balance out. It has not balanced out,"" Sharma said.
If the traffic flow among operators is symmetrical or evens out, it will not have a negative impact on any operator as it is simply a charge paid from one operator to another.
Vodafone Idea has already started providing evidence to the regulator on the traffic flows in the telecom sector. It believes that because traffic with respect to Reliance Jio is still asymmetric (more calls from Jio’s network end on theirs than the other way around), a shift to zero IUC does not make sense.
Vodafone India and Idea Cellular completed their merger in August 2018 and are currently undergoing an integration exercise to create synergies which would bring down costs of operating networks. The company is also in the midst of a capital raising exercise through a rights issue of  ₹25,000 crore to existing eligible equity shareholders. It is also simultaneously working on monetising its fibre assets and stake in the joint entity of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers which is close to completing their merger."

In February this year, Hughes Communications India (HCIL) became the the first company to be granted the in-flight and maritime connectivity licence in the country. The following month, Tatanet Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nelco, announced that it had obtained in-flight, maritime connectivity licence from the government.
Most recently, the DoT issued a 10-year licence to Bharti Airtel subsidiary Indo Teleports Ltd to provide such services.
According to Euroconsult, over 23,000 commercial aircraft will offer connectivity to their passengers by 2027, up from 7,400 aircraft in 2017.
Northern Sky Research's Aeronautical SatCom Market's 2017 report predicts that by the end of 2019, broadband VSAT (very small aperture terminal) connectivity will be installed on one out of every three commercial passenger aircraft, and will rise to two out of every three by the end of 2026.
Fuelled by rising demand for broadband connectivity, this installed base is estimated to generate over USD 32 billion in revenue over the next decade, as air travel continues its rise around the world.
The connectivity needs in maritime industry are also growing leaps and bounds, as increasing number of vessels look to stay connected to provide their crew and passengers high-speed internet access, monitoring weather patterns to cut fuel costs, filing regulatory documents, ordering supplies from sea to save time in port, and generating business intelligence.

New Delhi: After two years of battering from all fronts, the fortunes of the telecom sector may show some signs of revival this fiscal year, with revenue seen increasing by 7 percent on better pricing power and operating margin expanding by 350 bps to 31 percent, says a report.
The turnaround will ride on an increase in average revenue per user (Arpu) by 11 percent, Crisil said in report Tuesday, adding the revenue growth will come despite a 4 percent reduction in the overall subscriber base.
""Pricing aggression is expected to remain moderate and selective in fiscal 2020, given the new entrant (Reliance Jio) has revenue market share leadership in over 50 percent of the 22 circles,"" said Hetal Gandhi, a director at Crisil Research, adding this may lead to an operating margin expansion by 3.50 percent to 31 percent in FY20, it said.
The agency said despite consolidation, a ""protracted tariff war"" has pushed Arpu to a decadal low and as a result of the same, the industry revenues have fallen by 20 percent in the past two years or by a whopping  ₹40,000 crore cumulatively.
It can be noted that the September 2016 entry of the deep-pocketed Jio has been blamed for a lot of ails of the telecom sector, which resulted in massive profit erosions, forced consolidation and also bankruptcies.
The agency said the tariffs have ""bottomed out"" in the industry now, pointing out to the stable pricing.
The top three telcos have almost equal revenue market share as of now, it said, adding any price-led aggression now can impact all adversely.
Prices of prepaid plans of leading telcos have over the past six quarters converged at  ₹4 per GB and have stabilised over the past two quarters, Gandhi said.
Profitability is expected to look up, with operating margins expected to rise 3.50 percent to 31 percent in FY20, the report said.
Combined operating profit of Vodafone Idea, Airtel and Jio will increase 20 percent to  ₹56,200 crore from  ₹46,100 crore in the year-ago period.
Explaining the dip in subscriber base that it foresees, it said while low tele-density will lead to increase in users, there is a dip in the urban areas as two-SIM discontinue the second connection.
Network capex for the top three telcos is expected to moderate to  ₹84,000-90,000 crore in FY20, down from  ₹1 lakh crore in FY19.
Improvement in bottomline and decline in capex, together with sizeable deleveraging plans will support a reduction in debt to  ₹3.1 lakh crore, by March 2020, the report said.
""Debt protection metrics are expected to improve, with the interest coverage and debt-to-Ebitda ratios touching 2.5x and 5.6x by March 2020, compared to an estimated 2x and 7.7x, respectively, as of March 2019,"" another director at the agency Nitesh Jain said.
However, standalone debt metrics will remain weak and overall credit profile will continue to be supported by deleveraging plans and sponsors' support, he added."

New Delhi: Vodafone Idea Ltd, which is in the midst of a  ₹25,000 crore fundraising, has said the Indian telecom market with three private players is an ""ideal scenario"" in terms of healthy competition, dismissing any possibility of cartelisation or duopoly.
""It is three private players plus one (BSNL and MTNL) and that is the ideal scenario to be. There are four players here...it is an ideal level of competition,"" Vodafone Idea chief executive Balesh Sharma told the Press Trust of India.
Worldwide, markets with three private players are known to be markets where constantly there is an ongoing war but a healthy level of competition exists, he added.
Sharma said a market with three strong players almost equal to each other ""is an ideal place to be"" as ""they all want to become bigger and are fighting with each other"".
""There is absolutely no concern for duopoly also...because I believe in a democracy all policy makers, politicians, and everyone understands that for consumers' rights there needs to be at least three strong private players and hoping that the government player also continues to be in that...,"" Sharma said.
Such a scenario will keep the competition level at an ""optimal"", he noted.
India's telecom industry has witnessed a spate of consolidation aimed at finding economies of scale after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd stormed the market in 2016, ploughing billions of dollars into a pan-India 4G data service, offering free voice calls and data tariffs well below prevailing rates.
This triggered a massive consolidation in the telecom industry. Bharti Airtel Ltd, then number one operator, started the spate of telecom mergers by acquiring the India business of Norway-based Telenor. It has since then bought over the consumer mobile business of Tata Teleservices Ltd and broadband internet firm Tikona.
Last year, Idea Cellular and Vodafone Plc announced completion of the $23.2 billion merger of their India operations to create the country's largest telecom operator—Vodafone Idea—to take on competition from Reliance Jio."

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd' wholly owned subsidiary Reliance Ethane Holding Pte. Ltd is selling its fleet of six very large ethane carriers (VLECs) through an investment deal with Japanese shipping group Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd, RIL said today.
RIL has 100% holding in six limited liability companies (LLCs) which own the VLECs.
""Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd. (MOL) of Japan and a strategic minority investor have signed binding definitive agreements for strategic investment by MOL and minority investor in the six special purposes limited liability companies, each owning a VLEC,"" RIL said in a press statement.
Mitsui OSK, which has a fleet of over 850 vessels, and a minority investor signed an agreement to buy stakes in six special purpose companies of RIL, which own a VLEC each, said RIL in a statement.
RIL did not disclose the value of the deal. Transaction closing is subject to regulatory approvals.
P.M.S. Prasad, Executive Director, RIL, said, “Given MOL is currently the operator of all the six VLECs, investment by MOL will deepen our relationship with them and ensure continued safe and efficient operation of the VLECs. We welcome MOL as a strategic partner into the SPVs as they move beyond the current operator role to the joint owner and operator role in the SPVs"".
MOL said it has detailed knowledge about these assets having, supervised the construction and delivery of the six VLECs and subsequently operating them since their delivery.
Takeshi Hashimoto, Member of the Board, Executive Vice President, MOL, said, “This investment would enable MOL to add six unique VLECs, which we have been operating for some time now, as owners to its existing fleet of over 850 vessels, which include LNG carrier, other tankers, dry bulkers, car carriers, ferries, and coastal RoRo ships and cruise ships."

NEW DELHI :
No other operator in the world has scored better at a country level than Reliance Jio in India in terms of 4G availability, according to a new report from London-based mobile analytics company Opensignal.
Jio's score grew by close to one percentage point to reach 97.5%, up from 96.7% about six months ago, said the ""Mobile Network Experience"" report.
""Jio's winning 4G availability score of 97.5% is the highest we have ever recorded at a country level in any of our reports,"" it said. ""Jio's achievement of reaching 97.5% 4G availability in such a short time is truly astonishing,"" the report added.
In the US two operators have scored over 90%, while in Taiwan four are over this mark, but none in either market have yet crossed 95%, Opensignal said.
Even in the Netherlands, arguably Europe's most advanced mobile market, only one has crossed the 95% mark, and in Japan two operators have passed this benchmark, it added.
The study, however, revealed that Bharti Airtel showed the greatest growth in 4G availability as its score jumped by over 10 percentage points to cross 85%.
It also widened the gap on its rivals in ""download speed experience"", increasing the winning score by more than a megabit in the last six months. All the five of India's main national operators showed fair improvement in their ""download speed experience"" scores.
Airtel also gained in Opensignal's ""video experience"" analysis and its score jumped by over five points to pull ahead of the pack. ""The mobile 'video experience' in India is moving in the right direction, but still leaves an awful lot to be desired,"" report said.
In the 4G upload speed category, Idea had a slightly comfortable lead with a score of 3.8 Mbps, ahead of Vodafone's 3.2 Mbps and Airtel's 2.6 Mbps. Jio was some way behind its 4G rivals, with a score of 1.9 Mbps, said the report."

362,2019-04-18,Reliance,"The current question is what Reliance sees in Aramco. The short answer: crude oil supplies at preferential rates from an equity partner

Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries is reportedly in talks to sell a 25% stake in its refinery and petrochem business to Saudi Aramco for an estimated $10-15 billion. Details of the deal aren’t known yet, but it could be a gateway to India for the Saudi state-owned company that boasts of the world’s biggest crude oil reserves; its partnership with Indian state-run refiners and retailers for a refinery in Ratnagiri, Maharashtra, has not made headway. Fresh from a $10-billion bond issue, the Saudi company has announced a forward integration plan, and is on the lookout for investment opportunities. The current question, however, is what Reliance sees in Aramco. The short answer: crude oil supplies at preferential rates from an equity partner.
That would be a win-win if prices suit both sides. Perhaps Reliance is keen on this because the global price of its chief input, crude oil, seems to be on an uptrend again. Oil hit a five-month high of over $72 per barrel this week, defying expectations that a rise in US shale oil production would cap the price. Crude supplies have been squeezed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which has been acting in league with Russia to limit output and exert monopoly control—the very influence that America’s shale-oil revolution was expected to curtail. Meanwhile, political turbulence in north Africa and US sanctions on Venezuela and Iran have piled up pressure. It’s not that US shale output hasn’t increased, it’s just that the rise hasn’t been enough to stall oil’s climb, and this suggests that OPEC may yet to able to regain its former pricing power.
After the 2014 crash in the price of oil, many market analysts had written OPEC obituaries, arguing that it would be unable to push prices higher than a range of $50-60, the point at which US shale supplies are estimated to turn profitable. This assumption is being revised now. That Reliance is ready to strike a deal with Saudi Aramco is a sign that doomsday calls on OPEC may have been premature. From the look of it, the oil cartel is back in the game. Private strategists and public planners should take note."

Mumbai: Reliance Retail, a subsidiary of India’s largest conglomerate, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), is in talks to acquire a controlling stake in iconic UK-based toymaker Hamleys, said two people aware of the matter, requesting anonymity.
Moneycontrol.com, which first reported the development on Wednesday, said that “due diligence for the deal is at an advanced stage"" and “Reliance Retail is aggressively pursuing the deal"".
Hamleys is currently owned by Chinese fashion conglomerate C Banner International, which had acquired it for £100 million in 2015. C Banner also owns the Chinese units of marquee consumer retail brands such as Steve Madden and Sundance.
It has been looking to cut its losses and sell off Hamleys after logging heavy losses, Sky News had reported last October.
If the deal goes through, it would cap the story of the 295-year old toymaker, which has struggled to generate profits in recent times.
Hamleys started with a single-store shop, Noah’s Ark, in 1760, around the time when the British East India Company was thriving in India.
“By the time Queen Victoria ascended the throne in 1837, Hamleys was already a London landmark... So successful was the shop that in 1881 a new branch opened in Regent Street (a popular London street),"" shows the Hamleys’ website.
In 2003, Hamleys was delisted from the London stock market by Icelandic investment firm Baugur Group, which had paid $68.8 million for the company. In 2012, it was sold for $78.4 million to France’s Groupe Ludendo.
Hamleys reported losses of £12 million in 2017, when it last reported its financials.
Profits fell off the cliff by 500%, as its chief executive, Ralph Cunningham, blamed Brexit, macroeconomic factors and terrorist attacks for the company’s poor performance. However, he had also said that he expects Hamleys to return to net profitability in the following year.
Reliance Retail already has a pan-India franchise agreement with Hamleys to merchandise its famous toys. Hamleys has around 129 stores globally, a large majority of which are under the franchise model. Besides the UK, the company is present in China, Germany, Russia, India, South Africa and the Middle East, among other regions, the Moneycontrol report said.
Reliance Retail plans to increase the toymaker’s geographic footprint in India if the deal goes through.
A Reliance spokesperson said the company does not comment on “speculation and rumours"".
“Our company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis. We have made and will continue to make necessary disclosures in compliance with our obligations under Securities Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 and our agreements with the stock exchanges,"" the spokesperson said.
Reliance Retail has entered into tie-ups with many other marque international brands such as Diesel, Marks and Spencers, Steve Madden and Kenneth Cole. It reported turnover of  ₹69,198 crore for 2017-18. As on 31 December 2018, Reliance Retail operated 9,907 stores across over 6,400 cities with a retail area of over 21 million sq.ft.

I want to invest  ₹5,000 each month in SBI Life Retire Smart Fund for 16 years. It has already been two years since I made the first investment. Please advise whether I should move to another fund or change my investment in order to accumulate  ₹4 crore in the next 16 years
—Name withheld on request
There are two issues with your question—one, the product that you are talking about (and investing in) is not a mutual fund product, but a unit-linked insurance product (Ulip). Also, it appears that this is a product that guarantees a certain amount of return to the investor, which implies that it is a very conservative investment vehicle.
Two, even if you were investing in a mutual fund, investing  ₹5,000 a month for 16 years means you would be investing Rs9.6 lakh total. It is very improbable that this amount will turn to Rs4 crore in this period (it would mean an annualized return of more than 30% sustained for 16 years, which has never happened). Moreover, it is impossible for it to happen with this investment-cum- insurance product.
So, my advice to you would be to switch to mutual fund systematic investment plans (SIPs) for your long-term investing needs, and increase your monthly investment considerably to get to your target.
I am a 27-year-old bachelor and I want to accumulate Rs2 crore by the time I turn 50. I plan to use this money to travel the world. To this end, I am investing  ₹65,000 in mutual funds through direct plans since 2015. Of this amount,  ₹5,000 in Reliance Small Cap Fund, and  ₹15,000 each in in Kotak Emerging Equity Scheme, Parag Parikh Long Term Equity Fund and Aditya Birla Sunlife Frontline Equity Fund. For debt, I save about  ₹9,000 per month in my Provident Fund account and  ₹2,000 each month in Public Provident Fund (PPF). Could you please evaluate my portfolio and suggest changes in my mutual fund investments, if necessary?
—Sanjay Kumar
It is not quite clear from your question whether your investments in mutual funds are ongoing SIPs or if they were one-time investments made four years ago. If they are SIPs, then you are very well-positioned to reach your goal of accumulating  ₹2 crore long before you reach 50 years of age. You might even achieve it by the time you turn 40 years old.
However, if they were one-time investments made a few years ago, they would not be enough, just by themselves, for you to reach your goal, since this money would grow to only about  ₹15 lakh in the given time frame of 23 more years.
If this is the case, then you should start an SIP for about  ₹20,000 a month (or as much as you can invest) in a diversified, aggressive portfolio. From among the schemes you have selected for this purpose, you can continue investing in Parag Parikh and Aditya Birla Sunlife funds. You can consider replacing the Kotak Emerging Equity Fund with Kotak Standard Multicap Fund. For the allocation to small-cap, consider adding HDFC Small Cap Fund into the mix and splitting the allocation with the Reliance Small Cap Fund, which you already have.

367,2019-04-18,Reliance,"Saudi Aramco is said to be in serious discussions to buy as much as 25% in the refining and petrochemical business of RelianceA stake sale in the core business, at a desirable valuation, will free up resources for Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail

Mumbai: Saudi Aramco is in serious discussions to buy as much as 25% in the refining and petrochemicals businesses of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), The Times of India reported on Wednesday. That the two companies are considering a deal isn’t entirely surprising. Earlier this year, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Al Nasser said: “We are looking at additional investments in India. We are in discussions with other companies as well, including Reliance Industries.""
But what’s surprising is the reported Aramco-Reliance deal valuation. The TOI report suggests RIL will carve out its refining and petrochemicals divisions into a separate entity, which will be valued at $55-60 billion. This values the downstream businesses at about seven times estimated Ebitda for the year ended 31 March. This will be attractive from Aramco’s perspective, but far from lucrative as far as RIL is concerned. 
Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Note that a number of broking houses have valued the downstream businesses at much higher levels already. The median across the Street is upwards of $70 billion. It’s not like Reliance is a distress seller either. While its indebtedness has increased considerably in recent years after its aggressive foray into the telecom sector with Reliance Jio, leverage ratios haven’t gone out of whack. Net debt to Ebitda is around 3.7 times based on the current year’s debt and earnings estimates.
“RIL’s oil businesses generate high cash flows, which will take care of its debt. There is no pressing need to sell a stake in its refining and petrochemical assets,"" said an analyst at a domestic broking house. The only motivation to sell is if the deal includes a condition to procure crude from Aramco at discounted rates, the analyst added.
But this might not be the bait that attracts RIL either. After all, it is better placed than many other refiners, both in terms of its ability to process heavy/low quality crude and long-established trading relationships that help it procure crude at competitive rates.
According to the head of research at a multinational brokerage, the only reason RIL is likely to part with a stake to Saudi Aramco would be if it gets what it deems is a “full valuation"" for the asset. The Saudi state-owned oil company has been aggressively increasing its footprint in downstream businesses, buying stakes and entering into joint ventures with large companies in countries such as South Korea, Malaysia and China. Its eagerness to diversify beyond the upstream oil production business may well result in handsome valuations for RIL.
As far as Reliance in concerned, it has already demonstrated that it isn’t averse to selling stakes in its businesses. Incidentally, the company reported on Wednesday that it had sold a stake in a unit that owns six very large ethane carriers to Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd. Earlier, it announced the sale of its shale units and there is talk of an initial public offering (IPO) of Reliance Retail.
A large stake sale in the downstream business would stand apart from these above-mentioned deals. But if Aramco agrees to higher valuations, with the view to pursue its downstream expansion plans, a stake sale in the core business may well be a smart move for RIL.

Mumbai: Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has sought a higher valuation for its refining and petrochemicals business as it considers selling a minority stake to Saudi Arabia’s state energy group, Saudi Aramco, said two officials directly aware of the development, requesting anonymity.
On Wednesday, The Times of India reported that Saudi Aramco is in talks with RIL to buy up to a 25% stake in its refining and petrochemicals business. A minority stake sale could fetch $10-15 billion, valuing the business at $60 billion, the report added. The petrochemical and refining business contributes 75% to RIL’s operating profit.
“Saudi Aramco wants to buy 25% stake, but RIL is ready to offer less than that. There are differences over the valuation,"" said the first official mentioned above.
While Saudi Aramco declined to comment on the development, RIL said: “As a policy, we do not comment on media speculation and rumours. Our company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis.""
Aramco, the world’s largest crude producer, has been keen on entering India since 2016. Last June, Saudi Aramco and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. had signed an MoU to jointly develop and build a $44 billion integrated refinery and petrochemicals complex at Ratnagiri in Maharashtra.
The Ratnagiri project has seen unprecedented delays after farmers refused to give up their land for the project. Subsequently, in February, the state government decided to shift the project from coastal Ratnagiri to neighbouring Raigad district. The project was aimed at giving India steady fuel supplies, while providing Saudi Arabia with a regular buyer for its oil. An oil marketing company official said Saudi Aramco’s deal with RIL will not impact the Ratnagiri Refinery and Petrochemicals project.
In 2016, Saudi Aramco was also looking to pick up a 25% stake in ONGC Petro-additions Ltd (OPaL), which is promoted by Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and co-promoted by Gail India and Gujarat State Petroleum Corp. (GSPC) and other international petrochemical companies. “The concern around petrochemical comes from the current high paraxylene prices, where high capacity additions are expected in China in end-CY19. Lower paraxylene prices may impact margins for other polyester products, too. The concerns on refining are: High refining capacity additions over 2019 and 2020, with capacity addition of nearly 3 million barrels of oil per day over two years,"" said Credit Suisse in a report dated 10 April."

MUMBAI: :
Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), India's largest private enterprise, may report a muted fourth-quarter earnings today due to soft refining margins which may be offset by earnings from the retail and telecom arm.
According to a Bloomberg poll of 14 analysts, RIL’s consolidated net profit is estimated to be  ₹9,796 crore. However, 12 analysts estimated RIL's revenue at  ₹1.48 trillion. For the March 2018 quarter, RIL had reported a net profit of  ₹9,435 crore on total revenue of  ₹1.17 trillion at the consolidated level.
""After sixteen straight quarters of q-q standalone profit growth, we expect a relatively muted 4Q. We expect standalone profit after tax to decline 3% quarter-on-quarter driven by further weakness in refining and also a marginal decline in petchem,"" said Nomura Research in its report dated 9 April.

Also watch: What to expect from Reliance Q4 earnings?
Analysts expect RIL's gross refining margin--what a company makes form turning every barrel of crude to fuel-- to be in between $7- $8 per barrel, down from $8.8 per barrel during the last quarter and $11 per barrel in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal. During the quarter, Brent crude averaged 6% quarter-on-quarter lower at a six-quarter low of $63 a barrel in fourth-quarter. Asian refining margins though rose in March, but averaged at a nine-year low of $3.2 per barrel.
""We believe 4Q was among the toughest refining environments for RIL given the sharply lower gasoline cracks, a decline in diesel cracks, and overall the large cuts in heavy crude production which impacted complex refineries negatively. We forecast GRMs at $7.9/bbl for RIL with a premium over the benchmark likely at $4.7/bbl,"" said JP Morgan in a report dated 7 April.
After eight consecutive quarters of earnings before interest and tax (ebit) growth driven by margin expansion, petchem ebit is expected to decline 2% quarter-on-quarter due to lower margins.
""Petchem is expected to be flattish to slightly weak as lower naphtha prices though strength in paraxylene spreads would be offset by weakness in PTA (purified terephthalic acid) and MEG (mono-ethylene glycol),"" said BNP Paribas in an 8 April report.
Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) climbed as much as 2.24% in the early trade on Thursday, buoyed by reports of the company planning to sell up to 25% stake in its refining and petchem operations to Saudi Arabia's oil company Saudi Aramco.
At 10:45 am, the stock was trading nearly 2.36% higher at  ₹1,377.10 a piece. During the last one year, RIL stock has zoomed 43% whereas the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has gained 14%.
RIL’s telecom business Jio is expected to report increased profitability quarter-on-quarter, riding on Jio phone sales and subscriber addition. Jio is expected to report around 10% quarter-on-quarter revenue growth with a slight dip in average revenue per user (ARPU) by 1-2% to  ₹128.
In retail, RIL is expected to see a growth in sales and ebit while margins may remain flat. ""We expect retail sales to grow 20% and ebit to grow 16% with margins remaining flat at 4.1,"" said UBS Securities India in a report dated 3 April.
In terms of guidance from the management, the street is expecting updates on the petcoke gasification project against the backdrop of a sharp fall in LNG prices, reduction in debt on deconsolidation of tower and fibre assets and measures to deleverage the balance sheet."

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) reported a 9.79% increase in its quarterly profit, beating analysts’ estimates, boosted by its consumer-facing businesses of telecom (Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd) and retail (Reliance Retail).
Net profit rose to  ₹10,362 crore for the quarter ended 31 March from  ₹9,435 crore in the year earlier, RIL said in a statement on Thursday. That compares with the  ₹9,796 crore estimated by 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Revenue rose 19.4% to  ₹1.54 trillion for the quarter ended 31 March from  ₹1.29 trillion in the year earlier. Analysts estimated quarterly revenue at  ₹1.48 trillion.
Revenue rose primarily on account of higher realization for refining and petrochemical products. This is the second straight quarter when the Mukesh Ambani-led company has reported a quarterly profit of more than  ₹10,000 crore.
Ambani is relying on Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail to double RIL sales in about seven years and targeting that it will contribute nearly as much to the overall earnings of the company as its energy and petrochemical businesses.
RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM), or the amount a refiner earns by refining one barrel of crude oil, narrowed to a 17-quarter low at $8.2 per barrel. On a sequential basis, GRM declined 7%. It fell 25.5% from a year earlier. Analysts had expected RIL’s GRM in the range of $7-$8.5 per barrel.
During the March quarter, revenue from the refining and marketing segment fell by 6.1% to  ₹87,844 crore while the segment’s operating profit declined by 25.5% to  ₹4,176 crore. Refining and marketing segment performance was hurt by lower crude throughput due to planned maintenance. Revenue from petrochemicals segment increased by 11.3% to  ₹42,414 crore.
“RIL reported largely in-line standalone Ebitda and higher-than-expected petchem margin at 18.9% was offset by lower-than-expected refining throughput at 16 million tonnes,"" said Abhijeet Bora, an analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.
RIL’s digital services businesses clocked an Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of  ₹4,329 crore in the March quarter.
“Now consumer businesses account for almost 25% of RIL’s Ebitda, said V. Srikanth, joint chief financial officer.
Average revenue per user (Arpu) was  ₹126.2 in the March quarter, lower than the  ₹128 analysts had expected. Arpu is a key measure of profitability for telecom companies.
“There are 90 days in this quarter versus 92 days in the last three quarters each, due to which we have seen a dip of 2.7% in Arpu. Also, Jio customers came in at  ₹99 plan that may have impacted the Arpu,"" said Anshuman Thakur, Reliance Jio strategy and planning head.
The company expects Arpu to increase on the back of new schemes.
Reliance Retail saw 89% growth in revenue to  ₹1.31 trillion in the March quarter from  ₹69,198 crore in the year earlier. Segment operating profit rose 168% to  ₹5,546 crore to  ₹2,064 crore.
“There is no sign of deflation that we are seeing in our stores,"" said Gaurav Jain, strategy head of Reliance Retail Ltd, referring to slowing consumer demand. The company has opened 2,829 stores in the year ended 31 March and 510 stores in the fourth quarter.
RIL’s debt outstanding as on 31 March rose to  ₹2.87 trillion from  ₹2.18 trillion at the end of the previous year. The company held cash and cash equivalents of  ₹1.33 trillion at the end of the fiscal year, compared with  ₹78,063 crore as on 31 March 2018.
“During FY 2018-19, we achieved several milestones and made significant strides in building Reliance of the future. Reliance Retail crossed  ₹100,000 crore revenue milestone, Reliance Jio now serves over 300 million consumers and our petrochemicals business delivered its highest ever earnings,"" said Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director, Reliance Industries Ltd.
“Reliance Jio net profit largely remained flat quarter-on-quarter at  ₹840 crore and average revenue per user declined to  ₹126 per subscriber per month. We believe that likely strong subscriber additions in the telecom business, sustained high growth in retail business and likely deleveraging of the consolidated balance sheet would act as key re-rating catalyst for the stock,"" added Bora.
On Thursday, RIL shares rose 2.79% to  ₹1,382.90 apiece on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex lost 0.34% to end the day at 39,140.28 points."
359,2019-04-19,Reliance,"The big drag for RIL continues to come from its refining business, where Ebit fell by 18.6% sequentiallyReliance Jio and Reliance Retail did relatively better, but could not make up from the refining shortfall

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has been among the best performing large-cap stocks in the past year. The stock has risen by 45% in the past 12 months, compared to a rise of less than 12% in the Nifty 50 index. Needless to say, expectations are running very high.
In that backdrop, RIL Q4 results may be a tad disappointing for investors. Consolidated profit before tax fell 4.1% sequentially to  ₹13,858 crore in the March quarter. RIL’s increasing debt is biting. Consolidated earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) rose 1% sequentially to  ₹18,752 crore.
The big drag continues to come from the refining business, where Ebit fell by 18.6% to  ₹4,026 crore. Of course, it is well known that Singapore gross refining margins (GRM) have fallen sharply in recent months, and to that extent RIL’s reported refining margin of $8.2/barrel doesn’t come as a big negative.
The problem, however, is that other segments didn’t make up for the shortfall from the refining segment. After eight successive quarters of increases in profits, Ebit of the petrochemicals business fell 2% sequentially to  ₹7,819 crore.
And while the much-touted consumer businesses in did deliver, they are still relatively smaller in size to make up for the shortfall of the much larger refining segment.
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s Ebit rose 13% sequentially in Q4, although most of that increase was given away in higher interest costs. As such, pre-tax profit of the telecom business was flat sequentially, despite another stellar quarter in terms of subscriber growth. Average revenue per user (arpu) fell marginally as well, with the share of JioPhone customers increasing in the pie.
Note also the stark difference between Reliance Jio’s profits and its capital expenditure. Jio generated Ebitda (Ebit plus depreciation and amortization) of  ₹15,102 crore in FY19, but its capex stood at  ₹66,000 crore. Evidently, cash burn and indebtedness remain high for RIL’s digital services business.
While the conglomerate has restructured its telecom debt and transferred some debt to special purpose vehicles, this doesn’t count for much until new investors come to share the load.
Reliance Retail Ltd, meanwhile, had another strong quarter, with Ebit growth of 14% sequentially to  ₹1,721 crore in Q4. Margins continued to improve, and the strong performance supports the prospects of an initial public offering of the division.
Despite the overall sedate performance, investor sentiment in the RIL stock may continue to be positive on a possible stake sale in the refining and petrochemicals business. Of course, much depends on the valuation, if such a deal occurs with Saudi Aramco. But without such triggers, investors should note that they may have built in far too high expectations from RIL. To deliver on these would be a tall order."

New Delhi: Online retail in India will touch $170 billion or 8% of the total retail market of the country by 2030 growing at a CAGR of 21%, higher than the growth that offline retailers will see in the same period, brokerage firm Jefferies said in a report dated April 18. According to estimates by Jefferies, online retail is currently 25% of the total organised retail market: by 2030 it can jump to 37%.
Jefferies conducted a survey of over 550 online shoppers across several cities in India. It tracked their shopping purchases in a survey that threw up interesting results.
The brokerage noted that shoppers in India are now pivoting to online driven by convenience over discounts that drew the initial shoppers to the internet in India. While electronics and apparel have continued to see high demand, Jefferies said it has seen the emergence of newer shoppers buying into personal care and groceries a lot more in what can be seen as an imminent threat to offline retailers.
While electronics and apparel continue to be among the top shopped for categories online, Jefferies said, ""Our survey results imply that apparel is the most shopped category online, but categories such as electronics, grocery and personal care may see higher recruitment of consumers on online platforms, where consumer preference for shopping online is higher.""
Currently, Indian online shoppers spend  ₹12,800 per shopper per year; that number is expected to rise to  ₹25,138 by FY 30 as shoppers extend shopping online to segments beyond electronics and apparel.
Over the last few years, online retailers such as Flipkart, Myntra, Jabong, and Amazon have caused a sizeable dent into the shares of offline retailers such as Kishore Biyani-backed Future Group, Tata’s Trent, Arvind Retail, and Reliance Retail —which too have pivoted to an “omni-channel"" retail model that helps shoppers buy both online and offline. Even though initially, online retailers used hefty discounts and an advertising blitzkrieg to get Indian shoppers to shop largely for electronics, and apparel, Jefferies noted that online shopping has now become a more convenience driven habit. “Online retail is increasingly becoming a convenience format, rather than just a discounting one,"" Jefferies said.
It also added that online discounting has come down from its peak promotions offered in FY13 and FY14. “We believe that the impact of online discounting has come off from its peak and given the under penetration of both organised and online retail in India, there is strong head room for growth for both channels,"" the report said."
357,2019-04-19,Reliance,"Mukesh Ambani has ambitions to take on Amazon and Walmart in IndiaAmbani has set big expectations for Reliance’s consumer divisions

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s debt-fueled bet on the rise of the Indian consumer is starting to pay off, with his retail and telecommunications businesses contributing an increasing share of revenue and profit to his $87 billion empire.
The two divisions accounted for a combined 23 percent of revenue for the year ended March, up from 17% in the previous year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That growth has come at the expense of the conglomerate’s energy-related arms, which have been the bedrock of Ambani’s business for more than a decade. Their revenue share dropped to 77% from 83%, the data show.
Asia’s richest man has ambitions to take on Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. in India, where the power of the middle class is growing along with demand for e-commerce. Ambani launched the telecommunications business in 2016, spending $36 billion to roll out a 4G wireless network across India and luring millions of subscribers with free or cut-price data services. He’s now building on that business to create an online shopping platform, just as the US giants come up against constraints on foreign e-commerce activity in India.
Mukesh Ambani has set big expectations for Reliance’s consumer divisions, saying they will contribute almost as much to the conglomerate’s earnings as energy-related arms by the end of 2028.
The push into e-commerce shows how the billionaire is trying to put his mark on an empire that he largely inherited. Ambani, whose father Dhirubhai founded Reliance in 1959, agreed to split the businesses with his brother Anil three years after their father died without leaving a will. Mukesh got control of the flagship oil refining and petrochemicals arms.
Anil got Reliance’s newer services businesses in the split, including telecommunications. His brother’s entry into the industry and resulting price war has hit many rivals -- including Anil’s Reliance Communications Ltd. -- undercutting market leaders Vodafone Idea Ltd. and Bharti Airtel Ltd. in a price war. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., Mukesh’s telecom unit, saw profit in the year quadruple to  ₹2,960 crore ($427 million), the company said Thursday.
But he’s racked up borrowing to finance that push, with Reliance Industries’ net debt climbing to  ₹1.93 trillion in the year ended March, or about 2.3 times ebitda, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with the 2.69 times average for companies on the S&P BSE Sensex index as of Dec. 31.
In his quest to build a competitive e-commerce platform, Mukesh Ambani, 62, has been acquiring or purchasing stakes in businesses from Radisys Corp. to Vakt Holdings Ltd. in a series of deals worth $2.5 billion over the past two years. Reliance, Amazon and Walmart’s Bangalore-based Flipkart Online Services Pvt. are seeking to carve up an online shopping market that Morgan Stanley estimates will grow to $200 billion by 2028, from about $30 billion last year.
Ambani may be looking to raise more cash to fund his expansion plans, which include a proposal to add capacity to Reliance Industries’ oil refining operations. He’s considering selling 25 percent of the conglomerate’s refinery business to investors including state-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. in a deal that could fetch at least $10 billion, people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg earlier this week.

355,2019-04-20,Reliance,"Reliance has bought Venezuelan crude oil from Rosneft long before the imposition of the US sanctionsReliance has made all the purchases with the full knowledge and approval of the US, says company

New Delhi: Reliance Industries Saturday said it is not in violation of the US sanctions on Venezuela and had purchased crude originating from the Latin American nation from companies such as Russia's Rosneft in full knowledge of US authorities.
In a statement, Reliance said reports suggesting that it was involved in an arrangement that leads to cash payment for oil supplies to Venezuelan national oil company PDVSA via third parties are ""false and reckless"".
""Reliance has purchased Venezuelan crude oil from companies such as (Russia's) Rosneft long before the imposition of the US sanctions, as they do get title to Venezuelan oil in return for reduction in their prior debt.
""Since sanctions were imposed, Reliance has made such purchases with the full knowledge and approval of the US Department of State (USDOS), and Reliance has informed USDOS of specific volumes and transactions. Such transactions do not lead to any consequent payment to PDVSA and do not violate US sanctions or policies,"" it said.
Reliance said its price agreement with such sellers is at market price and payments are settled in cash or by product supply bilaterally between it and such sellers.
""It is false to suggest that Reliance would be settling such shipments via Rosneft to PDVSA. In these transactions, PDVSA is only the original physical supplier, as the crude oil originates in its export facilities,"" the statement said.
Reliance had last month stated that it had stopped all oil exports to US sanctions-hit Venezuela and will not resume sales until sanctions are lifted.
Reliance, whose twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat were major importers of Venezuelan crude oil, has reduced purchases by about a third.
The US imposed economic sanctions on Venezuela in late January 2019 with a view to curb the country's crude exports and put pressure on socialist President Nicolas Maduro to step down.
Reliance has investments in US shale gas projects and trades fuel in North America.
""Our US subsidiary has completely stopped all business with Venezuela's state-owned oil company, PDVSA, and its global parent has not increased crude purchases,"" the company had said last month. ""In addition, since sanctions were imposed and contrary to some news reports, Reliance has halted all supply of diluent to PDVSA and will not resume such sales until sanctions are lifted.""
US oil sanctions on Venezuela do not ban importing crude oil from the Latin American nation but bar imports from the US of the diluents that must be blended with the extra-heavy oil from Venezuela's Orinoco Belt so it can flow through pipelines.
Industry sources said Reliance had a contract to buy some 3 million barrels of crude oil from Venezuela a month, which has been reduced to about 2 million barrels already.
Venezuela's state-owned oil company PDVSA has been placed on the US Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals list, which generally prohibits American citizens from dealing with named firms or individuals.
This has resulted in international banks and shipping companies as well as Reliance ceasing any transactions with the firm.
These restrictions came into force on March 29 after an eight week winding down period for contracts that were already in effect.
Oil from the Orinoco Belt needs to be diluted with lighter grades to reduce its viscosity so as to allow its flow through pipelines to the coast for export or processing.

354,2019-04-21,Reliance,"Slide in Arpu may put pressure on the company to raise tariffs, say expertsIncrease in tariffs will be good news for the sector which has seen operators shut shop after Reliance Jio’s entry

New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, India’s most profitable telecom operator, has witnessed a continuous drop in its average monthly billings over the past five quarters and although it still outperforms rivals on this metric, analysts say the slide may finally put pressure on the company to raise tariffs.
Any increase in tariffs would spell good news for the telecom industry which has seen operators shut shop or get acquired after a bruising price war started with Jio’s entry in September 2016.
From  ₹154 in the December 2017 quarter, Jio’s average revenue per user (Arpu) fell 15.6% to  ₹130 in the same quarter in 2018 and to  ₹126.2 in the March 2019 quarter. Arpu is the total revenue of the operator divided by the number of users or connections on its network.
A declining Arpu means subscriber additions on the network outpace its growth in revenue. In other words, every incremental user contributes less to the total revenue.
“This simply implies that the quality of Jio’s subscriber base is becoming weaker. Ideally, low-paying customers should not grow beyond a certain stage and Arpu eventually must rise. Moreover, a declining Arpu for Jio is good for its rivals as it would put some sort of pressure on Jio to raise tariffs,"" a Mumbai-based analyst said requesting anonymity.
Interestingly, as Jio sees massive user additions and falling Arpu, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have started weaning low-paying customers by putting in place minimum recharge plans starting at  ₹35.
In fact, Bharti’s Arpu improved to  ₹104 in the December 2018 quarter from  ₹100 in the preceding quarter, the first such increase after nine straight quarters of decline. The company had modified the customer base definition to represent only paying customers. Similarly, Vodafone Idea’s Arpu too rose by a rupee from  ₹88 in the September 2018 quarter to  ₹89 in the December quarter. Both these companies have not reported earnings for the March quarter.
“Every telco wants subscribers that generate significant revenue but Jio, unlike its rivals, can better sustain a decline in Arpu and keep adding low-paying customers since it operates a 4G-only network and can add users at a minimal cost. But till when can it sustain the decline in Arpu is the question,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India.
An email sent to Jio remained unanswered at press time.
Moreover, telecom tariffs have bottomed out and all telcos now have almost equal revenue market share and any price-led aggression could impact all adversely, Crisil said in a report dated 16 April.
To be sure, Jio’s performance on metrics such as data traffic, profit and 4G users is much better than its rivals’. In the December quarter, Vodafone Idea’s and Airtel’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was  ₹1,136.8 crore and  ₹1,949.8 crore respectively, while Jio’s was  ₹4,053 crore.
Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) believes Jio’s Arpu decline is not surprising given the aggressive pace at which the subscriber base is growing. “The industry should also start taking into consideration the mix of customers on the telco network. Also, in terms of ARPU, Airtel and Jio might come neck-and-neck soon and one should also look at the customer churn metric going forward,"" Rajan Mathews, director general, COAI said"

March quarter earnings and elections are going to drive markets movement this week. In the global markets too, earnings will be key for equities. This week will go a long way in determining whether investors should be concerned about the dawning of an earnings recession or whether back-to-back quarters of negative growth can be avoided in what is the heaviest week for profit reporting by US companies.

On Monday, HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries stocks will be in focus after posting their quarterly earnings.
Net profit of Reliance Industries rose 9.79% to  ₹10,362 crore for the quarter ended 31 March while revenue rose 19.4% to  ₹1.54 trillion in the same period. This is the second straight quarter when the Mukesh Ambani-led company has reported a quarterly profit of more than  ₹10,000 crore.
RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM), or the amount a refiner earns by refining one barrel of crude oil, narrowed to a 17-quarter low at $8.2 per barrel. On a sequential basis, GRM declined 7%.
“Management is constructive about refining margins as diesel spreads are likely to get a boost from implementation of IMO 2020, as 3.5mbpd marine fuel Sulphur standards are likely to come down. RIL is well positioned to benefit given their high complexity. However, gasoline spreads are likely to be under pressure from high new refinery capacity addition of 2mbpd against demand growth of 1.3mbpd,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher in a note on 19 April.

On 18th April, CARE Ratings downgraded Reliance Capital debt worth  ₹21,000 crore from CARE A+ to CARE A. On 19th April, Brickwork Ratings followed suit. It downgraded Reliance Capital debt worth  ₹14,100 crore from from BWR AA to BWR A+. The company cited “deterioration in liquidity profile of the group due to challenges faced by Reliance Capital and its key lending subsidiaries, Reliance Commercial Finance Limited (RCFL) and Reliance Home Finance Limited (RHFL) to raise funds through traditional bank lines and debt market instruments."" Two other ADAG Group Companies, Reliance Home Finance and Reliance Commercial Finance were downgraded by Brickwork Ratings. For both these companies, Brickwork noted that “no clarity has been provided on quantum of loans to group companies and timely recoverability of funds is critical to ensure timely repayment of debt obligations."" Reliance Capital stock was down 12.18% on Monday and is down 65.26% for the year gone by.
An analysis of mutual fund data as of 31st March 2019 shows that 7 AMCs are exposed to the three companies across 62 schemes. The highest exposure is of Reliance Nippon Asset Management Company of  ₹1,727 crores followed by SBI Mutual Fund at  ₹787 crore. Reliance Nippon Asset Management in turn has Reliance Capital as its promoters raising important questions about MF holdings of promoter debt. Reliance Capital is reportedly in talks to divest its stake in Reliance Nippon AMC. On a scheme-wise level, the exposures range from as high as 16.54% of assets in LIC MF Dual Advantage Fixed Term Plan - Series 2 - Regular Plan to negligible amounts. The downgrades come at a troubling time for the mutual fund industry. Debt troubles emanating from IL&FS and Essel Group Debt have caught debt fund managers on the back foot. Recently Kotak AMC held back some part of it FMP units against expected repayments from the Essel Group rather than allowing investors to redeem all units. HDFC AMC rolled over its HDFC Fixed Maturity Plan—1,168 days—February 2016 (1) - Regular Plan which had exposure to Essel. It later released a noted announcing plans to offer investors the option to rollover or to redeem.
It is unclear how much of the mutual fund debt in the ADAG group is Loans against Securities. It has been reported that the promoters of the Reliance ADAG group have entered into a standstill agreement with lenders till 30th September 2019, similar to the agreement between the Essel Group and its lenders. Industry professionals indicated that the MF exposure to the three companies – Reliance Capital, Reliance Home Finance and Reliance Commercial Finance does not fall within the loan-against-shares category and hence no question of a standstill agreement arises. However whether the paper in question is backed by shares or other collateral, investors in these schemes face a high level of risk.
Corporate group debt in schemes of mutual funds owned by the group also presents an added element of uncertainty. “Mutual funds which are owned by corporate groups will end up owning debt from the parent up to permissible limits. If the parent company is in trouble, fund investors should see it as a warning signal and look at exposure to the parent in their schemes,"" said Deepali Sen, fouder, Srujan Financial Advisors LLP."
350,2019-04-23,Reliance,"Reliance Jio's ebitda margin has hovered at 38-39% for six quarters now, despite revenue rising 60% over the same periodWith Reliance Jio saying it's close to 99% network coverage in India, it is likely that both opex and capex will grow at a slower pace

Mumbai: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s Ebitda margin has hovered around the 38-39% mark for six quarters now. This despite the fact that revenues have risen from  ₹6,879 crore in the December 2017 quarter to  ₹11,106 crore in the March 2019 quarter (Q4), an increase of more than 60%.
Normally, a rise of this magnitude would have resulted in gains from operating leverage. Why are Reliance Jio’s margins stuck at the same levels? 
While nearly all other costs have fallen, network operating expenditure (opex) has risen as a percentage of revenues. In the December 2017 quarter, network opex amounted to  ₹1,737 crore, or 25.2% of the company’s revenue. In the recently concluded March quarter, it nearly doubled to  ₹3,401 crore, and amounted to 30.6% of revenue.
“The lack of operating leverage in earnings prints continues to surprise as network opex per unit of data carried on the network stayed flat. This challenges our understanding of the wireless business being an inherently high operating leverage one,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients after Q4 results of parent Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) were announced last week.
The head of research at an institutional brokerage firm says, “The benign view is that Jio’s network coverage has been rising even in recent quarters, which will naturally result in higher network opex. Another view, however, is that Jio is now capitalizing a lower proportion of its expenses, now that its revenues have risen meaningfully.""
For perspective, Reliance Jio continues to capitalize a portion of its expenses, citing that these pertain to non-wireless businesses that are yet to be commercially launched. But some analysts have had questions about the wireless expenses that were reflecting in the profit and loss statement, which seemed low. The rise in network opex in the past few quarters now makes wireless costs look more realistic.
Now, with Reliance Jio saying it is close to network coverage of 99% of the population, it is likely that both network opex and capital expenditure will grow at a slower pace. As such, the benefits of operating leverage may well start being visible in a few quarters.
As things stand, the lack of operating leverage has been a dampener on RIL Q4 results. Despite rising revenues, Jio’s pre-tax profits were flat at December 2018 levels. Apart from flat Ebitda margin, profits were also hit by an increase in interest costs. For investors who are highly enthused about Reliance Jio’s prospects, it’s imperative that signs of operating leverage start becoming visible soon."

Mumbai: Reliance Jio GigaFiber will offer a broadband-landline-TV combo service for  ₹600 a month, and additional facilities plus the option to connect at least 40 devices to its smart home network for up to  ₹1,000, a person aware of the development said.
Currently, Reliance Jio is pilot-testing GigaFiber in New Delhi and Mumbai, providing 100 gigabytes (GB) of data at 100 megabytes per second (mbps) for free, except for the  ₹4,500 one-time deposit for a router. To this, telephone and television services will be added in the next three months, and all three services will remain free for about a year, when the service will be commercially rolled out, the person mentioned above said on condition of anonymity.
While the landline will come with unlimited calling facility, television channels will be delivered over the internet (Internet Protocol Television).
“All these offerings will be powered through an ONT (Optical Network Terminal) box router which can connect 40-45 devices such as mobile phones, smart TVs, laptops, tablets and a range of smart devices,"" the person cited above said. Additional services could include gaming, closed-circuit television and smart home systems.
“While the triple combo—which will offer 600 channels with seven-day catch-up option, landline and 100 mbps broadband—will be priced  ₹600 a month, the tariff for adding other smart home services may cost extra and depending on the plan, the tariff could go up to  ₹1,000 a month,"" the person added.
With speeds of at least 100 mpbs, going up to 1 gigabytes per second (gbps), Jio GigaFiber will also enable storing CCTV surveillance footage and other data on the cloud, making it accessible across devices.
At the last annual general meeting of Reliance Jio’s parent Reliance Industries Ltd in July, chairman Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest person, had announced that GigaFiber will be the largest greenfield fixed-line broadband rollout globally, with simultaneous introduction in 1,100 cities across India.
The service is now being rolled out across 1,600 cities, Reliance said last week in a statement announcing March quarter earnings.
Rival Bharti Airtel Ltd, however, will focus on premium customers and expand its broadband service across India’s top 100 cities, instead of copying Reliance Jio’s ambitious plan to create a fibre-optic network across India.
The commercial launch of Jio GigaFiber could disrupt the wired broadband market in the same way Reliance Jio disrupted the wireless market in September 2016.
Moreover, the wired broadband market is a highly under-penetrated one. As of February end, there were just 18.29 million wired broadband users as against 531.54 million mobile broadband subscribers, data from the telecom regulator showed.
Registrations for Jio GigaFiber had opened in August last year.
In October, Reliance said it would buy majority stakes in Den Networks Ltd and Hathway Cable and Datacom Ltd for  ₹5,230 crore—a move that will boost Jio GigaFiber.
Through these investments, Reliance Jio had said in October last year, it plans to boost 27,000 local cable operators that are aligned with Den and Hathway through superior back-end infrastructure, tie-ups with content producers, and investment in digital infrastructure for connecting customers.
Mint could not ascertain the current size of Jio GigaFiber’s footprint.

With the US announcing to withdraw waivers granted to eight economies including India to buy crude oil from Iran beginning early May, over-dependence on oil imports in the third largest consumer of oil has again come to limelight.
During the first year in office of prime minister Narendra Modi in 2014-15, India used to import a majority (18.4%) of its total crude oil requirement from Saudi Arab with Iran at a distance 7th position contributing only 6% of India’s crude basket. However, towards end of Modi’s tenure, as per the latest available data for the first 10 months of the financial year 2018-19 (April-January), Iran is now the third largest contributor to India’s energy security, contributing 11.3% of the country’s crude oil demand. A fast normalising Iraq after a long period of war and internal strife has also replaced Saudi Arab as the top source for India’s crude oil demand, contributing a fifth (20.4%) of its oil imports by January this year.
How US ending Iran waivers could affect oil markets and beyond
Sweetener deals including higher discounts, longer credit periods and better insurance and shipping deals by both Iran and Iraq have endeared them to India as reliable oil suppliers at a time Saudi Arab has cut oil production.
In 2014-15, Venezuela was the third largest supplier (12.1%) of crude oil to India. But by January, 2019, it has dropped to fifth position (7.6%) mostly due to pressure from the US to reduce oil imports as it unleashed sanctions on the “illegitimate"" regime of President Nicolas Maduro, accusing it of violence and obstructing international humanitarian assistance to the citizens of the country undergoing a socio-economic crisis.
However, the most surprising entry in the top 10 list of oil exporters to India is the United States from where India now sources 2.75% of its total oil requirements till January of 2018-19 financial year. To keep president Donald Trump in good humour who has been accusing India of unfair trade practices, highlighting the trade surplus that India enjoys, India started importing crude oil from the US beginning 2017-18 and increased it more than four times in 2018-19. But that has not stopped Trump from withdrawing zero duty benefits worth $5.6 billion to Indian exporters or ending the waiver from Iran sanctions."
347,2019-04-24,Reliance,"Reliance Retail is testing a food and grocery app among employees before the commercial launch of its e-commerce platformThis strategy mirrors the one adopted by Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries before the launch of Reliance Jio

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd’s retail arm—Reliance Retail Ltd—is testing its food and grocery app among its employees before the commercial launch of its e-commerce venture, mirroring the strategy India’s most valuable company adopted ahead of launching its 4G telecom service in Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
The grocery app would be made available to the public by this year-end and orders made on the app fulfilled by local merchants, two people aware of the matter said, requesting anonymity.
Reliance Industries’ entry into the Indian e-commerce market, if its aggressive foray into the telecom industry is anything to go by, may similarly upend the online retail industry that is dominated by US giants Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.-owned Flipkart, at present. While food and grocery is the largest consumption category in India, accounting for two-thirds of India’s retail market, online sales in this category are still restricted to the top cities.
“We think Reliance Retail is most suited for an e-commerce play. They have the capital strength, a big offline presence, good brands in their kitty and significant grocery operation. If not this Diwali, we expect a launch of the e-commerce venture next year for sure,"" said Satish Meena, senior forecast analyst at Forrester Research. “Though it may challenge the position of existing e-commerce majors, it will also attract new online buyers, which will be good for the segment.""
Queries emailed to Reliance remained unanswered till the publishing of this story.
Reliance Retail operates neighbourhood stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets, and wholesale, speciality and online stores.
“We believe given the vast store network (10,415 stores) it gets an edge to implement the omnichannel platform,"" brokerage Jefferies India said in a note to clients on 22 April.
For its e-commerce venture, RIL plans to sign on local merchants, boosting their sales through what is known as the O2O (online-to-offline) marketplace, a business model pioneered by the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.
Under the O2O model, a consumer searches for the product or services online but buys it through an offline channel. RIL’s plan is to consolidate merchants under an e-commerce platform. The merchants, in turn, will cater to the demand. This will help the company save costs and enter areas currently outside the traditional purview of e-commerce companies.
Reliance already sells food and grocery products through its website Reliancesmart.in.
The launch of the grocery app for its employees is also RIL’s first effort to combine the strengths of Jio numbers and retail’s cash-and-carry model, according to one of the two people cited earlier.
“The plan has always been to integrate the advanced infrastructure built by Reliance Jio and physical retail business to create a differentiated model,"" said the person, requesting anonymity.
In January, RIL chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said that group companies Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio would jointly launch a new e-commerce platform in the country and Gujarat would be the first state to get it.
The e-commerce bet is in line with Ambani’s aim to generate half of the group’s revenue from the consumer businesses over the next 10 years. Currently, 80% of the group’s sales come from its traditional oil and gas business.
Significantly, Reliance Retail has withdrawn its fashion and lifestyle products from online marketplaces including Amazon and Flipkart.
Reliance Retail reported an 89% jump in sales at  ₹1.3 trillion in the year ended 31 March from  ₹69,198 crore in the previous year. The retailer’s reach expanded to 6,600 towns and cities at the end of the fiscal.
Jefferies in its report adds that online retail is currently $18 billion in size and accounts for 3% of the total retail market in India, according to India Brand Equity Foundation.
“We estimate the share of online retail in India will increase to about 8% by 2030, with the total size at $170 billion. This implies a 21% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for online retail over FY18-30E, versus 15% CAGR over FY18-30E for physical organized retailers. Over the same period, we expect the overall retail in India to grow by 9% as unorganized players lose market share,"" said Jefferies India in the note.

345,2019-04-24,Reliance,"RIL along with its partner BP Plc plans to jointly set up as many as 2,000 petrol pumps in India over the next few yearsRIL, which enjoyed an overall 12% market share in fuel retailing till 2006, saw it slip to less than 0.5% in 2014

Mumbai: Mumbai: Eleven years after Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) began shuttering its fuel retail outlets, it has now regained market share in petrol and diesel to pre-2006 levels.
While petrol and diesel sales nationwide grew 9% and 3%, respectively, in 2018-19 from a year ago, RIL outperformed the industry with figures of 21% and 16%, respectively, the company said in a presentation to analysts after its quarterly earnings.
Till 2006, when RIL’s fuel sales were at their peak, the refiner had a market share of 14.3% in diesel and 7.2% in petrol.
“With 1,372 outlets, we clocked the highest-ever exit volume at 5.6 million kilolitres in March 2019,"" said RIL in the presentation. A kiloliter is equivalent to 1,000 litres.
RIL, which enjoyed an overall 12% market share in fuel retailing till 2006, saw this slip to less than 0.5% in 2014, by when it had shut most of its fuel retail outlets due to spiralling crude oil prices.
RIL spent  ₹5,000 crore in setting up 1,470 retail outlets between 2004 and 2006. In 2008, however, RIL started shutting down outlets, and later reopened some of them. In 2018-19, it reopened or added 59 stations, reaching 1,372 fuel retail outlets now.
“In the domestic market, RIL is gaining market share across categories. RIL continues to be optimistic on gross refining margins owing to scale-up of petcoke gasification, International Maritime Organisation (IMO) regulation implementation, and demand improvement in China,"" said Yes Securities in a report dated 19 April.
Under regulations issued in October 2016 by the IMO, ships must shift to fuel oil with sulphur content below 0.5% from January 2020. This is against the present 3.5%.
With this impending shift, demand for low-sulphur fuel oil is expected to rise. According to analysts, RIL’s gross refining margin stands to gain from expansion in middle distillate cracks, including LPG, diesel, fuel oil, kerosene and marine bunker fuel.
During the fourth quarter, RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM), or the amount a refiner earns by refining one barrel of crude oil, narrowed to a 17-quarter low of $8.2 per barrel. On a sequential basis, GRM declined 7%.
RIL has also outperformed the industry in sales of aviation turbine fuel and bulk diesel and is preparing to onboard Air India for diversifying its portfolio and reinforce its industry position.
“Year-on-year volume growth of 33% in direct sales to airline partners and breakthrough hospitality arrangement with Shell MRPL,"" said RIL.
The oil-to-telecom conglomerate, along with its partner BP Plc, plans to jointly set up as many as 2,000 petrol pumps in India over the next few years.
While Reliance holds a licence to set up 5,000 fuel retail outlets, BP has a licence to set up 3,500 fuel retail outlets in India.
Currently, RIL’s fuel retail outlets are largely concentrated in the western region.
Its key competitors are state-owned oil marketing firms — IndianOil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd—which together dominate over 90% of the fuel retailing market."
344,2019-04-24,Reliance,"Far from leaving a hole that can’t be filled, the exit of a market leader often triggers a burst of fresh growth. IndiGo and SpiceJet will soon fill the gaping hole left in the wake of the Jet Airways crisis

More than 2,000 years before Jet Airways (India) Ltd looked set to join the ash heap of airline history, Aristotle postulated horror vacui, the concept we understand as “nature abhors a vacuum"". While Hindu philosophers as well as those like Epicurus and Lucretius subsequently debunked the thought, it is a convenient way of looking at where the Jet Airways crisis is headed.
While Naresh Goyal may well choose to believe (and declare), that après moi le déluge—reality may be a bit more banal—even if it hurts his delicate sensibilities. Markets, especially free ones, tend to handle the loss of a single competitor with far greater equanimity than what floundering protagonists themselves display when faced with their unfortunate demise.
Examples abound of industries where the loss of one or even more participants has been swiftly followed either by existing players stepping up to the plate or newcomers seizing the opportunity.
In the aviation industry, of course, we have the oft-chronicled instance of how when the first set of private airlines like Damania Airways, ModiLuft and East-West Airlines collapsed in the mid-1990s, they were replaced quickly by newer players like Jet Airways, Air Sahara, Air Deccan and of course, Kingfisher Airlines. In turn, even as the last three were disappearing from the map, their place in the sky was being taken up by IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir.
The airline business is at its core fairly straightforward, with the mobility of underlying assets a given. Planes, gates, pilots and other key resources can smoothly be transferred from one company to another. After all, in which other business can you slap a new name over an existing one overnight and operate as if nothing has changed?
But, even in a more complex sector like the telecom industry in India, the elimination of six of the nine companies that were present in the business even three years ago hasn’t led to a shrinking of the market or even a paucity of choice for the customer. Indeed, if anything, with the business reduced to just three major competitors, there has been a bonanza for customers in terms of lower prices and greater data offerings.
Far from leaving a hole that can’t be filled, the exit of a market leader often triggers a burst of fresh growth. That happens largely because incumbents, especially those who are leaders, tend to get caught napping just when the market is ready for take-off.
In 2007, Nokia had a 50% share of the smartphone market. Today, its share is down to barely 1%, but the market for smartphones has grown exponentially. Nokia didn’t read the tea leaves and paid the price for it.
Around the same time, an entirely new business was emerging around the social media space. At this time, Myspace was acquired by Rupert Murdoch for $580 million in 2005 in an effort to leverage its hugely popular online community for his news business. Just four years later, Murdoch sold Myspace at a massive 90% discount, effectively killing it as a competitor. But instead of signalling the end of social media as a business, it marked the rise and rise of Facebook.
Market leaders slip and fall due to complacency, mismanagement, circumstances beyond their control or simply because they have nothing new left to offer, and this cycle of boom and doom has become increasingly shorter.
Indeed, the consolidation that has taken place in both telecom and aviation in India is the new norm for businesses across the world.
In a recent piece in the Harvard Business Review titled The High Price Of Efficiency, author Roger L. Martin points out, “In more and more industries, profits are concentrated in a handful of companies. For instance, 75% of US industries have become more concentrated in the past 20 years. In 1978, the 100 most profitable firms earned 48% of the profits of all publicly traded companies combined, but by 2015 the figure was an incredible 84%."" 
So, let’s ignore all the hosannas for Jet Airways on social media. The truth is the airline has been underperforming for several years now. Its fate also reflects the repudiation of its business model. Simply put, the yield on a two- or three-hour flight—which forms the bulk of air services within India—can never justify the full-services model that Jet Airways adopted.
Only low-cost airlines, with their maniacal drive to constantly cut costs, grow revenues and maximize efficiencies, can survive in such markets. It is a trend that is being replicated in country after country, with even the long-distance flying market now being driven by low-cost carriers (LCCs).
According to the International Civil Aviation Organization, LCCs are consistently growing at a faster pace than the world average growth, and their market share is continuing to rise both in advanced and emerging economies. In 2018, these LCCs carried an estimated 1.3 billion passengers, accounting for approximately 31% of the world’s total passengers on scheduled flights.

NEW DELHI :
Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio maintained its lead over other telecom service providers in adjusted gross revenue (AGR) for the March 2019 quarter at about  ₹9,839 crore, according to data from Trai.
Vodafone Idea, the country's largest telecom operator by subscriber base, recorded AGR of  ₹7,133.4 crore (1.25 per cent dip over December quarter), and Bharti Airtel  ₹5,920.2 crore (over eight per cent fall on a sequential basis) during the March quarter.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's (Trai) latest data showed that Jio's adjusted gross revenue (AGR), or earnings from mobile phone services, rose 3.76 per cent sequentially to  ₹9,838.9 crore at the end of March 2019, as the company continued its comfortable lead over the two rivals.
However, quarter-on-quarter, AGR growth for Jio this time was lower than 14.6 per cent rise it had experienced in the December quarter.
The government's share of licence and other fees is determined on the basis of the AGR from access services. Overall, access services contributed over 72 per cent of the total AGR of telecom services, with the balancing flowing in from domestic and international long distances services.
According to Trai's report, titled 'Indian Telecom Services Performance Indicator', measuring telecom performance for March quarter, the number of telephone subscribers in the country declined to 1,183.5 million at the end of March 19, a decline of 1.20 per cent over December quarter, and 1.88 per cent when seen year-on-year.
The overall teledensity in India declined from 91.45 as on December 2018 to 90.11 as on March 2019, it said.
The monthly average revenue per user (ARPU) for wireless service improved by 1.80 per cent to  ₹71.39 in the quarter ended March this year, against  ₹70.13 in the quarter ended December 2018.
Prepaid ARPU per month increased to  ₹63 in quarter ended March 19 ( ₹60 in quarter ended December 2018) but, notably, the postpaid ARPU per month saw a substantial decline to  ₹261 from  ₹296 during the same period.
The gross revenue (GR) and adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of the telecom service sector for the March 2019 quarter stood at  ₹58,414 crore and  ₹35,932 crore, respectively.
""GR declined by 0.98 per cent and AGR declined by 0.34 per cent in quarter ended March 2019 as compared to previous quarter,"" it said. Compared to the year-ago period, the GR and AGR this time was lower by 6.08 per cent and 0.66 per cent respectively.
The licence fee declined marginally to  ₹2,888 crore in the March quarter, from  ₹2,890 crore in the December quarter."
343,2019-07-10,Reliance,"A job loss or the threat of one is among the most stressful events in a person’s life causing anxiety and depression

Last Sunday wasn’t a happy holiday for thousands of families across the world. Deutsche Bank kicked off yet another turnaround plan that envisaged laying off 18,000 employees across the world, including in India. The retrenchment comes as no surprise, even if the scale is shocking. This latest round of culling adds more numbers to the thousands of employees who have been axed in the last 10 years as the financial crisis played out in the form of closures and mounting losses. However, it isn’t just banking and financial services that have seen mass lay-offs in recent years. In 2017, Indian telecom companies laid off thousands of people following a series of mergers and acquisitions as well as shutdowns in the sector following the price war unleashed by Reliance Jio. Around the same time, the information technology industry was in the midst of large-scale retrenchment.
We are not done yet. As sectors such as automobiles face an uncertain future amid changing customer choices, there could be many more people finding themselves out of a job soon with no place to go. It is becoming a pattern. As business leaders find their strategies going awry, resulting in declining financials, a lay-off is the first piece of restructuring they turn to. It is easy to execute, shows activity and brings instant returns by lowering costs. Lay-offs are an inevitable consequence of market economics, but it is becoming increasingly evident that it may be less to do with competitive forces and more a consequence of poor leadership. The result is that many end up paying for the sins of a few.
Take Deutsche’s woes. The bank has struggled to stay afloat since the 2008-09 financial meltdown following a series of scandals, troubles with regulators, and a failed merger with smaller rival Commerzbank. In 2015, Deutsche was fined a record $2.5 billion by regulators in the US and UK for its role in rigging the key Libor interest rate. In October 2016, German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel said about the bank’s woes: “The scenario is that thousands of people will lose their jobs. They now have to bear the responsibility for the madness carried out by irresponsible managers.""
That sums it up, even if it isn’t just madness but avarice and fraud, too, in most cases.
In India, many of the incumbent telcos were in deep distress even before Jio launched its take-no-prisoners assault on the market in 2016. The aggressive bids in the spectrum auction of March 2015, when companies coughed up  ₹1.1 trillion, left most of them bleeding with massive debt on their books. The lay-offs that followed a few years later was the response of the same leaders who had taken the earlier decisions.
Lay-offs, especially sector-wide ones, are generally driven by major changes in the market or unsustainable pressure from competition. In 1993, Sears, till then the reigning retail leader in the US, finally gave in to Walmart’s sustained price pressure and laid off 50,000 people to lower costs. The same year, IBM laid off an equal number. It stemmed from the stubborn refusal of its leadership over the previous two decades to accept that the world was moving to personal computing. Again, in 2012, Hewlett Packard announced 20,000 lay-offs, following declining sales that stemmed from its inability to see that customers were increasingly looking for mobile machines. The company had no tablets or smartphones in its portfolio at a time when sales of these were taking off.
A lay-off is traumatic. There’s enough research to suggest that a job loss or even the threat of one is among the most stressful event in a person’s life, leading to anxiety and depression. Far from being momentary pain, unemployment leads to long-term earning losses and subsequently jobs of lower quality, besides impacting one’s psychological and physical health. What’s more, morale levels among surviving employees plummet—almost 30% by one indicator, as people simmer about the unfairness and injustice meted out to their laid-off colleagues even as they watch the very leaders and managers flourish who were responsible for leading the company to grief.
Yet, it isn’t proven that mass lay-offs allow companies to recover profitability. A study titled Cure Or Curse: Does Downsizing Increase The Likelihood Of Bankruptcy? by professors from Auburn University, Baylor University and the University of Tennessee found that downsizing firms are significantly more likely to declare bankruptcy than firms that do not engage in it.
Some companies, realizing the futility of large job cuts to shore up performance, have experimented with alternatives. In a 2018 article , Harvard Business Review cites AT&T as one of those firms. In 2013, the US telecom giant realized that 100,000 of its 240,000 employees had work that would no longer be relevant in a decade. “Instead of letting these employees go and hiring new talent, AT&T decided to retrain all 100,000 workers by 2020. That way, the company wouldn’t lose the knowledge the employees had developed and wouldn’t undermine the trust in senior management that was necessary to engagement, innovation, and performance,"" writes the author. The results were almost instantaneous: 18 months after the programme’s inception, the company had shortened its product development cycle time by 40% and accelerated its time-to-revenue by 32%, and since 2013, its revenue has increased by 27%.
When leaders fail, it is their bucks that should stop first.

339,2019-07-17,Reliance,"The move will let Indus secure a unique revenue stream outside the traditional model of renting towers to phone firmsThe move will allow the company to secure a unique revenue stream outside the traditional model of renting out its towers to mobile phone operators

NEW DELHI :
Indus Towers Ltd, India’s largest mobile tower company, plans to utilize its vast base of telecom towers to charge electric vehicles as part of a strategy to tap this fledgling industry and morph into an overall infrastructure provider.
The move will allow the company to secure a unique revenue stream outside the traditional model of renting out its towers to mobile phone operators. It would also help Indus Towers reduce dependence on the troubled domestic telecom sector.
The telecom industry has witnessed severe disruptions after the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016 with cheap tariffs, which eventually forced smaller operators to either close operations or consolidate—leaving just two operational entities, Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel Ltd.
With fewer telecom tenants, the tower industry has flipped from being a seller’s market over three years ago to a buyer’s market currently.
Indus Towers, thus, believes that hosting EV charging units is a natural extension for the company because of its large footprint.
“We are very keen about this (EV) space. Since the car tank will be replaced by a battery, you will need to charge that battery at either commercial places or your building. The kind of turnaround we talk about in these electric vehicles, you will need many locations. And we have locations which are powered 24 hours of the day making it suitable for EV charging,"" a top company official said, requesting anonymity.
Indus Towers’ plans come at a time when the Union government is aggressively looking to increase the sale of electric vehicles and also make the country a global manufacturing base for EVs. The government in this year’s budget announced income tax rebates of up to  ₹1.5 lakh to customers on interest paid on loans to buy electric vehicles, with a total exemption benefit of  ₹2.5 lakh over the entire loan period.
The government also announced customs duty exemption on lithium-ion cells, which will help lower the cost of the batteries in India, as they are not produced locally. Makers of components, such as solar electric charging infrastructure and lithium storage batteries, will be offered investment-linked income tax exemptions under Section 35 AD of the Income Tax Act, besides other indirect tax benefits.
To handle the charging of EVs, Indus Towers would have to extend the outlets of its current mobile tower infrastructure to EV charging as well, the official added. This is part of its endeavour to become an infrastructure provider independent of any sector.
“We have a location to sell. Any and every technology which hangs on our location and pays us money, we are happy about it,"" he said. “There is a huge amount of traction that Indus is seeing from municipalities in providing the EV charging stations and trials have already started in Gurgaon.""
Indus Towers, is still to firm up its EV charging plans, including the likely investments given the early stages of the EV ecosystem in India.
“What kind of nozzle will go into the car...what will be the battery charging model and the charging cycle, or will the battery be swappable...all that is still on the table,"" the official said.
The company, which was incorporated in November 2007 as a joint venture between certain entities of Bharti Group, Vodafone Group and Idea Cellular, is in the final stages of completing a merger with Bharti Infratel Ltd.
Last April, the two tower companies had agreed to merge their businesses to create the world’s largest tower company outside China.
The combined entity will own more than 163,000 towers, second only to China Tower.
It will be listed on the stock exchanges, as Bharti Infratel is a publicly-traded company.
Its nearest rival in India will be ATC, which has 78,000 towers."
337,2019-07-17,Reliance,"Reliance, which is the operator of KG-D6 with 60% stake, has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the Bay of Bengal blockBP's Chief Executive (Upstream) Bernard Looney said the partners are also discussing the development of natural gas found in Mahanadi basin, off the Odisha coast

New Delhi: British energy giant BP plc and its partner Reliance Industries will invest $5 billion in bringing to production three sets of natural gas fields in the Krishna Godavari basin block in the Bay of Bengal by 2022.
BP's Chief Executive (Upstream) Bernard Looney said the partners are also discussing the development of natural gas found in Mahanadi basin, off the Odisha coast.
""Together we are spending up to $5 billion or  ₹35,000 crore in three gas development projects in the KG-D6 block and together we are expected to bring about one billion cubic feet per day of new domestic gas on stream by 2022,"" he said here.
The three projects will help reverse the falling gas output from what was once the biggest gas-producing block in the country.
Last month, the two partners had announced investment sanction for development of their deepest natural gas discovery in the KG-D6 block. The MJ, or D-55, gas find will be developed in sync with the previously approved 'R-Series' and the Satellites Cluster development to add 30-35 million standard cubic metres per day of natural gas production in phases.
The two partners also exploring ways of 'economically' developing discoveries in the NEC-25 block in the Mahanadi basin and building pipelines for transportation of the gas, Looney said.
The three projects will develop a total of about 3 Tcf (trillion cubic feet) of discovered gas resources. R-Cluster will be first to come on stream, delivering gas in the second half of 2020-21 fiscal. The second set is called the Satellite Cluster. MJ is the third of these fields.
Reliance, which is the operator of KG-D6 with 60% stake, has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the Bay of Bengal block. Of these, Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 & D3) -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block, was put to production in September 2008.
The output from D-1 and D-3 has fallen sharply from 54 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) in March 2010 to 1.3 mmscmd in the January-March quarter. MA field ceased to produce last year.
BP holds 30% stake in the block while the remaining 10% is with Niko Resources of Canada.
Besides MJ, four deepsea satellite gas discoveries -- D-2, 6, 19 and 22 -- are planned to be developed together with D29 and D30 finds on the block. These six fields are called Satellite development.
The third set is the D-34 or R-Series find.
According to Looney, India is expected to overtake China as the largest growth market for energy in the mid-2020s and its primary energy demand will increase two-and-a-half times until 2040.
""India has a natural gas base with a potential to meet 50% of anticipated demand for gas through to 2050. Natural gas burns at half of the emission of coal for power generation and offers significant benefits for air quality. In renewables, there are large untapped solar and wind resources with a potential to be utilised at a cost which is increasingly competitive with hydrocarbons,"" he said."
340,2019-07-17,Reliance,"Revenues of telecom companies have stabilized after several quarters of declinesVolume growth has come off from the 35-40% levels seen in the preceding quarters

Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai’s) latest performance indicator report has mixed news for telecom investors. Consumer spends on telecom services, which had been falling for several quarters, have stabilised recently. But while telecom companies hold on to tariffs and maintain revenues, volume growth came off significantly in the March quarter.
First, the good news on revenue. Aggregate consumer spends on mobile services, including goods and services tax, stood at around  ₹35,000 crore in the quarter ended March, according to an analysis by Kotak Institutional Equities. This translates to annual spend of  ₹1.4 trillion, 5% higher than the lows of  ₹1.34 trillion in the September 2018 quarter.
The stabilization in revenue comes on the back of stable pricing and implementation of minimum recharge plans for pre-paid users. None of the major players have announced any cuts in their tariffs from February 2019, points out India Ratings and Research Pvt. Ltd
Revenue trends are unlikely to see major change in the recently concluded June quarter either. Both Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd are expected to report stable revenue in comparison to the March quarter. “Overall, our prognosis is that of a steady quarter with Bharti reporting a modest 1.6% sequential growth in wireless revenues and Vodafone Idea reporting a flattish revenue print, largely on the back of higher number of days in the June quarter versus March,"" analysts at Kotak said in a results preview note.
The stable revenue scenario, however, does not mean the industry’s challenges are behind it.
The March quarter industry internals also show easing of volume growth. Industry voice volumes grew just 18% (YoY), the slowest since the commercial launch of Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio, points out Kotak. 4G data usage per subscriber grew a modest 1.6% sequentially in the March 2019 quarter, implying usage is plateauing for many smartphone users. In the preceding three quarters, growth had stood at 2.8%, 5.9% and 12.2%, respectively.
Also, the postpaid segment continues to see a sharp fall in average revenue per user (Arpu). Consumers have been downtrading their usage plans, reflective in the 33% year-on-year (YoY) fall in postpaid revenue. The churn is expected to continue in June quarter as well. “Even as like-for-like pricing has been stable for the past few quarters, incumbents continue to see net negative impact of consumers trading up and trading down on the average revenue per user axis,"" analysts at Kotak add.
While volume trends are not worrying yet, telecom companies still face the herculean task of profitability improvement and balance-sheet repair. “Despite the likely stabilisation of revenues and possibly profitability, telcos would continue to rely on external funding arrangements to support their debt servicing and elevated capex requirements,"" India Ratings and Research said in a note."

MUMBAI :
Oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is likely to report a muted first-quarter earnings on Friday as gains from its telecom and retail arms will be offset by the weakness in its refining and petrochemicals business, analysts said.
According to a Bloomberg survey of 11 brokers, RIL’s consolidated net sales are expected to come in at  ₹1.45 trillion. Net profit was estimated at  ₹9,706.20 crore by 13 brokers.
“On a standalone basis, the first quarter was largely a subdued one driven by weak margin trends in both the refining and chemical businesses. On a consolidated basis, part of the weakness should have been offset by the increasing earnings contribution from consumer businesses,"" said HSBC in a research report dated 8 July.
RIL is expected to report its eighth consecutive quarterly decline in gross refining margin (GRMs), which is what a refiner makes from turning every barrel of crude to fuel. Analysts expect RIL’s GRM to be at $8-$8.5 per barrel this time.
“We expect RIL’s GRMs to be down 2% quarter-on-quarter at $8 per barrel due to unfavourable Brent-Dubai and refinery shutdown,"" said Emkay Research in a report dated 8 July.
Brent crude oil prices fell 8.2% year-on-year to average $68.5 per barrel in the June quarter. Singapore GRM declined 43% year-on-year to $3.5 per barrel. Though GRM has recovered of late, the gasoline crack spread remains at lower levels. RIL’s performance in petrochemicals may not impress either as chemical margins have been on a downtrend, especially in June, due to a possible slowdown in demand. Chemical margins have weakened despite the increase in Chinese imports.
“In addition, increasing capacity as seen for monoethylene glycol (MEG) and paraxylene (PX) and a decline in demand as seen for butadiene (BD) further point toward a sustained slowdown in the sector. We lower our margin assumptions for PX, MEG, BD, and ethylene,"" said BNP Paribas in a report dated 17 July.
According to Goldman Sachs, RIL’s petchem earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) will be 9% lower from the previous quarter. On Thursday, RIL’s shares ended at  ₹1,262.80 on BSE, down 1.54%, while the benchmark Sensex fell 0.81%.
RIL’s telecom and retail businesses remain the bright spots in its portfolio.
Jio is expected to report increased profitability quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q), riding on JioPhone sales and subscriber additions. It is expected to report around 7% quarter-on-quarter revenue growth with a marginal dip in average revenue per user (ARPU) by 1-2% to  ₹125.
“ In 1Q, Ebitda is likely to see a q-o-q decline due to the transfer of Jio’s tower and fibre assets to a separate SPV (towards the end of 4Q19), on which Jio will start recognizing rent in the income statement. We note that it is difficult to estimate the exact Ebitda impact in 1Q due to limited details around the rental structure of these assets, but forecast a 370bps q-o-q Ebitda margin compression to 35.3%,"" the Goldman Sachs report said.
On the retail front, RIL is expected to benefit from strong store additions. Also, end of season sales, which commenced a week earlier than the base quarter, is expected to help. “However, the overall slowdown in the economy coupled with the Indian Premier League and Cricket World Cup, which were expected to impact sales as most matches were scheduled on Sundays, led to lower footfalls,"" said Edelweiss Securities Ltd in a note dated 5 July."

Brent crude oil prices fell 8.2% year-on-year to average $68.5 per barrel in the June quarter. Singapore GRM declined 43% year-on-year to $3.5 per barrel. Though GRM has recovered of late, the gasoline crack spread remains at lower levels. A slowdown in the demand environment along with new capacities set to come on schedule would put further pressure on GRMs.
Revenue from the petrochemicals segment stood at  ₹37,611 crore for the June quarter, a dip of 6.64% when compared to  ₹40287 crore posted in the same quarter last year. Analysts had estimated that performance in petrochemicals may not impress as chemical margins have been on a downtrend, especially in June, due to a possible slowdown in demand.

Revenue from the refining and marketing segment was also up 6.4% during the quarter, while the segment’s operating profit declined 15.2%.
Refining and marketing segment performance was impacted by lower product realization on a y-o-y basis. Revenue from the petrochemicals segment dropped 6.6% to  ₹37,611 crore, against  ₹40,287 crore during the first quarter of last fiscal.

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is likely to report a muted first-quarter performance as gains from its telecom and retail arms will be negated by its weak refining and petrochemicals business, according to analysts. RIL will report its first quarterly earnings on Friday. According to a Bloomberg poll of 11 brokers, RIL's consolidated net sales are expected to come in at  ₹1.45 trillion and net profit is estimated at  ₹9,706.20 crore by 13 brokers.
Five leads to watch out for in RIL's first-quarter earnings
1) Stabilising petcoke gasifiers
RIL's petcoke gasifiers remain the key to improve its refining profitability. RIL has invested $5 billion in setting up petcoke gasifiers. With refineries processing heavier crudes, the production of petcoke at refineries is peaking and gasification of petcoke has become an efficient and environmentally safe way of utilizing it. RIL wants to completely eliminate its petcoke production of 6.5 million tonnes a year, generated from two of its cokers. Petcoke gasification will help it produce 23 mscmd (million standard cu. m a day) of synthesis gas or syngas which will reduce intake of regasified liquefied natural gas (R-LNG) at its refineries.
2) Monetization of the telecom assets (tower, fiber)
To cut debt, Jio has decided to transfer its fiber and tower arms to two infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs)—Digital Fiber Infrastructure Trust and Tower Infrastructure Trust—which will be offered to external investors. The transfer will help it not only reduce debt but also become an asset-light digital services company. The InvIT has effectively allowed RIL to replace  ₹710 billion of external debt with very-long-term (20-year) money and thereby remove any refinancing need on this amount of debt. It also gives more balance sheet flexibility and allows RIL to further increase spending across its consumer business if it chooses to do so.

3) Commercial roll out of its broadband business
RIL is expected to roll-out its fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) service this year. Reliance Jio had early this month asked its users what they'd like to call it's broadband service. Jio gave the users of its MyJio app three options to choose from JioFiber, JioHome, and Jio GigaFiber. RIL had announced its FTTH service JioGigaFiber plans last year at the company's annual general meeting (AGM). The service aims to deliver wall-to-wall broadband service for mobile devices with speeds peaking 100Mbps in 1,100 cities across India.
4) Omnichannel strategy and launch of an e-commerce platform
Reliance Retail operates neighbourhood stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets, and wholesale, specialty and online stores. For its e-commerce venture, RIL plans to sign on local merchants, boosting their sales through what is known as the O2O (online-to-offline) marketplace, a business model pioneered by the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.
5) Capex plans
RIL has stopped given capital expenditure guidance. However, the analysts expect that any indication towards a slowdown in capex will be viewed positively by most investors."

333,2019-07-19,Reliance,"Reliance Industries will announce its financial results for April-June quarter todayReliance Jio had posted a profit of  ₹8.4 billion for the March quarter

India’s newest and only profitable telecom operator Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is expected to show improved revenue on the back of strong subscriber additions, but its average revenue per user (ARPU) may decline given that a chunk of these additions comprise low-paying users.
Jio’s parent Reliance Industries will announce its financial results for April-June quarter later today. Jio had reported a profit of  ₹8.4 billion for the March quarter on an operating revenue of  ₹111 billion. It had a subscriber base of 306 million as of March end.
Goldman Sachs expects Reliance Industries’ telecom arm to report a revenue of  ₹119 billion with 329 million subscribers, while ARPU is expected to drop to  ₹125.
Though Jio has witnessed a continuous drop in its average monthly billings over the past five quarters, it still outperforms its rivals on this metric. From Rs154 in the December 2017 quarter, Jio’s ARPU fell 15.6% to  ₹130 in the same quarter in 2018 and to  ₹126.2 in the March 2019 quarter.
ARPU is the total revenue of the operator divided by the number of users or connections on its network.
Comparatively, Airtel’s ARPU for the March quarter was  ₹123, an 18.6% increase from  ₹104 in the December quarter. Vodafone Idea lags behind these two at  ₹104.
At a time when its rivals are weaning away bottom-of-the-pyramid subscribers by launching minimum recharge plans and improving their ARPU, Jio continues to widen its subscriber base by adding low-paying users on its network.
“RJio ARPU will be soft as more JioPhone users are added at low price points. However, strong subscriber addition for RJIo to lead to higher Q1 revenue,"" Axis Capital said in a report dated 3 July.
Industry analysts will look out for management commentary on the company’s ability to maintain revenue momentum, capex outlook and update on the rollout of its fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) offering Jio GigaFiber.
Jio GigaFiber is touted to be the largest greenfield fixed-line broadband rollout globally, with simultaneous introduction in 1,600 cities across India.
“Price hikes are unlikely this year...and challenges in last-mile connectivity for FTTH persist,"" IIFL Institutional Equities said in a report dated 3 July.
The commercial launch of GigaFiber, still in the works, could disrupt the wired broadband market in the same way the company had disrupted the wireless market in September 2016."
329,2019-07-19,Reliance,"Reliance Jio has vaulted past Bharti Airtel to become the country’s second-largest mobile telephone company by user base

Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Jio has vaulted past Bharti Airtel to become the country’s second-largest mobile telephone company by user base. Considering Jio’s growth strategy, this was inevitable. Jio launched its commercial services—entirely on 4G technology—in September 2016, signing up millions of subscribers in a matter of moths with its initially-free data and voice service. The latest data put out by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India shows Jio has about 323 million subscribers, as of 31 May, ahead of Airtel’s 320.4 million and behind Vodafone Idea’s 387.6 million users.
At this rate, Jio’s use base could go on to overtake Vodafone Idea’s in the not-too-distant future. Jio’s exponential growth has been driven by aggressive pricing, but that’s only part of the story. The new entrant offered such fabulous data speeds and voice services that it made the offer basket of pricier incumbents look slow and patchy. Customer complaints of call-drops and internet snap-offs have bedevilled many of the older players in recent years. The price war unleashed by Jio has led to record losses in the telecom industry, forcing some players to the brink. The once-crowded telecom space now has only three large private players, and the state-run MTNL and BSNL are hardly seen in market contention anyway.
The ongoing surge in Jio’s subscriber base has a lot to do with Vodafone Idea and Airtel introducing service validity vouchers, which require users to pay a minimum recharge sum to continue using their networks. What users want, though, are reliable networks as a minimal guarantee; and with 5G around the corner, network quality differences could yet become stark."
330,2019-07-20,Reliance,"As of May end, Reliance Jio had 322.98 million users, against Bharti Airtel’s 320.38 million usersVodafone Idea continues in the top position with 387.55 million users

NEW DELHI :
India’s youngest and only profitable telecom operator Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has overtaken rival Bharti Airtel to become the second largest operator in terms of subscribers to its mobile phone services, according to data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India made public on Friday.
Jio, which entered the sector in September 2016, had 322.98 million users and 27.8% subscriber market share, against Airtel’s 320.38 million users and 27.6% market share as of end-May.
To be sure, the subscriber numbers include active as well as inactive SIMs. The telecom regulator counts each SIM as a user although there are overlaps.
Vodafone Idea, the company born out of a merger between Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, continues to retain the top position with 387.55 million users and a 33.36% subscriber market share.
There is, however, a silver lining for Airtel. It held the maximum proportion (99.86%) of active wireless subscribers as against its total wireless subscribers in May.
Interestingly, as Jio continues to widen its subscriber base by adding low-paying users on its network, rivals Airtel and Vodafone Idea started weeding out inactive customers through minimum monthly recharge plans of  ₹35, launched in November. The telcos expect the focus on paying users will improve average revenue per user (ARPU).
ARPU is the total revenue of the operator divided by the number of users or connections on its network.
Airtel’s ARPU for the March quarter thus improved to  ₹123, rising 18.6% from  ₹104 in the December quarter. Vodafone Idea’s ARPU was at  ₹104 in the March quarter, up from  ₹89 in the December quarter, and  ₹88 in the three months ended September 2018. These two companies now consider only active users to calculate ARPU.
However, both Airtel and Vodafone Idea have lost subscribers over the past 11 months. In May alone, Airtel lost 1.5 million users, while Vodafone Idea was poorer by 5.7 million subscribers. In contrast, Jio added 8.1 million users during the month.
As a result of the massive bottom-of-the-pyramid user additions on its network, Jio has seen a continuous drop in its ARPU in the past six quarters. Jio’s ARPU for the June quarter was at  ₹122, down from  ₹126.2 in the March quarter.
Jio had 331.3 million subscribers as of 30 June, and posted a net profit of  ₹891 crore in the June quarter, according to the company’s financial results.
Airtel and Vodafone Idea are yet to announce their June quarter earnings."

Reliance Jio, India’s youngest and only profitable telecom operator, on Friday overtook rival Bharti Airtel to become the country’s second largest operator in terms of mobile phone subscribers.
According to data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, Jio, which entered the sector in September 2016, had 322.98 million users and 27.8% subscriber market share, against Airtel’s 320.38 million users and 27.6% market share as of end-May.
The company’s present subscriber base is 331.3 million subscribers, according to Jio’s April-June financial results also announced on Friday when it reported a profit of  ₹8.91 billion, up 45.6% year on year and an operating revenue of  ₹116.79 billion rupees, up 44% on year.
Clearly, Jio’s dream ride continues.
But, among all these powerful indicators lies a worrying metric.
Jio’s average revenue per user (ARPU) has declined consistently over the past six quarters.
Jio’s ARPU for the June 2019 quarter was at  ₹122, down from  ₹126.2 in the March 2019 quarter and  ₹130 in the December 2018 quarter. It was at its peak of  ₹154 in the December 2017 quarter.
ARPU is the total revenue of the operator divided by the total number of users or connections on its network.
A declining ARPU means subscriber additions on the network outpace its growth in revenue. In other words, every incremental user contributes less to the total revenue.
This essentially implies that the quality of Jio’s subscriber base is becoming weaker in terms of paying capacity of the user. Moreover, a declining ARPU for Jio is good for its rivals as it would put some sort of pressure on Jio to raise tariffs, as the industry clamours for higher prices.
“The company’s performance is steady, but new subscribers are not adding to revenue much. Tariff hikes have to happen but when will Jio go for it is the question,"" a Mumbai based analyst said requesting anonymity.
Interestingly, as Jio continues to widen its subscriber base by adding low-paying users on its network, rivals Airtel and Vodafone Idea have started weeding out inactive customers through minimum monthly recharge plans of  ₹35, launched in November. The telecom companies expect the focus on paying users will improve ARPU.
Airtel’s ARPU for the March quarter was  ₹123. The company has not yet announced financial results for the June quarter but analysts expect Airtel’s ARPU to rise further as it gets rid of low-paying users on its network. To be sure, Airtel only counts paying users for ARPU calculation.
Vodafone Idea’s ARPU was at  ₹104 in the March quarter, up from  ₹89 in the December quarter, and  ₹88 in the three months ended September 2018.
Jio, which dreams of being the number one telcom company, also must realise subscribers come at a cost. More subscribers would amean congestion on the network. It is a trade-off that Jio must ponder upon while its rivals pray for tariff hikes."

Big US companies are accelerating efforts to move more of their supply chains from China to neighboring countries in light of Trump administration tariffs.
Companies in sectors such as technology, clothing and footwear are exporting more goods from emerging giants including Vietnam and Malaysia, data show.
At the same time, the shift has exposed the murkiness of trade export rules, putting a premium on lawyers expert in the minutiae of US customs rules.
""We have a lot of questions from our members,"" said Sage Chandler, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association. ""Companies are trying to find ways to avoid having to pay 25%.""
Some companies may be pushing the envelope a little too much, violating US rules against ""transhipments,"" the routing of China-made goods through other countries to evade tariffs, legal experts say.
Speeding shift from China
President Donald Trump since last year has slapped 25% duties on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports and threatened additional levies on all other Chinese items coming to the United States -- though the two sides agreed last month to hold their fire for now.
Trump's trade measures have led some multinationals to fortify their North American operations and others to transfer some manufacturing capacity from China to any number of countries, including Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, the Philipines, Bangladesh, India and Ethiopia.
Exports of computers and electronics from Vietnam to the United States have risen 71.6% in the first five months of 2019 compared with the year-ago period, according to government data.
The pattern has also held for other machines and equipment, with exports from Vietnam rising 54.4% over that period.
Even before Trump targeted China on trade, US companies had been reducing their dependence on China because of increasing production costs and elevated transport expenses compared with other Asian countries.
But the trade war has sped up those moves.
Ralph Lauren has ""accelerated the diversification of our supply chain to mitigate the long-term impact of any potential tariff outcomes,"" said a spokesperson for the clothing company, adding that tariffs have so far not hit the company's goods.
Xcel Brands, which owns Isaac Mizrahi, Judith Ripka and other fashion houses, will cease manufacturing in China in 2020, a big shift from two years ago when the country was the source of 100% of its merchandise.
The company has moved clothes-making operations to Vietnam, Cambodia and Bangladesh, and is exploring adding capacity in Central America, Mexico and Canada.
This retooling, which was in the works prior to the tariffs, could boost profit margins, said Xcel chief executive Robert D'Loren. The trade war with China ""accelerated our sourcing diversification efforts,"" he said.
A decade ago, more than 90% of US footwear was made in China. But today, the figure is 69%, said Matt Priest, president of Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America.
Problem solved?
Yet shifting production outside of China to other Asian centers is not necessarily a panacea.
Many of these countries lack the roads, airports and other vital infrastructure of the world's second-biggest economy. And there is no guarantee that the emerging manufacturing venues will be safe from US tariffs down the road.

Companies can also run afoul of US law if goods are made in China and then sent to an intermediate destination to dodge US tariffs.
""I have noticed an upswing in the number of tariff evasion cases that have been made public and also in the number of inquiries my firm has received,"" said Jeff Newman, a Boston attorney.
A June Wall Street Journal report showed that billions of dollars of Chinese-made goods were being rerouted in this manner through Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines.
US customers officials did not respond to request for comment.
Retail giants such as Walmart and Target say significantly reducing their reliance on Chinese-made goods is unrealistic because of the demand for low prices.
That means retailers are more likely to stop producing goods with very low profit margins than to incur additional costs by moving production out of China, according to Priest of the footwear distributors association.
He points to flip flops, which earn returns of only around six or seven percent.
""It won't be worth moving to Vietnam for six or seven percent-margin shoes,"" Priest said.
""That shoe is not worth it."""
321,2019-07-21,Reliance,"Jio recently topped Bharti Airtel to become India's second-biggest telecoms operator behind Vodafone IdeaSince its launch in September 2016 Jio has added 331.3 million subscribers by offering cut-price data plans and free voice calls

MUMBAI :
India's Reliance Industries plans to remain focused on subscriber additions rather than chase higher tariffs for its Jio telecoms business, a top company executive said.
Its strategy is aimed at prolonging the pressure on rivals such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, whose revenue and profits have plunged since the launch of Jio by Reliance boss Mukesh Ambani.
""We have been telling you from the beginning, the priority for us today is customers,"" Jio's head of strategy, Anshuman Thakur, said in a news briefing late on Friday after quarterly results.
Since its launch in September 2016 Jio has added 331.3 million subscribers by offering cut-price data plans and free voice calls, along with free music, movies and more. Its arrival has caused upheaval in India's mobile telephony market, forcing some small players out of business while bigger Vodafone and Idea have responded by merging in India.
Competition from Jio has sent the average revenue per user (ARPU) tumbling. Jio's results for the three months to June 30 showed its ARPU - a key metric for telecoms companies - was at 122 rupees ($1.77), down 9.3% from a year ago.
""We are not in this ARPU game,"" Thakur said, adding that the management's priority is to ensure that more subscribers latch on to its network and use its services, thereby creating greater ""long-term value.""
Jio recently topped Bharti Airtel to become India's second-biggest telecoms operator behind Vodafone Idea.
Analysts had predicted that Jio would start raising its tariffs as soon as it reached a critical mass of subscribers.
Thakur, however, suggested that Jio is in no mood to relent, noting that it added 24.5 million subscribers in the quarter and that its subscribers consume an average of 11.4 gigabytes of data each month.
""We're quite happy with these key performance indicators,"" he said.
Reliance also announced on Friday that Jio has sold its tower assets via an investment trust to Canada's Brookfield Asset Management for 250 billion rupees."
320,2019-07-21,Reliance,"Reliance Industries’ operating profits were higher than the Street’s estimatesPerformance of some of the key business segments showed some hiccups

Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL’s) June quarter results weren’t exactly comparable with earlier quarters because of the divestiture of its tower and fibre units as separate units housed under an infrastructure investment trust. Besides, there has been a change in accounting norms, which impacted the results as well.
Even so, the company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization stood at  ₹21,315 crore, higher than the Street’s estimates of  ₹20,079 crore.
As has been the case in the past many quarters, RIL’s consumer businesses drove profits, with their share of operating profit increasing further to 29% in Q1. In the March quarter, the telecom and retail businesses accounted for 27% of its consolidated earnings before interest and tax.
While overall profit growth was decent, performance of some of the key businesses displayed some hiccups. In the telecom business, for instance, average revenue per user fell to  ₹122 in Q1, from  ₹126.2 in the March quarter.
So, even though the company’s subscriber base grew by 8% sequentially, revenue rose at a lower rate of 5.2%. In the March quarter, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s revenue had risen 7% sequentially.
From the looks of it, Reliance Jio is likely to drive volumes at the expense of realizations. As such, analysts hoping for a recovery in tariffs might end up being disappointed.
In the refining business, RIL reported a gross refining margin of $8.1 per barrel, down from the $8.2 per barrel margin it had reported in the March quarter. This was despite a slight increase in Singapore refining margins last quarter and, to that extent, is a slightly negative surprise in the results. Profit of the petrochemicals division fell about 6% quarter-on-quarter, with margins of some key petchem products declining.
Finally, in the retail business, the star performer in the last fiscal year, the high base seems to have finally caught up. Profit of the division rose only 3%, sequentially, in the June quarter. While it’s heartening that the consumption slowdown hasn’t dragged down profits of the division, the fact that growth is subdued doesn’t augur well for overall profit growth.
Beyond the quarterly results, investors need to focus on the company’s high indebtedness, apart from the possibility of free cash flow missing the Street’s optimistic estimates. “Street EPS estimates still appear too optimistic as do free cash flow estimates. Debt in telecom is still rising, as well as in retail where it is now around  ₹16,500 crore,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients. EPS is earnings per share.
Of course, the hive-off of the tower and fibre business has helped reduce debt, especially now with the tower unit receiving an investment worth  ₹25,215 crore from Brookfield Infrastructure Partners Lp. But there is a commensurate impact on the telecom business’s profits as tower rentals are now a cost item. It remains to be seen what the net gains from the transaction are.
For now, investors may well be pleased that despite the global and domestic slowdown, RIL’s reported profits remain steady."
319,2019-07-22,Reliance,"Reliance has developed an oil-to-chemical strategy to transform the Jamnagar refinery from a producer of fuels to chemicalsRIL has developed a multizone catalytic cracking (MCC) process, which converts a wide range of feedstock to high-value propylene and ethylene in a single riser

Reliance Industries, in its first-quarter results, beat street estimates to post an increase of 6.8% in its consolidated net profit at  ₹10,104 crore. Though RIL's new-age businesses -- retail and telecom -- helped it post a profit, the management said earnings could have been hit had the company not embarked on its oil-to-chemicals integration path a few years ago.
""We know the environment for refining and petrochemicals was volatile. The volatility in crude, the macroeconomic headwinds and China-US trade-related development all impacted the market but thanks to the level of integration we have between refining and petrochemicals, a lot of this volatility has gotten absorbed and without having any meaningful impact on our earnings,"" said V. Srikanth, joint CFO, RIL at the company's first-quarter earnings on Friday.
Petrochemicals segment revenue decreased 6.6% year-on-year to  ₹37,611 crore in 1Q FY20 due to the decrease in volumes and price realizations, primarily in paraxylene (PX) and monoethylene glycol (MEG), which was partially offset by an increase in volumes of polyesters. Petrochemicals segment earnings before interest and tax, affected by lower volumes, was at  ₹7,508 crore, down 4.4% year-on-year.
Reliance has developed an oil-to-chemical strategy to transform the Jamnagar refinery from a producer of fuels to chemicals.
""The objectives are to preserve as well as upgrade existing refinery margins, while maximising asset utilisation, for a sustainable competitive cost of chemicals,"" RIL said in its 2018-19 annual report.
RIL has developed a multi-zone catalytic cracking (MCC) process, which converts a wide range of feedstock to high-value propylene and ethylene in a single riser.
The company ultimately wants to achieve greater than 70% conversion of crude refined in Jamnagar to competitive chemical building blocks of olefins and aromatics. The Jamnagar refinery product slate, at the culmination of oil-to-chemical transition, shall be only jet fuels and petrochemicals.
""All refined products priced below crude shall be eliminated for chemicals at the initial stage. Final fuel de-risking shall target the elimination of gasoline, alkylate and diesel, synchronised to the global evolution of E-mobility and transport fuel demand decline,"" RIL said in its annual report."
318,2019-07-22,Reliance,"Of 300MHz, Isro and defence department have sought 100 and 25MHz, respectivelyIn India, the only band identified for 5G spectrum is under the 3.3-3.6GHz band, which has 300MHz of airwaves available

NEW DELHI :
India’s defence and space departments have laid claim to a large chunk of the fifth-generation (5G) airwaves, two people familiar with the matter said, casting a shadow over this year’s auctions that telcos say are too costly to bid for.
The two departments have together sought 125MHz out of the 300MHz marked for 5G services, said the people cited above on the condition of anonymity, shrinking the spectrum available for commercial use and potentially driving up auction prices.
In India, the only band identified for 5G spectrum is under the 3.3-3.6GHz band, which has 300MHz of airwaves available. Of this, the defence department has sought 100MHz to boost coastal security while the Isro wants 25MHz for satellite-based navigation services, the people cited above said. The requests, if granted by the government, leaves just 175MHz for telecom services.
The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), an industry body, said without adequate spectrum at reasonable prices, the auction will fail to garner industry interest.
“After Isro and defence...just 175MHz will be left for telcos...maybe out of this, the government might also want to reserve some airwaves for BSNL as it wants to keep the PSU competitive. There are clearly constraints now in this band...the government has to decide what it really wants to do. Without adequate amount of spectrum at reasonable prices, it (auction) is a non-event,"" said Rajan Mathews, director general of COAI.
The department of telecommunications (DoT) did not respond to an emailed query.
COAI has earlier criticized the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) for setting high reserve prices for the airwaves at a time when revenue streams of the debt-laden industry have thinned.
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s entry in September 2016 brought down data tariffs to rock-bottom, forcing the incumbents to match prices, which led to several companies to either shut operations or be acquired by bigger telcos. Trai had last year suggested auctioning airwaves in the 3.3-3.6GHz band at  ₹492 crore per MHz, sparking an outcry from telcos who have termed it prohibitively expensive. DoT is yet to decide on these recommendations.
“Earlier, we thought only pricing was an issue, now, even the amount of spectrum is an issue,"" Mathews said.
On top of this, Trai has also suggested that an operator can buy up to 100MHz of 5G airwaves. So, if the highest bidder ends up buying all that it is allowed to buy, that leaves only 75MHz for the rest. Also, this leaves the risk of not having any 5G spectrum left for the third bidder.
In India’s ultra-competitive telecom sector, it makes strategic sense for the highest bidder to purchase as much spectrum it is permitted to reduce competition. Jio is the only profitable telco in India.
“There is a huge challenge ahead for DoT and Trai as they will have to again decide on the spectrum cap per operator now that the available spectrum on offer is lower,"" said a senior telco executive, requesting anonymity.
To be sure, Trai had suggested a 5G spectrum holding cap of 100MHz per operator keeping in mind the available spectrum was 275MHz, much before the defence department made its request.
“Auctioning insufficient spectrum will only further burden the already debt-laden industry with higher costs as it creates artificial scarcity, driving up prices. It’s unfair to hold an auction with less spectrum. The government must instead seize its unique opportunity to incentivize deployment of 5G by lowering the cost burden on the industry,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India."

Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd.’s talks to sell a minority stake in its refinery business to Saudi Arabian Oil Co. have stalled on differences over the deal’s structure, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Aramco is concerned about Reliance’s proposal to shift some debt of the wider group to its refinery business ahead of the transaction, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. The Indian company is working on alternatives and negotiations could still resume and lead to a compromise in the coming months, the people said.
Reliance’s shares closed 0.5% lower at  ₹1,273.55 in Mumbai after falling as much as 1.6% earlier. A representative for Aramco declined to comment, while a representative for Reliance didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Ambani, Asia’s richest man, has been selling assets -- from mobile-phone towers to energy assets -- to pare debt. His Mumbai-based company is looking to sell as much as 25% of its refinery and petrochemicals business in the deal that could fetch at least $10 billion, Bloomberg News reported in April. The sale would help pare the conglomerate’s obligations that have risen to about $42 billion, as it poured money into new sectors such as telecommunications.
Both sides have completed due diligence for the potential deal, the people said. Aramco has asked its financial adviser to update the due diligence report every quarter, one of the people said.
Ballooning Debt
Reliance’s debt increased 20% over the past year as it spent $36 billion to disrupt India’s wireless market with cheap data and free calls, forcing rivals to combine or exit.
Brookfield Asset Management Inc., last week, agreed to spend $3.7 billion to acquire a stake in an investment trust that will manage the mobile-phone tower business of Reliance. That transaction was the Canadian alternative asset manager’s second deal with Reliance.
Earlier this year, Brookfield agreed to buy a pipeline from Ambani for $1.9 billion, while in 2018, a Reliance unit sold its stake in some Eagle Ford Shale acreages in the U.S. to Sundance Energy Inc. for about $100 million.
Aramco is restarting preparations for a potential public offering, months after putting the planned listing on hold, people familiar with the matter said earlier this month. The oil giant recently held talks with a select group of investment banks to discuss the potential share sale, the people said.

309,2019-07-24,Reliance,"The penalty on Airtel and Vodafone works out to be about  ₹1,050 crore eachThe DCC had last month approved imposing penalty on Airtel and Vodafone Idea

NEW DELHI :
Telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Wednesday expressed disappointment on the DCC's decision on penalty imposition, saying the ""arbitrary"" move would put more burden on stretched financials of telcos while adversely impacting the government's vision of a digitally empowered India.
The telecom department's apex decision-making body, the Digital Communications Commission (DCC), on Wednesday approved imposing a cumulative penalty of  ₹3,050 crore on Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea (now merged as Vodafone Idea Ltd) for not providing points of interconnection to Reliance Jio.
The penalty on Airtel and Vodafone works out to be about  ₹1,050 crore each. In case of Idea, it comes to around  ₹950 crore.
Hinting at possible legal recourse, Airtel asserted that it will approach the ""appropriate forum"" after receiving a formal intimation about penalty, and went on to say that it has ""complete faith in the judicial process and the law of the land"".
""We are extremely disappointed with the decision to impose penalty on the telecom operators on the matter pertaining to providing the Point of Interconnect (POI). This is despite the fact that the total number of POIs provided were more than sufficient for the projections provided on the number of customers,"" an Airtel spokesperson said.
The spokesperson argued that the requested points of interconnect were provided within the prescribed time limits and were more than the numbers requested for.
""All these facts were presented to the authorities. It is, therefore, disheartening that those facts have not been considered while taking this arbitrary decision of imposing the penalty,"" the spokesperson said.
Given the recent forced consolidation due to the financial stress in the sector, the decision will put an additional burden on the already stretched balance sheets of the operators, and adversely impact the government's vision of a digitally inclusive and empowered India, the spokesperson said.
""Upon receipt of the formal communication intimating the levy of penalty, we will approach the appropriate forum. We have complete faith in the judicial process and the law of the land,"" the spokesperson added.
In October 2016, the telecom regulator had recommended imposing a total penalty of  ₹3,050 crore on Airtel, Vodafone and Idea for allegedly denying inter-connectivity to Reliance Jio.
The regulator had, at that time, stopped short of recommending cancellation of their telecom licences saying it may lead to significant consumer inconvenience.
The DCC had last month approved imposing penalty on Airtel and Vodafone Idea. However, before imposing the penalty, the commission decided to seek the regulator's views on revising the  ₹3,050 crore suggested penalty, citing the ""present financial health of the sector"".
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, however, maintained its stand, saying it is not in a position to modify its previously recommended penalty on the operators as it is bound by the provisions of the Trai Act."
310,2019-07-24,Reliance,"Digital Communications Commission's decision is a setback to Airtel and Voda Idea, already buried under a pile of debt and are facing lossesThe penalty is for denying interconnection ports to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd when it started operations three years ago

New Delhi: The Digital Communications Commission (DCC) on Wednesday upheld the telecom regulator’s decision to levy a penalty of  ₹3,050 crore on Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd for denying interconnection ports to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd when it started operations three years ago.
DCC is a government panel comprising top officials from the telecom department, ministry of electronics and information technology, NITI Aayog and the department of economic affairs.
The decision comes as a setback to Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which are already buried under a pile of debt and are facing mounting losses, amid a lingering tariff war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio in late 2016.
“Today, after detailed discussion it was decided that the DCC will accept Trai’s recommendations to levy penalty and recommend accordingly to the government (department of telecommunications or DoT),"" telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan told reporters on Wednesday. In the previous DCC meeting, the matter was referred back to the Telecom Regulatory of India (Trai) for a review, Sundararajan said, adding that the regulator wrote back saying it would not change its recommendations.
DCC’s recommendations will be sent to DoT now, which has also been studying the issue for almost three years since Trai first sent its recommendations in October 2016.
“DoT is the final authority to issue the penalty. It has the powers to take any decision,"" said Sundararajan.
The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), the industry body representing telecom operators, said it was disappointed with the imposition of a penalty of this magnitude at a time when the industry is reeling under financial stress. “We had earlier also said that this would simply extract more from the industry,"" said Rajan Mathews, director general of COAI.
Bharti Airtel said that given the recent forced consolidation due to financial stress in the sector, this decision would be an additional burden on the already stretched balance sheets of the operators, and would adversely impact the government’s vision of a digitally inclusive and empowered India.
“... the requested POIs (points of interconnection) were provided within the prescribed time limits and were more than the numbers requested for. All these facts were presented to the authorities. It is, therefore, disheartening that those facts have not been considered while taking this arbitrary decision of imposing the penalty,"" a spokesperson for Airtel said, adding that “upon receipt of the formal communication intimating the levy of penalty, we will approach the appropriate forum. We have complete faith in the judicial process and the law of the land"".
A Vodafone Idea spokesperson said, “We will explore all options, including seeking legal recourse to protect our interests.""
In October 2016, Trai had recommended to the government that a penalty of  ₹1,050 crore each be imposed on Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India, and  ₹950 crore on Idea, for allegedly denying PoIs to Reliance Jio.
This came after Jio in September 2016 complained to Trai that a large number of calls on its network were failing as incumbent operators were not providing sufficient interconnection ports. Points of interconnection are used to connect two telcos’ networks to complete a phone call.
Trai had then said that Reliance Jio had placed its demand with the three operators well in advance, based on its subscriber and traffic projections, to ensure communication between subscribers of networks. Denying sufficient PoIs was anti-consumer, against public interest and aimed at stifling competition in the sector, Trai had then said."
312,2019-07-24,Reliance,"The decision today will set the ball rolling for operators' plans for launching such services in IndiaThe industry will watch out for whether the government will agree to lower spectrum prices

New Delhi: The Digital Communications Commission (DCC), the highest decision making authority at the Department of Telecommunications, is set to meet Wednesday to deliberate on the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai) suggestions on conducting upcoming auctions – the first for 5G airwaves.
This puts the spotlight on the country’s roadmap for rollout of next generation wireless technology which is set to boost data speeds and Internet of Things (IoT), resulting in industry altering changes for agriculture, manufacturing, healthcare, and education.
The decision today will set the ball rolling for operators' plans for launching such services in India. The industry will keenly watch out for the government’s decision on lowering spectrum prices.
This will be the first time the commission will meet after the telecom regulator on 8 July said it would stick to its earlier stand on pricing for next spectrum auctions, as it believes that the auction is an open process and players other than existing licencees could also participate.
This caused a setback to debt laden telecom companies which have been clamouring for lower spectrum prices.
The regulator’s response came after the commission last month sought a comprehensive review of the Trai’s recommendations on upcoming spectrum auctions, including reserve prices.
The government’s call to review came with an aim to ensure greater competition, sale of all spectrum and bringing the benefits of 5G to social sector. The government is keen to conduct the auction this year. It is also worried that the demand for spectrum is likely to be subdued due to consolidation in the market as currently there are effectively three private telecom service providers.
The sector saw intense disruption after Reliance Jio’s entry in September 2016 pulled down data prices to rock bottom and made voice calls free. This forced other operators to match tariffs, which saw many shutting shop or being acquired by bigger players. Now, the market is essentially left to Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Jio.
The government had last month also urged the telecom regulator to review its suggestions so that the entire spectrum which is put for auction is sold rather than having a situation where large quantum of spectrum remains unsold.
In August, Trai said the 3,300-3,600 MHz band, expected to be the primary band for 5G services, should be auctioned as a single band and in blocks of 20MHz each at Rs492 crore per megahertz. While Bharti Airtel Ltd has said these prices are exorbitant and it would not participate in an auction held at these prices, Vodafone Idea Ltd has suggested the 5G auction take place in 2020.
In South Korea, the same band was priced at roughly Rs131 crore per megahertz in auctions held in June last year.
The government did not auction any spectrum in fiscals 2017-18 and 2018-19. In 2016-17, the government had raised  ₹65,789 crore through spectrum sale, a fraction of the Rs5.63 trillion worth of spectrum, at base price, it had put up for sale. While the total spectrum put up for sale was 2,354.44MHz across seven bands, the government managed to auction just 965MHz."

MUMBAI :
Fitch Ratings has downgraded the Long Term Issuer Default Rating of Tata Motors Ltd (TML) to “BB-"" from “BB"". The ratings agency has also removed the automaker’s previous Rating Watch Negative (RWN) status, given to it on 6 February, as the outlook has turned negative on the concerns around TML’s profitability and free cash flow over the next 2-3 years.
TML’s downgrade follows a similar action on Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc on 16 July wherein the British carmaker too was given the BB- rating with a negative outlook.
Although Fitch noted that TML is likely to invest to consolidate its long-term competitiveness, it said it has revised the estimates due to increased business risks for the automaker’s India operations as well as for its JLR unit.
“This will result in sustained deterioration in TML’s financial profile, including its leverage,"" said Fitch in its report, which has rated TML on a consolidated basis including 100% of JLR.
TML’s heavy reliance on JLR has been a long-standing worry for investors. JLR contributed about 75% of TML’s consolidated revenue in FY19, thus dragging the parent’s profitability and free cash generation.
JLR, which is heavily impacted by the slowdown in demand for luxury passenger cars and sport-utility vehicles in China, already stands at the risk of stringent emission regulations in Europe and other global markets. Diesel variants contribute a sizable amount to JLR’s sales in Europe. On the electric vehicle front, JLR plans to offer EV variants for all of its existing models by 2020. However, Fitch report points out that any unexpected delays in the introduction of EVs could dampen JLR’s sales performance.
“In particular, JLR’s large investments to keep up with trends in emission regulations, alternative drive trains, automation and shared mobility, have magnified the underlying risk to TML’s cash flows and leverage,"" according to Fitch.
Meanwhile, for TML, the domestic market continues to be a key concern amid slowing sales of passenger as well as commercial vehicles. TML’s cumulative sales for the domestic market for Q1FY20 fell 20% at 131,879 units from 164,579 units a year earlier.
TML’s group global wholesales, which includes sales of JLR vehicles, fell 5% in June to 95,503 units. Last month, TML indicated a bigger concern for its commercial vehicle business as it recorded a 12% decline at 38,846 vehicles, including Tata Daewoo range on the group wholesales. Global wholesales of all passenger vehicles in June 2019 were at 56,657 units, up 1% YoY.
“We expect India’s auto sales volumes to stabilize gradually with the re-election of the government in May 2019, but prolonged weakness in sales would exert further pressure on leverage,"" Fitch said.
It is important to, however, note that TML’s standalone credit profile (SCP) rating is ‘B+’, which reflects its smaller scale and limited diversification when compared to its global peers. Fitch expects TML’s financial profile to remain weak on the back of expanding product range and production capabilities in a tough market scenario, incoming BS VI emission norms, price increases and other factors."

316,2019-07-24,Reliance,"Kapoor and family owned MCPL have been forced to pledge entire 7.34% stake with Reliance Nippon LifeRana Kapoor and MCPL hold 4.31% and 3.03% stake, respectively, in Yes Bank

Yes Bank co-promoters Rana Kapoor and his family owned firm Morgan Credits Pvt. Ltd (MCPL) have been forced to pledge their entire 7.34% stake with Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd (RNAM), asset manager of Reliance Mutual Fund (MF). The move follows the mutual fund converting a previously unsecured loan into a secured loan.
As the bank’s stock has lost 80% over the past year, an unsecured loan availed by MCPL from RNAM through issuance of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) has been converted into a secured loan by creating a pledge on the entire 170.25 million shares held by Kapoor and MCPL.
The whole transaction lies shrouded in mystery. For one, it is odd for a mutual fund, which is a custodian of public funds, to lend unsecured funds to a private entity. Having secured the loans now, RNAM needs to disclose the structure of the transaction to the public shareholders because RNAM is a listed entity.
Kapoor and MCPL hold 4.31% and 3.03%, respectively, in Yes Bank. According to an exchange filing, Kapoor and MCPL have pledged their entire holdings in Yes Bank—100 million and 70.25 million shares, respectively—in favour of MCPL bond-holders.
Last year, MCPL had raised  ₹1,160 crore by issuing NCDs to RNAM. A prepayment of  ₹200 crore was made by MCPL to Reliance MF in November. The loan pact mandates that the value of Yes Bank shares (held by Kapoor and MCPL) should always be greater than double the loan outstanding.
It is not known whether there were other prepayments in the interim, or exactly how much MCPL owes Reliance MF as of 23 July. However, the value of the 170.25 million shares pledged on Monday is around  ₹1,410.19 crore.
The Yes Bank stock has been falling steadily since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) indicated in August that Kapoor’s term as the bank’s chief executive officer would not be renewed after January 2019. Since 20 August, Yes Bank shares have lost almost 80% to  ₹81.75 as of Monday on BSE.
“Over the last eight months, MCPL has successfully prepaid NCDs in excess of 30% of the outstanding amount (along with prepayment of proportionate accrued interest) well before the stipulated maturity repayment date (both principal and interest on the NCD is due only on maturity in April 2021),"" said an MCPL release on Tuesday.
“In order to enhance the credit structure of the NCD by migrating from unsecured NCD to secured NCD, MCPL and Rana Kapoor have now pledged their respective shareholdings in Yes Bank,"" said MCPL.
Both MCPL and Yes Capital (India) Pvt. Ltd are fully owned by Kapoor’s three daughters.
In September 2018, after Yes Bank’s other co-promoter Madhu Kapur sold a part of her holding, Rana Kapoor had posted on Twitter, terming his shares as “diamonds"".
To be sure, there is nothing illegal about loans against shares. However, this particular form of secured lending by corporates, especially from mutual funds or insurance companies has drawn the attention of regulators after some defaults and delayed repayments hurt investors.
A Reliance MF spokesperson, while confirming that MCPL had prepaid certain amounts of the loan and the borrowing is adequately secured as per transaction documents, with no covenant breaches as on date, said: “The rating has been reaffirmed recently. A conversion to pledged structure strengthens the structure and is in fact in favour of Reliance MF investors.

308,2019-07-25,Reliance,"The rupture of trust between the US and China offers an opportunity India should not squander

The Trump Administration’s decision to blacklist Huawei and cut off access to western software and chip technologies has been called China’s Sputnik moment. It will now galvanize China to develop its own independent technology infrastructure. Commentator Fareed Zakaria has suggested that this may be America’s Sputnik moment too, finally spurring it to wean itself off Chinese suppliers and outcompete China.
This rupture of trust and relationships is no ordinary trade spat over cars or soybeans. It could result in a new cold war, a bipolar tech world with two hermetically walled-off technology ecosystems. This would have seismic consequences for companies and countries everywhere. Already companies are scrambling to rethink their supply chains, their procurement strategies, and potentially relocate manufacturing. This rupture is starting with electronic hardware but could spread across many more products.
Depending on how it plays out, this trade war could be an extraordinary opportunity for India and our new government. Many American firms and potentially even European and Japanese companies will be looking for new countries and new suppliers to source from. They will also need to find new markets since they may no longer be welcome in China. Equally, Chinese companies will need to find new markets to reduce their reliance on America. With our size and capabilities, India is a natural prize for both sets of firms.
We are already seeing this in tech. India is the largest market outside China for smartphone vendors like Xiaomi, OnePlus and Lenovo. It is also a must-win market for US tech companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon, which find themselves shut out of China. Chinese firms Alibaba, Tencent and Bytedance are some of the biggest investors in Indian internet startups like Ola, PayTM, Swiggy and Big Basket.
The fight is not just for market and revenue share but also for data-share in a world where “data may be the new oil"". India must have a strategy to benefit from all this interest rather than unwittingly become a battleground and victim of the proxy-war between these tech titans. Currently we do not nor do we have many significant Indian firms beyond Reliance Jio in the game, which is a grave risk.
The trade war can also breathe new life into Indian manufacturing. No large country has become prosperous without a substantial manufacturing sector and this has been a major challenge for India. Many experts have concluded that unlike Japan, Korea and China, the window of opportunity for export-led growth has closed for India. President Trump may have just flung the windows wide open again.
However, opportunity is one thing, speed and execution are another. The fact is that despite substantial progress on our Ease of Doing Business ranking, and the Make in India initiative, India may be losing ground on manufacturing competitiveness to an array of countries including Mexico, Vietnam (electronics, footwear and machinery) and Bangladesh (textiles and garments) whose exports have soared even as ours have shrunk.
India has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to accomplish amazing things when there is a clear mission, political will, strong leadership and effective partnership between policy makers and industry. The emergence of Indian IT and pharma firms as globally competitive players, and more recent progress in areas such as Aadhaar, digital payments and data connectivity, shows that nothing is impossible. Political will and leadership must breathe new life into Make in India. This time, Make in India is not just Make ‘for India’ but ‘for the world’.
The idea of having an industrial policy is sometimes viewed with suspicion because it can translate into protectionism and poor outcomes for customers and the country. Nevertheless, we will need a robust industrial policy. Such a policy should focus on enhancing our competitiveness sector-by-sector, especially labour intensive industries like garments and footwear where India’s competitiveness has been declining.
Many experts have been pushing the idea of Special Economic Zones where the ease of doing business—acquiring land, obtaining environmental clearances and developing good infrastructure—is made dramatically friction-free. Such zones may be used as ‘sandboxes’ to experiment with reforms such as flexible labour laws before they are rolled out nationally.
Finally, India has to be marketed and both Indian and global firms must be wooed and encouraged intensely. In the now famous words of our Prime Minister, they have to be convinced that India is now dead-serious about converting red-tape into red-carpet.
The rupture of trust between America and China, and the consequent disruption of global supply chains, represents an opportunity that India cannot afford to squander. Is the new government listening?

NEW DELHI :
Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said state-run Saudi Aramco's talks with Reliance Industries to buy a minority stake in the Indian conglomerate's refining assets have not stalled.
""The two companies, Reliance and Aramco, are talking with a lot of goodwill, with good intention,"" al-Falih told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.
Reliance, controlled by Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani, operates the world's biggest refining complex with capacity to process 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil at Jamnagar.
State-owned Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer, plans to boost investment in refining and petrochemicals to secure new markets for its crude amid a recent demand slowdown.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that talks between the companies had hit a roadblock as Reliance was keen on a higher valuation.
But Falih, who met Indian oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan in New Delhi on Thursday, said he was 'optimistic' that a deal between the two companies would work out.
""We still see daylight. We will announce the terms when they are concluded,"" he said.
Aramco and the United Arab Emirates' national oil company ADNOC teamed up with state-run Indian refiners last year in a plan to build a 1.2 million barrel per day refinery.
But the plan has faced delays as farmers refused to surrender land, forcing the Maharashtra government to find a new location.
India has invited Saudi Arabia to help build its strategic petroleum reserves, Pradhan tweeted after his meeting with Falih.
Pradhan asked Saudi Arabia to continue to ensure balance in oil markets, and raised concerns over disturbances in the Strait of Hormuz affecting the movement of crude and gas tankers.
Saudi is the second biggest oil supplier to India after Iraq.
Falih said the kingdom will supply additional oil to India if required. New Delhi has suspended purchases of Iranian oil from May, under pressure from US sanctions against Tehran's nuclear programme."

Vodafone Idea is expected to narrow its loss in the June quarter as it reaps synergies from the merger of brands Idea and Vodafone completed in August last year in order to survive in an intense telecom battleground where it fights rivals Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel.
Vodafone Idea’s average revenue per user (ARPU) is also expected to improve for the third consecutive quarter on the back of minimum monthly recharge plans it rolled out for users in November.
ARPU is the total revenue of the operator divided by the subscriber base. Vodafone Idea counts only paying users to calculate ARPU.
The company will announce its earnings for the June quarter later today. Rival Jio posted a net profit of  ₹891 crore, up 45.6% year on year. Airtel will announce its financial results on 1 August.
Vodafone Idea’s topline has continued to remain under pressure after Jio’s entry in September 2016 brought down tariffs to rock-bottom. However, it is still the largest operator in India, by revenue and by subscriber base.
Motilal Oswal expects Vodafone Idea to see 6% quarter-on-quarter jump in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) led by synergy gains.
Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, who had announced their merger in March 2017, completed the exercise in August 2018 and are currently undergoing an integration exercise to create synergies which would bring down costs of operating networks.
Kotak Institutional Equities expects the company’s average revenue per user to rise to of  ₹114. It was  ₹104 in the March quarter,  ₹89 in the December quarter and  ₹88 in the September quarter. Despite the growth, the company’s ARPU is behind both Airtel and Jio.
“The company is expected to post a net loss of  ₹4,540 crore,"" ICICI Securities said in a note dated 8 July.
Vodafone Idea had incurred a net loss of  ₹4,881.9 crore in the March quarter, down from  ₹5,004.6 crore in the December quarter."

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio is the biggest mobile tower client for state-owned firms BSNL and MTNL, Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad informed Parliament on Wednesday.
""BSNL and MTNL have rented out 13,051 and 392 mobile tower sites respectively to private telecom service providers,"" of which Jio has rented 8,307 sites from BSNL and 137 from MTNL, as per the data shared by Prasad in the Lok Sabha.
BSNL has rented out 2,761 towers to Airtel, 892 to Vodafone, 941 to Idea Cellular and 127 to Sify, according to the data.
""Monthly rental charges claimed by BSNL varies from  ₹21,000 to  ₹38,700 and for MTNL from  ₹30,000 to  ₹1,50,000. Mostly private TSPs are paying rent on time. However, in case of any delay in payment, BSNL and MTNL regularly follow up the matter and take actions for early payment and to effect recoveries,"" Prasad said."
303,2019-07-27,Reliance,"Three years ago, Reliance Jio entered the telecom sector which rock-bottom tariffsRecently, Jio overtook rival Bharti Airtel to become the country’s second largest operator in terms of mobile phone subscribers

Not very long ago, India had a booming telecom industry, with a dozen operators battling for market share in this billion user market.
But three years ago, Reliance Jio entered the sector which rock-bottom tariffs. A brutal tariff war started, which kicked several operators out of the race to provide wireless services and left many with battle scars. Today, just two other private operators, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are left to compete with Jio.
Earlier this week, Jio overtook rival Bharti Airtel to become the country’s second largest operator in terms of mobile phone subscribers.
Vodafone Idea retains top spot in terms of subscriber base.
But if you compare India’s number one and number two players on metrics like profitability, revenue, 4G data users and the growth trend of the operators’ average revenue per user, the results that emerge boggle the mind.
For starters, Vodafone Idea, with the largest user base, made a net loss of  ₹4,874 crore in the June quarter, while Jio made a profit of  ₹891 crore. Both companies have priced mobile services at almost similar levels. To be sure, Vodafone Idea is in the midst of a merger integration exercise. The company believes that it is delivering on its stated strategy although the benefits are not yet visible in its topline. It also expects better financial performance going forward. But that depends on when tariffs improve in the market, and that call is clearly in Jio’s hands.
Take a second metric – revenue. Despite more subscribers, Vodafone Idea, which posted revenue of 11,269.9 crore, lags behind Jio which posted revenues of  ₹11,679 crore in the June quarter. Its other rival, Bharti Airtel, will announce its results on 1 August.
Third, Vodafone Idea had 84.8 million 4G subscribers as of 30 June. However, in comparison, Jio has 331.3 million 4G subscribers. Then again, Vodafone Idea’s subscriber base is a mix of 2G, 3G and 4G while Jio is a 4G-only operator.
The fourth metric is the most interesting. While Vodafone Idea’s average revenue per user is steadily climbing, Jio’s is dropping.
After Vodafone Idea rolled rout monthly minimum recharge plans for subscribers to stay on its network, its shrinking subscriber base has led to an improvement in average revenue per user (Arpu) to  ₹108 in the June quarter, from  ₹104 in the March quarter,  ₹89 in December and  ₹88 in September.
Average revenue per user is an operator’s total revenue divided by total subscriber base.
Jio, on the other hand, has shown the opposite trend for the last 6 quarters. Jio’s ARPU for the June 2019 quarter was at  ₹122, down from  ₹126.2 in the March 2019 quarter and  ₹130 in the December 2018 quarter. It was at its peak of Rs154 in the December 2017 quarter.
A declining ARPU means subscriber additions on the network outpace its growth in revenue. In other words, every incremental Jio user contributes less to the total revenue and for Vodafone Idea the quality of the user base is improving.
A clear picture of who wins this telecom war will emerge only when the dust settles in the battleground. Till then, customers can sit back and enjoy cheap data tariffs."

New Delhi: The government on Saturday told the telecom industry that it wants fair competition in the sector and will not encourage monopoly, while asking companies to prioritise quality of service and ensure ""robust involvement"" in 5G as well as a blueprint for the $5-trillion economy.
Telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who met industry honchos, also assured them of the government's full support on outstanding issues such as cut in levies and refunds.
""I spoke to them about the need for a robust involvement of the industry in 5G innovation, startups and creation of 5G products that can create India-specific patents. I said that in the $5-trillion economy target, 25% should be telecom's contribution,"" the minister said after meeting industry CEOs.
Prasad's first interaction with the industry after he took charge of the telecom portfolio comes at a time when the sector is reeling under severe financial stress with cumulative debt of over  ₹7 lakh crore. Saturday's meeting was attended by Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal, Vodafone Idea's Balesh Sharma, Reliance Jio board member Mahendra Nahata and BSNL chairman P K Purwar. 
Prasad said he had already taken up outstanding issues such as inputs tax credit and lowering of GST rate with the finance ministry, and said a proposal pertaining to the reduction of universal service obligation (USO) levy was also under the Telecom Department's consideration.
""I have asked companies to look at improving the quality of service. Also 43,000 villages are uncovered at present. I have told the industry to pool in their resources so that in one year, we can reach all the uncovered villages and they have agreed. The Department of Telecom (DoT) will provide all assistance,"" Prasad said.
The minister also asked companies to look at improving connectivity and digital ecosystem in religious sites such as Kedarnath and Badrinath. The minister assured the industry of its support on the issue of installation of telecom towers. The industry flagged the issue of lapsed bank guarantees, which they want returned and the ministry has asked the DoT to urgently look into the matter.
""I have assured them of three things...We want a fair competition. The government will not encourage any monopoly and will do its best to ensure ease of doing business,"" Prasad said.
The telecom sector is burdened with staggering debt levels and cut throat competition. Competition has only intensified since 2016, when Reliance Jio stormed into the market and offered lifetime free calls and cheap data. Jio's offerings forced rivals to slash rates, affecting profit margins. Since the launch, rivals have either teamed up via merger, resorted to acquisitions or folded up."

MUMBAI :
Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) will soon hire distributors to sell private-label brands owned by its retail unit through neighbourhood stores, as billionaire Mukesh Ambani aims to boost the contribution of the company’s consumer business, two people aware of the development said.
RIL will sell its store brands across categories such as staples, food, home and personal care and general merchandise, the people said on condition of anonymity. RIL sells these products through its retail stores under brand names such as Best Farms, Good Life, Masti Oye, Kaffe, Enzo, Mopz, Expelz and Home One.
Ambani, India’s richest man, wants to reduce the company’s reliance on the energy business. He expects the consumer businesses to contribute nearly as much to RIL’s overall earnings as the energy and refining businesses by 2025. As part of this strategy, RIL is taking on online retailers such as Amazon and Flipkart in the e-commerce segment and the likes of Hindustan Unilever Ltd and ITC Ltd in the offline segment.
“RIL is planning to appoint FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) distributors on a trial basis,"" said one of the two people cited above.
“A network of FMCG dealers will help RIL meet the logistics and delivery needs from online channels,"" said the second person cited above. RIL did not respond to an email sent on Friday.
After its fiscal first-quarter earnings on 19 July, RIL executives told investors that the company’s telecom arm, Jio, is likely to roll out its new commerce/kirana initiative and the fibre-to-the-home business this fiscal.
According to the people cited above, the commercial launch of these services is scheduled at the company’s annual general meeting on 12 August.
In the past, RIL has often chosen its annual meetings to make strategic announcements and release new products. While the JioPhone was launched at the 2017 AGM, 2018 saw the launch of JioPhone 2 and the unveiling of JioGigaFiber.
In April, Reliance Retail began testing its food and grocery app among a select group of users, largely comprising its employees. The company has also on-boarded local kirana stores in metro cities to receive orders from customers.
Reliance Retail operates neighbourhood stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets, wholesale, specialty and online stores. RIL has also initiated a pilot for assisted e-commerce at Jio Stores wherein store staff will take orders and the customer can collect/return orders from a Jio Store, RIL told analysts in a presentation on 19 July.
For its e-commerce venture, RIL has signed up local merchants offering them an O2O (online-to-offline) marketplace, a business model pioneered by the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Under the O2O model, a consumer searches for the product or services online but buys it through an offline channel.
RIL plans to consolidate merchants under an e-commerce platform. The merchants, in turn, will cater to the demand. This will help the company save costs and enter areas currently outside the traditional purview of e-commerce companies."

NEW DELHI :
About a year after its unveiling in the company's last annual general meeting (AGM), Reliance Industries is likely to launch Jio GigaFiber services soon, according to a report. Based on fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) technology, Reliance Jio GigaFiber is a combo service that bundles broadband, landline and TV connections. Just like Reliance Jio, which became India's top mobile service operator in just three years, Jio GigaFiber is also expected to be a market disruptor with its cheap pricing plans.
The commercial launch of fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) services is likely to be announced during RIL AGM on August 12, according to a recent report in The Hindu.
Having announced its decision to lay FTTH network for its broadband services across 1,600 cities in India, Jio is yet to announce its pricing plans. The telecom operator has been conducting trial runs and preview offers since the last few months.
Reliance Jio GigaFiber broadband, TV, landline plan:
Reliance Jio GigaFiber will offer broadband at the speed of 1 gigabytes per second (gbps), 600 TV channels and a landline connection -- all for a monthly subscription price of just  ₹600, Mint had earlier reported.
As indicated on its website, Jio GigaFiber plans will be available both in prepaid and postpaid options.
Jio users will also have to pay a security deposit of  ₹4,500 to get the ONT device (GigaHub Home Gateway) provided by the operator. The deposit will be refunded if the customer chooses to discontinue using the Jio GigaFiber services.
The ONT device will act as the router for the broadband service.
What's on offer now:
Currently, Reliance Jio is running a broadband preview plan which gives ultra-high-internet speed of up to 100 Mbps free for a limited period. Under the preview offer, there are no installation charges but there is a refundable security deposit of  ₹2,500 for the ONT device.
Jio Gigafiber speed:
Reliance Jio has promised that its broadband service will offer a minimum of 1 Mbps speed that will go upto 1 Gbps. A recent survey report has already crowned Jio GigaFiber as India's No. 1 internet service provider in terms of speed. In February 2019, Netflix ISP Speed Index report found that Reliance Jio GigaFiber was running at a speed of 3.61 Mbps.
Reliance Jio had recently sought suggestions from users of its MyJio app on what should be the name of its broadband service. Users were given three options to choose from: JioFiber, JioHome and JioGigaFiber."

In 1998, Aruna Sundararajan set up Kerala’s first ever department of information technology (IT). The exercise, which laid the foundation for the state’s digital journey, was a result of her incessant efforts in convincing the then chief minister E K Nayanar that the IT revolution was inevitable and needed a dedicated separate department.
That was 21 years ago.
After an eventful career, Sundararajan retires on Wednesday after helming the central government’s department of telecommunications through the choppy seas left in the wake of Reliance Jio’s entry in September 2016.
The 1982-batch Kerala Cadre IAS officer’s tryst with technology is not new. As the state’s founding IT Secretary, in 2002, she conceived and spearheaded the Akshaya project, an e-literacy project where over 1 million people were trained in basic digital skills on a campaign mode. Akshaya had received domestic and international acclaim as a digital transformational project.
The state, no wonder, holds a special place in her heart. She grew up in the Nilgiri region and trekked through the Western Ghats on most of her holidays.
“When I joined the service somebody who I respect very much told me that the first thing you should do is cultivate a passion apart from the service. That will both enrich and bring a sense of perspective. That early advice I didn’t realise how valuable it was but over the years I have seen that particularly in this kind of service where the pressures are fairly high, the responsibilities are also vast, it is essential to at least one other passion and for me that is trekking,"" Sundararajan had told Mint in a candid interview last year.
Sundararajan has spend over three decades with the government where she held key positions in economic and development administration, investment promotion and IT/telecom.
While she spearheaded the government’s Digital India programme during her time at the ministry of electronics and information technology, her most important role, however, has been as secretary of department of telecommunications since June 2017.
During her tenure, the industry saw intense disruption, shrinking revenue streams, companies going bankrupt, and intense consolidation in the sector. At that same time, she also rolled out the National Digital Communications Policy in May last year which aims to attract $100 billion in investments into India by 2022 and create 4 million jobs apart from providing broadband to all.
During the final stages of drafting the policy, Sundararajan worked till the wee hours of the morning. When work piled up, she took small breaks in her vegetable garden at her South Moti Bagh residence and listened to music. Her successor, 1986 batch IAS officer Anshu Prakash will now oversee the execution of the policy.
Sundararajan also headed the department at a time when telecom companies complained that the government was extracting too much from companies who were expected to pay huge prices for spectrum, especially given the government’s plan to hold the first auction for 5G airwaves this year.
“What things have to be fought in the market have to be fought in the market. What has to be done by government will be done by government. Protecting government interest and public policy interest is our priority and protecting market share is their priority. These two things, the dynamic will have to play out,"" she told reporters on Tuesday, a day before her retirement.
At her retirement, Sundararajan is confident that the worst is behind the sector and it will thrive because telecom is a key utility and in fact new players could also enter the market.
“We cannot predict the future, but the telecom pipes have to be there. There will be a convergence of powerful interests that make sure investments go into the carriage business,"" she said on Tuesday.
Not many know that she is also a Bharatnatyam dancer and trained in south Indian classical music. She loves to listen to jazz as well. “For me, the love of the arts has been a big anchor. Although I am a trained dancer, I have not really had the time to keep up with my dancing... trekking is something that I wish I could do it much more often,"" she had said last year.
“I can’t wait to retire so that I can travel the world and go on treks. That would be my number one desire. We bureaucrats have the tendency to really overrate and overestimate how important and central we are to the scheme of things. Travelling brings a great sense of perspective and tells you exactly where you belong.""

Bharti Airtel Ltd, which was India’s largest operator till a year ago, will announce its June quarter earnings on Thursday, but the day will be more significant for its arch rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which is expected to be crowned the number one telco.
With Bharti’s revenue unlikely to exceed that of Reliance Jio, India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani will have achieved a rare feat with his telecom company grabbing the top spot in the market in less than three years of starting operations.
Last week, Jio, for the first time, surpassed Vodafone Idea Ltd in terms of operating revenue. Despite more subscribers, Vodafone Idea, which posted revenue of  ₹11,269.9 crore in the June quarter, lagged behind Reliance Jio’s  ₹11,679 crore.
In the March quarter, Bharti Airtel’s India mobile business generated  ₹10,632 crore. Top brokerages expect Airtel India mobile revenue to grow just 1-2% sequentially in the June quarter.
“Indian wireless revenues (for Bharti Airtel) are expected to grow 1.7% quarter-on-quarter to  ₹10,810 crore,"" ICICI Securities said in a report dated 8 July.
The brokerage expects Airtel’s Indian wireless business to witness muted net subscriber addition of 1.1 million given the weakness in wireless broadband subscriber addition.
Motilal Oswal, too, expects Airtel’s India wireless revenue to grow by a meagre 1.1% sequentially to  ₹10,750 crore.
With Airtel’s June quarter results to be announced on Thursday, the dust will settle in the telecom battleground with Reliance Jio likely to emerge as the market leader from its challenger position three years ago.
Jio entered the telecom sector in September 2016 with cheap data plans and affordable handsets, which led to an unprecedented rise in mobile data consumption in the country, with an average user consuming 11 GB data per month.
While the telecom industry also witnessed intense disruption, shrinking revenue streams, bankruptcy and, finally, consolidation, the last three years have been monumental as 4G coverage soared and became a catalyst for the growth of mobile data and new applications and services, especially in the content ecosystem.
Earlier this month, Reliance Jio overtook rival Bharti Airtel to become the country’s second largest operator in terms of mobile phone subscribers. Jio had 322.98 million users and 27.8% subscriber market share, against Airtel’s 320.38 million users and 27.6% market share as of end-May, according to data from Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.
The leadership position is also significant for Jio as it would allay concerns about the company not raising tariffs even as it reinvents itself as a technology platform.
At last year’s annual general meeting, Ambani had said that digital platforms were becoming the new-age factories and that Reliance was embarking on a golden decade.
“As the golden decade rolls on, our consumer businesses will contribute nearly as much to the overall earnings of the company as our energy and petrochemical businesses,"" he said on 5 July last year.
Reliance has invested over  ₹2.5 trillion in building mobile and broadband infrastructure across the country.
Ambani’s next big bet is on fibre-to-the-home offerings. Termed JioGigaFiber, it is touted to be the largest green field rollout of wired broadband services, covering 1,600 cities in India. It is also working on creating a hybrid, online-to-offline new commerce platform by integrating Reliance’s retail and telecom offerings. Details on these products are expected at Reliance’s upcoming annual general meeting on 12 August."
296,2019-08-01,Reliance,"Bharti Airtel posts  ₹2,866 crore loss in Q1FY20, against  ₹97 crore profit in the year earlierRevenue from India wireless business grew 4.1% year-on-year to  ₹10,724 crore

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel Ltd posted its first quarterly loss in 14 years amid a brutal price war unleashed by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd that has ravaged its rivals and reshaped India’s telecom market.
New Delhi-based Bharti Airtel swung to a  ₹2,866 crore loss in the quarter ended 30 June from a net profit of  ₹97 crore in the year earlier as finance costs rose and it incurred a one-time loss of  ₹1,445 crore.
Bharti Airtel, which was till last year India’s biggest telecom operator, has been struggling to raise prices and add subscribers because of the tariff war, although a wave of consolidation in India’s telecom market has wiped out smaller telcos and forced Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd to merge.
“The pressure on Airtel will continue as it has to incur the cost of managing multiple networks given its users are also on 2G and 3G. This hurts Airtel’s economics in the short run,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India.
Bharti Airtel’s consolidated revenue from operations grew 4.7% to  ₹20,738 crore in the June quarter from  ₹19,799 crore a year ago. Revenue from the India wireless business grew 4.1% year-on-year to  ₹10,724 crore.
Reliance Jio generated  ₹11,679 crore in operating revenue in the June quarter, beating Bharti Airtel on this metric. Last week, Jio surpassed Vodafone Idea Ltd, which posted revenue of  ₹11,269.9 crore despite having more users.
With this, Reliance Jio is now the number one telco in terms of revenue, achieving the rare feat of market leadership in the telecom industry in less than three years of starting its operations in September 2016.
The results also underscore the sustained struggle of Bharti Airtel and other Indian telecom operators to stay profitable despite recording higher data and voice consumption. An average Airtel user consumed 12GB of data a month in the June quarter, compared to 7.8GB in the year-ago period.
Consolidated operating profit rose 24.2% to  ₹8,493 crore from a year earlier. The company’s India wireless business posted a loss of  ₹1,242 crore in the June quarter. Airtel’s consolidated net debt was  ₹1.16 trillion as of June-end.
The silver lining for the firm is that its average monthly revenue per user (Arpu) from India mobile services rose to  ₹129 in the June quarter from  ₹123 in the preceding three months. This is also due to the fact that its subscriber base has shrunk.
Airtel’s Arpu is the highest across telcos in the June quarter, with Jio at  ₹122 and Vodafone Idea at  ₹108.
“The India business revenue is stable, Arpu is up and 4G base has also increased. These are positive factors,"" said a Mumbai-based fundamental analyst, requesting anonymity.
The launch of low-cost tariff plans by Reliance Jio, a unit of Reliance Industries Ltd, forced rivals to drop their rates, hurting profit margins. Smaller companies were forced to either shut shop or get acquired, leaving just Airtel, Jio and the merged entity of Vodafone and Idea to compete in the Indian market.
The performance of the firm’s Africa unit has proved to be a beacon of hope. Airtel Africa posted revenue of $795.9 million, a 6.9% rise from $744.5 million a year earlier, largely driven by growth in Nigeria and East Africa.
The Africa operations posted a profit of $132.2 million in the June quarter."
295,2019-08-02,Reliance,"Bharti Airtel’s total data customer base grew 4.3% last quarter, while Vodafone Idea’s data users fell 2%Airtel’s operating profit or Ebitda dropped only by 1.8%

Bharti Airtel Ltd’s June quarter results will bring relief to investors, especially after the shocking results of Vodafone Idea Ltd. Revenue at Airtel’s mainstay India wireless business grew for the second consecutive quarter. They are up 2.2% from March quarter, on the back of a 4.3% sequential expansion in the March quarter.
In comparison, revenues at Vodafone Idea had fallen 4.3%, and resulted in a 22% drop in operating profit on a like-to-like basis. In Airtel’s case, operating profit or Ebitda dropped only by 1.8%. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
""Bharti’s ahead-of-Vodafone Idea network investments, slightly better quality of subscriber base, and some success of its loyalty/partnership program (Airtel Thanks) are all playing a role on Bharti’s superior relative performance to Vodafone Idea,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients.
Drill down further and it becomes clear why Airtel has handled the onslaught of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd much better. To start with, the fall in its subscriber base is far lower than Vodafone Idea’s.
Importantly, the expansion in mobile broadband towers is better at Airtel, where they rose 2.6% to 177,141 towers. Vodafone Idea saw a mere rise of 1.1% to 157,278 towers.
Note that Vodafone Idea’s revenue is ahead of Airtel’s, even while its broadband coverage is lower. It isn’t surprising then that Airtel’s total data customer base grew 4.3% last quarter, while Vodafone Idea’s data users fell 2%.
Data usage per customer has seen notable improvement— up 8% vis-à-vis 4.9% in March quarter. As a consequence, the improvement in realization, also known as average revenue per user, is also better at Airtel.
Now that Airtel has reported a steady performance for its India wireless business, it is evident that Vodafone Idea’s underperformance can be explained by company-specific issues. The mega-merger and the time taken to integrate teams and networks have weighed on the latter’s performance.
It is not yet clear how Airtel customers are reacting to minimum recharge plans. Vodafone Idea’s experience with the minimum recharge plans has not been encouraging, forcing the company to alter the plans. It is also not yet clear if the pace of down-trading in post-paid segment has slowed at Airtel. Prima facie, Airtel appears to have handled these pressures better.
Meanwhile Airtel Africa, the other key business segment, reported a steady quarter with revenue and operating profit growing slightly from the March quarter.
While key operating metrics of the India business show incremental improvement, much depends on market repair. Capital expenditure remains elevated and earnings expansion remains a challenge. “Although we think Bharti is better positioned than incumbents, we believe recovery is still some way off. The key for Bharti, in our view, will be an improvement in pricing, which remains elusive. Jio has said it does not feel the need to change ARPU (average revenue per user) currently. We expect competitive intensity in the India business to stay high over the next 12 months,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in 28 July note."
294,2019-08-02,Reliance,"The company started the process last month, when it wound down the 3G network in the Kolkata circleAirtel will shut down 6-7 circles by September and the entire pan-India network by March

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel will shut down its 3G network across India’s 22 telecom circles by March 2020, and increase its focus on providing 4G services, a top company official said.
The company started the process last month, when it wound down the 3G network in the Kolkata circle. It, however, continues to provide 2G services for feature phone users.
“This has worked very well in Kolkata. Now we will do this process across India. By September, we will shut down six to seven circles and by March, the entire 3G network pan-India will shut down,"" Bharti Airtel chief executive Gopal Vittal said in the post-earnings call with analysts on Friday.
This marks the first phase-out of the 3G technology in India, which is now increasingly moving to 4G, triggered by the entry of 4G-only Reliance Jio in September 2016. Rival Vodafone Idea continues to provide 2G, 3G and 4G services.
In Kolkata, Airtel has reformed the 900MHz spectrum band, used for 3G, to strengthen its 4G network. The telecom operator is deploying L900 technology in the 900MHz band to complement its 4G services in the 2300MHz and 1800MHz bands.
The move, Airtel expects, will improve 4G availability inside buildings and coverage across homes in Kolkata.
However, the company does not expect much cost savings by shutting down 3G as it would continue to use the same equipment to offer 4G services. “Our capex will continue for deployment of new sites and some loading on 2300MHz band,"" Vittal said.
On Thursday, Airtel Ltd posted its first quarterly loss in 14 years amid a brutal price war unleashed by Reliance Jio. Airtel swung to a  ₹2,866 crore loss in the quarter ended 30 June from net profits of  ₹97 crore in the year earlier, as finance costs rose and it incurred a one-time loss of  ₹1,445 crore.
However, its consolidated revenue from operations grew 4.7% to  ₹20,738 crore in the June quarter from  ₹19,799 crore a year ago. Revenue from its Indian wireless business grew 4.1% year-on-year to  ₹10,724 crore. Airtel’s consolidated net debt was  ₹1.16 trillion as of June-end.

293,2019-08-02,Reliance,"Amazon had made the proposal to Reliance for the partnershipPotential partnership could help counter Flipkart

NEW DELHI :
Amazon.com Inc is in talks with Reliance Industries Ltd's retail unit to buy a stake in India's biggest brick-and-mortar retailer, two sources with knowledge of the talks told Reuters on Friday.
Amazon's massive online presence could help bolster Reliance's consumer and private labels business. More importantly, a potential partnership will help the duo counter Walmart, which last year invested $16 billion in India's Flipkart, in their battle for a bigger share of India's fast-growing e-commerce market.
In late December, India modified rules around foreign direct investment (FDI) in e-commerce, creating additional hurdles for companies such as Amazon and Flipkart, and giving companies such as Reliance an edge.
Amazon had made the proposal to Reliance for the partnership, but it was not clear whether a deal would materialize, said one of the sources.
The second source said Amazon had been pondering a proposal to purchase an up to 26% stake in the Reliance unit since at least February.
""For Amazon, it is about neutralizing a major rival and allowing itself to grow,"" said the second source, who added the company envisions helping Reliance's roughly 40 brands and grocery products go online.
Further details of the possible deal, first reported by India's Economic Times newspaper on Thursday, were not immediately clear.
Amazon and Reliance did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. Amazon had on Thursday declined to comment, while Reliance had said it would make any disclosures to stock exchanges as and when necessary.
Reliance could potentially leverage Amazon's global experience in technology, supply chain and logistics as it aims to connect grocery stores across the country digitally through its Jio telecoms network - the biggest in India by subscribers.
For Amazon, picking up a stake in a Reliance unit could mean getting access to the Jio telecoms platform and its vast retail footprint of more than 10,600 stores across India. It might also add more firepower to their lobbying efforts, as the Ambani family is viewed as being well-connected politically.
Seattle-based Amazon is keen to get a bigger share of India's e-commerce market, which Deloitte expects to more than treble to $84 billion between 2017 and 2021. Reliance was previously in talks with China's Alibaba to sell a stake in Reliance Retail, but a deal could not be sealed due to differences in valuation, according to a person familiar with the matter."
292,2019-08-03,Reliance,"AI, virtual assistance and mobile applications are significantly reducing the time to process insurance claimsInsurers give discounts in insurance policies by tracking lifestyle activities

MUMBAI :
Paper work and insurance agents have long been the foundation stones for your insurance policies. However, insurers have used technology along various steps of the insurance services value chain: from the application to claim-processing stage. Artificial intelligence, wearable devices, mobile applications, virtual assistance and video conferencing are replacing paperwork. Let’s take a deeper look at the benefits of these services and the challenges you face.
Artificial intelligence: Artificial intelligence (AI) first entered insurance through chat bots. Some insurers have now integrated use of AI on Whatsapp. For instance, Reliance General Insurance Co Ltd has used AI by introducing Reliance Interactive Virtual Assistant (RIVA) which generates policy quotation, accepts claim intimation and provides policy copy on Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. It replaces human intervention and reduces time taken for claim processing. Through the use of AI and technology, queuing theories and smart analytics, HDFC Ergo General Insurance Co Ltd claims to have reduced the average time to 14 minutes from 3.8 hours.
Wearable devices: Insurers give discounts in insurance policies by tracking lifestyle activities. For example, ManipalCigna Health Insurance’s Get Proactiv is integrated with their Healthy Rewards Program allowing you to earn incentives by tracking your activities using select wearable devices. You can also directly enter non track-able activities into the application. Healthy reward points are then earned on the basis of the quantum of physical activity. The company uses these reward points to give you some discount on your premium, limited to a maximum of 10% of your annual premium.
Mobile applications: Some insurers allow you to upload your claim documents for a certain amount digitally. Bajaj Allianz General Insurance has a feature called Health – Claims By Direct Click (CDC), which allows you to submit documents through the mobile application ‘Insurance wallet’ for assessment and settlement. Through this you can receive claims of up to  ₹20,000 in two working days for admissible claims. Another health insurer’s mobile app, Max Bupa Health App by Max Bupa Health Insurance Company Ltd offers services available to those who have purchased Max Bupa’s Goactive policy. ‘Goactive customers’ can access services provided by the plan on the app – cashless OPD, diagnostics, purchasing medicines, personalised advice from fitness experts, health checks, behavioural assistance and second medical opinion in case of critical illnesses and more. Aditya Birla Health Insurance Company Ltd has an online cashless platform for OPD claims. “There is a centrally located team of experts who reach out to customers to resolve their queries and assist them during the course of hospitalisation,"" said Mayank Bathwal, CEO, ABHICL.
Video conferencing: One of the examples of this service is Motor On The Spot (Motor OTS) by Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company Ltd. “Normally, the claimant has to submit original hardcopies followed by a physical inspection of the vehicle,"" said Sasikumar Adidamu, chief technical officer, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance. Through Motor OTS, you need to upload the images of the damaged vehicle along with the requisite claim documents on the mobile application. The company using data analytics tool will recommend immediate liability to you and suggest a repair workshop within turnaround time of around 20 minutes. After your consent, the company will approve the claims payment which, the insurer claims, will get credited within 30 minutes into the your bank account. Some insurers also have a live video streaming facility. “Through our live video streaming feature for motor insurance claims, our workshops/customers can easily carry out self-inspections,"" said Santosh Menon, executive vice president and national head of claims personal lines, auto, Tata AIG General Insurance Co Ltd.
WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU
Experts believe these initiatives come as a relief . “From a customer standpoint, the process of submitting claims has become easier,"" said Naval Goel, founder, Policyx.com. The usage of AI has fastened things in all the three stages of the insurance value chain: Distribution and pricing, underwriting and policy issuance, and claim servicing. “AI-powered chat bots help in the application stage, and algorithms used in underwriting have brought down the time take for policy issuance,"" said Goel. However, such AI-powered services may face a glitch.
“An issue that you may face with AI-powered chat bots is if it may not give the exact answer you were looking and specific questions may be easier to convey to a human. However, this is still an evolving feature,"" said Mahavir Chopra, director – health, life and strategic initiatives, Coverfox.com."
291,2019-08-03,Reliance,"Airtel’s big focus now is to engage customers more on its network and drive data usageBharti Airtel is growing its India revenue and improving its quality of subscriber base

New Delhi: Earlier this month, Reliance Jio dethroned Bharti Airtel as the number two operator in terms of subscriber base. Jio has also became the number one operator by revenue in less than three years of operations, surpassing Vodafone Idea in the June quarter.
The turmoil in the telecom sector caused by Jio’s rock-bottom data tariffs and free voice calls, introduced in September 2016, has reshaped the Indian telecom market, leaving just two other private operators – the merged entity of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, and Bharti Airtel – to compete with it.
Analysts fear Vodafone Idea could be reduced to a regional operator given its mounting losses and shrinking revenue stream.
But Bharti Airtel, at the same time, is growing its India revenue and improving its quality of subscriber base.
Airtel reported a net loss of  ₹2,866 crore in the April-June quarter, its first in 14 years, but that was largely the result of a one-time exceptional expenditure. Airtel’s revenue from India wireless business grew 4.1% year-on-year to  ₹10,724 crore and customer churn was low.
In comparison, Vodafone Idea posted a net loss of  ₹4,873.9 crore, while its revenue fell 4.3% from the preceding quarter to  ₹11,269.9 crore in the June quarter.
Airtel has now sharpened its focus and is aiming for quality and not quantity of subscribers.
To upgrade users to 4G, and drive data usage it also plans to shut down its 3G network across India by March.
In fact, Airtel’s data consumption per user surpassed Jio for the second consecutive quarter. In the three months ended June, Airtel’s average data usage per month was 11.9 GB compared with Jio’s 11.4 GB.
By ensuring stickiness for better paying users on the network, Airtel has managed to post the highest average revenue per user across the three telcos at  ₹129, beating Jio at  ₹122 and Vodafone Idea at  ₹108. Average revenue per user is the total revenue of the operator divided by its subscriber base.
“We are happy to lose subscribers who don’t pay us money,"" Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal said in the post-earnings call with analysts on Friday.
To wean away inactive users from its network, the company had in November rolled out minimum monthly recharge plans starting  ₹35. As a result, there was some customer churn but its average revenue per user also rose.
Airtel’s big focus now is to engage customers more on its network and drive data usage.
In May this year, created a loyalty programme for its prepaid users called Airtel Thanks, similar to what airlines offer to flyers, under which subscribers can reap benefits based on their tariff plans and consumption of digital services on the Airtel network.
Airtel expects to achieve twin objectives of increasing its average revenue per user, which has been under pressure after Jio’s entry in September 2016, while getting them to avail more services as the telecom major embarks on its journey to morph into a digital platform.
This loyalty scheme will be refreshed in the next three months. Airtel has, however, not divulged the details on this.
Despite all these positives, the company continues to maintain that industry tariffs are unsustainably low and prices need to move up to ensure sector viability.
But for that to happen, it has to pray that rival Jio does not get too greedy."

284,2019-08-05,Reliance,"Stock also comes under heavy selling pressure on lower refining marginsCredit Suisse has slashed the stock’s target price and has downgraded it to underperform

Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) have fallen 17.9% since May, with the index heavyweight coming under heavy selling pressure. The stock fell 3.48% on Monday to close at  ₹1,143.00 on the BSE.
In May, the RIL stock fell 4.46%, followed by a 5.85% decline in June, and a 6.87% drop in July. This, despite the stock featuring on the radar of buyers from the start of this year. Since January, RIL has risen 2% thanks to a 10.68% gain in March—its biggest monthly increase this year.
In a report released on Monday, Credit Suisse downgraded the stock to underperform from neutral and slashed its target price. The brokerage said given RIL has been free cash flow (FCF) negative for six years and given margin pressure in refining and petrochemical (high supply), FCF is likely to be negative for FY20-21.
RIL’s total liabilities have already climbed to $65 billion in FY19 from $19 billion in FY15, comprising 40% of its enterprise value. Total interest cost has risen to $4 billion in FY19 from $1.2 billion in FY15.
Credit Suisse analysts cut RIL’s FY21/22 earnings per share (EPS) target by 5% to factor in lower refining and petrochemical margins. “Our enterprise value of $141 billion values refining at six times FY21 EV/EBITDA, petrochemical at seven times FY21, retail at 22 times FY21, Jio on eight times FY25,"" Credit Suisse analysts Anubhav Aggarwal and Sayantan Maji said in the report.
RIL’s burgeoning debt is also an overhang. In the last fiscal year, the company’s finance cost more than doubled to  ₹16,495 crore from  ₹8,052 crore in the previous year.
“The increase was primarily on account of the commencement of digital services business, petrochemical projects at Jamnagar and higher loan balances,"" RIL said in its annual report. The company made a capital expenditure of more than  ₹1.32 trillion in the last fiscal year. It ended the year with a gross debt of more than  ₹2.87 trillion. In the June quarter, RIL posted gross refining margins of $8.1 per barrel while its petchem production declined 10% quarter-on-quarter.
“We have not seen this kind of weakness in both refining and petrochemical margins probably in the last three-four years. Also, the first-quarter earnings were muted. The petrochemicals margins are under pressure even though they remain flattish because of their efficient cost. The fact is that from here on, growth is very difficult in the near term,"" said an analyst from a domestic brokerage, who declined to be named.
After RIL posted its June quarter results, analysts at Jefferies said that Q1FY20 was noisy, as expected, while core performance was soft, with lower refining margins, petchem volumes, and telecom average revenue per user (Arpu). In June quarter, Arpu for its telecom business came in at  ₹122. During the quarter, RIL’s revenue rose 22.1% from  ₹1.41 trillion in the year-ago period to  ₹1.72 trillion in the first quarter of fiscal 2019-20.
It had said that with FCF uncertain, EPS is at risk, and valuations rich, it has underperform rating with lower liabilities post the InvITs offset by lower EV in telecom and retail.
In July, Reliance closed a  ₹25,215 crore deal with Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management to sell its 49% stake in telecom tower assets, and for Brookfield to also take over the Tower Infrastructure Trust.
Currently, RIL has 22 buy ratings, 9 hold ratings and 5 sell ratings on Bloomberg."

Reliance Jio's aggressive posturing has begun to show the divergent impact on entrenched telcos, with Vodafone Idea getting impacted sharply and Bharti Airtel holding on, a report said on Monday.
The deep-pocketed Jio's entry has so far impacted all the telcos, forcing mergers and also bankruptcy filings.
For Vodafone Idea, it was the market share loss to Jio which proved to be the undoing and led to a weak numbers for the June quarter, Airtel could hold on, global rating agency Fitch said in a note.
The agency also estimated that Airtel, which has now begun the third biggest telco after Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea, to show operating profit growth in India this year on improvements in average revenue per user (ARPU), easing competition and cost savings.
It said Airtel's operating profit grew 7% during the June quarter as compared to the three months ending March on an ARPU growth and shift of more consumers to the 4G network.
Vodafone Idea's revenue slipped 4 per cent and operating profit was down 22 per cent during the same period, as it lost 14 million subscribers, it said.
In comparison, Jio posted revenue growth of 44 per cent and 37 per cent growth in operating profit, it said.
Internet experience is the key aspect which is influencing customers and not tariff where no differentials exist, it said, adding that Bharti and Vodafone-Idea are improving their 4G coverage.
Going forward, Telcos are likely to monetise their tower and fibre assets to deleverage and create financial flexibility, it said in the note that comes days after Jio announced a  ₹25,000 crore deal to sell tower assets to Brookfield.

Reliance Industries Ltd. agreed to buy an Indian technology startup funded by Google, scooping up an inventory-management platform and adding to the list of smaller deals the conglomerate has assembled to take on Amazon.com Inc.
Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s group agreed to buy a controlling stake in Shopsense Retail Technologies Pvt, which operates the Fynd platform, according to a statement dated August 2. The investment unit of Reliance will pay as much as 2.95 billion rupees ($42 million) in cash, with an option to plow in a further 1 billion rupees. Once completed by December 2021, the total investment would translate to an 87.6% stake, the company said.
Reliance is adding Fynd as part of its focus on consumer businesses and mobile phone services as growth areas for the sprawling energy-to-retail conglomerate. India’s largest retailer has said it intends to transform itself from a grocery and neighborhood store-based empire to an online powerhouse as India becomes a battleground for giants such as Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart Online Services Pvt.
Ambani’s Deals
Shopsense, which started out as an online fashion portal, has attracted investments from Alphabet Inc.’s Google, among others, and has shifted its focus to helping stores boost sales by managing inventory. Ambani has said the key to his e-commerce push will be empowering mom-and-pop retailers with technology to improve their sales and better serve customers.
The deal for Fynd, expected to be completed by December 2021, will enable the group’s digital and new commerce initiatives, according to the statement. The transaction doesn’t require regulatory approval, the company said.
Fynd, which was incorporated about seven years ago, had a 186.4 million rupee net loss in fiscal 2018 on sales of 48.4 million rupees, according to the statement.

MUMBAI :
Indian equity markets and the rupee fell on Monday amid political uncertainty in Jammu and Kashmir. The Indian currency also declined in the backdrop of speculation that Beijing may allow currency depreciation to counter US President Donald Trump’s latest tariff threat.
At 10am, the benchmark equity index Sensex slumped 1.7% or 621 points to 36,497.33, while Nifty declined 1.8% or 194 points to 10,803.90 points.
The rupee slipped 1.25% to 70.48 a dollar, its steepest fall since 11 December 2018. It closed at 69.60 on Friday. The domestic currency opened at 70.06 and touched a low of 70.60 a dollar. So far this year, it has declined 0.2%.
While there has been no direct statement from the Centre so far, all eyes will be on home minister Amit Shah’s visit to Kashmir in the wake of massive troop deployment in the Valley.
According to Sahaj Agarwal of Kotak Securities, Nifty breached a critical support of 11,000 points in the previous week. This indicates a lack of momentum in the markets and implies significant increase in downside risk. Next support is seen at 10,800 on monthly basis. Volatility is likely to persist in the near term. On the higher side, resistance is seen at 11,100. Midcap stocks have underperformed significantly in the recent past, and this is expected to continue.
The yuan plunged beyond 7 per dollar for the first time since 2008 after Trump abruptly escalated the trade war with new tariffs on Chinese goods. Beijing pledged to respond if the US goes ahead with a plan to impose a 10% tariff on a further $300 billion in Chinese imports.
""First, the Fed became the second major Central Bank (after ECB last week ) to disappoint markets, as it delivered a less than dovish cut of 25bp. To add to the woes, Trump announced another round of tariffs on the last remaining tranche of Chinese imports. China has already warned of retaliation and now all eyes will be on how China reciprocates, and everything else will likely take a backseat for now, in our view,"" said Nomura Research in a note.
""Geopolitical and trade tensions continue to rise, with the US withdrawing from a nuclear treaty with Russia , North Korea conducting another missile test, and Japan-South Korea threatening to remove each other from trade whitelists, which could further dampen the growth outlook for the region,"" Nomura Research added.

New Delhi: Eight years after they partnered to produce hydrocarbons in India, Reliance Industries Ltd and British oil major BP Plc have come together again to open a nationwide network of fuel retailing outlets.
The outlets will be set up through a new joint venture company that will be owned 51% by RIL and the remainder by BP, according to a joint statement issued by the companies. The partnership will also market aviation turbine fuel to cater to India’s growing aviation industry.
Together, the companies plan to set up 5,500 fuel retail stations across the country, which may include the 1,378 retail outlets RIL independently runs across India at present.
RIL and BP did not disclose the investments in the new venture. They also did not provide a time frame for setting up the outlets.
Mint had on 6 December 2016 reported that the two companies may join hands to build a retail network in India.
“Building on Reliance’s existing Indian fuel retailing network and an aviation fuel business, the partners expect the venture to expand rapidly to help meet the country’s fast-growing demand for energy and mobility,"" RIL said in the statement.
Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of RIL and Bob Dudley, group chief executive of BP, signed the heads of agreement for the joint venture in Mumbai on Tuesday. “Our robust partnership in developing gas resources in India has now expanded to fuel retailing and aviation fuels. This transformative partnership will deepen our engagement with the consumers in further enhancing the world-class services across the country,"" Ambani said.
BP received a licence to market jet fuel in India in January 2016. In October 2016, it received a licence to set up 3,500 fuel retail outlets in India. RIL holds a licence to open 5,000 fuel outlets and plans to double its market share in the fuel retail segment from the present 7-8% share.
There is no clarity whether these licences can automatically be folded into the new venture.
“This joint venture will also include RIL’s aviation fuels business, which currently operates at over 30 airports across India, providing participation in this rapidly-growing market,"" RIL said.
Final agreements will be reached during 2019 and, subject to regulatory and other customary approvals, the transaction will be completed in the first half of 2020.
BP is RIL’s partner in its exploration and production ventures in the country. In February 2011, London-based BP bought a 30% stake in 21 oil and gas production-sharing contracts operated by RIL for $7.2 billion. The two are also partners in India Gas Solutions Pvt. Ltd, an equal joint venture for sourcing and marketing of gas in the country.
India is one of the few major global markets where fuel demand is growing and has attracted attention from foreign fuel retailers seeking to gain a toehold in a country where fuel retailing is dominated by state-run companies.
Dudley said: “India is set to be the world’s largest growth market for energy by the mid-2020s. BP is already a large investor here and we see further attractive, strategic opportunities to support this growth. Together, we will work to provide consumers across India the high-quality fuels, convenience retail and services they need, continuing to drive modernization and mobility solutions across the country.""
RIL and BP are also partners in India Gas Solutions, an equal joint venture for sourcing and marketing of gas in the country. Besides, BP has a presence in India through its automotive and industrial lubricant brand Castrol."
282,2019-08-07,Reliance,"DoT will subsidize operating costs for five years, after which, the infrastructure will be handed over to the operatorSo far, the government was dependent on state-run operator BSNL to reach these unconnected villages

NEW DELHI :
Every Indian village without mobile connectivity is likely to get connections in a year from now, if a new incentive model devised by the department of telecommunications (DoT) works out.
Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have teamed up with DoT to reach the last 43,000 villages without cellular services, Cellular Operators Association of India director general Rajan Mathews said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants these villages connected within a year, Mathews said, along the lines of the last-mile connectivity achieved for cooking gas and electricity supply.
“Telcos didn’t go there earlier because the commercials don’t work. DoT is now coming up with a model where they will give 100% subsidy (for capital expenditure). Basically, the government will pay for it and telcos will set up the network and operate it,"" Mathews added.
“The (DoT’s) intention is to also subsidize (network) operating costs for five years,"" he said. After this period, the infrastructure will be handed over to the operator.
Under the model, the government will divide these 43,000 villages into three categories—easy-to-cover, medium difficulty, and hard-to-cover. After this, it will form pools comprising villages from each of these three categories. Telcos will then bid for these pools and will not be allowed to disaggregate the villages from the pools.
Whichever telco bids the lowest amount to provide connectivity to these pools will win the bid. The government is working on other modalities, including the total size of the project.
An email query to DoT did not elicit any response till press time.
So far, the government was dependent on state-run operator BSNL to reach these unconnected villages.
According to data from DoT, Odisha had 9,940 villages without mobile services, Maharashtra 6,117 and Madhya Pradesh 5,558. Other villages lacking mobile services are located in border areas, islands and the north-eastern states.
The fresh focus on connecting the villages comes after telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad met top officials of telcos last month and assured them of the government’s full support on outstanding issues, such as cut in levies and refunds, apart from asking the industry to reach all villages within a year.
According to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, as of May end, rural tele-density was 56.42. Teledensity is the number of telephone connections for every hundred individuals living in an area.
There were 505.59 million rural wireless subscribers in the country as of May end. The share of rural wireless subscribers in the overall wireless user base is 43.52%.
Interestingly, the national digital communications policy, approved by the Cabinet in September 2018, had set a goal to provide universal broadband coverage, deploy five million public Wi-Fi hot spots by 2020, and 10 million by 2022 through a National Broadband Mission, apart from implementing a “Fibre First Initiative"" to take fibre to the home.
In February, DoT announced plans to monetize fibre assets built by the government under its flagship mission BharatNet by leasing the assets for a 20-year period after a bidding process. This comes against the backdrop of concerns over poor utilization of digital infrastructure that has been created across more than 100,000 gram panchayats in the country."

BENGALURU :
India's Reliance Industries Ltd is partnering with iconic US-based luxury jeweller Tiffany & Co to open a line of stores in the country, adding yet another marquee name to its growing portfolio of brands.
Tiffany, popular for its engagement rings and robin's egg blue boxes, plans to open stores in New Delhi and Mumbai in the second half of fiscal years 2019 and 2020 respectively, the company said, adding that India's ""growing luxury consumer base presents a unique opportunity"".
The tie-up comes as Reliance, which is run by Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani and runs a sprawling conglomerate, bolsters its consumer-focused units such as retail and telecoms to match the strength of its dominant oil and gas business. The company bought British toy retailer Hamleys earlier this year.
For Tiffany, known for its diamond engagement rings and a flagship Manhattan store made famous by Audrey Hepburn, the deal represents its latest effort to expand globally as it battles subdued demand in the United States and Europe."

Bengaluru: Altico Capital India Ltd, a non-banking financial company (NBFC), plans to expand into the housing finance sector and acquire a retail lending portfolio, said a top executive.
Altico is in talks with a few housing finance companies, including Reliance Home Finance Ltd, and the due diligence process will start for the latter, he said.
“Housing finance complements our wholesale lending business. The valuations of housing finance companies were quite high earlier unlike today, when there are opportunities and platforms available at reasonable valuations. Our strategy to enter the housing finance business is not a reaction to what has transpired in the NBFC space in recent months, but this is an opportune time to enter this space,"" said Sanjay Grewal, chief executive, Altico Capital.
The NBFC had received board approval to enter the housing finance business nearly 18 months back, but is actively looking at it only now.
Altico is backed by Clearwater Capital Partners LLC, Abu Dhabi Investment Council and Varde Partners Inc.
A Reliance Home Finance spokesperson declined to comment.
“Reliance Home Finance is currently in talks with four potential buyers and one of them is Altico,"" said a person familiar with the transaction, requesting not to be named.
Last October, Altico had said that it plans to diversify into sectors like health, education and infrastructure in the next 18 months. Its diversification strategy was primarily to de-risk its investments, which are heavily dependent on the real estate sector, and seek opportunities outside.
The company also elevated former head of HSBC India, Naina Lal Kidwai, who has been an independent director in Altico since 2016, as its chairman.
The NBFC sector has been going through a tumultuous period after Infrastructure Financing & Leasing Services Ltd (IL&FS) defaulted on some of its debt obligations last year. Since then, most real estate-focused NBFCs have slowed down deployment to real estate projects and companies.
Grewal said while it expected a shorter crisis period, the NBFC has tried to be more prudent, conserve cash and raise long-term capital. Altico’s shareholders also put in around  ₹350 crore of equity in March.
In the last seven months, on a loan book of  ₹7,000 crore,  ₹2,200 crore of loan pre-payments and repayments have happened, he said.
In the last five years, Altico has had only two non-performing assets (NPAs), of which one has been subsequently realized.
“Going forward, our strategy will be to focus on building the new housing finance business, deploy capital in newer sectors like health, education and warehousing, and finally, lend to high-quality developers, mostly in affordable housing projects,"" Grewal said."

Iconic American jeweler Tiffany & Co. is partnering with Mukesh Ambani’s conglomerate to gain a foothold in the lucrative Indian market. The New York-based jeweler plans to form a joint venture with a retail unit of billionaire Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. to open stores in Delhi and Mumbai by 2020, according to a statement Wednesday. Tiffany is targeting the world’s second-biggest gold jewelry market where some consumers are moving away from the traditional Indian ornaments.
“There is a consumer in India who wants designs with western sensibility just the same as in the case of clothes where some western brands are doing well,"" said Colin Shah, vice chairman of the nation’s Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council.
The announcement comes two months after Tiffany said U.S. sales to Chinese tourists fell by more than 25% last quarter as visitors dropped in a fallout of the escalating trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies. For Tiffany, India presents a natural hedge, where sales of gold and diamond jewelry are expected to grow at an annual rate of as much as 7% in the next three to five years, according to Shah.
Sales growth in China is estimated to be either neutral or slightly negative from earlier projections of an increase of as much as 3%, according to Alrosa PJSC, the world’s biggest diamond producer. Duties on jewelry imported from the U.S. into China were raised to 25% from 10% from June 1.
In India, Tiffany may also benefit from Ambani’s ambitions to set up an e-commerce platform in India to rival Amazon.com Inc. For that, he’s been forming partnerships with global brands and also acquiring smaller companies to build the model. In May, his group agreed to purchase British toy-store chain Hamleys.

Bhopal: The Reliance Group headed by Mukesh Ambani is planning to set up a global logistics hub in Madhya Pradesh to help the state governments efforts to exploit the state's industrial development potential.
Chief Minister Kamal Nath and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani met in Mumbai on Wednesday where the Madhya Pradesh CM invited Ambani to invest in new technologies in the state.
""This will boost trade and employment opportunities in the state,"" Kamal Nath said, adding that the venture would benefit both the state and the investor.
According to a government official, Ambani said that Jio data is used in Madhya Pradesh more than it's used in South Korea or the UK, and the network could be further channelled in fields such as crimes against women, crime investigation and control.
Like Amazon and Walmart, the Reliance Group could also set up a logistics hub in Madhya Pradesh, the official quoted the Reliance Chairman as saying. The group has already established similar facility in Mumbai and Bengaluru.
""Reliance is willing to invest in battery manufacturing for the energy storage sector and MP is on top priority for this,"" Ambani said.
He was replying to Kamal Nath's statement that Madhya Pradesh could be a centre of horticulture, food processing, data processing and energy processing.
The Chief Minister said that ""our new investment policy will be different for every district according to its needs and capacity. The main basis of our new employment policy is to ensure increase in employment and economic activities.""
Kamal Nath also said that trust is utmost necessary for investment.
He mentioned that he will gain the trust of the industrialists by meeting them and discussing ways to make suitable industrial atmosphere in the state.
The Chief Minister also had plans to meet Kumar Mangalam Birla of the Birla Group, Natarajan Chandrasekaran of Tata Group, Pawan Goenka of Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Group, Praveer Sinha of Tata Power, Dilip Gour of Grasim, Harsh Goenka of RPG Group, Dilip Akhuri of ACC Cement, Yashwant Holkar of Ahilya Heritage Hotels and Amrish Patel of Narsee Monjee.
""Madhya Pradesh has a lot of opportunities to invest here. We have opportunities in every field, so I will discuss this with many industrialists and talk about how they can gain confidence in the state,"" Kamal Nath said.
""Since I am involved in investment myself, I know that this will create the future of our youth and increase economic activity in the state, which will increase employment opportunities. After discussing with the industrialists, I will try to know what they think and what our investment policy should be,"" he added.
The Kamal Nath-led government has introduced India Cements, HEG, Wonder Cements and Proctor and Gamble, attracting large industries such as Shri Ram Piston, with an investment of about  ₹6,000 crore and an employment potential of about 76 lakh direct jobs.
A Congress spokesperson said that Kamal Nath government's decision to make 70 per cent employment mandatory for the youth of the state for new industries will provide jobs and stop brain drain.

Mumbai: New subscribers of the New Pension System (NPS) have one less pension fund manager to choose from. Reliance Capital Pension Fund Ltd has surrendered its NPS licence with effect from 10 Augus,t 2019. The company held a licence in the NPS All Citizens Model and the NPS Corporate Model.
All existing subscribers of Reliance Pension Fund are being transferred to LIC Pension Fund, unless they specifically opt for an alternative.
According to an executive from a pension fund, who did not wish to be named, this was on account of Nippon's stake in the company exceeding the 49% permissible limit for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Reliance Pension Fund, which was launched on 21 May, 2009, had assets of  ₹103.52 crore as of 30 June, 2019.
“Nippon Life insurance is in the process of acquiring 75% stake in Reliance Nippon Asset Management (RNAM) and PFRDA (Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority) guidelines on FDI don’t allow the sponsor company to breach the 49% limit. Hence, Reliance Capital Pension Fund Ltd has voluntarily offered back the licence and will cease to act as pension fund manager from 9 August 2019,"" said a spokesperson from Reliance Nippon Asset Management Ltd.

BENGALURU :
Traditional Point of Sale (PoS) devices at supermarkets and small retail stores are gradually giving way to smart Android-based PoS devices that can not only process card payments but also make the entire supply chain more efficient with data analytics and potential credit scoring.
Tech startups like Pine Labs, Mswipe, Jumbotail and big companies like Reliance Jio have already begun pushing their own branded “smart PoS"" machines with Android operating system (OS), sporting an LCD touch screen, bar code reader, and connectivity features like 4G and Wi-Fi.
According to Vicky Bindra, CEO of Pine Labs, smart PoS machines are catching up fast in smaller (tier 1 and tier 2) towns that are starting to migrate to digital payments. “Retailers and merchants from diverse sectors such as electronics, food and beverage, fashion, pharmacy, telecom, and airlines are adopting the new smart PoS machines to improve their efficiencies and enhance consumer’s shopping experience,"" added Bandra.
Mswipe’s CEO Manish Patel likened the new PoS devices to smartphones, adding that just like the evolution of feature phones with basic SMS and calls-support to more smarter touchscreen-based devices, the PoS machine too is evolving.
“Today a smart PoS device is not just accepting cards, but they can also provide UPI (unified payments interface) pull transactions, QR codes (displayed on screens), NFC (near filed communication) transactions, wallet transactions, or basically, any payment mode that is available in India,"" said Praveen Hari, a fellow at industry body iSPIRT.
Analysts also point out that, unlike in developed markets like the UK, US and China—where merchant payments still depend on a mix of QR codes, digital wallets, and NFC-enabled card payments—payments companies in India are targeting retail merchants by integrating all payment form factors into a single smart POS device.
For example, Pine Labs’s PoS machines are equipped to accept over 50 modes of payment including UPI and Google Pay payments which allows merchants to send a payment request to user’s UPI ID or Google Pay ID. This trend also helps in collecting valuable data on sale volumes, GST, stock keeping units (SKUs) in different stores, as well as data of wholesale purchases.
Consider the case of Bengaluru-based Jumbotail, an online wholesale marketplace for food and grocery products.
According to Jumbotail’s co-founder Ashish Jhina, today smart PoS machines can do four key business functions: payment, billing, inventory management, wholesale procurement. But he believes the larger opportunity is beyond just payments.
Jumbotail allows grocery stores and kiranas to place on-demand orders for grocery and food stocks via their app. Each SKU with a merchant is tracked in real-time, and using data points like purchase volumes (from wholesalers), and sale volumes (pulled from PoS machines), Jumbotail claims it can accurately predict the time a merchant may require to stock up.
“We have seen that at least 20-30% of stock-outs (with grocery merchants) can be avoided by tracking SKUs in real-time. As soon they (merchants) notice that a particular SKU is dropping below the limit, we can notify them in real-time to make a quick purchase or recommend an alternative product for the same SKU,"" Jinha explained.
Smart POS data is also valuable for credit scoring. Apart from avoiding stock-outs, store-level data can also serve as alternative credit scores, especially for kiranas and mid-sized supermarkets who don’t really have the means to avail formal credit facilities. “The GST data itself is good enough for a lender to make a lending decision and the shopkeeper or his FMCG distributor now has an incentive to report all the transactions. The transaction data itself can help a lender make a lending decision,"" explained Hari.
Mswipe, for instance, is already using store-level data points to help its merchant base to take credit and pay them back in instalments. “We have engineered a credit model where when our merchants can borrow money (to make wholesale purchases) from any of our NBFC partners, based on data we provide…In terms of recollection, the merchant can opt to pay back in daily and monthly instalments,"" said Patel.
To be sure, apart from lending, startups including Mswipe and PineLabs are also opening up their smart POS devices to third-party developers to allow creation of mobile apps tailored for retail merchants. PineLabs also recently launched a dedicated app store to house third-party developers’ apps especially across areas of online and offline payments, customer feedback capture, travel and ticketing, ride-sharing, and food and e-commerce delivery."
274,2019-08-11,Reliance,"Reliance Jio is expected to announce rollout and pricing plans of its much-awaited Jio GigaFiber serviceRIL AGM begins at 11 am tomorrow

NEW DELHI :
As Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) holds its 42nd annual general meeting (AGM) tomorrow in Mumbai, all eyes are on key announcements related to the launch of Jio GigaFiber broadband service and the new Jio Phone 3 model.
In the last year's AGM, RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani had announced that Jio is planning is to come out with fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) service of Jio GigaFiber, a combo service of broadband, TV and fixed landline. Since then, a trail run of Jio broadband service, expected to be a market disruptor, has been going on in several cities. But a full-fledged commercial launch across 1,600 cities of India is awaited.
In the last two AGMs, Reliance Jio came out with successive models of Jio Phone. This AGM, too, it is expected that a new Jio Phone 3 model might be announced by the Ambani family.
In less than three years, Reliance Jio has already become India's largest telecom player by revenue and the second largest by subscriber base.
RIL AGM will begin at 11 am on Monday. 
Jio GigaFiber:
The Ambanis are expected to announce pricing plans of Jio GigaFiber and even Jio GigaTV during the AGM. It has been reported that earlier that Jio might provide a bundled service of broadband internet at a speed of 1 gigabytes per second (gbps), 600 TV channels and a landline connection for a subscription price of  ₹600 per month. Just like its mobile telephony service, it is expected that Jio's new foray into the cable TV and broadband segments might also act as a market disruptor with cheap pricing plans.
As indicated on its website, Jio GigaFiber plans will be available both in prepaid and postpaid options. Users will, however, have to pay a security security deposit of  ₹4,500 to get an ONT device (GigaHub Home Gateway), which acts as a router, to get access to broadband services.
Reliance Jio had recently sought suggestions from users of its MyJio app on what should be the name of its broadband service. Users were given three options to choose from: JioFiber, JioHome and JioGigaFiber.
Jio Phone 3:
Reliance Jio's last two phone models - Jio Phone and Jio Phone 2 - has had a dream run in the market so far as over 5 crore units of the two smart feature phones have been sold so far.
A hybrid of smartphone and feature phones, Jio Phone comes at an affordable price for those who want smartphone-like features but without paying as much. While Jio Phone comes at a refundable deposit of  ₹1,500, the 4G capable Jio Phone 2 model is priced at  ₹2,999. 
Coinciding with the AGM, Reliance Jio is also holding a sale of the Jio Phone 2 model on August 12 at noon.
It is now expected in the market that RIL will announce a new Jio Phone 3 model with more features at an attractive price."

The company is preparing its Jamnagar complex, the world's largest refinery at a single location‎, to be future ready as fuel demand undergoes change with advent of electric vehicles.
""Jamnagar shall be the refinery icon of the world with best-in-class performance,"" the company said in its latest annual report outlining its vision.
The firm's mission is to ""ensure the Jamnagar refinery is future-ready with a strategic transformation to optimal oil-to-chemicals.‎"" Its refineries currently convert crude oil, sourced from around the globe, into petrol, diesel, LPG, aviation turbine fuel (ATF), LPG, naphta and other value added fuels. Some of these products are used to produce petrochemicals used for making plastics and other products.
Now, it is implementing a strategy that will convert the crude oil only into petrochemicals and ATF used in aeroplanes.
""Reliance has developed a future-ready Oil-to-Chemical strategic vision to, ‎progressively, transform the Jamnagar ‎refinery from a leading producer of fuels to chemicals,"" it said in the annual report.
‎The fundamentals of the Jamnagar oil-to-chemical strategy are to employ advanced ‎molecule management to upgrade the refinery intermediate streams by value.
""The oil-to-chemical programme is a roadmap implemented over a long time horizon, based on market outlook and price triggers for refinery fuel products. The ultimate goal is to achieve greater than 70% conversion of crude refined in Jamnagar, to competitive chemical building blocks of ‎ olefins and aromatics.
""The Jamnagar refinery product slate, at the culmination of oil-to-chemical transition, shall be only jet fuels and petrochemicals,"" it said.
India already has an oil refining capacity that is in excess of fuel demand. While the fuel demand is tapering, PSUs have planned massive refinery expansion plans, which some analysts have questioned in view of the massive push by the government towards electric vehicles and moving away from polluting hydrocarbon-based liquid fuels.
Reliance said the objectives of this plan was to preserve as well as upgrade existing refinery margins, while maximising asset utilisation for a sustainable competitive cost of chemicals.
It has developed a disruptive technology innovation, a Multizone Catalytic Cracking (MCC) process, which converts a wide range of feedstock to high value propylene and ethylene in a single riser.
""All refined products priced below crude shall be eliminated for chemicals at initial stage. Final fuel de-risking shall target elimination of gasoline, alkylate and diesel, synchronised to the global evolution of E-mobility and transport fuel demand decline,"" it said.
With expectations of global petrochemicals demand growing at a faster rate as ‎compared to transportation fuels in longer ‎term, some companies are investing to integrate refinery to petchem to maximise yields of petrochemicals from every barrel of oil processed.
This can possibly lead to significant cost savings through economies of scale and improve competitiveness of companies undertaking such projects.
New complexes in Asia and the Middle East have announced projects with 25-40%‎ crude to chemical conversion.
As part of its oil-to-chemical strategy, the firm has already implement or is in the process of implementing multi-billion dollar projects.
It has built the world's first ever Refinery Off-Gas Cracker (ROGC) complex of 1.5 million tonnes per annum and is importing ethane from the US to produce petrochemicals.
It has also started up all units of the Petcoke Gasification project that will transform Jamnagar complex into a unique 'bottom-less refinery' by converting refinery residue into synthetic gas, the company said.
""Complexity index (CI) designates the capabilities of a refinery to upgrade lowest quality crude to the highest quality refinery products, including fuels and petrochemicals.
""Complexity index of Jamnagar supersite, as per KBC, a global refinery consultant, has increased from earlier 12.7 to 21.1 or a 66.1% boost with the start-up of Jamnagar expansion projects, including ROGC and downstream units, Paraxylene complex and Petcoke Gasification complex,"" it said."

Reliance Industries (RIL) is working towards empowering the 3 crore merchants and kirana shop owners with its end-to-end digital and physical distribution stack new commerce, its chairman Mukesh Ambani said today. Speaking to shareholders at RIL's 42nd Annual General Meeting (AGM), Mukesh Ambani said the company's retail arm will soon unveil Reliance 'new commerce'. ""This user friendly digital platform is designed for inventory management, customer relationship management, financial services and other services,"" he added.
“These highly energetic and self-motivated entrepreneurs have suffered in recent years because of their inability to invest in technology and infrastructure,"" he said.
For this, Reliance is deploying blockchain, IoT, AI and other new technologies on a pan-India basis. This tech-enabled partnership will link producers, traders, small merchants, consumer brands and consumers.
According to the RIL chairman, this will modernise even the smallest neighbourhood kirana shop to become a future-ready digitized store. ""I believe that the small must not only survive, but also thrive in New India,"" Mukesh Ambani said.
""Reliance Retail has brought a retail revolution in India,"" he said, adding that 'new commerce' is meant to revolutionise India's three crore kirana stores.
The purpose of 'new commerce' is to transform unorganised retail into organised retail. New commerce is a $700-billion business opportunity, he added.
Reliance Retail has grown phenomenally in recent times, registering a seven-fold increase in revenue and a 14-fold increase in profit in the last six years."
251,2019-08-12,Reliance,"RIL looking to achieve zero-debt target in next 18 months, says chairman Mukesh AmbaniAmbani says the company expects to complete transactions with Saudi Aramco and BP, which are expected to generate an inflow of  ₹1.15 trillion, within this fiscal

MUMBAI :
Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) may sell equity in more businesses as it aims to become a zero-debt company in the next 18 months, RIL chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said. Speaking at the company’s 42nd annual general meeting (AGM) on Monday, Ambani said RIL has received strong interest from strategic and financial investors for its consumer businesses—Jio (telecom) and Reliance Retail—but did not divulge further details.
RIL’s deals with Saudi Aramco and BP Plc in the past weeks will help it reduce debt. It had accumulated  ₹2.88 trillion of group debt at the end of last fiscal year. The group’s debt, however, stood at  ₹1.54 trillion at the end of last fiscal, after accounting for monetization of telecom infrastructure, such as telecom towers.
“We have a very clear roadmap to becoming a zero-net debt company within the next 18 months, that is by March 31, 2021. We expect to complete transactions with Saudi Aramco and BP within this financial year. These are expected to generate an inflow of  ₹1.15 trillion,"" Ambani said.
At the end of the last fiscal, RIL’s gross debt was at  ₹2.88 trillion, or $41.6 billion. This includes stand-alone gross debt of  ₹1.62 trillion, and balance in key subsidiaries, including Reliance Jio ( ₹670.18 billion), Reliance Holding USA ( ₹34,848 crore), Reliance Retail Group ( ₹12,832 crore), Independent Media Trust Group ( ₹3,045 crore), Hathway Cable and Datacom Ltd ( ₹1,973 crore), Reliance Gas Pipelines Ltd ( ₹1,379 crore) and Recron Malaysia ( ₹1,170 crore).
Cash and marketable securities were at  ₹1.33 trillion, resulting in net debt of  ₹1.54 trillion.
“We will induct leading global partners in these businesses in the next few quarters, and move towards the listing of both these—Jio (telecom) and Reliance Retail—companies within the next five years,"" he said, adding “We will also evaluate value unlocking options for our real estate and financial investments."" With these initiatives, RIL will have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world, he said.
“As we achieve our zero-net debt target, I assure you, my dear shareholders, that we will reward you abundantly through higher dividends, periodic bonus issues, and other means, and at a more accelerated pace than any time in our history,"" he said.
In a 5 August report, Credit Suisse downgraded RIL’s stock from neutral to underperform, and slashed its target price. The brokerage said given that RIL has been free cash flow (FCF) negative for six years and facing margin pressures in refining and petrochemicals, FCF is likely to be negative for fiscal 2020-21 as well.
Ambani said RIL has invested  ₹5.4 trillion in the last five years for expanding and strengthening its oil to chemicals business, creating 4G wireless telecom network offering high-speed internet, and in setting up India’s largest retail chain.
“We also have large and valuable real estate assets; and have a strong portfolio of financial investments,"" he said.
“On the strength of our existing and new growth engines, I am very confident that we can grow this by 15% annually over the next five years,"" he added."
252,2019-08-12,Reliance,"JioFiber’s launch is likely to trigger consolidation, largely among smaller broadband providersCombining high-speed internet, telephony, television and movies, JioFiber will also offer additional features

New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambani kicked off India’s broadband wars on Monday, with the launch of feature-rich JioFiber, a wired internet service that hopes to replicate the runaway success of its Jio mobile service.
Combining high-speed internet, telephony, television and movies, JioFiber will also offer additional features for home security, multiplayer gaming, multiparty video conferencing, virtual shopping and immersive viewing through wearable headsets. While some plans will come bundled with subscriptions to over-the-top content apps, premium users will get to watch movies on the day of their release from mid-2020.
A basic plan will cost  ₹700 a month, while the top plan will cost  ₹10,000, Ambani, India’s richest man, said at the company’s annual general meeting on Monday.
“We will start this service commercially from 5 September at rates, which are one-tenth compared to global rates... JioFiber customers who opt for our annual plans, which we call Jio-Forever plans, will get an HD or 4K LED television and a 4K set-top box free. We are calling this the JioFiber welcome offer,"" said Ambani, announcing plans to reach 20 million homes and 15 million business enterprises across 1,600 cities.
JioFiber is expected to trigger consolidation, largely among smaller broadband providers, just as Jio’s mobile services brought down the number of private telcos to just three. However, Jio’s broadband pricing is not as aggressive as that of its mobile service. For instance, ACT Fibernet’s lowest plan at 100mbps costs  ₹749, while the cheapest monthly plan from Airtel at 40mbps in Delhi costs  ₹799. Big operators in an under-penetrated broadband market could gain as small and local ones get edged out.
As of May-end, India had only 18.45 million wired broadband users as against 562.52 million wireless broadband subscribers, data from the telecom regulator showed, leaving significant room for expansion. The largest private operator in the wired broadband market is Bharti Airtel, which has 2.39 million users. India has 322 wired broadband providers, most of them small and local operators.
“Details of the tariff bundles are not out yet... at what tariff plan what all features will be available. This will provide more clarity on the level and extent of disruption that JioFiber will cause in the market,"" a Mumbai-based equity analyst said, requesting anonymity.
“The current level of penetration (of wired internet) in the country is 7%. I think there is going to be a market explosion with Jio coming in. That’s where it will be good for all the players,"" Bala Malladi, chief executive of ACT Fibernet, had said in an interview in February.
After majority stake buys in Den Networks Ltd and Hathway Cable and Datacom Ltd for  ₹5,230 crore, and upgrading the infrastructure of local cable operators, Jio’s local cable partners will be able to offer HD channels through the JioFiber set-top box."
253,2019-08-12,Reliance,"RIL plans to provide a tech platform for small merchants across India to strengthen their businessReliance Retail’s new commerce initiative is in the pilot phase

MUMBAI :
Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) aims to revolutionize India’s retail industry by connecting as many as 30 million kirana or neighbourhood stores, through its offline-to-online initiative.
Unveiling what he termed as a $700 billion opportunity, RIL chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said on Monday that the so-called ‘new commerce’ platform would connect consumers, merchants and producers across the country.
“The main purpose of new commerce is to completely transform the unorganized retail market, which accounts for 90% of India’s retail industry. The three crore merchants and kirana shop owners, who generate direct and indirect livelihoods for over 20 crore people, form the backbone of India’s commerce ecosystem,"" Ambani told shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting.
He said RIL is working towards enriching and empowering the merchants and kirana shop owners with its end-to-end digital and physical distribution stack. “For this, we are deploying blockchain, internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and other new technologies on a pan-India basis. This tech-enabled partnership will link producers, traders, small merchants, consumer brands and consumers.""
Reliance Retail’s new commerce initiative is now in the pilot phase, RIL said in its annual report for 2018-19.
Through the differentiated business model, RIL plans to provide a technology platform for millions of small merchants across India to strengthen and grow their business. “New commerce will transfer significant new value to consumers, producers, and merchants. Our merchant point of sale (PoS) solution—Jio Prime Partner PoS—is integral to our plan to create an ecosystem around small merchants,"" Ambani said, adding Jio Prime Partner PoS will modernize even the smallest neighbourhood kirana shop to become a future-ready digitized store.
In the past year, RIL made significant progress in developing and testing its merchant technology platforms. It’s beta trials with thousands of merchants across multiple locations established the premise of new commerce with significant increase in sales and improvement in margins for the participating merchants.
Ambani said RIL is now preparing to roll out the platform at a larger scale. The new commerce platform thus represents the digital symbiosis of big and small enterprises. “I believe that the small must not only survive, but also thrive in new India,"" he added.
Ambani said the retail arm will be one of the key growth engines for RIL.
“Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail will account for 50% of the company’s operating profit soon,"" he said, adding RIL will induct leading global partners in these businesses over the next few quarters, and move towards listing them in the next five years.
On the business of Reliance Retail, he said the company had crossed  ₹1.3 trillion in revenue last year and added that two-third of its stores were in tier-II, III and tier-IV towns.
“It is four times larger than the second-largest retail player and also larger than all the other major retailers put together,"" Ambani said."
254,2019-08-12,Reliance,"Revenue drop was reported as speculation swirled that the company was preparing for its much-delayed overseas listingAramco’s income was $46.9 bn for H1 2019, compared to $53.0 bn for the year-ago period

Saudi energy giant Aramco said Monday its first half net income for 2019 slipped nearly 12% to $46.9 billion, a first such disclosure that still reinforces its position as the world’s most profitable company.
The revenue drop amid lower crude prices was reported as speculation swirled that the secretive company was preparing for its much-delayed overseas stock listing, dubbed potentially the world’s biggest.
The news also coincided with an announcement by Reliance that it had agreed to sell a 20% stake in its oil and chemicals business—worth $15 billion—to Aramco, a deal that would potentially boost the Saudi giant’s valuation ahead of an IPO.
Reporting its revenue, Aramco said in a statement: “The company’s net income was $46.9 billion for the first half (of) 2019, compared to $53.0 billion for the same period last year.""
It is the first time the company has published half-year financial results and comes after Aramco opened its secretive accounts for the first time in April as it prepares to raise funds from investors.
“Despite lower oil prices during the first half of 2019, we continued to deliver solid earnings and strong free cash flow underpinned by our consistent operational performance, cost management and fiscal discipline,"" Aramco chief executive officer Amin Nasser was quoted as saying in the statement.
Analysts say record demand for a $12-billion debut international bond launched this year has propelled the world’s top oil exporter to speed up efforts to float the company.
But Monday’s statement made no mention of the planned initial public offering.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has previously said the IPO—which could potentially be the world’s biggest stock sale—would take place in late 2020 or early 2021.
Saudi Arabia plans to sell up to five percent of the world’s largest energy firm and hopes to raise up to $100 billion based on a $2 trillion valuation of the company.
But investors have long debated whether Aramco was really valued so much.
Failure to reach a $2 trillion valuation as desired by Saudi rulers is widely considered the reason the IPO—earlier scheduled for 2018—has been delayed.
The preliminary deal with Reliance, which the Indian giant hailed as the “biggest foreign investment"" in its history, underscores Aramco’s efforts to diversify its operations and boost its valuation.
“(There is) an effort to generate buzz about the company’s success and potential valuation,"" Ellen Wald, author of the book “Saudi Inc."", told AFP.
“But ultimately the valuation of the company is not determined by the king, the prince or the CEO. It’s determined by the banks and the markets.""
The planned IPO forms the cornerstone of a reform programme envisaged by Prince Mohammed to wean the Saudi economy off its reliance on oil.
Saudi Arabia has not announced where the listing will be held, but London, New York and Hong Kong have all vied for a slice of the much-touted IPO.
The petro-state has taken a number of key procedures in preparation for the IPO, including issuing a law for hydrocarbons tax, appointing a new board for Aramco and allowing an independent auditing of the kingdom’s oil reserves, the crown prince said in June.
Aramco has also opened its accounts books for the first time to international ratings agencies, declared the size of its profits and transformed into a public shareholding company, he added.
In April, Aramco revealed it made the world’s biggest corporate profit last year, opening its accounts for the first time.
Aramco posted a net profit of $111 billion in 2018—far higher than the combined net earnings of the five international oil majors—and generated $356 billion in revenues.
Aramco also dethroned Apple as the world’s most profitable firm. Last year, the US tech giant posted nearly $50 billion in net profits."
255,2019-08-12,Reliance,"RIL to sell 20% in refining, chemicals business in bid to become zero-debt firmMukesh Ambani said Aramco will invest in RIL’s oil-to-chemicals unit at an enterprise valuation of $75 billion

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is in the process of selling a 20% stake in the company’s flagship chemicals and refining business to Saudi Aramco in a deal valued at $15 billion, as the Indian company seeks to cut its massive debt and secure an assured supply of crude oil to its refineries.
Chairman Mukesh Ambani, Asia’s richest man, announced the proposed transaction at the company’s 42nd annual general meeting on Monday, although the terms of the deal have not been finalized. The deal, which values the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business at $75 billion, is part of a plan to make RIL a zero-debt company in the next 18 months, Ambani said in a speech at the annual meeting.
“Saudi Aramco will invest in Reliance for a 20% stake in oil-to-chemicals division at an enterprise value of $75 billion for the O2C division, which will be demerged into a separate subsidiary in the next five years,"" Ambani told shareholders. In addition to the stake sale to Aramco, RIL will raise $1 billion from BP Plc, which will acquire a 49% stake in RIL’s petro-retailing business for  ₹7,000 crore, said Ambani.
The investments are subject to due diligence, definitive agreements, regulatory and other approvals, Ambani said, adding that the Saudi Aramco partnership will cover all of RIL’s refining and petrochemicals assets, including its 51% stake in the fuel retailing joint venture with BP. RIL and BP announced a joint venture to open a nationwide network of fuel retail outlets last week.
Ambani is aiming to slash RIL’s ballooning debt after spending as much as $50 billion to propel its telecom business to the top position in India within three years of starting operations, surpassing Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd.
As part of the proposed deal, Saudi Aramco will also supply 500,000 barrels per day of crude oil on a long-term basis to RIL’s Jamnagar refinery.
Saudi Aramco, the most profitable company in the world, controls the world’s second-largest proven crude reserves at more than 270 billion barrels, and the partnership will go a long way in insulating RIL from any future oil shocks and volatility in crude prices, said industry experts.
“This deal could not only ensure continuous crude oil supply to RIL’s twin refineries but also bring in pricing advantages and give RIL cushion from the uncertain global crude oil market,"" an analyst with a domestic brokerage said on condition of anonymity. “For Saudi Aramco, this deal gives a much sought-after foothold in India.""
The proposed deal, once completed, is expected to significantly improve RIL’s debt profile. The company’s total financial liabilities rose to $65 billion as of 31 March from $19 billion at the end of March 2015, resulting in interest cost rising almost fourfold to $4 billion during the period.
“This programme to aggressively pursue deleveraging in businesses and emerge as a zero-debt company in the next 18 months will strengthen the consolidated balance sheet leading to strong valuation rerating of the stock,"" said Ajay Bodke, CEO of portfolio management services at Prabhudas Lilladher.
RIL has developed a strategy to transform the Jamnagar refinery from a producer of fuels to chemicals, moving up the value chain. The complexity index of RIL’s Jamnagar integrated refinery has been enhanced to 21.1 (from 12.7 in 2016) after the commissioning of various integrated projects and petcoke gasifiers."
258,2019-08-12,Reliance,"The conglomerate aims to be a zero-net-debt company in 18 months, Asia’s richest man told shareholders MondayLast week, Credit Suisse cut its recommendation for Reliance’s stock and the price target citing reasons including rising liabilities and finance costs

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. is on a mission to reduce debt after racking up $76 billion in capital expenditure in the last five years.
The conglomerate aims to be a zero-net-debt company in 18 months, Asia’s richest man told shareholders Monday. Aiding that effort would be a decision to sell 20% of Reliance’s oil-to-chemicals business to Saudi Arabian Oil Co., or Aramco, at an enterprise value of $75 billion. The company will also start preparing to list its retail and telecommunications units within five years, Ambani said.
The tycoon is cleaning up the group’s finances following years of spending on his wireless carrier, whose entry in 2016 with free calls and cheap data upended the industry and spurred a consolidation. The almost $50 billion plowed into the phone venture, mostly in debt, has raised concerns among analysts including at Credit Suisse Group AG that Reliance’s ballooning borrowings would weigh on growth. Ambani sought to allay those fears.
“With these initiatives, I have no doubt that your company will have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world,"" he said. “We will also evaluate value unlocking options for our real estate and financial investments.""
Reliance had a net debt of  ₹1.54 trillion ($22 billion) at the end of March 31, according to Ambani. His plan to carry zero debt would mean the borrowings would fall below the company’s cash reserves, a level not seen since 2013.
Last week, Credit Suisse cut its recommendation for Reliance’s stock and the price target citing reasons including rising liabilities and finance costs. Shares of the company have slumped about 18% from a record reached on May 3, compared with a 3.6% decline in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex.
Reliance’s debt is backed by “extremely valuable assets,"" Ambani said, signaling his group isn’t prone to the kind of troubles that have been plaguing many other corporate borrowers in India. The conglomerate controlled by Ambani’s younger brother, Anil, has been struggling to pay creditors while his mobile carrier has slipped into bankruptcy.
Apart from the Aramco deal, Reliance also announced a joint venture with BP Plc this month, under which the European oil major would buy 49% of the Indian firm’s petroleum retailing business. Reliance would receive about 70 billion rupees under this deal.
The “commitments"" from the Aramco and BP deals alone are about 1.1 trillion rupees, Ambani said, adding that Reliance will induct “leading global partners"" in telecom and retail units in the next few quarters.

259,2019-08-12,Reliance,"By partnering with Microsoft Corp. Reliance Industries has in a single swoop challenged the likes of Amazon Web Services, Google and a host of smaller- and mid-sized data centres and SaaS companies

BENGALURU
If the nearly three-year-old Mukesh Ambani-controlled telecom company, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, has crossed the 340-million subscriber mark, making it India’s largest telecom enterprise in terms of users, revenue and profit, by disrupting the country’s telecom sector, the chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries on Monday has not only raised the entertainment and digital bar for telcos, but also sharpened his focus on startups, small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and big enterprises.
To begin with, in the 42nd annual general meeting (AGM) speech, Ambani took the high digital position by underscoring the fact that almost every conceivable emerging technology trend is present in the Jio fold—be that artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), blockchain, online multiplayer gaming, multi-party videoconferencing, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR).
Since, Reliance Industries already has its payments ecosystem, is fortifying its e-commerce play, has 3D printing capabilities and uses robotics, robotic process automation and advanced analytics comprehensively in its oil fields and telecom services, these services make up the so-called Industry 4.0 trend, consequently highlighting the intended positioning of Reliance Industries and Jio as the new poster boys of digital transformation in India. As Ambani said in his speech, “Jio has truly become the Digital Gateway of India.""
It’s not only Indian telcos—in particular, Bharti Airtel and the Idea Vodafone—that Ambani has targeted. By partnering with Microsoft Corp., to offer solutions comprising connectivity, computing, storage solutions, and other technology services and applications such as data analytics, AI, cognitive services, blockchain, IoT and edge computing to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), Reliance Industries has in a single swoop challenged the likes of Amazon Web Services, Google and a host of smaller- and mid-sized data centres and software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies.
RIL has done so by offering multiple digital services—whether they be smart home solutions atop the Jio Giga Fibre (with speeds of 100 Mbps to 1Gbps), remote video-conferencing facilities, to cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools available with Microsoft 365, applications using the Microsoft Azure cloud platform that will be deployed in Jio data centres. These data centres will be “fully operational in calendar year 2020"", according to Ambani.
Ambani is bullish on the power of IoT. Jio, plans to use narrow-band IoT, or NB-IoT, data from billions of smart sensors—whether residential homes or industrial places, from across India. NB-IoT is a low-power wide-area network radio technology standard developed by 3GPP, a standards organization, to enable a wide range of cellular devices and services.
Last month, the Indian Institute of Kanpur and Ericsson said they will jointly deploy an NB-IoT-based sensor network to monitor air pollution in Delhi. Ambani cited the example of digitally “connecting over 300 million electricity meters for real-time monitoring and giving consumers full visibility and control of cost and quality"". He predicts there will be more than 2 billion connected devices in India in the next two years. Since Jio aims to connect “at least 1 billion of these on Jio’s IoT platform, it translates into a  ₹20,000 crore annual revenue opportunity"", according to Ambani.
That said, currently these NB-IoT services have been developed on Jio’s 4G networks. With 5G on the anvil, things could only get better for Jio since 5G is a data-only technology, but spectrum issues (both availability and price) are yet to be sorted out.
Further, interoperability and security of IoT devices remain major hurdles that will only get compounded with the rise in connected devices.
That said, the fact that Jio is getting serious about enterprises is also demonstrated from Ambani’s focus on startups. Jio has invested in 14 startups till date, and the mixed reality and edge computing demos at the AGM were from the a couple of the startups that Jio invested in. Besides, Ambani said he will make cloud infrastructure free for “budding startups"" while offering them for just  ₹1,500 to SMEs.
Over the next 12 months, Jio will also install one of the largest global blockchain networks in India, comprising “tens of thousands of nodes operational on day one"". Further, aimed at delivering immersive content that creates “new possibilities for entertainment, shopping, gaming and most importantly for education"", Jio is setting up a pan-India ‘Edge Computing and Content Distribution’ with multiple nodes.
Tying the blockchain and edge computing (effectively, getting data nearer to end-use devices) strategies with cloud computing services from Microsoft, Mukesh Ambani wants to develop “truly India-native solutions including Speech Recognition and Natural language understanding for all major Indian languages and dialects"", all moves that make it a major competitor in the enterprise segment.
The vision, according to Ambani, is to underscore Jio’s “contribution to transform India into an AI-first economy across all sectors and all walks of life"". “It is my passion and conviction that New India will lead and not follow the advanced nations of the world in adopting, even creating disruptive technologies that will decide the winners and losers of the Fourth Industrial Revolution,"" Ambani said in his speech.
While he did make the right noises, all these initiatives will require more investment, especially for a company that already has a net debt of  ₹1.55 trillion. Ambani, though, has announced that he wants to make Reliance Industries a zero net-debt company by 2021.
Digital Transformation is a major lever for him on this journey. He reasons that since India is a $2.5 trillion economy and large economies typically spend 3-5% of their GDP on digital services, “...even at 3%, this translates to a potential Indian digital service spend of nearly  ₹5,00,000 crore ( ₹5 trillion) annually"", of which Jio can “earn a significant proportion""."

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Reliance CMD Mukesh Ambani announced a long-term alliance with Reliance Jio at the company's 42nd Annual General Meeting (AGM).
""Computing is becoming ubiquitous and distributed. AI is being infused in every experience. And the interaction model itself is increasingly human-first, rather than device first. These advances are shaping the next phase of innovation, creating new opportunities for people and organisations everywhere, especially in India,"" said Nadella in a video that was projected during the AGM.
""Our long-term partnership combines the power of Azure, Azure AI and Office 365 with Jio's connectivity and digital solutions, which are among the most used and fast growing in the world. Together, we will offer a comprehensive technology solution—from compute to connectivity and productivity for SMBs everywhere in the country,"" he said.
As part of this new agreement, Jio will provide its internal workforce with cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools available with Microsoft 365 and will migrate its non-network applications to the Microsoft Azure cloud platform.
Jio’s connectivity infrastructure will promote the adoption of the Microsoft Azure cloud platform within its growing ecosystem of startups, as part of Jio’s cloud-first strategy.
""Jio and Microsoft will partner to launch new cloud datacenters in India, ensuring more organizations can access the tools and platforms they need to build their own digital capability,"" said Nadella.

MUMBAI :
Reliance Industries and BP Plc will together invest  ₹35,000 crore for bringing to production three sets of natural gas fields in the Krishna Godavari basin block in the Bay of Bengal, Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said on Monday.
The three projects will help reverse the falling gas output from what was once the biggest gas-producing block in the country. In July, the two partners had announced investment sanction for development of their deepest natural gas discovery in the KG-D6 block.
""With an expected peak production of one billion cubic feet per day, equivalent to nearly 30 per cent of India's current indigenous gas production, the joint venture will emerge as a major contributor to India's energy security,"" said Ambani while speaking at the group's 42nd annual general meeting.
With world-class deep-water infrastructure in the east coast of India, the joint venture is uniquely positioned to monetise over three trillion cubic feet of discovered resources in the KG D6 block, he said adding the projects to develop these gas-fields are among the most complex being executed anywhere in the world.
Ambani said the natural gas business will soon regain its pride of place in Reliance's value-creation strategy. With Reliance de-emphasising its shale gas business in the United States, the company is currently focused only on India.
""In our coal bed methane blocks, we are focusing on augmenting production. The joint venture with BP will play a major role as a producer of natural gas,"" he said.

263,2019-08-12,Reliance,"Saudi Aramco will acquire a 20% stake in RIL's refining and petrochemicals business for an enterprise value of $75 billionRIL also said that it intends to become a debt-free company by 2021

Is Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) engaging in some serious deleveraging or is it tactfully defocusing from its traditional oil and gas businesses? While it’s difficult to read the mind of the company run by India’s richest man, it does look like RIL is achieving both objectives through its deal with Saudi Arabian Oil Co. (Saudi Aramco).
The world’s largest oil producer will acquire a 20% stake in RIL's refining and petrochemicals business at an enterprise value of $75 billion, the latter announced at its annual general meeting (AGM) on Monday.
In end-June, RIL had a net liability of $36.9 billion, with the refining and petrochemicals business housing about $5.6 billion of it, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients last month. Based on these numbers, Saudi Aramco may shell out about $14 billion for the stake purchase, which will in turn reduce RIL’s net liability figure by about 40%.
RIL also said that it intends to become a debt-free company by 2021. While one may quibble about its exclusion of capex creditors from the definition of debt, the general trajectory of its balance sheet will please investors. Reliance’s global depository receipts (GDRs) were trading 6.5% higher in London on Monday.
The deleveraging aside, the stake sale to Aramco has other messages as well. It’s tactful on the part of the company to give up some of its ownership in what is seen as its core business. Importantly, the move will free up resources for the group’s consumer businesses, which enjoy far higher valuation multiples.
What’s more, in the process, RIL has extracted a decent valuation for the refining and petrochemicals assets. The median valuation across the Street for the refining and petrochemicals business is around $70 billion.
The Saudi state-owned oil company has been aggressively increasing its footprint in downstream businesses world over, and its eagerness to diversify beyond the upstream oil production business has resulted in handsome valuations for RIL’s asset.
To be sure, RIL has engaged in deleveraging moves even in the consumer businesses, such as the creation of the investment trusts for its telecom infrastructure. In the AGM, it also said it will induct leading global companies as partners in its telecom and retail businesses in the next few quarters. But thus far, the majority of its stake sales have been in its oil businesses.
The fact that the company is shedding weight in its balance sheet will certainly be hailed by investors. What’s more, as a result, resources will become more freely available to RIL’s faster growing business, which will be seen as an added bonus. Needless to say, this is grave news for RIL’s competitors, whose resources now look even more scarce in comparison to the conglomerate."

Reliance CMD Mukesh Ambani announced a TV set top box alongside the launch of its high-speed internet service, Jio Fiber, at the company's 42nd Annual General Meeting (AGM). Jio Fiber will come a landline phone connection, IoT and the aforementioned TV set top box that aims to provide ultra-high definition entertainment. 
Jio Fiber plans are priced between  ₹700 and  ₹10,000 a month. Ambani said these rates are a tenth of the global rates. 
Over the past months Reliance has worked with Multiple System Operators (MSOs) to upgrade its infrastructure, Ambani said.
Earlier this year, RIL acquired controlling stakes in three leading Cable MSOs – Hathway, DEN and GTPL — who have direct relationships with over 30,000 LCOs.
He believes after these upgrades, Reliance's LCO partners would be able to offer the largest bouquet of High-Definition channels to customers with better features, reliability and customer experience than DTH.
Ambani also said the Jio set top box can accept the broadcast cable TV signals Reliance's LCO partners.
Akash Ambani and Isha Ambani demonstrated the capabilities of Jio Fiber and Jio's set top box at the event. Jio TV seems to have integrated the entire Jio ecosystem that includes JioCinema, JioGames, JioCast and JioSaavn. They also showed the low latency, high-speed cloud gaming experience, mixed reality applications through Tesseract, a Reliance-owned startup and video and voice conference capabilities of Jio Fiber. 
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also made a surprise appearance at 42nd Reliance's Annual General Meeting (AGM) to announce a long-term alliance with Jio.
""Jio and Microsoft will launch new cloud data centres in India, ensuring more of Jio's customers can access the tools and platforms they need to build their own digital capability,"" said Nadela."
271,2019-08-12,Reliance,"Stake sale in Reliance Home Finance may include divesting ownership control to the new partnerReliance Home Finance currently has a loan book of  ₹11,000 crore

BENGALURU/MUMBAI :
Reliance Capital Ltd (RCap) is in talks with four firms to sell a majority stake in its unit Reliance Home Finance Ltd that may also include divesting ownership control to the new partner, said three people familiar with the matter.
The talks are taking place with investment firms Varde Partners Inc., AION Capital and Cerberus Capital Management and non-banking financial company (NBFC) Altico Capital India Ltd, said the people cited above, requesting anonymity.
Reliance Home Finance currently has a loan book of  ₹11,000 crore. It comprises around  ₹4,500 crore of retail loans and  ₹6,500 crore of wholesale loans.
“The company is in an advanced stage of discussions with two of these firms. It is keen to close the deal as soon as possible. The plan is to sell a stake in the company and then by 2020, wind down the wholesale lending business, and eventually, it is the retail housing finance business that will stay on,"" said the first person cited above.
“Reliance Capital will also remain as a significant minority shareholder.""
A Reliance Capital spokesperson declined to comment. “Housing finance complements our wholesale lending business. The valuations of housing finance companies were quite high earlier, unlike today, when there are opportunities and platforms available at reasonable valuations,"" said Sanjay Grewal, chief executive, Altico Capital.
“Our strategy to enter the housing finance business is not a reaction to what has transpired in the NBFC space in recent months, but this is an opportune time to enter this space"".
Altico is also in talks with a few other home financiers.
Spokespersons for Varde Partners and AION Capital declined to comment, while Cerberus Capital didn’t respond to queries.
Altico’s strategy to diversify into housing finance and other sectors is to primarily de-risk its investments, which have been dependent on the real estate sector. On 30 April, Mint had reported that RCap has drawn up plans to raise up to  ₹10,000 crore through stake sales as the diversified financial services company seeks to cut its debt amid a string of rating downgrades. The Anil Ambani group firm plans to sell up to a 51% stake each in its wholly-owned non-banking financial companies—Reliance Home Finance and Reliance Commercial Finance and in two media companies—Codemasters and Prime Focus, the report said.
The NBFC sector has been going through a tumultuous period after Infrastructure Financing & Leasing Services Ltd (IL&FS) defaulted on some of its debt obligations last year. Since then, most real estate-focused NBFCs have slowed down deployment to real estate projects and companies.
Finally, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, last week, announced National Housing Bank’s fresh liquidity window for housing finance companies.
The scheme called Liquidity Infusion Facility (LIFt) offered  ₹10,000 crore for housing financiers for lending to individuals for purchasing affordable homes.
Reserve Bank governor Shaktikanta Das said last week that the central bank has identified 50 large non-banks, including some housing finance companies, and is monitoring them and that it is trying to ensure that there is no collapse of any large systematically large NBFCs."

Mumbai: Reliance Industries chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani on Monday announced a deal with Saudi Aramco, terming it India's largest foreign direct investment till date. As part of the deal, Saudi Aramco will acquire a 20% stake in RIL's oil-to-chemicals (OTC) or refining and petrochemicals business at an enterprise value of $75 billion.
The deal follows RIL announcing a joint venture with BP wherein the latter will pick up 49% stake in the former’s petroleum retailing business for  ₹7,000 crore.
Reliance has developed an oil-to-chemical strategy to transform the Jamnagar refinery from a producer of fuels to chemicals.

""The objectives are to preserve as well as upgrade existing refinery margins, while maximising asset utilisation for a sustainable competitive cost of chemicals,"" RIL said in its 2018-19 annual report.
RIL has developed a multi-zone catalytic cracking (MCC) process, which converts a wide range of feedstock to high-value propylene and ethylene in a single riser.
The company eventually wants to achieve an over 70% conversion of crude refined in Jamnagar to competitive chemical building blocks of olefins and aromatics. The Jamnagar refinery product slate, at the culmination of oil-to-chemical transition, shall be only jet fuels and petrochemicals.
""All refined products priced below crude shall be eliminated for chemicals at the initial stage. Final fuel de-risking shall target the elimination of gasoline, alkylate and diesel, synchronised to the global evolution of E-mobility and transport fuel demand decline,"" RIL said in its annual report."

During its Annual General Meeting (AGM) today, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) demoed its fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) service and gave us a few more details about it.
Jio Fiber services will start on 5 September. The base package is priced at  ₹700 and offers 100Mbps speed.
The service was announced last year, on 12 August, but the telco didn't reveal details like data plans and real-time data speeds. Jio did offer the fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) service to early adopters with the GigaFiber Preview Offer, but the service has a capped top speed of 100Mbps instead of 1Gbps speeds promised during its unveiling last year.
Jio Fiber data plans
Jio Fiber's cheapest data plan is priced at  ₹700/month with speeds of 100Mbps.
The top-of-the-line package is priced around  ₹10,000 per month. This package offers 1Gbps speeds.
All Jio Fiber plans allow access to broadband, fixed line, Jio HomeTV and Jio's IoT services.

""We are calling this the Jio Fiber Welcome Offer. I invite all of you to make the most of our Welcome Offer, and sign up for Jio Fiber as soon as it is available in your neighbourhood.""
Complete tariff information would be available on 5 September.
Akash Ambani and Isha Ambani said the speed of the network ranges between 100Mbps and 1Gbps. They also talked the various applications of the service ranging from digital TV to cloud gaming.
Reliance also talked about its mixed reality (MR) startup Tesseract. MR has many use cases including virtual shopping, education and movies. The Tesseract VR headset was also demoed.
Chairman Mukesh Ambani said Jio is signing up 10 million new customers every month.
He also talked about the readiness of the Jio Infocomm hardware and the overwhelming reception of Jio Fiber by early adopters.
""The core and aggregation layers of our converge network are already 5G ready. Our wireless hardware is already 4G+ and can be upgraded to 5G,"" he said.
According to the Reliance, Jio Fiber's Preview service generated interest from 15 million people in 1,600 towns. Ambani said the services plans to reach more than 20 mill residences in 15 mill businesses in 1,600 towns. 5 lakh homes are on trial plans and each of these are using more than 100GB of data.
""US has average internet speeds of 90Mbps, our base plan offers a higher speed"" said Ambani.
Reliance Jio is also eyeing enterprise customers including small and medium businesses (SMBs) and large businesses with the service.
Ambani said ""Jio Fiber will enable 2.4 mill SMBs with high-speed data connectivity."""

Reliance Industries Ltd. will receive  ₹7,000 crore ($990 million) from UK's BP Plc in a deal announced last week that gives the European oil major a 49% stake in the Indian conglomerate’s fuel retail business.
Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced the value of the deal for the first time at the company’s annual meeting Monday. The companies last week said they’d agreed to form a new joint venture that will take over 1,400 retail fuel stations run by Reliance along with its aviation fuels operations at more than 30 airports across India.

New Delhi: Reliance Industries has unveiled its much awaited wired broadband service Jio GigaFiber starting at  ₹700 a month going up to  ₹10,000 a month depending on the usage plans, which will combine wired broadband, television content, landline calling and a host of smart solutions such as multi-player gaming and video conferencing.
“We will start this service commercially from 5 September at rates which are one-tenth compared to global rates,"" Reliance Industries Ltd Chairman Mukesh Ambani said at the 42nd AGM on Monday.
JioGigaFiber has received over 15 million registrations from 1,600 cities and the company has drawn up a plan to reach 20 million homes and 15 million business enterprises.
“Customers opting for one-year plan for Jio GigaFiber will even get an HD 4K LED television and a 4K set-top box free. We are calling this the Jio GigaFiber welcome offer,"" Ambani said.
The fibre offering will support mixed reality (augmented reality and virtual reality combined) which would enable immersive shopping experiences, high definition entertainment apart from high quality video calling anywhere in India.
Within less than three years of its launch, Jio has become the number one operator in terms of revenue and the second largest in terms of subscriber base.
In fact, at the last annual general meeting of Reliance Jio’s parent Reliance Industries Ltd in July 2018, chairman Mukesh Ambani had announced that GigaFiber will be the largest greenfield fixed-line broadband rollout globally. The company intends to roll out this service in 1,600 cities across India.
Registrations for Jio GigaFiber had opened in August last year.
A few months later, in October, Reliance said it would buy majority stakes in Den Networks Ltd and Hathway Cable and Datacom Ltd for  ₹5,230 crore—a move that it said would boost Jio GigaFiber.
Through these investments, Jio said it plans to boost 27,000 local cable operators that are aligned with Den and Hathway through superior back-end infrastructure, tie-ups with content producers, and investment in digital infrastructure for connecting customers.
“Our local cable operator partners will have access to GigaFiber homes and can earn revenue from broadcast services,"" Ambani said.
The wired broadband market is a highly under-penetrated one with huge room for growth. As of May end, there were just 18.45 million wired broadband users as against 562.52 million wireless broadband subscribers, data from the telecom regulator showed.
In fact, Jio’s thrust on wired broadband also assumes significance given the government’s focus on fibre in its national digital communications policy announced in May 2018, with a target of attracting investments of $100 billion in digital communications.
The policy’s goals include universal broadband for all, deployment of 5 million public Wi-Fi hotspots by 2020 and 10 million by 2022 through a National Broadband Mission, apart from implementing a “Fibre First Initiative"" to take fibre to the home.
The commercial launch of Jio GigaFiber could disrupt the wired broadband market in the same way Reliance Jio disrupted the wireless market in September 2016."

Network roll out of Jio Fiber services is expected in the next 12 months.
Competition
Given the nature of the service, Jio Fiber would be competing with Spectra and ACT Fibernet. These two companies also offer 1Gbps download speeds but in select cities.
ACT Fibernet's Giga plan offering gigabit internet speeds in select areas including Bengaluru is priced at  ₹5,999. It has a data limit of 2,500 GB after which the internet speed is throttled to 1Mbps. Spectra offers a 1Gbps connections at  ₹13,999 in Noida, Gurgaon, Bengaluru and Delhi with no data restrictions."

Reliance Jio will also launch its IoT platform from January 1, 2020, he announced. 
""In India even the most basic Jio Giga Fiber will start at 100 mbps at the lowest end. We have plans to go all the way to 1 gbps. We are pricing our plan at one-tenth of global rate to make it accessible for every home,"" Ambani said.
From mid-2020, the premium Jio Giga Fiber customers will also get to watch new movies on the same day of its release, he said.
""Premium Jio Giga Fiber customers can watch movies at home… the same day they are released in theatres! This service will be launched in the middle of 2020,"" he said.
Mukesh Ambani said that Jio, which has amassed over 340 million subscribers in less than three years, is now ready to fire four new growth engines including Internet of Things (IoT) for the entire country, home and enterprise broadband services as well as broadband for SMEs.
""Revenue from each of these engines will kick in this fiscal itself,"" Reliance Industries' Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said addressing the 42nd Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Mumbai.
The investment cycle of Reliance Jio is complete, and about  ₹3.5 lakh crore has been invested in high-speed 4G network, he said.
Jio has also entered into a long-term alliance with Microsoft to accelerate digital transformation of India by launching new cloud data centres, he added. (With Agency Inputs)"

NEW DELHI :
Having ended the last year with a net debt of  ₹154,478 crore, Reliance Industries chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani has laid out a roadmap to make the conglomerate a zero net-debt company in just 18 months. At RIL AGM in Mumbai, Ambani also announced that he is planning to list both Reliance Jio and Reliance in the next five years.
Mukesh Ambani said RIL is now coming to the end of its largest capital expenditure cycle after having invested  ₹5.4 lakh crore in the last 5 years.
5 things to know about Mukesh Ambani's plan for Reliance Industries' balance sheet:
1) ""We have a very clear roadmap to becoming a zero net debt company within the next 18 months that is by 31st March 2021,"" Mukesh Ambani announced at RIL AGM. After announcing a  ₹5,32,00 crore deal with Saudi Aramco and a  ₹7,000 crore deal with BP, Ambani said the two deals will create win-win relationships, generating significant strategic value for its partners. ""We expect to complete these transactions within this financial year subject to definitive agreements, due diligence, regulatory and other customary approvals. The commitments from these two transactions are about  ₹1.1 lakh crore,"" he said.
2) Reliance Industries has also received strong interest from strategic and financial investors in its consumer businesses, Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail. ""We will induct leading global partners in these businesses in the next few quarters, and move towards listing of both these companies within the next five years,"" Ambani said.
3) Reliance Industries will also evaluate value unlocking options for our real estate and financial investments. ""With these initiatives, I have no doubt that your company will have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world,"" Ambani told shareholders.
4) Last year, RIL had transferred its telecom infrastructure assets to two separate infrastructure trusts for a consideration of  ₹1.25 lakh crore with the intention of raising this money from large global institutional investors. ""We have received strong interest and commitments from reputed global investors and are confident that these transactions will be completed by the end of this Financial Year,"" Ambani said.
5) To RIL shareholders, Ambani made a no-holds-barred promise of higher dividends and bonus issues. ""As we achieve our zero net-debt target, I assure you my dear shareholders that we will reward you abundantly through higher dividends, periodic bonus issues and other means, and at a more accelerated pace than any time in our history,"" he said."
238,2019-08-13,Reliance,"Reliance has scaled back its subscriber target for its fixed broadband service, JioFibeThe company’s minimum tariff for its 100GB JioFiber plan isn’t vastly lower than competitors

Slow and steady wins the race isn’t the mantra anyone will associate with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. In less than three years of the launch of its mobile broadband services, it has become the clear market leader. The company first enticed customers by offering its services free and, even when it started charging them, tariffs were way below competition.
In comparison, the company’s plans for its fixed broadband services, under the JioFiber tag, are far more restrained. To start with, in its annual general meeting on Monday, parent company Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) scaled down its target of reaching 50 million homes with its broadband services to 20 million.
Of course, the new target is nothing to sneer at. The entire fixed line broadband market in the country right now is at a little more than 18 million. Among private sector operators, the largest is Bharti Airtel Ltd, which has a subscriber base of about 2.3 million.
Even so, Jio’s decision to lower its target reflects the underlying challenges, such as last-mile connectivity and affordability. Interestingly, the company has decided on a minimum tariff of  ₹700 for its 100GB plan, which isn’t vastly lower than competitors. “With most peers, offering 100GB plans and pricing starting from  ₹600 and ARPU for most at  ₹400-800, the plans do not appear as disruptive as in mobile,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients. ARPU stands for average revenue per user.
The limited scope of the market and challenges with last-mile connectivity seem to have led to the decision. Taking broadband services to residences involve multiple approvals from authorities, such as municipal corporations and housing societies, which aren’t very easy to come by. Note that Jio’s broadband trial runs, which effectively amount to free services over the past many months, have resulted in a customer base of only 0.5 million.
Some analysts are hopeful that JioFiber may be better placed than competitors because of its bundled offerings, and its partnership with cable operators.
Last year, RIL bought stakes in DEN Networks Ltd, and Hathway Cable and Datacom Ltd, providing access to 27,000 local cable operators. At the time of acquisition, both had access to 24 million cable and 1.2 million broadband subscribers.
According to Rajiv Sharma, co-head (research) at SBICAP Securities Ltd, there are an estimated 20-25 million affluent homes in India. Add to this the infrastructure back-up of RIL, and market access from DEN and Hathway, Sharma expects RIL to add 3-4 million subscribers per year, achieving the target in five years.
In other words, the progress is expected to be slow and steady. This may have been fine, except that the pace at which capital expenditure has been incurred on the project was anything but slow. As such, the payback time for Jio’s massive expenditure continues to get drawn out."

Anil Ambani’s Reliance Infrastructure reported consolidated net profit of  ₹299 crore for the June 2019 quarter, up 19.6% from the  ₹250.14 crore it reported in the same period last year, boosted primarily by higher revenue from the power generation business. Revenue stayed flat at  ₹5466.72 crore.
In its Q1 earnings disclosure, Reliance Infra disclosed a fragile liquidity position on a host of assets, most importantly of thermal power generation company Reliance Power, where the parent holds 29% shareholding. However, RInfra said in a disclosure to stock exchanges that the management decided no impairment was necessary on these assets and that the current market price of Reliance Power (at  ₹3.61 a share) “does not reflect the fundamentals of the business."" The notes to accounts also declared shaky liquidity for other businesses - Mumbai Metro One Project Ltd, GF Toll Road Pvt Ltd, TK Toll Road Pvt Ltd, TD Toll Road Pvt Ltd and Vidarbha Industries Pvt Ltd.
In Q1, RInfra reported revenue of  ₹300 crore from road projects and  ₹85 crore from the Mumbai Metro One project. All the 16 Lenders of Reliance Infrastructure signed an Inter Creditor Agreement (ICA) on July 6 through which the company achieved a standstill for 180 days to implement its resolution plan by monetizing assets. The company’s debt stands at over  ₹7200 crore. In July, RInfra announced a plan to monetize its Reliance Center office in Santacruz East (Mumbai) by way of long-term lease, and will use the proceeds only for debt reduction.
RInfra has, in the past, also taken a  ₹3972.17 crore provision on its exposure to Reliance EPC, an engineering, procurement and construction firm where RInfra has 2% equity shareholding but has a total exposure of  ₹7336.86 crore and corporate guarantees of  ₹1775 crore, the company reiterated. During the quarter, RInfra adjusted a loss of  ₹629.35 crore for the invocation of a pledge of shares of an associate company.
The notes to account also disclosed that there is a security cover shortfall in listed non-convertible debentures of  ₹1101.20 crore indicating that in case of a possible default, the security may be inadequate.
Shares of Reliance Infrastructure closed at  ₹45.05 apiece on the BSE on Tuesday, down 4.86%."
240,2019-08-13,Reliance,"Saudi Aramco is set to acquire a 20% stake in RIL’s oil-to-chemicals business, whose enterprise value is pegged at $75 billion

On Monday, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani announced a proposed $15 billion deal with Saudi Arabian Oil Co. (Saudi Aramco). Once the deal happens, state-run Saudi Aramco will acquire a 20% stake in RIL’s oil-to-chemicals (OTC) business, whose enterprise value is pegged at $75 billion. Though the Saudi state suffered a severe public image setback globally as a result of the Khashoggi affair, it hasn’t shelved plans for an Aramco IPO a year or so in the future. To enhance its own valuation, forging business alliances with large-scale consumer firms such as RIL makes sense. Perhaps, as some suggest, Aramco would also learn the art of shareholder management by working with RIL. That the Saudi firm can count on RIL buying its crude oil supplies goes without saying. On current information, Aramco is expected to supply RIL half a million barrels a day of the stuff.
The contours of the deal look promising from RIL’s perspective as well. It would assure RIL the security of input supplies from a volatile region, and that too of a commodity whose market price is infamously sensitive to geopolitical tensions. Saudi Arabia also holds significant weight with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, a cartel whose production levels influence global prices to varying degrees. What delights RIL shareholders, however, is the prospect of the Indian company lightening its debt burden—estimated at $65 billion in 2018-19—with Aramco’s money. With a more reasonable debt-to-equity ratio, RIL will be in better shape to expand and reward shareholders.
Aramco’s India plans also include a partnership with Indian state-run oil companies for setting up the world’s largest oil refinery and petrochemical complex in Maharashtra. Driven by the same rationale, Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (Adnoc), the state-run oil firm of the United Arab Emirates, has also picked up a part of Saudi Aramco’s stake in the $44 billion refinery. All of this points to a future of close Indo-Saudi ties in the energy sector."
241,2019-08-13,Reliance,"Reliance-owned Jio that disrupted India’s telecom market with cheap data rates, emerged as the most trusted telecom network brand among those surveyedWhen it came to online shopping, Amazon emerged the clear winner

New Delhi: Indian consumers opted between foreign and home-grown brands while shopping for clothes, booking online tickets and their preferred telecom services provider, according to findings of a survey by YouGov that asked Indian shoppers about their most trusted online brands in India.
Jio, MakeMytrip, and Paytm emerged as the most trusted online brands, while e-commerce retailer Amazon won the maximum trust for online shopping.
YouGov surveyed 1,017 respondents aged 18 to 40(+) on the internet in India in August 2019 for the findings.
They asked respondents to choose between 76 brands across five categories - e-commerce, online travel booking, online payments or e-wallets, cab hailing and mobile network providers.
“While Indians are more trusting of global brands in areas of online shopping and e-commerce, Indian brands are more reliable when it comes to making online payments, for online travel bookings and while choosing a mobile network provider,"" the survey said.
Reliance-owned Jio that disrupted India’s telecom market with cheap data rates, emerged as the most trusted telecom network brand among those surveyed, with 41% respondents saying they trusted the brand. Home-grown Airtel that started offering telecom services to Indians in the 90s emerged the second most trusted, with around a third of respondents placing their trust in the brand. Vodafone ranked third with 16% respondents saying they trust the telecom provider.
“It has been only four years since (Jio) the brand launched in India, however, it has managed to completely change the game for telecom players in the country,"" the survey said.
When it came to online shopping, Amazon emerged the clear winner.
YouGov noted that 45% of those surveyed said Amazon was a brand they trusted when it came to shopping online for fashion. Home-grown retailers such as Flipkart (21%) and Myntra (13%) ranked second and third, respectively. Fashion apart, Amazon also garnered maximum trust when it came to shopping online for electronics, with half of those surveyed putting their trust in the US e-commerce retailer. In comparison, a quarter (25%) trust Flipkart when buying electronics online.
For online travel bookings, MakeMyTrip was trusted by 34% of those surveyed, followed by Paytm(17%), and Goibibo (6%).
In the case of online transactions, SoftBank-backed online payments firm Paytm was the obvious choice for most. Over 40% of those surveyed said they trust Paytm. Interestingly, Google Pay that entered India’s digital payments market more recently, in September 2017, was second, with a trust vote of 27% of those surveyed. Flipkart-owned PhonePe ranked third with 10% respondents saying they rest their trust in the brand.
“Although Google Pay was launched in 2017, it is steadily increasing its user base. More than a quarter (27%) said they trust Google Pay to make online payments,"" YouGov said as part of its findings.
YouGov also tracked consumer trust for ride-hailing and renting cabs where safety trumps other features when it comes to consumer preferences. Both San Francisco-based Uber Technologies and Bengaluru-based Ola emerged as most trusted ride-hailing apps."
243,2019-08-13,Reliance,"As part of Jio Fiber's premium offering - Jio First Day First Show - customers would be able to watch movies on the release day itselfPVR said theatrical and at-home are two completely different experiences

NEW DELHI :
Multiplex players have expressed confidence in the theatrical exhibition business in the country, even as Mukesh Ambani unveiled ""a disruptive concept"" for watching new movies at home on the release day as part of Reliance's Jio Fiber premium offering.
The country's largest multiplex operator, PVR which runs nearly 800 screens in the country, stated that theatrical and at-home are two completely different experiences and each has their own places.
Inox Leisure pointed out that producers, distributors and multiplex owners in India have mutually agreed to an exclusive theatrical window of eight weeks between the theatrical release of a movie and release on any other platform.
""This exclusive theatrical window is a model that is followed internationally, in order to ensure the robust financial viability of all the segments of the sector, and has been replicated in India,"" said Inox Leisure, which operates about 600 screens across in India.
The producer of the film is the owner of the creative content, and is, therefore, entitled to choose the platform for distribution and consumption of his content, Inox Leisure added in its regulatory filing.
""However, in view of this mutually-agreed exclusive theatrical window, he (the producer) would have to choose between theatrical exhibition or release on any other platform, since release on both simultaneously would breach the mutually-agreed exclusive theatrical window,"" it added.
Both these experiences have co-existed and prospered for decades and will continue to so in future, PVR said in a filing to BSE, adding that it is extremely buoyant about cinema exhibition’s growth prospects.
Given India’s low screen density and the growth potential it offers, PVR expects cinema exhibition to continue expanding its footprint in India for the next multiple years, which will continue growing its contribution to the overall revenue of the filmed entertainment.
Ambani on Monday announced the roll-out of Jio Fiber from September 5, promising free voice calls for life from landlines, 100 mbps minimum broadband speed at subscription starting from  ₹700 a month and free HD TV set on a commitment to an annual plan.
As part of Jio Fiber's premium offering - Jio First Day First Show - customers would be able to watch movies in their living rooms on the release day itself. This service will be launched in the mid 2020.
""...For the first time in India, we are introducing a disruptive concept for watching new movies. Premium Jio Fiber customers will be able to watch movies in their living rooms the same day these movies are released in theatres,"" he said.
Shares of the two listed multiplex operators declined in morning session, with PVR shedding 2.45 per cent and Inox Leisure slipping 2 per cent.

242,2019-08-13,Reliance,"Future Retail is seeking a valuation of about  ₹2,000 crore from Amazon for the stakeThe sale will give Amazon the option to buy more shares from Kishore Biyani, Future Retail’s founder and chairman

BENGALURU :
Amazon.com Inc. is in late-stage talks to acquire as much as 10% of Future Retail Ltd, people familiar with the negotiations said, as the US company moves to bolster its brick-and-mortar presence in one of the world’s fastest-growing retail markets.
India’s No. 2 retailer by turnover, Future is seeking a valuation of about  ₹2,000 crore  ($281 million) from Amazon for the stake, according to the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. The sale is likely to be routed through a holding company, they said, and will give Amazon the option to buy more shares from Kishore Biyani, Future Retail’s founder and chairman.
The deal with the Mumbai-based company, which operates its flagship “Big Bazaar"" grocery store chain, will give Amazon more exposure to the business after it bought Whole Foods Market Inc. for $13.7 billion in 2017 and secured a foothold in the U.S. food retailing segment. The proposed investment in Future Retail offers some parallels, enabling Amazon to tap into India’s rising demand for household products and home-delivered fresh produce and vegetables.
Discussions are yet to be finalized, and the deal could still falter or be delayed. Representatives for parent company Future Group and Amazon in India said they don’t comment on market speculation.
Last Market
The potential deal underlines the American online giant’s ambitions to dominate the last sizable market yet to be conquered by large networks of hypermarkets and supermarkets, after losing ground in China.
It’ll also give the Jeff Bezos-controlled firm an edge over rival Walmart Inc. and the planned e-commerce venture of Mukesh Ambani, Asia’s richest man, that plans to combine the online and offline retail formats in India. Walmart, which spent $16 billion last year to acquire Indian e-tailer Flipkart Online Services Pvt. Ltd., has a local unit that is allowed to sell goods to smaller grocery stores but not directly to consumers.
Amazon has been acquiring tiny stakes in other Indian brick-and-mortar chains such as Shoppers Stop Ltd. and a grocery chain from the Aditya Birla Group in the past couple of years.
That’s on top of directly plowing in $5.5 billion into its own operations in a bid to grab a bigger slice of India’s modern retail market which, according to consultant Technopak Advisors, will more than double to $188 billion by 2023, up from $79 billion last year.
Discussions between the Seattle-based retailer and Future Group revived recently, said the people, after waning earlier this year when India tightened rules related to online retail, throwing Amazon and Walmart’s grand plans for the nation in disarray.
Future Retail operates over 2,000 stores across 400 Indian cities, including the “Big Bazaar"" stores that are designed to appeal to the value-conscious urban consumers who have traditionally shopped in India’s chaotic street markets.
More recently, it has been building out its network of small-format corner stores that seek to provide the same convenience of the traditional grocery stores that dot every neighborhood in India. Future Retail is also expanding its affordable fashion wear chain under the “fbb"" brand.

246,2019-08-13,Reliance,"Over the last one year, RIL has taken many steps towards reducing its mammoth debt on the booksRIL said it aims to be debt-free by March 2021

Analysts have never been more pleased after a Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL) annual general meeting (AGM) than this year. The singular focus on deleveraging the company’s balance sheet has brought immense relief for investors. RIL shares soared 9% in early trade on Tuesday after the company said it aims to be debt-free by March 2021.
“What caught our eye, though, was its target to cut headline net debt (now  ₹1.57 trillion) to zero by March 2021 implicitly acknowledging investor concerns on its balance sheet,"" said analysts from Jefferies India Pvt Ltd in a report on 12 August.
RIL told analysts Saudi Aramco will acquire a 20% stake in its refining and petrochemicals businesses for roughly $15 billion.
Over the last one year, RIL has taken three big steps towards reducing its mammoth debt on the books. It has transferred its telecom unit, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s infrastructure assets off RIL’s balance sheet to an InvIT structure. “This potentially reduces liabilities by about  ₹1 trillion,"" analysts from Centrum Broking Ltd pointed out in a report on 13 August.
Secondly, RIL will get  ₹7000 crore from BP for acquiring 49% stake in its petro-retail business. Thirdly, the Saudi Aramco deal will potentially reduce another Rs1 trillion from overall debt, said Centrum analysts. Together, this would reduce an estimated  ₹2.1 trillion from RIL’s consolidated debt from September 2018 levels of  ₹3.5 trillion (including  ₹0.8 trillion of suppliers’ credit), according to Centrum. Of course, the Aramco deal is subject to due diligence and the timeline of the receipt of funds may be staggered, some analysts say.
Even so, according to analysts from Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, “The Aramco deal implies a  ₹100 per share upside. The target of 15% 5-year Ebitda CAGR, zero net debt in 1.5 years, Jio/Retail listing in five years and higher dividend/buyback add to the positivity.""
Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
To be sure, these announcements come at a time when RIL’s increasing debt had cast its shadow on investor sentiment. In the past six months, Reliance shares had underperformed the Nifty by nearly 10%. Tuesday's 9% jump nearly wipes this out."

Reliance Industries (RIL) shares today surged as much as 12% today - its biggest one-day gain in over a decade - to  ₹1,302, after chairman Mukesh Ambani at the company's shareholder meeting on Monday announced the Aramco deal, which will help the oil-to-retail-to-telecom group become a zero-debt company. ""We have a very clear roadmap to becoming a zero net debt company within the next 18 months that is by 31st March 2021,"" Ambani said at the company's 42nd AGM. Ambani said Reliance Industries is planning to sell a fifth of its oil-to-chemicals business to Aramco in what would be one of the largest foreign investments in the country.
RIL shares ended nearly 10% higher at  ₹1,275, adding over  ₹70,000 crore to its market cap.
1) Ajay Bodke, CEO for PMS at Prabhudas Lilladher, said: ""Market is going to heartily welcome the seminal announcement by RIL of 20% stake sale in its oil-to-chemical (OTC) business to the world's largest oil company Saudi Aramco. This is arguably India's largest-ever FDI inflow and would help dissipate the gloomy sentiment currently pervading in the economy and stock markets. This program to aggressively pursue deleveraging in businesses such as OTC, fiber and tower and emerge as a zero debt company in the next 18 months will strengthen the consolidated balance-sheet leading to strong valuation re-rating of the stock.""
2) The deal with Aramco, which values the business at $75 billion including debt, also includes an agreement for Aramco to sell up to 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) to Reliance's Jamnagar refinery in Gujarat.
3) RIL had net debt of  ₹154,478 crore as of March 31, 2019.
4) The stake sale and plans to bring in more investors for its consumer businesses is part of Reliance's push to become a zero net debt company by March 2021.
5) Last week, global oil major BP said it was forging a fuel retailing joint venture with Reliance Industries. Reliance is set to own a 51% stake in the venture and the rest will be held by BP.
6) Reliance Industries will receive  ₹7,000 crore from BP Plc, under the deal.
7) The Aramco deal is the latest in a series of moves by Reliance to sell non-core assets, or forge joint ventures, as it seeks to reduce debt.
8) Ahead of the BP deal, Reliance last month announced the sale of the tower assets it owns through an investment trust to Canada's Brookfield Asset Management for  ₹25,000 crore.
9) Ambani also said that the investment cycle for Jio is now complete. He also announced the roll-out of 'Jio Fiber' broadband services from September 5, promising free voice calls for life from landlines, 100 mbps minimum broadband speed at subscription starting from  ₹700 a month and free HD TV set on a commitment to an annual plan.
10) Analysts remain positive on RIL's effort to trim debt. Gagan Dixit, vice-president at Elara Capital, said: ""In near term, it's (Aramco deal) a positive development and would help de-leverage RIL."""

Ambani said the high-speed internet service will be made available to the general public starting 5 September. Jio Fiber's name has been changed from 'Jio GigaFiber' after the company sought suggestions from Jio subscribers. The following key announcements surrounding the fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) broadband service were made during the meeting:
-The subscription to Jio Fiber will start at  ₹700 a month. This is the base plan that offers 100Mbps data speed. The top-end plan for 'power users' is priced at  ₹10,000 that offers unlimited data at speeds of 1Gbps.
-Ambani said the average fixed-line download speed in the US, the most developed economy in the world, is around 90 Mbps. He then compared it to the lowest and highest plans of Jio Fiber. He also declared that the plans will come at less than one-tenth of global rates.
-All the plans will come bundled with a landline connection, HD or 4K set top box and access to Jio's Internet of Things (IoT). Ambani promised free voice calls for life from the fixed line connection. Jio is also bringing down the cost of international voice calling by subsidising rates and will offer offer unlimited ISD calling to US, Canada at  ₹500/month.-
The landline, the broadband and the set-top-box would all be connected via fiber-optic cables.
-Reliance also introduced a 'disruptive concept' of watching movies that it calls 'Jio First Day First Show'. The service will be launched in mid-2020 and it will let Premium Jio Fiber users to watch movies through the service the next day after they are released in theatres.
-Jio says that it has developed an innovative service on its pan-India 4G network called Narrowband Internet-of-Things or NBIoT. Using this service with smart sensors whether residential, industrial or public, the company is looking to connect the whole of India. Jio claims the service will be commercially available from January 1, 2020. Within two years of launch, Jio estimates that there will be more than two billion connected IoT devices in India.

249,2019-08-13,Reliance,"Saudi Aramco paid out almost all its net income in dividends, despite the dwindling price of oilSaudi Arabia wants to raise a record $100 billion from selling a 5% stake in Aramco

Saudi Aramco showed Monday it’s still the world’s most profitable company -- and paid out almost all its net income in dividends -- despite the dwindling price of oil.
Profit slid 12% to $46.9 billion in the first six months of 2019, the state-owned energy giant said in its first-ever half-year earnings report. That easily outstripped corporate titans such as Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and other big oil producers, many of which suffered larger declines in profit as output and crude prices fell.
“We have some of the largest and most productive reservoirs on Earth,"" Khalid Al-Dabbagh, senior vice president for finance, strategy and development, said in an interview. The company’s “unrivaled financial results"" amid lower oil prices are “a testament to our resilience.""
Aramco paid out $46.4 billion in dividends in the first half. That included a $20 billion special payout to its owner -- the Saudi government -- which compares with a $6 billion payout last year. That’s of particular interest to potential investors ahead of an initial public offering planned for 2020 or 2021, though it may not be maintained, according to money manager T. Rowe Price Group Inc.
“We still don’t really have clarity on the dividend policy,"" Willem Visser, a credit strategist at T. Rowe Price, said after Aramco held its first-ever earnings call. Looking ahead, “it will probably be in line with other oil companies at about 50% of net income.""
Aramco, officially known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., published annual financial statements for the first time in April, ahead of a $12 billion bond sale. It’s now preparing for what could be a record IPO, putting the Damman-based company under even greater scrutiny from investors and inviting comparisons with other oil majors.
The average selling price for Aramco’s crude fell to $66 a barrel in the first half from $69 a year earlier, while crude production held steady at 10 million barrels of oil equivalent a day. Unlike most other energy companies, Aramco’s output is controlled by the state -- the world’s biggest oil exporter -- and the hefty royalties and taxes it pays underpin the Saudi economy.
Although the kingdom’s dependence on Aramco places a heavy burden on the company’s cash, its free cash flow increased almost 7% to $38 billion as a result of working-capital movements and lower capital spending.
“This all results in the best financial performance that any investors -- whether debt or equity -- would look for when evaluating a company,"" Al-Dabbagh said. “The company is ready for an IPO,"" he said, reiterating that the decision on when to go ahead, and on which exchange, rests with the government.
Saudi Arabia wants to raise a record $100 billion from selling a 5% stake in Aramco, which would make it the biggest IPO in history and a windfall for any banks that win a role. The kingdom has valued the company at a whopping $2 trillion, though the firm’s 2018 financials indicated a valuation closer to $1.2 trillion.
Acquisition Plans
Saudi Arabia announced plans for an Aramco IPO three years ago, but the sale was delayed to allow the company to acquire chemicals giant Saudi Basic Industries Corp. Aramco sold bonds to buy a 70% stake in Sabic from the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund. And it showed Monday that’s it’s not done yet with acquisitions.
Aramco plans to buy a stake in the refining and chemicals business of India’s Reliance Industries Ltd. as it seeks buyers for its crude and diversification downstream.
Aramco will acquire a 20% stake in the company’s oil-to-chemicals business, including the 1.24 million-barrel-a-day Jamnagar refining complex on India’s west coast, Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani said in Mumbai. Reliance values its oil-to-chemicals division at $75 billion including debt, implying a $15 billion valuation for the stake.
“Aramco has a long-running policy of expanding in major consumer markets in downstream to secure its crude market share,"" said Okan Akin, a credit analyst at AllianceBernstein Ltd. in London. “This deal would also make a lot of geopolitical sense for the Saudis, as it will likely allow them to overtake Iran as the main crude supplier"" to India.
The deal comes amid ambitious plans by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who runs the country day to day, to move the economy away from its reliance on oil sales. Saudi Arabia is getting a makeover under the prince, who assumed his de facto leadership in 2017 vowing to steer the kingdom from its near-total dependence on crude by masterminding reforms known as Vision 2030.

250,2019-08-13,Reliance,"Ambani's move could spark a price war in the Indian cloud market, expected to grow to $5.6 bn in next five yearsAs part of the 10-year alliance, Jio will build data centres across India that will be hosted on Microsoft's Azure cloud

Mumbai/Colombo: Reliance Industries Ltd on Monday announced a partnership with Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, in a move that deepens the offerings of its Jio telecoms unit while posing a direct challenge to rival cloud services providers such as Amazon.com and Alphabet's Google.
As part of the 10-year alliance, Jio will build data centres across India that will be hosted on Microsoft's Azure cloud, Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani told shareholders at the company annual shareholders' meeting.
""We now have the capability to develop truly India-native solutions, including speech recognition and natural language understanding for all major Indian languages and dialects,"" said Ambani, Asia's richest man with a net worth of $46.2 billion according to Forbes.
Reliance's foray into the cloud services market - essentially selling computer services such as website hosting and data storage - could intensify competition in an Indian market dominated by Amazon Web Services (AWS), say analysts.
Ambani disrupted India's telecoms industry in late 2016 when he launched Jio with free voice and cut-price data plans, pushing some rivals out of business and forcing others to match tariffs and consolidate in a crowded sector that once comprised more than 10 carriers.
""Other cloud players like AWS and Google will have to come up with new, perhaps cheaper pricing models for India,"" said Satyajit Sinha, an analyst at tech consultancy Counterpoint.
Ambani has always dubbed Jio a technology company, and used it to launch internet-enabled devices, deliver entertainment services, build fibre broadband and develop other offerings.
The Reliance-Microsoft partnership could help Jio extend its services to India's booming start-up ecosystem.
On Monday, addressing Reliance shareholders via a recorded video message, Microsoft's Indian-born Chief Executive Satya Nadella said: ""Together, we will offer comprehensive technology solutions – from compute and storage, to connectivity and productivity – to small and medium businesses everywhere in the country.""
Our partnership with Jio will bring the power of Azure, Azure AI and Office 365 to millions of businesses in India – helping them innovate and grow. https://t.co/9EYYwPZvX2
PRICE WAR
Jio would provide free connectivity and cloud infrastructure to start-ups, Ambani said, adding the company would offer a ""bundle of connectivity, productivity and automation tools"" to micro, small and medium business for as little as 1,500 rupees ($21.05) a month.
""This pricing of elementary services is really the rock bottom price,"" said Naveen Mishra, of tech researcher Gartner.
Rivals such as Amazon Web Services and Google offer similar services at multiple times that price, and technology analysts said Ambani's move could spark a price war in the Indian cloud market, expected to grow at an average 23% annually over the next five years to touch $5.6 billion.
Amazon's cloud services unit declined to comment on the matter. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""We definitely will reassess whether we should keep using AWS or something else, because storage is a huge cost,"" said Aprameya Radhakrishna, the founder and CEO of Vokal, an audio-video knowledge-sharing platform similar to Quora.
""India is a price conscious nation in general and anything which is competing on price will definitely get attention.""
Reliance's big push into cloud services also comes as India, one of the world's fastest growing web services markets, is framing a data privacy law, drafts of which have emphasized storage of key consumer data locally.
The country's central bank has also asked foreign firms such as Mastercard and Visa to store payments data solely in India.
""Companies that have a fairly mature IT adoption or those that are playing with a lot of Indian consumer data, they might prefer to move to (Reliance) because this data is guaranteed to be stored locally,"" said Krishna Iyer, an independent technology advisor who was previously a senior executive at cloud services firm Akamai Technologies.

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambani’s audacious plan to home-deliver movies on the day of their release could transform movie-watching and reshape India’s  ₹10,000 crore multiplex industry, provided Jio manages to deftly navigate a landscape of producers, exhibitors and top actors, key stakeholders in the entertainment industry.
Shares of multiplex operators plunged on Tuesday, a day after Ambani said premium users of JioFiber, a feature-rich wired broadband service, will get to watch the latest movies on the first day itself. On the BSE, shares of PVR Ltd and Inox Leisure Ltd, India’s largest and second-largest multiplex operators with 800 and 600 screens, respectively, fell more than 4% each. JioFiber will start offering the First Day First Show service from mid-2020.
RIL shares surged 9.72% on Tuesday, the biggest jump since February 2017, even as the benchmark Sensex shed 1.66% to 36,958.16 points.
In separate statements on Tuesday, both PVR and Inox said producers will need to choose between theatrical release and other platforms in the early days of a release.
However, for Jio to pull it off, it first needs a massive content library.
“A part of this could come from the films under production at Jio Studios,"" said film trade and exhibition expert Girish Johar. Known for hits such as romantic comedy Luka Chuppi released this year, Jio Studios has announced a bunch of Hindi movies for the next year, including Ayushmann Khurrana and Yami Gautam-starrer Bala and director Imtiaz Ali’s next with Kartik Aaryan and Sara Ali Khan.
The bigger chunk, however, will come from films acquired from other producers. Currently, there is an unspoken agreement to maintain an approximately eight-week window between theatrical release and digital premieres. Industry experts such as Johar said Jio will have to pay filmmakers a big chunk of their investment upfront and ensure smooth returns on investment because theatres may not screen films if they’re also streaming elsewhere. Jio will need to keep lead actors on its side as well, since they often ensure impressive opening figures by pulling in crowds. While digital deals for films are currently struck at  ₹30-40 crore, Jio could take this several notches up, compelling streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video to act.
Films such as Vikram Bhatt’s 1921 and Rajkummar Rao-starrer Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana have had their day one shows disrupted when multiplex chains pulled them down as they appeared on over-the-top (OTT) platforms simultaneously or within days of their theatrical release.
“It could, however, be a good option for producers making small films that anyway don’t draw crowds to theatres,"" Johar said, adding that the exhaustive library Jio is looking at is likely to be built on the back of non-star driven, niche films.
To be sure, though, if Jio manages to pull this off, it could mean a serious threat to the Indian film exhibition business.
Domestic theatricals contributed about  ₹10,210 crore of the total  ₹17,450 crore generated by filmed entertainment in India in 2018, according to the Ficci-EY media and entertainment industry report 2019. Film exhibition chains are unlikely to take the threat lying down.
“For decades, theatrical release window has been a valuable model for exhibitors and producers alike,"" PVR said in a statement. “In India and globally, producers have respected the release windows and kept a sacrosanct gap between the theatrical release date and the date of release on all other platforms, i.e. DVD, DTH (direct-to-home), TV, OTT etc. Cinemas continue bringing people together to share a communal experience, this irreplaceable element which is at the core of theatrical experience, continues to deliver a robust box office performance not just in a growing market such as India but also in more mature markets such as the US, China, Europe etc. where cinemas have regularly competed with many similar initiatives like Netflix original movies,"" it said.
The producer of the film is the owner of the creative content and is therefore entitled to choose the platform for distribution and consumption of his content, Inox Leisure said in a statement.
“However, in view of this mutually agreed exclusive theatrical window, he would have to choose between theatrical exhibition or release on any other platform, since release on both simultaneously would breach the mutually agreed exclusive theatrical window (of eight weeks),"" it added.
Cinepolis India declined to comment.
Actors such as Salman Khan, Ajay Devgn and Mahesh Babu have also announced forays into film exhibition in recent times."
236,2019-08-14,Reliance,"Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that DTH companies could be most vulnerable to Jio Fiber's plansJio Fiber's plans will be priced between  ₹700-10,000 per month

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio's bundled broadband services plans may leave DTH firms ""most vulnerable"", and work out to be ""neutral to slight negative"" for Bharti Airtel, as it raises competitive heat in corporate and home internet space, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report said on Tuesday.
The view comes after Reliance Industries on Monday revealed its plans for fixed line broadband services 'Jio Fiber' that will offer optical fibre-based ultra high-speed internet bundled with HD television viewing at less than one-tenth of global rates.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch said that direct-to-home (DTH) companies could be ""most vulnerable"" to Reliance Industries' bundled broadband and cable services as they are unlikely to offer dual services. It did not anticipate a direct impact on broadcasters but said that indirect impact on subscription revenue could be felt if DTH/MSOs (multiple-system operator) revenue are affected.
""Long-term impact would be on ad spends if advertisers focus more on advertising on Over The Top (OTT) and spend more on producing quality content to compete with Amazon, Netflix etc,"" it said.
The report did not rule some pressure on Bharti's broadband revenue triggered by Jio's entry in the space. However, it said, impact is likely to be limited as overall fixed broadband penetration remains low (at less than eight per cent) and large greenfiled opportunities remain.
Bharti Airtel did not respond to an e-mail query on the issue.
Jio with over 340 million mobile subscribers has become the country's largest operator in revenue terms within three years of launching its mobile services, and now hopes to pull off the feat in fixed-line broadband services.
Jio Fiber will offer free voice calls for life from landlines, 100 mbps minimum broadband speed at subscription starting from  ₹700 a month and free HD TV set on a commitment to an annual plan. It has declared that the landline rates for international calling will be the ""lowest"", and its plans will come bundled with subscriptions to most leading premium OTT applications.
Jio Fiber's plans will be priced between  ₹700-10,000 per month.
HSBC, however, said RIL seemed to be targeting only a gradual addition of subscribers.
""In its wireless offering, it was easier for subscribers to switch operator but given the low penetration of wireline internet in India, RIL will have to attract new subscribers,"" it said.
The report further said that Hathway, Den, GTPL Hathway (owned or investee companies of RIL) also offer home broadband at price of  ₹350-400 per month but offering lower speeds of 50Mbps, whereas RIL is promising a minimum speed of 100 Mbps at a minimum rate of  ₹700.
""We expect the adoption of this offering to be gradual with a long term view of 4-5 years,"" the report said.
Compared to wireless where prices were at a discount to prevalent rates, Jio Fiber consumers will have to pay more for new technologies, it added.
""On Cable TV, RIL has opened a platform for collaboration with LCOs (Local Cable Operators) rather than announcing any disruptive pricing,"" the brokerage report said.

235,2019-08-14,Reliance,"The Aramco transaction structure is yet to be finalisedRIL expects that the transaction will close before March 2020

NEW DELHI :
Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday said Reliance Industries' announcement of sale of a 20 per cent stake in its oil to chemicals (O2C) business to Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Aramco) will reduce the company's net leverage and is credit positive.
""The O2C business, which has an enterprise valuation of USD 75 billion, includes RIL's refining and petrochemical divisions, and RIL's 51 per cent stake in its fuel marketing business,"" Moody's said in a report.
The company also announced that it has entered into a deal with BP to sell 49 per cent stake in its fuel marketing business in India for USD 1 billion.
""Together, proceeds from these transactions will result in a USD 16 billion reduction in RIL's net debt, which will reduce RIL's adjusted net debt/EBITDA by 1.2x from 3.2x for fiscal year 2019, which ended in March 2019, a credit positive,"" it said.
The Aramco transaction structure is yet to be finalised and also remains subject to regulatory and other approvals.
RIL expects that the transaction will close before March 2020.
It will receive the proceeds in three stages - 50 per cent on closing, another 25 per cent after one year of closing and the balance 25 per cent in the following year.
The O2C business will be carved out into a division where Aramco will have an economic interest. It will have its own management and accounts.
""However, currently there are no firm plans to create a separate legal entity for this division (except for the fuel marketing business, which will be in a separate entity),"" it said.
""The stake sales are in line with the company’s target to reduce its net debt to zero by March 2021 and reflect the company's commitment to maintaining a strong financial profile despite significant capital spending over the last five years,"" it added.

Mumbai: “Anything that can go wrong will go wrong,"" states Murphy’s Law. At the moment, there is everything that is going wrong with the Indian markets. If the micro- and macro-variables are any indicators, it seems more can go wrong.
On normal days, a sharp rally seen in the Reliance Industries Ltd stock such as on Tuesday would have been enough to cushion the market. The stock contributed 94 plus points to the Nifty 50 on Tuesday, but the index still tumbled 184 points, or 1.65%. If not for the rally in Reliance shares, the markets would have well dropped by over 2.5%.
In dollar terms, the MSCI India index has undershot the MSCI EM index since the start of 2019, and the euphoria seen immediately after the election results has worn off.
A global risk-off mode is compounding problems. Argentina's stock market index Marvel crashed 38% in a single day sending global markets in a tailspin, and India was not spared. To top it, tepid domestic earnings and a slowing Indian economy further concerns investors have to contend. Investors at this point are not ready to take any risks when it comes to equity.
“Talks of global recession and fears of a slowdown in the domestic economy have contributed majorly to the current weakness. A probable escalation of US-China trade war and a selloff in Argentina's currency have added to the global woes. Corporate earnings have remained tepid, with an apparent slowdown in consumption sectors,"" said Kaushik Dani, Fund Manager--PMS, Reliance Wealth Management.
Since its peak on June 3, the Nifty 50 has lost about 9.6%. Question is, how much more stress is still left for the bellwether?
Domestic markets are still above its historical average forward price-earnings multiple of about 17 times earnings. “Indian markets were trading at ~20x one year forward earnings at the beginning of earnings season. While the markets have corrected, we expect earnings also to get a downgrade,"" said Sandip Raichura, CEO, retail and distribution, Prabhudas Lilladhar Pvt Ltd.
Given that the demand conditions remain weak, economic growth may take a further hit. Monetary policy has so far not been able to stimulate the domestic economy enough, as a result, brokerages are downgrading economic growth. “Without much scope of immediate fiscal/monetary stimuli, we do not factor in any quick growth recovery. We have recently revised down our FY2020 GDP growth estimate to 6.3% based on the above factors,"" said a recent Kotak Securities Ltd report for institutional clients.
In addition, the Chinese yuan is causing problems for emerging market currencies. The Indian rupee has been weakening in the past few weeks causing foreign portfolio investors to pull out of India markets.
So the current weakness could linger for a long time. Brokerages such as PhillipCapital (India) Pvt Ltd has noted a bear case scenario of 10,000-10400 levels. “However, at its low, the market tends to go to 12-13 times forward earnings, whenever there is a global crisis,"" said a veteran market expert, “as markets always overreact during extremes,"" he noted.
Thankfully such a scenario may not be seen soon, but neither is a recovery. “There could be some temporary relief, but then we are back down again. Basically, just moving in a band and consolidating this year and some part of next year,"" said Amar Ambani, head of research, Yes Securities Ltd. “Till the time the corporate earnings are elusive, I don’t think a sustained up-move in markets can come through again,"" he points out."

Tracking higher global markets, India's stock market indices Sensex and Nifty rebounded today, with some buying emerging in stocks that fell sharply in Tuesday's selloff. After rising over 500 points at day's high, the Sensex ended 353 points higher at 37,311 after US delayed tariffs on some Chinese imports, bringing some relief to global markets rattled by a trade conflict. The broader Nifty ended nearly 1% higher at 11,029. The rupee also rebounded after slumping to 6-month low on Tuesday though it later pared some gains. 
Here are 10 updates from Indian stock markets
1) Among the sectors, financials and auto which were hammered in Tuesday's selloff, led the gains today.
2) Among financials, Yes Banks, which slumped over 10% on Tuesday, rose 4% today. Bajaj Finance, which also fell nearly 6% in the previous session, saw some buying and settled 2% higher.
3) Reliance Industries shares today rose 1% today, extending their Tuesday's 10% gain.
4) Some buying was also seen in auto stocks Hero MotoCorp (+2.6%) and Bajaj Auto (+1.5%).
5) Metals stocks Tata Steel and Vedanta each ended nearly 5% higher as the global risk-on sentiment improved slightly.
6) Data released on Tuesday showed that India's retail inflation rate had eased slightly in July. ""Benign inflation continues to provide some more space for Monetary Policy Committee"" to ease rates further, Kotak Securities said in a note.
7) The finance ministry on Tuesday issued guidelines for rolling out its budget announcement of offering  ₹1 trillion partial credit guarantee to public-sector banks purchasing high-rated pooled assets of financially sound NBFCs. ""We believe that Ministry of Finance/RBI’s recent measures will improve liquidity for retail NBFCs. Trends from 1QFY20 results suggest that select NBFCs have faced challenges in raising funds likely due to exposure constraints of banks and MFs,"" Kotak said in a note.
8) Meanwhile, the rupee strengthened today to a day's high of 70.85 against the dollar, before paring some gains. 
9) Some pharma stocks came under strong selling pressure. Glenmark fell 8%, Sun Pharma declined 5% while Dr Reddy's and Lupin both lost nearly 2% each.

232,2019-08-14,Reliance,"A $22 billion reduction in RIL’s net debt will require more than Aramco’s cash

Does Mukesh Ambani see dark clouds gathering on the horizon? From his message to shareholders, it doesn’t look like India’s richest tycoon is worried. But his actions may reveal more than his words.
At Monday’s annual general meeting, the chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd was brimming with optimism. Not only did he endorse Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of bumping up annual gross domestic product (GDP) by 80% in five years to $5 trillion, he even forecast a $10 trillion Indian economy by 2030. It’s not only possible but “inevitable"", he said.
Something doesn’t add up. If the outlook is so rosy, why is Ambani hitting the brakes on a seven-year, $100 billion investment spree across refining, petrochemicals, telecom and retail? While a breather after such frenzied activity may be understandable, why does he want Reliance to be a zero-net debt company in 18 months? What will it mean for the more than 100 banks and financial institutions around the world that provide India’s largest company and its subsidiaries with billions of dollars, yen, and rupees—in financing and refinancing?
Above all, what will Reliance’s deleveraging mean for India?
In retrospect, I tackled the last question prematurely in October 2016 when Reliance was shouldering 13% to 14% of the entire investment by India’s top 1,250 listed companies as well as Indian Railways and state-owned electricity boards.
My conclusion then was that if Ambani took a year-long vacation, India’s growth outlook could dim. What I didn’t anticipate was that starting a 4G mobile network with lifetime free voice calls and dirt-cheap data was just the beginning rather than the end of Ambani’s telecom ambitions.
The goal of Reliance Jio was to acquire at least half of India’s 1 billion-plus mobile customers, and that required continued spending.
Now that he’s reached 340 million subscribers, though, the endgame is probably not more than a few quarters away. And that’s problematic for the economy. The rest of India Inc. is paralyzed by debt and self-doubt; consumers are overstretched; and so is the government.
A holiday for Reliance would remove from play the only domestic balance sheet with unspent firepower.
The investment cycle for the Jio network is complete, Ambani told shareholders. In other units, too, there’s little left to do.
Ambani is selling 20% of the family jewel—Reliance’s refining and petrochemical operations—to Saudi Arabian Oil Co. even though the goal is more strategic than just shedding debt. As my colleague David Fickling wrote, the $75 billion enterprise value at which Aramco is investing is a lot higher than the business is worth.
Saudi Arabia wants takers for its surplus oil in a world of electric vehicles, and if Reliance’s refinery can provide a profitable outlet for 500,000 barrels per day of Saudi crude by converting it into jet fuel and polymers, then Ambani is doing the right thing by taking Aramco’s money.
A $22 billion reduction in net debt (to reach zero) will require more than Aramco’s cash. Reliance has shoved some borrowings into an infrastructure trust together with telecom tower and fibre assets. It’s also taken on BP Plc as a partner in Indian fuel retailing and oil exploration. If Ambani finds deep-pocketed partners for general retail, as well as for telecom, reaching his goal will be simple enough.
Banks, however, will rue the end of his debt-fuelled expansion if loan syndication deals are only for refinancing and not new money.
As for shareholders, Ambani is telling them that hitting zero-net debt will come with higher dividends, bonus issues and other goodies “at a more accelerated pace than any time in our history"". But investors will struggle to reinvest the cash returned by Reliance.
For one thing, India’s slowdown is deepening. For another, the company’s digitization blitz is causing unpredictable disruption. A day after Reliance told shareholders that they could watch movies on their new home broadband the same day as the cinema release, shares of PVR Ltd, India’s biggest theatre exhibitor, fell more than 8% intraday.
Several Indian business leaders have sounded the alarm on the Indian economy’s increasingly choppy waters. While Ambani may or may not share their concerns, his cautious actions can only serve to bring the storm closer."

MUMBAI :
Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) surged 9.72% on Tuesday, witnessing their biggest jump since February 2017, after its chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani announced the group’s plan to sell a 20% stake in its oils-to-chemicals business to Saudi Aramco.
The sharp jump in RIL shares was in stark contrast to the broader market, which ended the day 1.7% down, as turmoil in Hong Kong and Argentina spooked investors, already on edge over the US-China trade war.
The benchmark 30-share index, Sensex, fell 1.66%, or 623.75 points, to close at 36,958.16 points, while the 50-share Nifty slid 1.65%, or 183.80 points, to end at 10,925.85 points.
Following major announcements at RIL’s annual general meeting on Monday, including the company’s plans to become a zero net-debt company by March 2021, several brokerages have raised their target price for RIL and upgraded the stock. The stock gained for the third consecutive session and added nearly  ₹1 trillion to investor wealth.
In intraday trade, the RIL scrip touched a high of  ₹1,302.5 a share, gaining as much as 12.09%, its highest since 18 May 2009. So far this year, it has risen 13.7%.
RIL plans to sell a 20% stake in its flagship chemicals and refining business to Saudi Aramco in a deal valued at $15 billion, amid plans to cut its massive debt and secure an assured supply of crude oil to its twin refineries in Jamnagar. In addition, RIL will raise $1 billion from BP Plc, which will acquire a 49% stake in RIL’s petro-retailing business.
The broader markets were, however, dragged down following global cues. Global markets, especially Hong Kong, fell as pro-democracy protesters brought the city’s airport to a standstill on Monday. Argentina’s peso as well as equities sank after voters rejected President Mauricio Macri in primary elections.
Among Asian markets, the Nikkei fell 1.1%, while Hang Seng fell 2.1%. European markets FTSE 100 and CAC40 were down 0.4%, while Dax declined 0.7%. Argentina’s S&P Merval index slumped 48.3% on Monday, while S&P Merval Argentina Index dropped 49%.
Back home, auto stocks were hammered, after data from auto industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, showed India’s passenger vehicle sales in July fell 31%, its steepest drop in two decades. Car sales fell 36%, while truck and bus sales fell 26%. Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd declined 6.1%, Eicher Motors Ltd fell 5.3%, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd dropped 4.7%, Hero MotoCorp Ltd lost 2.1%, and Bajaj Auto dipped 1.3%.
Investors were also disappointed after the government did not announce any measure to exempt foreign investors from the increase in surcharge on the super-rich. The dominant sentiment among investors continued to be that of caution amid the sharp decline in vehicle sales in July and rising geopolitical tension, following the removal of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status.
“Global crackdown due to political uncertainty in Argentina and Italy impacted our market. Domestic market is floating on a hope that the government will come out with supportive measures as indicated in the meeting with finance minister. Till measures are implemented, the market will react based on economic data, which continues to be weak,"" said Vinod Nair, head of research, Geojit Financial Services Ltd.
Expectations of a roll-back of the higher surcharge on foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) drove Sensex to a 900-point rally on Thursday and Friday last week.
However, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman gave no such indication at a meeting with FPIs on Friday."
227,2019-09-23,Reliance,"Reliance may upgrade its chemicals business once it repays its  ₹1.54 trillion of outstanding debtPetrochemicals accounted for 44% of RIL’s operating profit in the June quarter, up from 40% in the year earlier

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), which aims to become a debt-free company by March 2021, may start spending heavily again to upgrade its chemicals business once it repays its  ₹1.54 trillion of outstanding debt, two people aware of the talks said.
“The required capex is part of RIL’s oil-to-chemicals strategy to transform the Jamnagar refinery, which would take the company from primarily being a producer of fuels to chemicals for higher margins,"" one of the two people said, requesting anonymity.
The new capex plan in the works indicates that RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani is unlikely to pause for long after a seven-year investment spree that culminated in unit Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd gaining the leadership position in India’s telecom market, upending the established order.
RIL did not reply to an email seeking comment till the time of going to press.
Upgrading its petrochemical facilities will help RIL produce higher margin products from crude oil and prepare for a future when fuel demand will diminish because of the popularity of electric vehicles.
In August, RIL said it planned to sell a 20% stake to Saudi Arabia’s Aramco in its refining and petrochemicals business for $15 billion as part of a plan to pare its massive debt. According to the terms of the deal, Saudi Aramco will also supply 500,000 barrels per day of crude oil to RIL’s twin refineries in Jamnagar.
RIL has developed a multi-zone catalytic cracking process that converts a wide range of feedstock to high-value propylene and ethylene. The company plans to eliminate all refined products that are priced below crude for chemicals at the initial stage. However, the final fuel configuration will see the elimination of petrol and diesel to facilitate RIL’s plan to move into electric mobility as transport fuel demand declines.
Petrochemicals accounted for 44% of RIL’s operating profit in the June quarter, up from 40% in the year earlier.
“RIL has provided a road map of over 70% conversion of crude refined to high-value petrochemicals in phases over 10 years. We believe RIL will need to raise petchem capacity by 20mt towards this,"" Gagan Dixit, an analyst at Elara Capital, said in a 26 August note.
“If capex required is $800 million per tonne, similar to the recent expansion, then capex would be  ₹1,120 billion,"" Dixit added in the note."
228,2019-09-23,Reliance,"IUC is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networksTrai has floated a consultation paper to see if the date for scrapping IUC should be revised

NEW DELHI :
Without naming Reliance Jio directly, Bharti Airtel has alleged that it was gaming the interconnect usage system by reducing its outgoing call ringing time. It added that the change in pattern results in a missed call, and forces the call receiver on another network to dial back and, hence, create incoming call traffic for Jio.
This diverted incoming traffic would help Jio, which has just 36% of its total voice traffic as incoming calls, make 6 paise on every call that lands on its network, Airtel, India’s second largest operator by revenue, has alleged.
Interconnect usage charge, or IUC, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks. At present, the IUC is at 6 paise a minute.
Airtel’s allegation comes a week after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) floated two separate consultation papers. On 18 September, the regulator floated a fresh consultation paper to see if there was a need to revise the date for scrapping IUC, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic.
On 16 September also, Trai had issued a consultation paper to decide the ideal call ringing time, after receiving complaints that an operator had reduced the duration to 20 seconds on its network.
“This could be true (one large 4G-only particular operator gaming the IUC regime),"" an Airtel official said, requesting anonymity without naming Jio.
Reliance Jio is the only operator in the country which has a 4G-only network. All other telcos have 2G and 3G as well.
“For example, if one operator reduces the ringing time for outgoing calls to other networks (say from 45 seconds to 20 seconds) it leads to a lot of customer inconvenience since the calls are cut off even before the receiving customer had the time to pick it up,"" the official added.
Once a customer receives a missed call he or she usually calls back the originating operator’s network. “By converting such outgoing calls to incoming calls, one large operator is not only getting IUC from other operators, but also trying to reduce the asymmetry of traffic artificially. This is to show symmetry in traffic in the run up to the proposed implementation of zero IUC,"" the official alleged.
Jio, on the other hand, has alleged that while the incumbent operators have a ringing time of 30 seconds, globally, most operators have an average ringing time of 15-20 seconds, which includes Vodafone UK. “25-30% of calls landing onto the large 4G operator’s network are missed calls. Users from incumbents network, who are paying  ₹1.5/min for calls, request Jio users to make a free voice call to them by giving a missed call, thereby creating this traffic mismatch. Incumbent operators are creating this mismatch and wanting to monetize it, too, by asking for 6p/min IUC revenue,"" a Jio official said, requesting anonymity.
Jio has also alleged that if all operators were made to upgrade their networks to 4G and charge their customers at par, there will not be any traffic asymmetry.
Mint has ascertained that a call made from Jio to Vodafone rang for 20 seconds, while a call from Vodafone to Jio lasted 44 seconds.
Email queries to Airtel and Jio were unanswered till press time.
In September 2017, Trai reduced IUC to 6 paise per minute, effective 1 October 2017 and to zero from 1 January 2020. Earlier it was 14 paise. Incumbents, already reeling under the fierce price war triggered by the launch of Reliance Jio in September 2016, were severely impacted by the Trai order. Airtel and Vodafone resisted the change, while Jio was in favour."
230,2019-09-23,Reliance,"The certification may not be extended to international content, and may only apply to Indian originalsSelf-regulation classifies content into separate and distinct categories such as meant for general or universal viewing

NEW DELHI :
The ministry of information and broadcasting (I&B) is looking to finalize a model for the certification of online video streaming content soon after Diwali, people familiar with the development said. While nine video streaming sites in India had decided to adopt a self-regulatory Code of Best Practices under the aegis of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (Iamai) earlier this year, a couple of new shows have raised concerns in the corridors of power, they said.
These include Leila on Netflix that hints directly at the repercussions of right-wing Hindu fundamentalism and the kind of dystopian society it could create, and Gandii Baat on ALTBalaji that features erotic-themed stories from rural India. To be sure, both Netflix and ALTBalaji were among those, along with Hotstar, Voot, ZEE5, Arre, SonyLIV, Reliance Jio and Eros Now, that had agreed to self-regulation. The self-regulatory code by streaming platforms banned content which is anyway prohibited, including child pornography, content encouraging acts of terrorism and disrespect to national symbols or outraging religious sentiments, among others.
Further, self-regulation classifies content into separate and distinct categories, such as meant for general or universal viewing; content that requires parental guidance and/or content that is solely meant for age-appropriate audiences (such age-appropriate audience may be further sub-categorized into different age groups). Platforms are also required to display a content descriptor or guidance message that indicates and informs the viewer about the nature of the content, particularly around age-inappropriate content for minors.
Lastly, the signatories to the code agreed to a grievance redressal mechanism whereby they would appoint or institute, as part of their operational systems, a dedicated person, team or department, to receive and address any consumer-related concerns and complaints in relation to the content they are showcasing.
The I&B ministry did not respond to Mint’s queries on its plans for a certification provision. “Our pitch to the government for the past few months has been multi-fold,"" said a senior executive from a leading over-the-top (OTT) video streaming platform, on condition of anonymity.
“The video streaming industry in India is barely five years old. Its basic tenet always was democratization and the government cannot tell us how to run it on the basis of what it thinks is right or wrong, without regulating the broader social media and internet space in the country, where all kinds of objectionable content is readily available, be it Facebook or apps like Tik Tok,"" the person added.
Besides, most OTT services, such as Hotstar, ZEE5 and VOOT, in India are owned and operated by television broadcast networks, which already know how to adhere to multiple regulations when it comes to the small screen. “They will not be stupid enough to disturb the harmony of a space that is working towards digital inclusion, or bringing all of India under the ambit of digital education and content consumption,"" the senior executive said, adding: “This just shows an inherent lack of trust in us.""
To be sure, the certification will not be extended to international content available on these platforms, but will only apply to Indian originals, the first person cited above said.
Yet, other OTT platforms are optimistic about the new move. They are certain that it will not lead to censorship. Most say, in its conversations, the government has hinted at mostly wanting a mechanism for taking a platform to task for objectionable content, not actually filtering everything that goes out.
“I don’t think they will come down too hard on the industry. The idea is to come across as fair and transparent because there is some kind of clamp on the movie and TV industries,"" said a second streaming platform executive. “The goal is to get OTT players to become reliable and responsible as the whole ecosystem grows and cord-cutting becomes a reality in India.""
According to the Ficci-EY media and entertainment industry report 2019, paid video subscribers grew from around 7 million in 2017 to 12-15 million in 2018, while video subscription revenues grew almost four times in 2018 to  ₹13.4 billion. Countries, such as the US and the UK, do not look at certification or censorship norms for online video, if content is deemed offensive in terms of, say, hate speech or child pornography, it is seen as a criminal offence."

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Capital's deal to sell its entire stake in mutual fund arm to joint venture partner Japan's Nippon Life Insurance will be completed by the end of this month, RNAM CEO Sundeep Sikka said on Monday.
Post stake-sale, Nippon Life Insurance will own 75% stake in Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management (RNAM) for the long term, and the rest will be owned by public, including few marquee investors, Sikka said at the company's annual general meeting.
Sikka said that there would be a change in brand name following the completion of transaction and the company name in due course. However, there will not be any change in management team pursuant to this transaction.
""Reliance Capital's stake sale to Nippon Life transaction to be completed by the end of this month,"" Sikka said.
Reliance Capital had announced in May that it had signed binding definitive agreements with Nippon Life Insurance of Japan. Under the deal, Reliance Capital will exit the mutual funds business by selling its stake in RNAM to Nippon Life Insurance.
At the time of announcement, both partners held 42.88% stake each in the company, while the rest was with public shareholders.
Reliance Capital, which will receive  ₹6,000 crore through sale of its stake, will utilise the amount to pare its debt.
Speaking about corporate rate tax cut announced by the government last week, Sikka said the move will boost earnings by around 10 per cent.

231,2019-09-23,Reliance,"Firms move into new businesses, especially if the core business is unable to deliver growth

Nobody understands the world completely. It’s far too complex for a single brain to comprehend. Even the best minds identify that tiny part or minuscule patch as a runway to take off and fulfil their dreams. Legendary investors Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger term this “tiny part"" as “circle of competence,"" an area that one knows more than others. It has served as a life motto for both: know your circle of competence, and stick within it. The size of that circle is unimportant but knowing its boundaries is vital. Tom Watson, Founder of IBM, a true believer in the philosophy to operate within ones’ circle of competence, has famously added, “I’m no genius. I’m smart in spots – but I stay around those spots.""
Our circle of competence can be widened, but only slowly and over time. Investors often tend to confuse familiarity with competence, leading to disaster. In fact, circle of competence, as a theory, explains several corporate failures throughout history, including the fall of iconic brands back home such as Kingfisher Airlines and Reliance Communications.
Yet, no discussion on ‘circle of competence’ and ‘diversification’ can be complete without General Electric (GE).
Market capitalization of GE, under Jack Welch, grew from $12 billion in 1981 to $410 billion in 2001. GE acquired 600 businesses, allowing it to beat organic growth expectations. Fast-forward to 2019—GE’s market capitalization has shrunk to $76 billion and it was ejected from Dow Jones Industrial Average (index representing largest public companies in US) in June 2018.
One of the key reasons for GE’s eventual failure, experts agree, is the same that got GE to its ‘stardom’ in first place—diversification—and this is a paradox because in a way, GE both validates and contradicts theory of ‘circle of competence.’ And yet, it is not just the large conglomerates, even startups are breaking out of their ‘circle of competence.’
India’s top unicorns, Flipkart and Ola, have diversified into a variety of businesses from book review and music to lending and food delivery, many of which were not as successful and closed down within a year of operations.
In hindsight, often diversification decisions are perplexing.
A traditional point of view is offered by ‘agency theory,’ that argues that managers, who decide on diversification decisions, are not full residual claimants (not owners of the firm) and hence make decisions that increase their short-term utility and pay-out, while potentially decreasing the firm value. In fact, investors tend to increase the discount (conglomerate discount) rate to value very diversified firms and yet companies keep falling back to diversification, as a growth model.
Other point of view is pursuit of ‘growth’ - companies, often move into new markets or businesses, in pursuit of ‘high growth’ that could translate to ‘higher valuation,’ especially if the core business is unable to deliver expected growth. Such motivations are more plausible ones now, particularly in the world of over-capitalized startups which have a constant need to justify high valuations, thereby feeling a pressing need to keep painting a new growth story all the time.
Look at Uber, whose core business - cab hailing services - registered a slowdown in the last quarter of 2018 as per it’s S1 filings, has diversified into food deliveries and logistics, to keep the revenue growth rates up. Uber's Q4 net revenues minus incentives fell compared to Q3. Its year - over- year revenue growth has slowed in each of the past six quarters, with the rate it reported for the second quarter of 2019 - 14% - its slowest yet.
Oyo, yet another Softbank backed hotel and homes aggregator, is moving into an already competitive markets: co-working, co-living, leisure and reportedly coffee chains. In th long run start-ups operating in ‘conglomerate’ style, diversifying horizontally, may not add as much value as expected. In fact, investors tend to discount the sum-total valuation of very diversified-conglomerate (‘Conglomerate discount’). However, often outsiders tend to misjudge the circle of competence of companies, more so when it’s an agile technology start-up.
In my recent candid interaction with Ritesh Agarwal, founder of Oyo, he clears the air on the circle of competency of Oyo, which he defines as ability to acquire real estate and renovate it in real time, operate it well, and ensure best yield per square feet – all of which resonates with the new business ventures Oyo is planning. Traditionalists may differ.
On the other hand, India’s most successful conglomerate, Reliance Industries' core hydrocarbon business has delivered tremendous wealth for the group. And yet, company is exploring divesting its hydrocarbon business – it has divested 49% of its petroleum retailing arm to BP (UK) for a consideration of $1 billion, and plans to divest 20% its refinery business to Saudi Aramco for $ 15 billion – and expanding its digital operations under ‘Jio’ brand (from Connectivity, Bundled Data Services, Cloud datacentres, E-Commerce and Internet of Things) in de-novo, unexplored territories.
A look at the cover-page of Reliance Industries’ annual report (“The Jio Revolution"") conveys the intent and scale of diversification, that extends beyond just business to perception and culture in the group.In case of Reliance, diversification is about allocation of its capital in high growth space. As we witness the end of hydrocarbon supercycle due to climate change concerns, growth of clean-technologies and discoveries in shale, allocation of investable capital in ‘new economy’ areas will create significant value for shareholders. Just to illustrate this, petrochemical business is valued at 6.5-7.0x EBITDA (at best), while online/ digital services are valued at 17-18x EBITDA (at least).
So, the paradox remains – can businesses create wealth outside their circle of competency.
Successful companies, such as Alphabet and Amazon are able to do this day-in and day out. But the key learning here is to fix the core first.
Many practitioners believe that the recipe lies in balancing the portfolio of products and services in an innovation ecosystem.
One of the framework, that lends a perspective to this portfolio balancing, is Nagji and Tuff’s Innovation Ambition Matrix that defines innovation as either core (improving existing products for existing customers), adjacent (expand into new areas, i.e. new markets or products, that are already tested by someone else), and transformational (create products that do not exist for markets that do not exist). Research suggest that the ‘magic ratio’ of allocation of capital that has worked for most successful companies is 70:20:10 across core, adjacent and transformation innovation (45:40:15 for technology companies). Irony, is that companies such as Oyo and Reliance are even defying these principles set out by practitioners. Oyo, for example, is leap-frogging to transformational innovation without even consolidating its core business that is still loss-making. Reliance on the other hand, seems to completely, invert the ‘magic ratio’ of allocation of capital: maximum allocation of investments in transformation innovation.
While the jury is still out in this battle of convictions, one can sit and watch as the game unfolds.

Mumbai: Reliance Brands Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd, is gearing up to open the first store of the iconic American jeweller Tiffany & Co in India at Delhi's The Chanakya Mall in January.
In August this year, the Mukesh Ambani-group company entered into a partnership with Tiffany & Co for bringing the jewellery brand to India.
""We are opening the first Tiffany store in January, 2020 at Chanakya Mall in Delhi,"" said Darshan Mehta, chief executive officer (CEO), Reliance Brands Ltd on the sidelines of the India Retail Forum 2019 held in Mumbai.
Tiffany is one of the latest brands that the Mumbai-based firm has added to its growing portfolio of luxury and premium fashion labels. Earlier this year, the company bought out British toy retailer Hamleys for GBP 67.96 million (about  ₹620 crore) in an all-cash deal.
At present, the company manages over 60 brands including Kate Spade, Muji, Steve Madden, Superdry, Diesel, Hunkemoller, Iconix, Juicy Couture, among others. It also has 420 single-brand stores and retails via 350 shop-in-shops in India.

""There is increased evidence of these factors playing out, which should raise investor confidence on the 17 per cent EPS growth we expect over F2019-21,"" Morgan Stanley said.
As one of the most complex refiners, RIL should be the biggest beneficiary in Asia from International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations that from January 2020 bar use of fuel with more than 0.5 per cent sulphur in ships. This will lead to a rise in diesel demand.

As the January 1, 2020 IMO implementation deadline approaches, diesel margins have risen 9 per cent since end-2018 and gasoline margins have improved as refineries try to maximise diesel output by lowering gasoline output.
""Cheaper gas prices should keep RIL's operating cost inflation low,"" it said. ""RIL has highlighted its plans to lower debt by F2021 as it divests assets and slows its investments. We estimate a 40 per cent reduction in capex by F2021 (from F2019 levels) and near breakeven FCF.""

Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd has moved to create a segregated portfolio (side-pocket) in lieu of its exposure to erstwhile owner Reliance Capital, which defaulted on its debt. Reliance Capital missed a coupon (interest) payment due on 9 September and made delayed payment on 11 September. However a delay constituted an event of default and CARE Ratings downgraded Reliance Capital to D (default) on 20 September, after business hours. Reliance Capital is in the process of completing its stake sale in Reliance Nippon AMC to its minority partner, Nippon Life of Japan.
Side-pocketing is a procedure that capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced in December 2018. A side-pocket is a part of a mutual fund’s portfolio that is set aside in lieu of bad debt. Existing investors cannot redeem this portion, except by selling units on a stock exchange and fresh investors cannot enter it. However existing investors can exit their remaining investment in the affected scheme. These investors are paid back money against this portion when there is recovery in the bad debt in question.
Earlier in August, Reliance Nippon AMC amended its scheme information documents (SIDs) to incorporate side-pocketing. This entailed giving investors an exit load-free window period in which to move out of the scheme. This window period ends on 24 September. Trustees of Reliance Nippon Life AMC have approved the creation of a side-pocket with effect from 25 September.
Reliance Nippon Life AMC is exposed to Reliance Capital through two of its schemes–Reliance Equity Savings Fund (5.25% of the portfolio) and Reliance Equity Hybrid Fund (0.23% of the portfolio). In absolute terms, the exposure stands at  ₹60.1 crore and  ₹21.7 crore in the two schemes, respectively. “There are three lessons from this crisis for investors. First, the quality of the promoter of the mutual fund and of the investee company matters. Second, diversification matters–earning a few basis points through concentrated exposures tends to backfire in debt schemes. Third, cyclicality of the borrower’s business matters.

Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd on Tuesday surged over 4.8% to hit a six-week high, adding over $10 billion in market valuation in the last three sessions, following a cut in the corporate tax rate announced by the government.
Intra-day, the stock touched a high of  ₹1,298.55 on the BSE , a level last seen on 14 August, and gained as much as 4.84%. At 11 am, the stock was trading at  ₹1,294, up 4.45%, from its previous close. In the last three sessions, the scrip has risen over 10%. So far this year it is up 15.3%.
On Tuesday, Mint reported that the company was likely to start spending heavily to on upgrading its chemicals operations once it repaid its entire debt. Upgrading its petrochemical facilities will help RIL produce higher-margin products from crude oil and prepare for a future when fuel demand diminishes because of the popularity of electric vehicles.
In August, RIL said it planned to sell a 20% stake to Saudi Arabia’s Aramco in its refining and petrochemicals business for $15 billion, as part of a plan to pare its massive debt. According to the terms of the deal, Saudi Aramco will also supply 500,000 barrels per day of crude oil to RIL’s twin refineries in Jamnagar.
Gains in the stock were also due to the recent cut in corporate tax rate by the government. According to brokerage firms, Jio and the company's retail operations will be the biggest beneficiaries of the move.
""Tax rate reduction likely by 2-3% at the consolidated level. Combining the benefits at Jio (MAT rate reduction) and at retail operations, the overall tax rate reduction at consolidate operations could be lower by 2-3%"", Credit Suisse said in a 23 September report.
According to brokerage firm Credit Suisse said, Jio is currently on the MAT tax rate and would benefit from the reduction in MAT. P&L tax rate for Jio is 35%, but that is due to the high deferred tax liability creation (accelerated depreciation in income tax books). Due to the high depreciation in income tax books, carried forward losses for Jio are still increasing and Jio is currently under MAT.
Retail operations are at a marginal tax rate and will likely transition to the 25% tax regime. Retail operations have one more year of using carried-forward losses and are at a marginal tax rate in income tax books, and therefore would benefit from the reduction in marginal tax rate from 34.9% to 25.17%, according to the report.
However, the brokerage firm expects limited benefit for its refinery and petchem standalone operations. Standalone operations, which mainly comprise profitable refinery and petrochemical business, already benefit from exempted income, and tax rate is 25-27% on income tax books. Therefore the benefit is likely to be limited for standalone operations."

New Delhi: A heavy focus on digital marketing — videos, vernacular content and influencer engagement — is what has been driving the festive sales push of all big e-commerce firms this year. With a clear focus on leveraging the growing demand in tier II and III towns, online companies have been using content and entertainment to woo customers during the festive sale period.
“It is no surprise that the digital platforms are cannibalizing mass media advertising spends owing to the level of smartphones and data penetration. Different categories of online firms will use the media money on various digital assets depending on their individual brand planning and that’s what we are witnessing,"" said Sandeep Goyal, media veteran and chairman, Mogae Media, a Mumbai-based marketing and communication agency.
E-commerce firms, which have been spending big money on mass media channels such as television, have been shifting their advertising spend to digital especially after the launch of Reliance Jio.
Flipkart, for instance, has partnered with a band of regional and local influencers and a diverse portfolio of offline brands, to engage with consumers at every touch point. The objective is to capture the next 200 million consumers, hailing from smaller cities with a need of easy discovery as they navigate the benefits of e-commerce.
The e-commerce firm is leveraging food, fashion and travel to promote its sale. It has partnered with SpiceJet through branded aircrafts with an intention to reach out to seven million consumers. It has also introduced branded whopper burgers in partnership with quick service restaurant chain Burger King.
“Our idea is to be where our consumers are and they are not just accessible through mainstream media channels anymore,"" admitted Vikas Gupta, head of marketing at Flipkart. “We have amped our efforts to democratize commerce by not just facilitating buyers from across the country but also onboard sellers from diversified sectors onto our platform. We also introduced the Hindi interface which will attract a whole new set of consumers, especially from smaller cities, onto the platform.""
Despite a slump in consumer spending and a general slowdown, festival advertising is expected to grow at 10-12% over 2018 to touch as much as  ₹20,000 crore this year with online firms being one of the leading advertisers.
Giving its sale a twist, Paytm Mall has been promoting its festive sale as a ‘Mahacashback Carnival’ to reach out to more than 400 million internet users largely using digital marketing.
“Our audience is 18-28 years and their consumption habits clearly indicate they are digital consuming content on mobile and we would want to heavily focus our efforts on digital platforms like Facebook, video platforms, content portals and Paytm app for online,"" said Srinivas Mothey, senior vice-president, Paytm Mall.
Most promotions will happen on the Paytm app along with specific user profile targeting on content destinations such as Digit, 91mobiles, NDTV Gadgets, Hotstar, YouTube, Facebook, Google, Inshorts and more apps/destinations where younger audience consume content.
Meanwhile, online furniture platform Pepperfry is also relying heavily on engaging digital videos across platforms to promote its Furniture Mania Sale.
“The special feature of this sale is that, we have worked with our merchant partners specially to get new designs and products specifically for the festive season and these will be a part of the Furniture Mania Sale. We will be promoting this new sale concept with short films on various online video platforms,"" said Kashyap Vadapalli, chief marketing officer, Pepperfry."

Amazon’s plan to buy Reliance Retail stake stuck, co explores Max deal
Amazon’s plan to acquire stake in Reliance Retail has likely fallen through due to the high valuation of Mukesh Ambani’s retail business and the American ecommerce giant might have also demurred from such large investment in the Indian market after the government tightened regulations for foreign direct investment (FDI) in ecommerce, The Economic Times reported citing two senior industry executives who have business relationship with Amazon. Reliance has potentially valued the retail business at about  ₹2.5 lakh crore to  ₹3 lakh crore, and given that, Amazon’s initial plans to acquire a minority stake of 10-25% will mean a huge commitment. Amazon was in exploratory talks with Reliance Retail for last 3-4 months. Amazon has now started exploratory talks with Landmark group’s value fashion retail chain — Max — for acquiring a similar minority stake in it. Max had generated sales of about  ₹3,500 crore in 2018-19 and value fashion retailers are typically valued at about 1.5 to 2 times of their revenue, though talk with Amazon is in an early stage right now. Amazon and Max have recently entered into trading arrangement where Max exclusively sells its products through Amazon’s online marketplace in India.

215,2019-09-25,Reliance,"The finding is part of a report titled 'BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands of 2019'This is the sixth consecutive year in which HDFC Bank continued to dominate the ranking

New Delhi: India's largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank, topped the list of the country’s top 70 most valuable brands, according to a report released by marketing and advertising conglomerate WPP Plc and Kantar.
This is the sixth consecutive year in which HDFC Bank continued to dominate the ranking owing to its forward-thinking outlook, new financial products, an ongoing drive towards digital banking and new branches set-up throughout the country. The bank grew 5% in brand value to $22.7 billion, which is a positive contrast to the 8% decline in value of the top 20 global banks.
The 2019 edition of the ranking revealed a 6% rise in overall brand value to $228.2 billion, a moderate pace compared to previous years, given India’s recent macroeconomic challenges. Despite that, such growth is still in line with that of the BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands, as India steadily rises in global economic rankings. The BrandZ study combine companies’ financial data with consumer insight and opinion shows that trust is a key to develop the stability required for long-term success; highly trusted brands in the Top 75 are worth 129% more than less trusted ones.
""For the last five to six quarters our growth rates have been tanking. We are perhaps at our lowest point in the last two decades and these are the reasons why growth has been a challenge this year. Having said that, brands have grown because they had the right conversation with the consumer and offered them the right kind of products/services,"" said Vishikh Talwar, chief client officer, Kantar Insights Division.
Trusted brands include many of the consumer-facing technology platforms and service providers. With a 30% increase in value, this sector was the fastest growing group of brands in the ranking. Some of the notable brands include e-commerce site Flipkart (which occupied 12th spot), which increased its brand value 14% to $4.7 billion, while unicorn brands hotel booking site Oyo ($2 billion), online food ordering service Swiggy ($1.6 billion) and online restaurant marketplace Zomato ($1 billion) are newcomers to the ranking at 30, 39 and 61 ranks respectively.
The fastest riser in the 2019 ranking is telecom provider, Jio, which climbed one place to number ninth spot with a 34% increase in brand value to $5.5 billion. Its disruptive business model has made internet access available to many Indians who were previously unable to afford it, thereby opening up access to digital platforms and services. Vodafone ($2.5 billion) was the top-ranked newcomer at 24th spot.
Both digital and offline brands such as D-Mart (No. 25, $2.4 billion) have found success as a result of the rise of ‘middle India’; the growing number of people in the country’s second, third and fourth-tier cities and towns that are changing India’s traditional urban-rural divide. These previously poorly-served segments increasingly have access to a variety of online services, with Swiggy and Zomato building much of their growth on this shift.
With an expanding choice of offerings to buy, Indian consumers increasingly care more about the quality of service than whether a brand originates in India, as long as it demonstrates that it understands what it means to be Indian. That insight is reflected in the decision by Amazon to launch itself a year ago as India’s ‘neighbourhood shop’.
""Brands should stick to the fundamentals of marketing in the tough times. They should continue to invest, drive innovation, stay connected with the consumer, be authentic and earn their trust. For a corporate firm good brands, built over a period of time, become an insurance against bad times,"" said Preeti Reddy, chief executive, South Asia, Insights Division, Kantar.
Some of the key trends highlighted in the report include increased mobile internet penetration because of Jio phenomenon and renewed competition, retail being the second fastest growing category, with online and offline both growing strongly. New entrant Reliance Retail (No. 55, $1.1 billion) opened nearly 500 new stores and used Jio’s service to connect retail shops with grocery deliveries, while D-Mart ($2.4 billion) focused predominantly on offline, rising two places to No. 25.
Amazon and Flipkart compete with many Indian brands across several sectors, with Amazon also opening its largest campus yet in India. The success of unicorn brands such as Swiggy, Zomato and Oyo is fostering a new-found confidence in India as they look to expand their operations globally."

In a 2018 report titled Green Gaming: Energy Efficiency Without Performance Compromise, researchers from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the US came up with some interesting insights on the energy consumption associated with computer gaming. The team at Berkeley Lab conducted a scientific analysis of energy use across current gaming platforms and game types—testing 37 games across 26 different systems .
The study, sponsored by the California Energy Commission, found that computer gaming accounted for about 5% of all residential energy use in California—the same amount as 10 million new refrigerators. With more than 2.5 billion video gamers around the world, the report said the gaming industry and gamers were “missing out on potential ways to save energy"" and lower greenhouse emissions due to the lack of reliable energy data.
Now, some of the biggest names in the gaming industry have pledged to use their platforms to act on climate change. According to a UN Environment Programme press release, commitments from 21 companies, as part of the “Playing for the Planet Alliance"", in the video-game industry will result in a “30 million tonne reduction of CO2 emissions by 2030"".
These commitments, announced on the sidelines of the UN secretary general’s Climate Action Summit in New York on 23 September, include plans to plant millions of trees, incorporate “green nudges"" in game design and improvements in energy management, packaging and device recycling. Nudging aims to change user behaviour without using force or incentives.
Microsoft, maker of the best-selling Xbox gaming consoles, “will announce the expansion of its operational commitment to carbon neutrality, made in 2012, into its devices and gaming work"". As part of a pilot, the company will certify around 825,000 Xbox consoles as carbon neutral.
Apart from setting a new target to reduce its supply chain emissions by 30% by 2030, the company will try to engage gamers in real-life sustainability efforts through its Minecraft “Build a Better World"" initiative. Minecraft, a sandbox video game that allows players to build things in a 3D world, has more than 100 million users worldwide.
In 2018, around World Oceans Day, Minecraft had released a new game pack update—Update Aquatic—that allowed players to build coral reefs in the virtual world. Some of these in-game designs were then recreated into real-life underwater sculptures made from BioRock, a revolutionary technology that promotes the growth of natural coral reefs. These sculptures were placed on the seabed off the coast of Cozumel, Mexico, as part of a partnership between the game’s developers, Mojang, and a non-governmental organization, The Nature Conservancy.
Sony Interactive Entertainment will unveil new plans to use energy-efficient technology to introduce a new power-suspend mode in its next generation of PlayStation consoles. Cloud gaming service Google Stadia, which is expected to be launched in November, will not only produce a new sustainable game development guide but also fund research into how “green nudges"" can be incorporated into game play, the release states.
In India, Reliance Games, the developer of Little Singham, has pledged to generate awareness among youngsters by making them ambassadors of climate change with the help of in-game events and initiatives. China’s biggest independent gaming platform, iDreamSky, will also include “green nudges"" in its games.
French video-game company Ubisoft, publisher of hit titles Ghost Recon, Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry, will develop in-game green themes and source materials from eco-friendly factories. Sports Interactive, maker of the hugely popular Football Manager series, has committed to eliminating 20 tonnes of packaging by replacing plastic with a recycled alternative for all future releases of the game. It will start with Football Manager 2020, which launches in November."

Nippon Life of Japan is in the process of completing its acquisition of a 75% stake in Reliance Nippon Asset Management Co., as its former partner Reliance Capital makes an exit. Minoru Kimora, executive officer and head of Asia Pacific at Nippon Life Insurance Co., talks about the debt crisis and the new risk management practices that can be brought to India. He also revealed their plans to unveil a new direct selling strategy in the life insurance space
What has your experience of the Indian mutual fund industry been so far?
We invested in Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Co. in 2012 and we saw very good growth over the next seven years. This investment has been one of the most successful ones in our long history. We came to India to try to capture the growth potential in the life insurance and mutual fund industries and we believe that it was right to come to this country. We are long-term-oriented investors. There have been some fluctuations but in the long run, we do not see any big challenge.
What are the risk and asset management practices that Nippon will bring to Indian asset management?
Japan has also learnt from global best practices in both asset management and life insurance. The Indian market is still very domestic in the sense of customers, investors and products. This is because India’s growth potential and higher yields are attractive enough. Indian investors don’t need to go out of India. However, as the market matures, there will be some demand from clients for international diversification opportunities.
A global trend at present is giving due consideration to ESG (environment social governance) factors in the investment process. In India, this aspect is not paid as much attention. But in the long run, consideration of non-financial factors will increase in importance. We can bring these ESG processes to India as global best practices.
In terms of products, there are many outside India in the hybrid and multi-asset space. Here, pure equity or pure debt products dominate. As the market matures, our company can prepare for this shift and build a track record in such products.
A Morningstar report puts India as the fourth most expensive in terms of the equity fund costs out of the 26 markets it tracks. Has the time come to shift from active to passive funds in India?
The global trend is active to passive and it is a very strong and long-standing trend. India is still dominated by active funds. Active funds in India still have a lot of opportunity to create an alpha compared to more mature markets like the US. However, costs may be more important for institutional clients who might hence invest in the passive side. Our passive products in India are a kind of preparation for growth in passive funds.
India has been undergoing a debt crisis for the past year. Several funds of Reliance Nippon Life AMC were found to be holding bad debt. What changes are you making to ensure that this does not happen again?
The current debt crisis in India is a very big one. Investors of not just Reliance Nippon Life AMC but every other AMC are facing a very big challenge. It is similar to the 2008 Lehman global shock. In the long run, our credit team has a strong capability and can analyse and manage the current tough situation. A more robust process in credit analysis, more detailed risk management and control on exposure to single issuers will have to be implemented to avoid a similar situation in the future.
What are the challenges hindering the adoption of life insurance in India?
The life insurance market is growing healthily although some regulations are affecting the behaviour of companies and potential clients. Unit-linked insurance plan (Ulip) is the most popular product and most of it is sold by banks. However, the basic concept of life insurance is protection. In asset management, you can choose mutual fund, life insurance or other types of products but only life insurance can provide protection. As a player in the insurance industry, we should emphasize on protection more not only in terms of death benefit but also in terms of health insurance.
We are focusing strongly on the direct face-to-face distribution channel which we are bringing from the Japanese experience. In this channel, female agents directly sell insurance to clients face-to-face because for protection, people have to be convinced by advisers and this takes a long time. These agents would be paid a fixed amount and they would get commissions if they exceed targets. This is the traditional mode in Japan unlike in India where most agents are commission-based rather than fixed. The advantage of the direct channel is that we can educate our agents on the product and how to communicate with clients and also after-sales service.
How can technology cut expenses and bring mutual funds and insurance closer to clients?
We are implementing a lot of technologies in various areas. For example, our customers can easily connect to the company through mobile applications for insurance claims, questions or procedures like change of address, phone, among others. Our customers can benefit from technology in this way. In India, identification of customer is critical to avoid mis-selling. Facial and voice recognition make it easier to verify identity. We are implementing those kind of things in our operations. Underwriting can also be done through artificial intelligence-based robotics over shorter time frames.
If the FDI cap in insurance changes, will you be open to increasing your stake in the life insurance business?
At this moment, I cannot give a complete answer but we are committed to India for future growth, not only in life insurance but also in mutual funds."

New Delhi: The Vodafone group is focused on successful integration of the brand with Idea Cellular in India, the company’s global CEO Nick Read told reporters after meeting senior officials of department of telecommunications on Monday.
Read is in India with Vodafone Group Chairman Gerard Kleisterlee.
“We had a good meeting (with the government). We look forward to the results of that,"" Kleisterlee said after the meeting.
This meeting comes over a month after Vodafone Idea Ltd, which is in the midst of a complex integration process, said its chief executive Balesh Sharma has resigned citing “personal reasons"" and will be replaced by Vodafone Group’s India representative, Ravinder Takkar.
Sharma’s exit had come less than a year after the merged entity started operations on 31 August 2018. The merged company has since lost market share and posted losses in every quarter of the past year, amid a bruising tariff war.
As of date, Vodafone Idea has completed the network integration process in 11 out of 22 circles and hopes to achieve the rest by June 2020.
Takkar faces the arduous task of ensuring that the integration process is completed smoothly and the company pares its losses.
Vodafone India and Idea Cellular announced their merger in March 2017 in response to the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in September 2016.
Despite the merger, Vodafone Idea has been facing a rough ride, with shrinking revenue and a gross debt of  ₹1.2 trillion as on 30 June.
Since the completion of the merger, the company has lost subscribers every month. Its active subscriber base declined from 334.1 million in the March quarter to 320 million in the June quarter.
Because of the customer churn that was triggered by the introduction of minimum monthly recharge plans in November to weed out low-paying users, Vodafone Idea’s revenue fell 4.3% to  ₹11,269.9 crore in the June quarter from  ₹11,775 crore in the preceding three months. The telecom operator had posted a loss of  ₹4,873.9 crore in the June quarter, despite the company witnessing higher data consumption on its network and signing up more 4G subscribers.
Before that, the company posted a loss of  ₹4,881.9 crore in the March quarter,  ₹5,004.6 crore in the three months ended December, and  ₹4,973.8 crore in the September quarter."

Mumbai: Reliance Capital Ltd will exit its lending business and let its insurance units become long-term value creators, said Anil Ambani, chairman of Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG).
Reliance General Insurance business is currently valued at more than  ₹8,000 crore while Reliance Capital’s total investment in the life insurance business was  ₹3,000 crore.
Elaborating on the company’s plan for its lending businesses, Ambani said Reliance Home Finance and Reliance Commercial Finance are working closely with lenders to finalize a resolution plan, which is expected to be completed by December 2019.
“Reliance Capital will be a financial shareholder in both companies to re-converge shareholder value under the new management and shareholding structure and effectively, debt of Reliance Capital will stand reduced by  ₹25,000 crore,"" Ambani said at the company’s annual general meeting.
Reliance Capital has suffered great collateral damage over the last six months from the crisis in the financial services sector, irrational action by auditors and rating agencies, and the temporary economic slowdown, Ambani told shareholders.
Ambani added that his group has more than  ₹60,000 crore of receivables stuck in regulatory and arbitration matters which have been pending for 5-10 years.
He claimed his group has shown progress in paring debt, repaying over  ₹35,000 crore over the last 15 months. “It is close to repaying another  ₹15,000 crore by March 2020, despite nil funding from any bank, NBFC or financial institution,"" he said.
Reliance Capital said it made interest and principal repayment of  ₹72.65 crore on Friday and Monday on a range of instruments, including non-convertible debentures, term loans and inter-corporate deposits.
It said the company remained current on all its repayment obligations.
Last week, CARE Ratings had downgraded Reliance Capital’s debt to default grade ‘D’ from a stable ‘BB’ earlier. “The liquidity profile of the group continues to be under stress on account of the delay in raising funds from the asset monetization plan and impending debt repayments,"" the rating agency said in the release.
On Friday, the company completed a 21.54% stake sale in Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management to Nippon Life Insurance of Japan for  ₹3,030 crore.
With this, Nippon Life has raised its shareholding to 75% and has become the insurer’s sole sponsor. The company also plans to change its name with prominence given to Nippon India.
In February, Ambani’s telecom venture Reliance Communications Ltd filed for insolvency as its lenders did not receive any proceeds from its proposed asset monetization plans even after 18 months. This comes after its planned asset sale to brother Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio failed to get approval from the Department of Telecommunications.
On Monday, shares of Reliance Capital closed at  ₹24.55—a level last seen on 26 March 1999—down 12.32% from its previous close. Stocks of other group companies too closed at record lows. Reliance Infrastructure Ltd was down 12.3%, Reliance Power Ltd 8.7% and Reliance Communications 1.3%.

203,2019-10-01,Reliance,"Airtel has told Trai that it has cut the ringing time for outgoing calls on a rival network to 25 seconds from 45Last week, Airtel, without naming Reliance Jio directly, alleged that it was gaming the interconnect usage system by reducing its outgoing call ringing time

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel has slashed how long an outgoing phone call will ring before getting disconnected—a tit-for-tat retaliation to a similar move by rival Reliance Jio, as the two companies fight for dominance in the world’s second largest telecom market.
Bharti Airtel, the second-ranked operator by revenue, has told the telecom regulator that it has cut the ringing time for outgoing calls on a rival network to 25 seconds from 45.
The company said it took the step as despite its repeated requests, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has neither directed Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, the biggest telecom operator, to restore the timer to its original duration of 45 seconds nor issued a direction to operators to set the timer to 30 seconds as proposed by most of the operators.
“Therefore, we have reduced the ringing timer to 25 seconds in our network as well,"" Airtel said in its letter to Trai dated 28 September. Mint has reviewed a copy of the letter.
“In the absence of any direction from Trai and to prevent further loss of IUC (interconnect usage charge), we are left with no other option than to reduce the timer in our network as well,"" Airtel wrote.
An emailed query to Airtel went unanswered till press time.
A Jio official, responding to a Mint email, said: “Incumbent operators, to hide their inefficiencies, are blaming it on IUC. It is they who are gaming the IUC regime by charging their 2G/ 3G customers high voice tariffs. Users from incumbents network who are paying  ₹1.5/min for calls request Jio users to make a free voice call to them by giving a missed call, which is as high as 25-30%. Globally, most operators have an average ringing time of only 15-20 seconds, and 25 seconds ringing time on Jio network is in line with global practice.""
Last week, Airtel, without naming Reliance Jio directly, alleged that it was gaming the interconnect usage system by reducing its outgoing call ringing time.
Airtel said the change in pattern results in a missed call, and forces the person receiving the call on another network to dial back, thus creating incoming call traffic for Jio.
This diverted incoming traffic would help Jio, which has just 36% of its total voice traffic as incoming calls, make 6 paise on every call that lands on its network, Airtel had then alleged.
Interconnect usage charge is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks. At present, the IUC is 6 paise a minute.
To be sure, Airtel’s fresh letter comes just a fortnight after Trai floated two separate consultation papers on the issue.
On 18 September, the regulator floated a fresh consultation paper to see if there was a need to revise the date for scrapping IUC, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic. This followed its consultation paper on 16 September to decide the ideal call ringing time, after receiving complaints that an operator had reduced the duration to 20 seconds on its network.
Airtel alleged that once a customer receives a missed call, he or she tends to call back the originating operator’s network.
By converting such outgoing calls to incoming, a large operator was not only getting IUC from other operators, but also trying to reduce the asymmetry of traffic artificially, Airtel alleged, adding that this is to show symmetry in traffic in the run-up to the proposed implementation of zero IUC.
Trai reduced IUC to 6 paise per minute, effective 1 October 2017 and to zero from 1 January 2020. Earlier, it was 14 paise. Incumbents, already reeling under the fierce price war triggered by the launch of Reliance Jio in September 2016, were severely hit by the Trai order. Airtel and Vodafone Idea resisted the change, while Reliance Jio was in favour."

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has thrown an “Einstein Challenge"" to propagate the ideas of Mahatma Gandhi through innovations.
In his opinion piece in the 2 October issue of The New York Times on the occasion of the Mahatma’s 150th birth anniversary, he called upon thinkers, entrepreneurs and tech leaders to take forward Gandhi’s idea of innovation for future generations to remember.
“As a tribute to Gandhi, I propose what I call the Einstein Challenge. We know Albert Einstein’s famous words on Gandhi: “Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth,"" Modi said in the article. “How do we ensure the ideals of Gandhi are remembered by future generations? I invite thinkers, entrepreneurs and tech leaders to be at the forefront of spreading Gandhi’s ideas through innovation,"" he said.
Modi said that from uniting those who believe in humanity to furthering sustainable development and ensuring economic self-reliance, Gandhi offers solutions to every problem.
Writing about certain measures in India to take forward Gandhi’s ideals, Modi said, “In Gandhi, we have the best teacher to guide us. We in India are doing our bit. India is among the fastest when it comes to eliminating poverty.""

207,2019-10-02,Reliance,"Telco to use funds to reduce its consolidated net debt of  ₹1.16 tnBHARTI Airtel’s undersea cable unit Network i2i Ltd will be the official borrower

New Delhi: India’s second largest operator by revenue Bharti Airtel has appointed seven joint bookrunners and joint lead managers to kick start the process of a potential fund raising exercise through dollar denominated perpetual bonds, the company said in an exchange filing on Tuesday.
BofA Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, HSBC, J.P. Morgan and Standard Chartered Bank will conduct a series of fixed income investor meetings/calls across Asia, Europe and the US commencing 2 October for this purpose.
Airtel’s wholly-owned subsidiary Networki2i will be the official borrower and is expected to issue the bonds, the company said, without divulging how much it plans to raise and the use of such proceeds.
The operator is likely to raise $750 million to $1 billion and will use it to reduce debt, a person aware of the development said requesting anonymity. Airtel’s consolidated net debt was  ₹1.16 trillion as of June end.
The exercise to explore a fund raise comes at a time when the company is battling intense competition from rival Reliance Jio that entered the sector in September 2016.
Jio’s strategy to garner subscribers through cheap data tariffs has made it imperative for rivals to pump in funds in the cash-guzzling telecom sector.
To be sure, in March, Bharti Airtel’s promoters and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC had said they will together invest  ₹16,785 crore as part of a rights issue approved by the operator’s board in February as it aims to strengthen its balance sheet and continue investment in networks in a hyper-competitive telecom market.
This had come just a week after the company’s board in February approved a rights issue of  ₹25000 crore as well as raising  ₹7000 crore through foreign currency perpetual bond issue, taking the total capital raise to  ₹32000 crore.
Raising more funds for India business is crucial for Airtel as its profit has fallen every quarter since the entry of Reliance Jio. In fact, in the June quarter, Airtel posted its first quarterly loss in 14 years at  ₹2,866 crore as finance costs rose and it incurred a one-time loss of  ₹1,445 crore. It had recorded a net profit of  ₹97 crore in the June quarter a year earlier.
Airtel’s revenue from India wireless business was  ₹10,724 crore for the June quarter. In comparison, Reliance Jio generated  ₹11,679 crore in operating revenue in the June quarter, beating Airtel on this metric.
The launch of low-cost tariff plans by Reliance Jio, a unit of Reliance Industries Ltd, forced rivals to drop their rates, hurting profit margins. Smaller companies were forced to either shut shop or get acquired, leaving just Airtel, Jio and the merged entity of Vodafone and Idea to compete in the Indian market.
Operators, including Airtel, also need funds to buy airwaves for the launch of 5G services. The department of telecommunications plans to hold the auction in January.
Airtel is also toying with the idea of completely divesting its stake in the proposed merged entity of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel by selling stake to PE funds, Mint had reported on Monday.
The company’s Africa arm -- Airtel Africa -- had in June raised $750 million through an initial public offering (IPO). Prior to that, six investors, including Warburg Pincus, Temasek, Singtel and SoftBank Group International, in October invested $1.25 billion through a primary equity issuance in Airtel Africa. Sunil Kant Munjal of the Hero group was also part of this consortium. In January, Qatar Investment Authority, invested $200 million in the Africa arm."

DHFL: Shares of the troubled housing financier tanked 20% on Tuesday amid uncertainty over its debt resolution. The company submitted its debt-restructuring plan to lenders on Monday, following which speculation that non-bank companies such as mutual funds may face haircuts of more than 40% fuelled the negative sentiment.
Indiabulls Housing Finance: The company refuted charges of financial irregularities, siphoning of funds and regulatory violations by promoters of the company in a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Prashant Bhushan in the Delhi High Court.

198,2019-10-04,Reliance,"Praveen Rai, a corporate lawyer by profession, raised a number of issues at the AGM of Reliance PowerHe said a class action suit will be initiated if the issues raised by him are not resolved

A shareholder in the Anil D Ambani Group of companies (ADAG) has threatened to initiate a class action suit against the group, a first of its kind in India’s capital markets. Praveen Rai, a corporate lawyer by profession, raised a number of issues at the annual general meeting of Reliance Power Ltd, and said that the class action suit will be initiated if the issues raised by him are not resolved.
But on the face of it, there doesn’t appear to be any charges of mismanagement. “We will collect evidence. In a class action suit, we don't require much evidence; the share price fall is enough evidence,"" Rai said on a call. An email sent to ADAG was unanswered at the time of writing.
Experts say such an approach will not yield any results. ""The basis of any class action suit would likely be mismanagement of the company. This ADAG shareholder who has threatened them of a class action suit would need sufficient evidence against the directors and promoters of the ADAG of misuse of funds. For this shareholder to file such a legal action, evidence of management's negligence and improper use of funds would be required,"" said Shriram Subramanian, managing director, InGovern Research.
JN Gupta, managing director, Stakeholders Empowerment Services says, “We need to differentiate between fraud and failure - there has to be enough proof that management's decision to use funds in a particular manner were not in favour of the company. Be it a fraud or a failure, share price will decline in either of the scenario, so a sharp fall in share price alone cannot be an indicator of fraudulent practices."" While Rai has emphasised the huge fall in the value of ADAG group shares as evidence of mismanagement, it can be argued that this could also be a result of a lack of good judgment or poor business conditions or disruption by a new entrant. To link the fall in share price with fraud is easier said than proven, as Gupta points out.
It also goes without saying that Rai will need to find other shareholders who join the fight. “As the name suggests, one shareholder alone cannot a file a class action suit. You would need a group of investors for that,"" says Gupta.
Analysts have noted that the rising debt levels of the group were acting as red signals and that investors should have acted earlier against. “If the shareholder was that bothered about his large investment in the group, he could have voiced his concerns in earlier AGMs - the company has been in bad shape for quite some time. As a shareholder your angst against the company is valid, but you can't wake up at eleventh hour and ask for explanations. As a shareholder you have take a call,"" said a senior executive at a broking form who did not want to be quoted. In other words, the suggestion is that investors should vote with their feet and safeguard their investment before it’s too late.
On the other hand, sources in the Reliance ADAG group said that around 100 shareholders are signing a petition to file a class-action suit against auditor PwC. The compliant there is that the sudden resignation of the auditor caused a financial loss to these shareholders. Earlier, there were reports that the ADAG group may take legal action against PwC.
While Rai has a list of complaints against the running of ADAG companies, his main grievance was the excessive pledging of shares by the ADAG promoter group. This resulted in huge erosion in the value of his investments in the company, he alleged.
At the AGM, the lawyer noted that his investments in the ADAG group stocks have tumbled 90% in the group companies. He had sold shares of Reliance Industries Ltd in 2005 to buy shares of Anil Ambani Group firms.
He claimed that all his queries at the AGM went unanswered such as why the company is defaulting on a  ₹63 lakh loan to Axis Bank, when they have so much reserves on the balance sheet.
At the Reliance Power AGM, chairman Anil Ambani said that the company is among the top three private power generation firms. The group had a string of AGMs and told shareholders that it is committed to repaying its lenders.
The ADAG group’s debt-fuelled expansion has been one of the key reasons behind its downfall. For instance, in FY19, Reliance Power’s debt amounted to  ₹27029 crore. Additionally, the company made a loss of  ₹2925 crore loss in FY19. ADAG’s combined debt has ballooned to  ₹1.5 trillion in FY19. The market value of all ADAG group firms has fallen to Rs2491 crore currently. This excludes Reliance Nippon Life which has a market cap of over Rs16000 crore; but the ADAG group has a stake of only 4.5% left in this company.
As far as class action lawsuits are concerned, this has not been used in India. It’s only in May this year that the corporate affairs ministry allowed shareholders to file class-action suits. Under section 245 of the Companies Act, investors can file a class-action lawsuit if they have evidence that the management has conducted affairs of the company if they are prejudicial to the interests of shareholders.
“Any class action lawsuit will be a first of its kind in India. Though the Companies Act allows class-action lawsuits, nobody has utilized it till now. If admitted, it will set a precedent and benchmark which will be good for vigilant shareholders in the long run,"" said veteran investor Ambareesh Baliga. “Having witnessed unprecedented wealth erosion in the last 20 months, this could become a useful tool for shareholders to bring to book promoters and management,"" he continued.
“Whether or not the destruction of shareholders' wealth has happened overnight or during the course of time, shareholders have the very right to question the company. In the case of ADAG, they have had issues with respect to a number of directors on board and their management practices for some time now,"" says Subramanian.
However, as the experts quoted above note, to proceed with a class-action lawsuit, shareholders would need a battery of evidence.

199,2019-10-04,Reliance,"JioPhones will now be available for an upfront cost of  ₹699, compared to  ₹1,095 in the previous schemeApart from accelerating its market share gains, what this also means is that Vodafone Idea’s and Bharti Airtel’s revenues from IUC can drop materially.

In the past month, Vodafone Idea Ltd’s shares jumped by 20% twice, in two consecutive trading sessions on both occasions. The first was when the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India suggested it might rethink the abolition of interconnection usage charge (IUC) from January 2020. Then again, last week, in the backdrop of rumours of an increase in tariffs by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
But these hopes have come to nought. If IUC stays, it will certainly be a positive for Vodafone Idea, but a mere band-aid in the overall scheme of things.
The news, which sent the company’s shares down 16% in the past two trading sessions, and shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd by about 6% earlier this week, was Reliance Jio’s announcement of a sharp increase in the subsidy offered on its 4G feature phone. JioPhones will now be available for an upfront cost of  ₹699, compared to  ₹1,095 in the previous scheme.
This offers Reliance Jio a much better chance to capture the low-end of incumbents’ subscriber base. Jio also offers an unlimited voice plan for as low as  ₹49 per month. Currently only about one-fifth of the company’s subscriber base uses the JioPhone.
Unlike smartphone users, who shifted in droves to Jio’s network, feature phone users of Vodafone Idea and Airtel haven’t had the same opportunity, given the cost advantage of 2G handsets vis-à-vis 4G devices. “The offer clearly targets non-data/2G subscribers of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which stand at 42% and 52%, respectively,"" analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd said in a note. As such, a hitherto protected segment for the incumbents now stands the risk of being captured by Jio.
“Jio’s average monthly subscriber additions of around 8 million per month can be expected to rise as a result of the higher subsidy; maybe to 11-12 million,"" said an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm, requesting anonymity. With the company expected to end the September quarter with a subscriber base of 350 million, and assuming monthly additions of 12 million, Jio may well reach the 500 million subscriber mark within a year from now, to have over 50% market share.
Apart from accelerating its market share gains, what this also means is that Vodafone Idea’s and Bharti Airtel’s revenues from IUC can drop materially. After all, users at the low-end mostly receive calls and earn IUC for incumbents. If more of them start using the subsidized JioPhone, the above-mentioned traffic imbalance may reverse, and hurt incumbents.
Moreover, given Jio’s continued aggression with regards to subscriber acquisition, it seems unlikely that a tariff hike is anywhere around the corner."

NEW DELHI :
Amid an industry feud over call ringing time, Reliance Jio has urged the telecom regulator to abstain from mandating a specific duration for calls to ring, and said the matter should be kept under forbearance as ""there is no need for any regulatory intervention"".
Jio said if at all the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) wants to take a view on the issue, it should be in form of a ""reference guideline and not in form of a mandated value"".
""In such case, the range of 20 seconds to 25 seconds may be prescribed as reference guideline,"" Jio informed Trai, which is in the process of finalising its views on the issue through a consultation paper.
Rival Bharti Airtel -- which had charged Jio of arbitrarily shortening the ring time for outgoing calls from its network -- has argued that low ringing time for calls directly impacts the customer experience, and asserted that standardising the value at both originating and terminating ends ""is paramount at this stage"".
Airtel has recommended that the terminating exchange timer should be fixed at 45 seconds and the origination exchange timer at 75 seconds.
In its submission, Vodafone Idea has argued that the minimum ringing timer should be retained at 30 seconds, which, the company claimed is in tune with global practices.
Jio, meanwhile, has contended that in case Trai still decides to fix a value for call alert timer, the same should be done only after a detailed study by a technical panel comprising experts from the telecom department and Telecom Engineering Centre (TEC).
The company lamented that the only time objection has been raised on the ringing duration of calls is against the current implementation by Jio, and alleged that this ""is clearly a case of vested interests"".
""...we have not faced any customer issues and even the alleged customer issues being faced by one operator remain unsubstantiated, the authority may validate such claims and not take the same on face value,"" Jio said.
On the missed calls, Jio has told Trai that it is ""more of a victim here instead of being a perpetrator"".
In its comments on the Trai consultation paper, the Mukesh Ambani-led company said that the considered regulatory position so far has been that such timers fall under the domain of ""commercial freedom"" accorded to telecom operators.
""Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJIL) submits that this policy should continue in the interest of light touch regulation and forbearance,"" it said.
Jio noted that the operators in the past never felt compelled to disclose the timer to other players. Globally, too, this parameter is kept at the discretion of the service provider and many leading operators keep this minimal levels close to 20 seconds, some even 15 seconds.
RJIL believes that the optimum value of this timer is 20 seconds and argued that there is no logic of keeping these limits at the higher side as handheld devices are generally kept close to the users and most calls are being answered within 15 seconds, it said.
Late last month, as the contentious interconnect usage charges (IUC) issue came back on the regulator's radar, the industry -- polarised over the issue -- had erupted into a war of words.
Airtel had accused Reliance Jio of ""gaming"" the system of paying for calls to rival network, and Jio had returned fire arguing that incumbents are charging high voice tariffs and manipulating the system to the detriment of their users.
A senior Airtel official recently alleged that ""one large 4G-only operator"" has arbitrarily slashed ringing time for outgoing calls to other networks.
This, Airtel had said, not only led to customer inconvenience (since the calls are cut-off midway before answering), but prompted a barrage of call backs to artificially convert outgoing calls to incoming on its network. Jio had hit back saying globally most operators have an average ringing time of only 15-20 seconds.
The call ringing time issue is an important one for telecom players. Typically, a telecom operator pays for connecting calls of its subscribers to the company on whose network a call terminates. Currently, an operator is required to pay 6 paise per minute as mobile call termination charge, called IUC.
The IUC was originally proposed to be made nil from January 1, 2020. But TRAI is now reviewing the timeline, as part of a separate consultation exercise.
Earlier this week, telecom operators Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea slashed ring time on outgoing calls from their network to 25 seconds to counter a similar move by Jio and plug losses amid a high voltage dispute, over the issue. This is an interim measure, and the final decision on the call ring time will be taken by TRAI soon.

MUMBAI :
Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong is currently in India, provoking speculation that the South Korean tech giant may make further investments to expand its presence in the country, industry sources said on Monday.
Lee is likely to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani this week, reports Yonhap news agency.
Lee arrived in India on Sunday and was briefed by Samsung Electronics officials here. It is believed to be Lee's first visit to India since March.
Samsung is one of the equipment suppliers for Reliance Jio's 4G network business.
With the Indian telecom firm planning to establish a 5G network in the country, industry observers speculate that the two moguls may consult on the issue if there is a meeting.
""There's also a possibility that Lee could meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" a source said.
In July last year, Samsung India set up one of the world's largest mobile manufacturing facilities in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. PM Modi and South Korean President Moon Jae-in inaugurated the 35-acre Samsung Electronics facility.
Samsung currently has two manufacturing plants -- in Noida and in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu -- and five research and development centres in India. The company has one design centre in Noida with workforce of over 70,000 people.
India today is the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world after China. According to a survey conducted by mobile industry body ICEA, the 268 mobile handset and accessories manufacturing units in the country employ about 6.7 lakh people.
Due to the focus on 'Make in India' and 'Digital India' programmes, Uttar Pradesh has emerged as the new hub of mobile manufacturing in the country over the past few years.
The new Samsung facility in Noida was set up with the aim of doubling its capacity for mobile phones in Noida from 68 million units a year to 120 million units a year, in a phase-wise expansion to be completed by 2020.
India currently has over 450 million smartphone users. The number of smartphone users in the country is expected to reach 859 million by 2022, according to an ASSOCHAM-PwC joint study.
In such a scenario, Samsung's heir's visit is important in the festive season when the consumer electronics market is booming and consumer spending is witnessing an all-time rise, especially from the smaller cities and towns.
Samsung India is targeting business worth  ₹3,000 crore by selling over 2 million smartphones online before Diwali that falls on October 27.

193,2019-10-07,Reliance,"Some distortions of the telecom market caused by India’s ‘caller pays’ regime are showing up only now. This system was to be phased out, but it’s taking much longer than envisaged

Cell phone users in India must sharpen their reflexes, now that telecom service providers have reduced the ringing limit for outgoing calls to 25 seconds. The sounds that alert us to incoming calls are not exactly costless. Every ring eats up radio frequency, and Indian telecom companies cannot be faulted for wanting to move towards international standards, particularly after the telecom regulator flagged the issue last month. A majority view in favour of rings that last 30 seconds, though, was lost in a haze once Reliance Jio set the cut-off limit for its outgoing calls to 25 seconds, and its rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea followed suit. Such a short ring duration lends itself to accusations of being designed to induce call backs from call recipients who are unable to respond in time. Under a “calling party pays"" framework, an operator that originates a call must pay a termination fee to the network that answers. This means a net gain is made if more calls come in than go out to other networks. This intake constitutes a sizeable chunk of operator revenues, now that consumers themselves pay so little for the services they avail of.
However, as technology pulls down the cost of carrying voice traffic, termination fees are to be phased out. The payment system is currently the subject of a policy rethink on a sunset date for it. Packet switched networks, such as those using 4G cellular technology, render these charges redundant. The government is hopeful that domestic telecom firms would have upgraded their grids and moved enough of their legacy subscribers onto these networks by the end of this year. Disappointingly, the shift has been very slow. Every second cellular subscriber in India is still on either a 2G or 3G network. Although Jio has all its users on a 4G network and Airtel has tripled the size of its 4G grid in two years, only about half the handsets selling are 4G-enabled. Setting up spiffy new networks is one thing, getting subscribers to embrace them is quite another. For Jio, it was part of its game plan. Having bet its future on a rapid upgradation curve, it took just three years to expand its share of subscribers to around one-third of the total by bundling cheap tariff plans with elementary handsets hooked to its network. For Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which were left vastly indebted by the large sums they paid for 2G and 3G spectrum, pushing most of their subscribers to the latest available generation of mobile technology has been a far stiffer challenge.
The axing of termination fees was to mark India’s mass upgradation, and the regulator’s second thoughts over a deadline for it amounts to an admission that progress has been slower than envisaged. Any reassessment of the situation would have to address the incentive that operators have to resist change, reluctant as some may be to let go of the money raked in that way. If the status quo persists, millions of mobile subscribers could be left with outdated means of communication. The burden of high spectrum fees has already acted as a drag on the adoption of new technologies. As India gears up to roll out 5G services, telecom regulation must help the sector strike an optimal balance. The country has always taken a dual-lane approach to wireless telephony. A slow lane is alright, so long as the fast lane keeps up with the rest of the world."

NEW DELHI :
After the  ₹6,000-crore acquisition of Reliance Capital's asset management arm, Japanese financial services major Nippon Life will be focusing on regaining the lost market share it has had in the country with its JV with the Anil Ambani group, a top official said here on Monday.
Reliance Mutual Fund, which has been renamed as Nippon India Mutual Fund (NIMF) following the deal, used to be the leader in assets under management till a few years ago, but has slipped to the fifth spot as institutional investors pulled out their money with the troubled company.
Nippon Life entered Reliance AMC first by buying a 26 percent stake in 2012 and now owns as much as 75 percent, making it the single largest promoter. Nippon has paid  ₹6,000 crore for 75 percent stake, chief executive Sundeep Sikka told reporters.
""We will recover the losses in AUM that have happened,"" he added.
Sikka, who will continue to lead the new company, said the retail investors have stayed with it and it has been able to grow its market share as well.
Nippon Life's global president Hiroshi Shimizu said a strong team led by Sikka, coupled with the opportunity presented by the under-penetrated Indian market made them increase their stake in the venture. Nippon Life globally manages over  ₹50 lakh crore assets.
Sikka said the domestic mutual fund space has only 2 percent penetration and the fund house will focus on rural and semi-urban segments.
Beyond its 300 physical touch-points and 78,000 distributors, it will focus more on digital forms of selling.
Answering a specific query if the move to invoke the pledge of Rana Kapoor on his Yes Bank holding as reported in the press recently represents a directional change, Sikka refused to directly answer.
He, however, mentioned that there will better risk management as going forward unit-holders can enjoy the benefits of the same practices.
Reliance MF had  ₹2.22 lakh of AUM in June, which had slid nearly 4 percent in the preceding quarter, and was ranked fifth in the list led by HDFC Mutual Fund.
Sikka said the fund has raised commitments of USD 200 million from marquee Japanese investors, and will continue to get foreign investors into the country. As of now it manages USD 2 billion of foreigners' money which is invested in the domestic market, he said.
Shimizu said the firm is also working more actively on the Reliance Life in which it owns 49 percent, with teams collaborating on actuarial and strategy side.

New Delhi: Telecom operator Vodafone Idea termed Reliance Jio's plan to start charging 6 paise per minute for outgoing calls to rival network as ""an action of undue haste"" and an attempt to distract attention from the need for urgent action to address financial stress in the sector.
Without naming Jio directly in the statement, Vodafone Idea said that new announcement from the Mukesh Ambani-led firm comes closely to the action taken recently to potentially hurt revenues of other operators with its recent unilateral action of reducing ringing time.
""The announcement by one of the telecom service providers today to charge for calls made to other service providers to cover the termination charge of IUC is not only an action of undue haste but it also does not bring out the fact that interconnect is a settlement between operators and not a consumer pricing matter,"" Vodafone Idea said in a statement.
Telecom regulator TRAI in 2017 had slashed the so-called interconnect usage charge (IUC) to 6 paise per minute from 14 paise and had said this regime will end by January 2020. But it has now floated a consultation paper to review whether the regime timeline needs to be extended.
In this backdrop, Jio has announced it will charge customers 6 paise per minute for voice calls made to rival phone networks, but will compensate them by giving free data of equal value.
Telecom operator Bharti Airtel has also alleged that Jio's decision to levy 6 paise per minute on voice calls to rival phone networks is geared to ""force IUC to be brought down"".
Vodafone Idea said that Trai's call for a consultation on IUC keeping in mind the continuing asymmetry in traffic and in line with its earlier stated position on the matter.
""It seems like the consultative process is being challenged and is potentially drawing attention away from the real issue that the industry is in deep financial stress, a fact that’s now widely acknowledged. Bringing up the IUC matter seems like an attempt to distract from the need for urgent action to address financial stress in the sector,"" the statement said.

Airtel, Voda Idea could gain if date of scrapping IUC is postponed

New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, India’s most profitable telecom operator, will start charging for calls made to rival networks at 6 paise a minute, reneging on a promise to keep voice calls free for its customers and signalling the end of a bruising tariff war.
The operator said it “has been compelled most reluctantly and unavoidably"" to do this following the decision of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to review the date for scrapping interconnect usage charge (IUC) from 1 January 2020, which has led to regulatory uncertainty.
“For all recharges done by Jio customers starting today, calls made to other mobile operators will be charged at the prevailing IUC rate of 6 paise per minute through IUC top-up vouchers till such time that Trai moves to zero termination charge regime,"" Jio said in a statement on Wednesday.
That Jio will start charging for outgoing calls for the first time will come as a major relief to Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd, which have been left bleeding financially as a result of the rock-bottom tariffs offered by the Mukesh Ambani-controlled company.
“This is an indication that the price war is close to its end. This bodes well for both Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea as they have been hoping for an upward movement in tariff levels for long,"" a Mumbai-based telecom analyst said on condition of anonymity.
Jio, however, will compensate customers by providing free additional data of equivalent value based on the customer’s IUC top-up voucher consumption so as to ensure there is no increase in tariff.
The move comes three weeks after Trai on 18 September floated a fresh consultation paper to see if there is a need to revise the applicable date for scrapping IUC, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic.
IUC, which has been set at 6 paise a minute, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks.
Scrapping IUC or reducing it would benefit an operator with more outgoing traffic than incoming calls. As of June-end, 64% of Jio’s total traffic was outgoing. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea would stand to gain if Trai decides to postpone the date of scrapping IUC as these telecom operators get more incoming calls than outgoing.
“Despite Jio having comparable subscribers with rivals, termination of traffic is skewed in favour of incumbents. Now, even Jio feels it can’t justify this subsidy forever—as they were paying IUC charges, but still keeping voice calls free,"" Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India, said. “For Jio consumers, this is not good news as they were used to free calls. Jio starting to charge calls is good for rivals as this is an upward movement in tariffs for Jio customers. This gives some breathing room to incumbents.""
Jio, however, believes that the traffic is asymmetric because rivals have kept 2G voice tariffs high. “The price differential of free voice on Jio network and exorbitantly high tariffs on 2G networks causes the 35-40 crore 2G customers of Airtel and Vodafone-Idea to give missed calls to Jio customers. Jio network receives 25 to 30 crore missed calls on a daily basis,"" Jio said on Wednesday.
Bharti Airtel, without naming Jio, said that one of its competitors suggested that Trai reopen this issue, while the regulator had in September 2017 already said it might undertake an exercise to revisit the matter at a later date.
“Clearly, this off net charge being levied, therefore, is to force IUC to be brought down despite the heavy burden it puts in the receiving network. We are grateful that this very timely consultation paper to reassess IUC has been issued by Trai,"" Airtel said in a statement on Wednesday.
“The announcement by one of the telecom service providers today to charge for calls made to other service providers to cover the termination charge of IUC is not only an action of undue haste but it also does not bring out the fact that interconnect is a settlement between operators and not a consumer pricing matter,"" Vodafone Idea said in a statement.
Meanwhile, Jio has said these charges will only continue till the time the regulator abolishes IUC."

Bharti Airtel, however, without naming Jio, has said that one of its competitors has suggested that Trai has re-opened this issue while the regulator in September 2017 had already said it may undertake an exercise to revisit the matter at a later date.
“Clearly, this off net charge being levied, therefore, is to force IUC to be brought down despite the heavy burden it puts in the receiving network. We are grateful that this very timely consultation paper to reassess IUC has been issued by Trai,"" Airtel said in a statement on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Jio has also said that these charges will only continue till the time the regulator abolishes the IUC.
In September 2017, Trai had ordered a reduction in IUC to six paise per minute from 1 October 2017 from 14 paise earlier and an end to it from 1 January 2020. Telecom operators, already reeling from a fierce price war that started with the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in September 2016, were hit hard by the order. At the time Trai decided to scrap IUC, Airtel, Vodafone and Idea had resisted the change, while Jio was in favour.
“Despite Jio having comparable subscribers with rivals, termination of traffic is skewed in favour of incumbents. Now even Jio feels it can’t justify this subsidy forever – them paying IUC charges but still keeping voice calls free. For Jio consumers, this is not good news as they were used to free calls. Jio starting to charge calls is also good for rivals as this is upward movement in tariffs for Jio customers. This gives some breathing room to incumbents,"" Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India said."

NEW DELHI :
Forced by regulatory uncertainty over review of sunset clause for call termination charges, billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio on Wednesday announced it will charge customers 6 paise per minute for voice calls made to rival phone networks, but will compensate them by giving free data of equal value.
In a statement, Jio said the 6 paisa charge will remain in place till the time telecom operators are required to pay rivals for mobile phone calls made by their users to other operators' network.
These charges are not applicable on calls made by Jio users to other Jio phones and to landline phones and calls made using WhatsApp, FaceTime and other such platforms. Incoming calls from all networks will continue to be free.
Telecom regulator TRAI in 2017 had slashed the so-called interconnect usage charge (IUC) to 6 paise per minute from 14 paise and had said this regime will end by January 2020. But it has now floated a consultation paper to review whether the regime timeline needs to be extended.
Since voice calls on Jio network are free, the company had to bear the  ₹13,500 crore payment made to rivals such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. To recover the losses created by the TRAI move, the company has decided to charge customers 6 paise per minute for every call they make to a rival's network.
This will be the first time that Jio users will pay for voice calls.
Currently, Jio charges only for data, and voice calls to anywhere in the country and to any network are free.
""...The consultation paper has created regulatory uncertainty and therefore Jio has been compelled, most reluctantly and unavoidably, to recover this regulatory charge of 6 paise per minute for all off-net mobile voice calls so long as IUC charges exist,"" the statement said.
For all recharges done by Jio customers starting Wednesday, calls made to other mobile operators will be charged at the prevailing IUC rate of 6 paise per minute through IUC top-up vouchers till such time that TRAI moves to zero termination charge regime.
""Jio will provide additional data entitlement of equivalent value based on IUC top-up voucher consumption. This will ensure no increase in tariff for customers,"" Jio said.
Jio said it has, in last three years, paid other operators like Airtel and Vodafone-Idea nearly  ₹13,500 crore as net IUC charges.

189,2019-10-09,Reliance,"Airtel’s comments come after Jio blamed Trai of regulatory flip-flop on the IUC issue while announcing 6 paise/minute levy on voice calls made to rival networksJio to compensate customers for the IUC charge by giving free data of equal value

NEW DELHI :
Telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Wednesday alleged that Jio's decision to levy 6 paise per minute on voice calls to rival phone networks is geared to ""force IUC to be brought down"", and said ongoing review of call connect charges or IUC is consistent with TRAI's previously-stated intent.
The comments by Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Airtel came after Jio blamed Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) of regulatory flip-flop on the IUC issue while announcing a levy of 6 paise per minute on voice calls made to rival phone networks. Jio has, however, also said it will compensate customers for the IUC charge by giving free data of equal value.
Without naming Jio, Airtel in a statement said, ""One of our competitors has imposed a rate of 6 paise for all off net calls made to other operators to cover the termination charge of IUC (Interconnect Usage Charge). They have gone on to suggest that TRAI has re-opened this issue"". Airtel argued that the review was, in fact, in line with TRAI’s stated position on the matter in 2017 where it had made it clear that the issue will the revisited based on factors like adoption of new technologies (their impact on termination cost) and traffic patterns.
""Both these have not materialised. There are still over 400 million 2G customers from the poorest sections of society living in rural areas paying less than Rs50 per month and who can still not afford to buy a 4G device. Second, there still is significant asymmetry of traffic,"" Airtel said.
Airtel rued that even the current rate of 6 paise is significantly below the real cost of completing the call.
""...on 19 September, 2017, when TRAI reduced the IUC from 14 paise to 6 paise and proposed a move towards Bill and Keep (zero IUC rate) with effect from Jan 1, 2020 they had specifically mentioned the following...The authority, if deems it necessary may re-visit the afore mentioned scheme of termination charge applicable on Wireless to Wireless calls after one year from the implementation of the regulation,"" Airtel statement recalled.
Airtel further noted that the telecom industry is in a state of deep financial stress since the last three years with several operators having gone bankrupt and thousands of jobs having being lost. ""The IUC is determined based on the cost per call. Given the massive 2G customer base in India the cost of the call at 6 paise is already significantly below the real cost of completing the call,"" it added.
Airtel said: ""Clearly, this off net charge being levied, therefore, is to force IUC to be brought down despite the heavy burden it puts in the receiving network. We are grateful that this very timely consultation paper to reassess IUC has been issued By TRAI,"" Airtel said."

Mumbai: Struggling Anil Ambani group, which has exited a slew of businesses in recent past due to severe liquidity crunch, has appointed both the sons--Anmol (27) and Anshul (24)--as directors on the board of infrastructure arm RInfra.
The company has also appointed retired Army officer Lt Gen Syed Ata Hasnain as an independent director on the board of the company, it said in a statement on Wednesday.
As of July 2019, four group companies alone, excluding the bankrupt telecom arm, were sitting on a debt pile of about  ₹93,900 crore.
Anmol has been on the board of Reliance Capital since August 2016, while the younger one, Anshul joined group this January, and has been actively involved in all operations of RInfra, including a special focus on the defence business, working closely with the group chairman and Punit Garg, executive director, the company said.
During the recent AGMs, Ambani had said the group was shuttering the two lending arms of Reliance Capital--Reliance Commercial Finance and Reliance Home Finance with a cumulative asset of over  ₹25,000 crore--by December.
On Monday, the group nearly exited RCap's AMC business--which used to lead the market for long and now has gone down a distant fifth slot--to Nippon Life of Japan which now owns 75 percent in the company and has since been renamed as Nippon Indian Mutual Fund for a collective investment of  ₹6,000 crore.
The group has long ago existed the telecom business and the company, once a leading player, is in the bankruptcy court since February. Many other group ventures like the defence vertical are also struggling for long now.
The defence business, Reliance Naval is also under severe financial stress.
While in service, Hasnain had participated in Operation Pawan in Sri Lanka during 1988-90 and counter- insurgency operations in Punjab in 1990-91 and had also served with the UN in Mozambique, and later, in the war-torn Rwanda.
During the AGM, Ambani had claimed that his group has over 60,000 crore of receivables in regulatory and arbitrary disputes which are pending for the past 5-10 years.
He had blamed the crisis and the resultant decision to exit to the severe collateral damages the group had taken due to a combination of factors-crisis in the financial services sector, irrational action by auditors and rating agencies and now the slowdown of the economy.
Ambani had claimed that these events aided and abetted by reckless selling and rumour-mongering by vested interest have affected the shareholders of the Group companies.
He had also said the group is planning to pay creditors  ₹15,000 crore more by March next year."

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Thursday:
Indiabulls Housing: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has rejected the proposed merger of Lakshmi Vilas Bank Ltd (LVB) with Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd (IHF), puncturing the shadow bank’s attempt to get a banking licence. This comes after the RBI in September placed LVB in the prompt corrective action (PCA) list due to inadequate capital ratio, high level of bad loans and negative return on asset (RoA) for two years in a row.
TCS: The IT major will kick start the earnings season for the September quarter on Thursday. This is likely to set the tone and steer the Indian equity market. A slowdown in the economy combined with liquidity concerns in non-banking financial companies(NBFCs) may not bode well for the earnings season. IndusInd Bank Ltd will also announce its earnings today.
RIL: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio on Wednesday announced it will charge customers 6 paise per minute for voice calls made to rival phone networks, but will compensate them by giving free data of equal value. The decision came in the wake of regulatory uncertainty over review of sunset clause for call termination charges.
Lakshmi Vilas Bank: Shares of the bank are seen under pressure as RBI has rejected its proposed merger with IHF. The stock has lost 71% value since the all-stock merger was announced in April. The bank has been placed in the PCA list as it is way below the capital adequacy, RoA and non-performing asset (NPA) thresholds.
Yes Bank: The private lender was the top loser in Wednesday’s trade. Shares tanked after the company declined commenting on a Mint report that the bank was in talks with Microsoft Corp to raise funds. The bank said it was not aware of the news source. The stock has been losing value due to concern over exposure to stressed sectors, especially housing-finance companies, and weak financials of the bank.
Bharti Airtel: The company on Wednesday said it has raised $750 million (about  ₹5,330 crore) from investors based in Asia, Europe and the US through a hybrid financial instrument. The telecom operator will use the proceeds for refinancing, investments in subsidiaries and general corporate purpose.
Lupin: The pharmaceutical company has received a good manufacturing practice (GMP) certificate from Japan’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) for its bulk drug manufacturing facility at Mandideep in Madhya Pradesh. The certificate was issued after PMDA did not make any critical observation in an inspection at Mandideep Unit II from May 14-17, 2019.
JBM Auto: Shares of JBM Auto Ltd surged, ending up 20% on Wednesday after the company said it had received orders for supply of 300 buses. In an exchange filing, the company said it has bagged orders from Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System Limited (DIMTS), Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport Corporation (NMMTC) and two airline companies.
MTNL: Shares of the state-owned telecom company have been under pressure as the finance ministry is not keen on infusing fresh capital to bail out Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL). According to a Financial Express report, the ministry has rejected a massive bail-out package worth Rs.74,000 crore sought by the Department of Telecommunications to revive the debt-ridden company.

183,2019-10-10,Reliance,"For the first time, Reliance Jio customers will have to pay for making voice callsFor every  ₹10 you spent on call charges, Jio will give you 1 GB free data

NEW DELHI :
Not all voice calls made from a Reliance Jio mobile phone connection will now be free but the telecom operator has promised to refund the charges in the form of free internet data. Even though the charges for making voice calls to other mobile phone networks is as low as 6 paise a minute, it will be for the first time that Jio customers will have to pay for voice calls, free since its launch in 2016.
All voice calls made to non-Jio mobile numbers will be charged at 6 paise per minute from your next recharge.
5 things to know about Jio's call charges, data offer:
1) Jio said due to the undergoing regulatory policy changes for mobile call related charges, it is compelled to recover Interconnect Usage Charge or IUC for all non-Jio mobile voice calls. It means that any Jio to Jio calls, incoming call, calls made to a landline number and those using WhatsApp, Skype, etc, will remain free and voice calls made to another mobile operator like Airtel, Vodafone-Idea, etc will be charged.
2) Jio has assured that it will keep its promise for making voice calls free for life. The IUC charges will be applicable only till the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) migrates to a zero termination charge. At present, interconnect usage charge is 6 paise per minute. According to the last ruling by the regulator, IUC for mobile calls will be zero only from 1st January 2020. This means that you will have to pay IUC of 6 paise only till the end of this year.
3) Jio customers will have to buy IUC top-up vouchers. A  ₹10 voucher will give you 124 minutes of talktime to non-Jio mobiles and 1 GB of free data. If you buy the  ₹20 voucher, you get 249 minutes of IUC talktime and 2GB free data. A  ₹50 voucher will give you 656 minutes of talktime to non-Jio mobile phones and 5 GB of free data while the  ₹100 voucher comes with 1,362 minutes of calls and 10 GB data. In short, Jio will give 1 GB free data for every  ₹10 spent on IUC charges.
4) Post-paid customers will be billed at 6 paise per minute for off-net outgoing calls with a corresponding increase in free data entitlement.
5) At present, IUC, levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks, is 6 paise a minute."
182,2019-10-10,Reliance,"Bharti Airtel Ltd soared 4%, while Vodafone Idea gained 18%Analysts believe Jio’s tariff hike is prima facie positive for the industry

Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd surged on Thursday after most profitable telecom operator Reliance Jio said it will end free voice calls on its network.
Bharti Airtel Ltd soared 4%, while Vodafone Idea gained 18%. Reliance Industries Ltd rose 2.5%. In last three sessions, Bharti Airtel gained 10% while Vodafone Idea advanced 30%.
Reliance Jio said late Wednesday it will start charging for calls made to rival networks at 6 paise a minute. This comes as a major relief for rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea which have been left bleeding financially as a result of the rock-bottom tariffs offered by the Mukesh Ambani-controlled company.
Analysts believe Jio’s tariff hike is prima facie positive for the industry as it enables other operators to raise tariffs too. Other operators may not take the price hike in the same form though considering its potential negative effect on user experience. Other operators may see a drop in calls terminating on their networks, but the tariff hike should be able to compensate for it well.
The move came after Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on 18 September floated a fresh consultation paper to see if there is a need to revise the applicable date for scrapping interconnect usage charge (IUC), given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic.
""This works out to a price hike of about 14%. However, we believe that additional charges for off-net calls would disincentivise users to call other operators, which would reduce off-net call volumes for RJIO. We expect additional charges to drive up revenue ~5%, which would translate into ~10% increase in EBITDA,"" said Edelweiss Finance in a note to its investors.
""We believe the tariff hike from the price-setter is positive for the telecom industry and will provide other operators leeway to hike prices proportionately. We anticipated a price hike by RJIO in H2FY20. But the way the price hike has been taken is perplexing considering it may cause inconvenience and anxiety to subscribers. Other operators may follow suit, but by simply raising the tariff,"" the report added."
181,2019-10-10,Reliance,"Consumer credit offers lenders a lifeline after a buildup of bad corporate loans

A common refrain you hear in India is, “There’s no credit in the market."" 
The despondence cuts across industries as diverse as real estate, autos and road construction. An 88% slump in the flow of funds to the commercial sector between April and September shows that the producers’ unease is justified.  
However, one credit tap is starting to gurgle, giving some cause for optimism. Pocket-sized loans are feeding online consumption, with demand coming from smaller cities and towns. The amounts are still tiny, but as digital spending grows, financing it has the power to turn the page on Indian lenders’ underwriting of soured corporate loans: the source of a $200 billion sigh of collective agony.
Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart Online Services Pvt claimed record sales during the recently concluded six-day online shopping bonanza that marks the start of the Indian festival season. Although nowhere close to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s $31 billion Singles’ Day promotion in China, the Indian version of Black Friday has grown fivefold to $3 billion in four years, according to a review of this year’s sales by RedSeer, a consulting firm. Add the spending between now and Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, and Forrester Research reckons the total for a month of online purchases may fall just shy of $5 billion.  
Although the 30% growth this year was slower than in the previous three, it’s a strong outcome in a weak economy. Both of India’s leading e-commerce marketplaces cited small towns – and credit – for their success. Flipkart says Tier 3 cities ordered 100% more goods this year. The share of transactions using credit options grew by 70%, with a majority of these people living outside of big cities. Amazon revealed that three out of four customers who availed themselves of financing came from Tier 2 and 3 cities; significantly, every second buyer who used credit did so for the first time.
All this is hardly unique to India. China’s e-commerce boom saw an explosion of microloans, with millennials buying hamburgers on credit and the buy-now-pay-later habit picking up in Indonesia. What makes India interesting is the possibility that soon even physical retail will embrace digital in-store credit – minus plastic.
A mobile-payment app with pay-later options at physical stores will be an important innovation. For all its expansion, e-commerce will account for only 7% of India’s $1.2 trillion retail sales by 2021, according to Deloitte. Credit cards won’t go beyond big cities and organized retail. It’s not worth any bank’s while to make card acceptance universal because the revenue to a bank from signing up a mom-and-pop shop – the merchant who handles purchases at the bottom of the income pyramid –  is a meager $4 a month.
That’s why Flipkart’s “cardless"" credit deserves attention. Customers are validated for a $1,400 limit via a simple video upload; the actual financing comes not from Flipkart but from banks and financiers like Bajaj Finserv Ltd. This is the model that Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, might use to connect India’s 30 million small retailers with consumers. Amazon’s claim that its Great Indian Festival saw orders from 99.4% of the country’s postal codes owes that reach to Ambani’s aggressive entry into telecoms three years ago. The 4G network of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. has caused data prices to crash and usage to explode.
But Ambani won’t let the American duo of Amazon and Walmart be the biggest beneficiaries of his disruption. If Jio succeeds in taking its knowledge of 340 million Indians who use its mobile service to neighborhood stores, where most people still shop, banks and shadow banks will rush in with credit. From Citigroup Inc. to State Bank of India, HDFC Bank Ltd. to Singapore’s DBS Group Holdings Ltd., everyone will want this sizable new line of revenue at the intersection of consumer and corporate banking. 
Writing in the Financial Times, Viral Acharya, a former deputy governor at the Indian central bank, argues that finance in India must learn from shampoo makers such as Unilever and Procter & Gamble Co., who boosted sales by offering families affordable quantities in small sachets rather than in more expensive full-size bottles.
To similarly make bite-sized finance sustainable, account aggregators are coming. They’ll digitally record a consumer’s transactions with various institutions and, with consent, share data with a lender. Given that 52% of Indian workers are self-employed, and only 23% earn a regular wage, to be able to accurately assess a borrower’s irregular cash flows will give lenders confidence to extend credit.
So large is the overhang of bad corporate debt that to suggest a better model of banking will emerge invites skepticism. Yet below the surface of corporate bankruptcies and failing financial institutions, technology is enabling important change. Maybe not tomorrow, but credit will go where it is due."

NEW DELHI :
If you have a Reliance Jio mobile phone connection, then you might not be able to call mobile customers of Airtel, Vodafone-Idea and other operators without recharging with an IUC top-up voucher. Since this is the first time that Jio, launched in September 2017, is charging for making voice calls, it is also the first time that prepaid Jio users will have to buy a voucher for making domestic voice calls.
The vouchers will not only give you talktime for making calls to any non-Jio number in India but will also give you free data. For every  ₹10 voucher you buy, you are entitled to 1 GB of free data.
Jio's new voucher offer:
A  ₹10 voucher will give you 124 minutes of talktime to non-Jio mobiles and 1 GB of free data. If you buy the  ₹20 voucher, you get 249 minutes of IUC talktime and 2GB free data. A  ₹50 voucher will give you 656 minutes of talktime to non-Jio mobile phones and 5 GB of free data while the  ₹100 voucher comes with 1,362 minutes of calls and 10 GB data.
The new voucher rates imply that you pay 6 paise only per call made to a non-Jio mobile phone. Even that 6 paise is refunded to you in the form of data. Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani has been saying that customers should pay for only one service -- voice or data not both. The new voucher has been designed keeping in mind this principle.
Reliance Jio users should keep in mind that there has been no change in plans as all Jio to Jio calls, Jio to landline and incoming calls remain free. You can also make calls using apps like WhatsApp, FaceTime, Skype, etc which would also be free since they use data."

Mumbai: Reliance Jio Infocomm’s (RJio) decision to pass on the interconnect usage charge (IUC) for off-net calls (calls to other networks) to its subscribers may enable other operators to raise tariffs too, say analysts.
For RJio, this move is expected to drive up revenue by 5%, which would translate into a 10% increase in operating profit, according to Edelweiss Securities Ltd.
""This works out to a price hike of about 14%. However, we believe that additional charges for off-net calls would disincentivise users to call other operators, which would reduce off-net call volumes for RJio,"" said Edelweiss Securities Ltd in a note published on 9 October.
Analysts believe the tariff hike is positive for the telecom industry and will provide other operators leeway to hike prices proportionately. Other operators may follow suit, but by simply raising the tariff.
“We believe competition will follow suit, with tariff hikes for their bundled plan subscribers, which should result in an Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) increase of  ₹7 and  ₹4 for Bharti and Vodafone-Idea, respectively,"" Emkay’s note to shareholders said.
“RJio, on the other hand, will witness an ARPU increase of about  ₹17 following the move,"" it added.
On Wednesday, RJio announced it would charge its customers 6 paise per minute for calls to rival networks. The Mukesh Ambani-led company was actually passing on the IUC charges to the subscriber.
RJio will recover the IUC for off-net calls from its subscribers at 6 paise a minute via a separate recharge voucher. It would compensate for the hike by offering an equivalent value of data, signalling no effective change in tariffs for subscribers per se.
Analysts view it as a circuitous price hike that may not go down well with subscribers and may prompt a behavioural change among Jio subscribers, discouraging them from making off-net calls."
178,2019-10-10,Reliance,"Reliance Jio’s move on tariffs is in response to Trai’s consultation paper on the matterShares of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are up 10% and 20% respectively in the past two trading sessions

There has never been a dull moment in the telecom industry since Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launched commercial operations in 2016.
In the three years since its launch, it has been accused of predatory pricing – for charging ‘no tariffs’ and then ‘low tariffs’ to gain market share. Incumbents such as Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd are now miffed that Jio has suddenly decided to charge its subscribers ‘more tariffs’.
Jio said on Wednesday it will start charging its customers for outgoing calls made to rival networks at 6 paise a minute. This is to recover the interconnect usage charge (IUC) applicable on calls made to other networks, also known as off-net calls. Based on the quantum of such calls made from Jio’s network to Airtel, Vodafone Idea and the state-run mobile networks in the June quarter, analysts estimate a quarterly revenue bump of about  ₹1800 crore for Jio.
Average revenue per user, or Arpu, is expected to rise by about 15%. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities expect a roughly 6-8% increase in Arpu for the incumbents if they adopt a similar hike in tariffs for customers who use bundled data and voice packs.
Not surprisingly, shares of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are up 10% and 20% respectively in the past two trading sessions. Why then are the incumbents complaining?
Airtel said in a statement, “This off-net charge... is to force IUC to be brought down."" The incumbents are net receivers of the IUC charge, while Jio has a quarterly outgo of about Rs800 crore on this count. Indeed, even Reliance Jio’s statements clearly suggest that the increased tariff will be in force only till the time the IUC charge is retained by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).
For perspective, Trai had suggested two years ago that the fee will be abolished with effect from January 2020. But last month, it asked telecom operators and other stakeholders to give feedback on whether it makes sense to postpone the abolition of IUC.
The unwritten subtext of Jio’s move is that costs for telecom consumers are increasing because Trai isn’t going ahead with its original plan of abolishing IUC. This will doubtlessly be highlighted in the telecom regulator’s consultation process. The suggestion that a ‘voice will always be free’ network is forced to charge for outgoing voice calls because of Trai’s move may well be an argument that gains popular support. It’s another matter that while Jio’s net IUC outgo is around Rs800 crore, it may end up getting a far higher amount as a result of the new charge. After all, while it is charging customers for off-net outgoing calls, it isn’t compensating them for off-net incoming calls, where it receives IUC from rivals.
Besides, the suggestion that voice has always been free on Jio’s network is also debatable. “We aren’t in sync with Jio’s views of having paid IUC “from its own resources while offering free voice to its customers"". Of the bundled price paid by a customer, any attribution to voice, data, off-net outgoing IUC recovery etc. is an arbitrary one,"" say analysts at Kotak.
A moot question is if the friction caused by the additional charge will hurt Jio’s subscriber addition numbers. While this may well be true in the near-term, Jio has given ample evidence that it will take corrective action as soon as it is necessary.
“Jio could have taken a clean price hike, as expected, given it has become the market leader. The move to charge for IUC, with a sunset clause, indicates its sustained focus on subscriber additions and that tariff increase is not a near-term focus. Indeed, this move encourages voice-only subscribers to move to Jio's network,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients. Indeed, the additional charge for off-net calls will incentivise existing Jio users to bring friends and family on to the Jio network.
But rather than banking on such gains, Reliance Jio seems to be betting that its tariff move will put Trai on notice and that IUC would be abolished sooner than later. For a precariously placed company such as Vodafone Idea, net IUC receipts accounted for about 30% of Ebitda in Q1. An end of the IUC regime will hasten the depletion of its already low cash balances.
Rather than celebrate a possible temporary increase in tariffs, investors in Vodafone Idea and Airtel should worry about Jio’s aggressive approach with regards to not only subscriber additions but also regulatory debates such as IUC."
177,2019-10-10,Reliance,"Reliance Jio will charge customers for calls made to rival networksJio users, however, will be compensated with free data of similar value

Shares of Vodafone Idea Ltd. and Bharti Airtel Ltd. surged after the wireless carrier controlled by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani said it will end free voice calls on its network. Vodafone Idea jumped as much as 18%, set for the biggest intraday gain since August, while Bharti climbed 4.8% at 10:48 a.m. in Mumbai. Reliance Industries Ltd.’s shares rose for a third day.
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. will charge customers 6 paise per minute for calls made to rival networks till such time that the telecom regulator moves to a zero termination-charge regime, the company said after market on Wednesday. Jio users, however, will be compensated with free data of similar value.
The move “seems like a big deal, insofar as the market has been waiting for Jio to move from a land grabber to focusing on profitable growth,"" Chris Lane, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein said in a note.
Reliance Jio stormed into the industry in 2016, and became the nation’s top telecom operator after free calls and cheap data lured millions of users and left rivals struggling under mounting debt. Vodafone Idea’s shares, for instance, are down 71% this year despite Thursday’s surge.
Jio has paid about  ₹13,500 crore in user fees to rival operators since its launch, according to the statement. The regulator had planned to scrap these charges from January next year, but floated a fresh consultation paper to see if the date needed to be revised --a move that forced Jio to go back on its promise to keep voice calls free.
Here’s what brokerages said about Jio’s announcement:
Sanford C. Bernstein
“Jio’s effective 10% price increase should be a breadth of fresh air for the likes of Vodafone Idea, which has been left for dead, and Bharti Airtel""
The first has an outperform recommendation on Bharti Airtel, while Vodafone is the preferred play on the sector due to “the extreme, asymmetric risk-reward.""
Edelweiss Securities
“Reliance Jio’s tariff hike is prima facie positive for the industry as it enables other operators to raise tariffs too.
Other operators may see a drop in calls terminating on their networks, but the tariff hike should be able to compensate for it well. We are already building in 4% higher Q4FY20 ARPU (average revenue per user) for Bharti and Vodafone Idea than Q1FY20.""
Dolat Capital Market
“Jio’s majority subscriber base is on bundled plans and it is thus easier for it to charge for off-net calls which may not be the case with Bharti and Vodafone Idea.
Nevertheless, we believe Bharti and Vodafone Idea may either replicate Jio’s move or innovate on product front to capitalize from Jio’s price increase.""
Emkay Global Financial Services
“Competition will follow suit with tariff hikes for their bundled plan subscribers, which should result in an ARPU increase of 7 rupee and 4 rupees for Bharti and Vodafone, respectively.
Jio, on the other hand, will witness an ARPU increase of 17 rupees following the move.""

174,2019-10-10,Reliance,"Analysts say the hike by Jio will provide other operators leeway to raise their charges proportionatelyShares of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd ended 5-6% higher while RIL was up nearly 3% on Thursday

Telecom stocks rallied on Thursday on hopes that Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s unconventional tariff move may enable other operators to raise tariffs too. Reliance Jio said on Wednesday that due to undergoing regulatory policy changes for Interconnect Usage Charge (IUC), it is compelled to recover IUC from non-Jio users and hence post 10 October, all calls to non-Jio mobile numbers will be charged at 6 paise per minute.
Shares of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd ended 5-6% higher while Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) was up nearly 3% on Thursday.
Analysts believe the tariff hike from the price-setter is positive for the telecom industry and will provide other operators leeway to raise their charges proportionately. However, analysts were cautious that the way the price increase has been taken is perplexing considering it may cause inconvenience and anxiety to subscribers.
According to Nomura, RJio’s move is a step to pressure the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to keep unchanged the current plan of making IUC charges zero from 1 January 2020. In September 2017, by a change in regulation, Trai reduced the IUC from 14 paise to 6 paise per minute effective 1 October 2017 until 31 December 2019. It had further prescribed a bill-and-keep (BAK) regime, i.e. zero IUC or termination charge effective, from 1 January 2020. However, on 18 September 2019, the regulator floated a consultation paper to review the implementation of the zero IUC regime from 1 January 2020, following representation from some stakeholders.
Analysts at Nomura said in the near term, the move will likely boost average revenue per user (Arpu) but, more importantly, it could make the regulator rethink its move to defer implementing the zero IUC regime from the current plan of 1 January 2020. It said that if free calls from Jio subscribers to 2G subscribers of other operators reduce, the pace of subscriber switch (from 2G of incumbent operator to Jio) could increase further.
“We currently assume no IUC charges for domestic calls from Q4FY20. While Jio’s IUC charges are on a declining trend, these are still very high ( ₹850 crore in 1QFY20). We estimate that if IUC charges were to continue beyond 1 Jan 2020, nearly  ₹2500-3000 of Jio’s FY21 Ebitda could be at risk,"" Nomura said in a report on 10 October.
According to Kotak Institutional Equities, at roughly 6.6 paise/min charge, this would mean incremental revenues of  ₹1,790 crore per quarter. “One needs to adjust for the  ₹720 crore IUC cost that was assumed to be going down to zero. Net revenue uplift would be  ₹1,070 crore a quarter or  ₹4,300 crore per annum. ..So, gross Arpu uplift of  ₹19 per subscribers per month, assuming no price elasticity on off-net volumes,"" Kotak said in a report on Thursday."

NEW DELHI :
Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi on Thursday took a jibe at Reliance Jio after the mobile data network announced that calls made to other mobile operators will be charged at the prevailing interconnect usage charge (IUC) of 6 paise per minute through top-up vouchers till the time Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) abolishes IUC in line with its present regulation.
""JIO has decided to charge its customers because always remember that however big a lollypop you are offered, at the end there are no free lunches. Situation applicable to the present Modi Sarkar as well,"" Singhvi tweeted.
In a statement on Wednesday, Reliance Jio stated, ""We will share all data with TRAI to convince that zero IUC regime is in the best interest of consumers and how the huge number of missed calls is creating the wrong perception of asymmetric traffic.""
""We are hopeful that the IUC charge will be done away with as per the current regulation and that this temporary charge will come to an end by December 31 and consumers will not have to pay this charge thereafter,"" it added.
In the meantime, consumers can use the additional data entitlement in lieu of the IUC top-up vouchers so that there is no effective tariff increase till the year-end, Jio said.
IUC is a cost paid by one mobile telecom operator to another when its customers make outgoing mobile calls to the other operator's customers.

GURUGRAM :
The telecom operators paid a total of  ₹11,838 crore as IUC or interconnect user charges in 2018, led by Vodafone which paid  ₹4,214 crore followed by Airtel at  ₹3,411 crore and Jio at  ₹2,809 crore, a new report by market research firm techARC said on Friday.
BSNL/MTNL paid  ₹1,405 crore as IUC charges, said the techINSIGHT report which is based on TRAI's annual report published in September this year.
With Reliance Jio announcing 6 paise per minute charge for voice calls to rival networks, Vodafone Idea termed the announcement ""an action of undue haste"" and Airtel termed the Mukesh Ambani-owned company's move a forced tactics to reduce interconnection charges.
The IUC charges are paid for off-net calls to the operator on whose network a call terminates.
In 2018, Vodafone-Idea, Airtel and Jio paid 35 per cent, 29 per cent and 24 per cent of the total amount of  ₹11,838 crore, respectively.
""While Jio has invested in an all-IP network to support offering free voice calls --the disruption it entered with -- incumbents are still not pure IP networks,"" said Faisal Kawoosa, Founder &amp; Chief Analyst, techARC.
""VoLTE enablement is still an ongoing process for other operators, thus would require IUC to offset the infrastructure cost they bear on terminating a call,"" he added.
The average outgoing MoUs (minutes of usage) per annum were 312 minutes in 2018, out of which 84.01 per cent of the usage terminates on another wireless network.
Currently, an operator pays a little over  ₹100 per annum per subscriber as IUC to other operators, which is a little over  ₹8 per month.
Also, the subscriber number range for the three main operators isn't too wide that would make one operator benefit more than the other, the findings showed.
On account of taking a hit of  ₹13,500 crore due to network connection charges, or interconnet usage charges (IUC), Reliance Jio on Wednesday said it would charge customers 6 paise per minute for voice calls made to rival networks till IUC charges were eliminated.
It's the first time that Jio users will pay for voice calls, free since September 2016.
According to Kawoosa, there has to be a different mechanism to be worked out regarding IUC where nobody loses money and there is harmony among operators.
""One possible way could be allowing operators to charge a flat monthly fee per subscriber that they can offset the IUC against. Instead of settling interconnect charges, they would be deducting at source,"" said Faisal.

Leading telecom player Reliance Jio has clarified that all its customers who recharged their phones till Wednesday will continue to enjoy benefits of free voice calls to any number till their existing plan expires.
""Dear customer, if you have recharged on or before 9th October, you can continue enjoying free call benefits (even to non-Jio numbers), until your plan expires,"" said a message from Reliance Jio.
Jio had earlier announced that all calls to a non-Jio mobile phone number like that of Airtel and Vodafone Idea will be charged at the rate of 6 paise per minute. This is for the first time that users will have to pay for making a phone call from Jio.
An important update for all Jio users. pic.twitter.com/TR04y92wmC
Although Jio has not changed its existing tariff plans nor introduced any new plan for both its prepaid and postpaid users, the telecom operator has decided to charge a fee of 6 paise per minute for all calls made to other players as IUC (Interconnectivity User Charges). However, all Jio to Jio calls, incoming calls and landline calls continue to remain free as before.
To make calls to other non-Jio numbers, you need to buy new IUC top-up vouchers which have been made available. The vouchers begin from a price of  ₹10 and go up to  ₹100. Each voucher of  ₹10 will give you 1GB of free data.
Jio's postpaid customers will also be similarly charged for voice calls at the rate of 6 paise per minute. They will also be compensated in the form of free data.
Jio, in a statement, had yesterday said the charge would last till such time that regulations require payments to rival networks for completing calls but added that it will compensate the users by giving free data of equivalent amount.
Since voice calls on Jio network are free, highly charged 35-40 crore 2G users of rival networks end up giving missed calls to its users to trigger call backs that have resulted in a payout of  ₹13,500 crore to Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea in last three years, Reliance Jio said adding that to recover the losses created by the TRAI move, the company has decided to charge customers 6 paise per minute for every call they make to a rival's network.

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may remain in focus on Friday:
TCS: The IT major, in its July-September earnings announced on Thursday, reported a constant currency revenue growth of 8.4% year-on-year, missing the Street's estimate of 9-9.5%. This may not bode well for the stock. The company along with IndusInd Bank Ltd kick started the earnings season for the September quarter and is likely to set the mood for the Indian equity market.
Yes Bank: The private lender on Thursday said it has appointed Anita Pai as its chief operating officer and Jasneet Bachal as chief marketing officer. Despite the announcement, shares remained in the red due to worries over the bank’s exposure to stressed sectors, mainly housing finance companies (HFCs) and weak financials.
IndusInd Bank: Shares of the bank slumped more than 6% on Thursday after it announced its earnings for the September quarter. Though the bank saw a 52% year-on-year jump in net profit, a sharp rise in provisions dragged the stock lower. The net profit number also missed analysts’ estimate. The bank’s exposure to a large HFC has been weighing on the investor sentiment.
Lupin: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has pulled up Lupin Ltd for failing to maintain records of batches of manufactured medicines and their sales at the company’s Tarapur plant. The regulator also pointed out that the batch production and control records at the plant do not include complete information relating to production and control of each batch.
Indiabulls Housing: Shares of the company plunged on Thursday, closing down more than 19% as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rejected its proposed merger with Lakshmi Vilas Bank. This has spoiled the non-bank’s plans to get a banking licence amid concerns over tight liquidity and weak asset quality faced by housing finance companies.
Lakshmi Vilas Bank: The stock hit an all-time low on Thursday and was locked in the lower circuit limit of 5% at Rs.25.65 on the BSE as the Reserve Bank did not approve its merger with Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd. In September, the bank was placed under the prompt corrective action list by the RBI for not meeting certain regulatory thresholds.
Infosys: The IT company will report its second quarter earnings today. Experts believe that this earnings season may not do well due to weakness in demand that has led to a slowdown in the economy along with liquidity crisis that has affected the non-banking financial companies, automobile and real estate sectors.
Bharti Airtel: The company on Thursday was the top gainer among the Nifty 50 stocks as investors cheered Reliance Jio’s announcement that it will end free voice calls. The most profitable operator Jio will now charge customers 6 paise per minute for voice calls made to rival phone networks.
SpiceJet: The company on Thursday said no cracks have been found in its fleet of older Boeing 737 NG after the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ordered inspections following a similar move from the US Federal Aviation Administration's to conduct checks for structural cracks on a portion of the 737 fleet operating in the country.
IOB: Indian Overseas Bank said on Thursday it would reduce the interest rates in retail and micro small and medium enterprises by 25 basis points with effect from 1 November. This after the RBI cut the key lending rate by 25 basis points in the October monetary policy meeting."

As announced by the telecom operator this week, Reliance Jio mobile phone customers need to buy IUC top-up vouchers to make outgoing voice calls to any non-Jio mobile number like that of Airtel and Vodafone Idea.
Unlike before, Jio has now started charging users for making voice calls to any non-Jio mobile number. Both prepaid and postpaid customers of Jio will have to pay 6 paise per minute for making outgoing calls to any non-Jio mobile number.
Jio's new recharge plan
All prepaid customers of Jio will not be able to make calls to numbers of other mobile operators till the time they buy an ICU top-up voucher. Although Jio has not changed any existing recharge plan, you will need to buy these vouchers.
Jio's recharge voucher for making voice calls begin from  ₹10 and go up to  ₹100. You can buy any one of them depending on your requirement. Also keep in mind that you get free 1 GB data with each  ₹10 voucher.
The  ₹10 voucher gives you 124 minutes of non-Jio talktime while the  ₹100 voucher gets you 1,362 minutes of talktime. The  ₹100 voucher also gives you 10 GB free data.
Postpaid consumers will also get free 1 GB data for every  ₹10 they spend on IUC charges.
These top-ups, which do not come with any expiry date, will remain valid till the time you consume the talktime.
Will all Jio customers have to pay
Jio customers who recharged on or before October 9 will be exempt from voice call charges till the time their recharge plan expires.
Besides, all Jio to Jio calls and Jio to any landline calls will remain free. If you  want to call someone from other network without having to pay any IUC charges, you can use WhatsApp and other calling apps which use internet.
Jio has also promised that the charges will remain in force only till the time TRAI makes IUC zero.
What is IUC
When you make an outgoing call, your operator has to pay a fee to the other operator. Known as Interconnect Usage Charge (IUC), it is fixed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). At present, IUC is fixed at 6 paise a minute.
So far, Jio was bearing this cost on its own but now it has decided to pass on the cost to its customers."

New Delhi: India Inc titans Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries and Sunil Mittal of Bharti Enterprises will be missing in attendance at the largest stage of the country’s telecom sector — India Mobile Congress.
The two have managed to draw crowds at the first two editions of the expo in 2017 and 2018 where they shared stage and addressed each other as ‘dear friends’.
The three-day India Mobile Congress, which is the country’s attempt to showcase it as a vibrant telecom market and woo investors, starts on Monday.
Mittal and Ambani are expected to give the expo a miss at a time when their telecom companies engage in a fresh battle over interconnect usage charges.
Ambani’s Reliance Jio and Mittal’s Bharti Airtel last week again locked horns over the interconnect usage charge.
The fresh war of words between the two operators erupted when last week Jio, India’s only profitable telecom operator, said it will start charging for calls made to rival networks at 6 paise a minute, reneging on a promise to keep voice calls free for its customers.
Jio said it “had been compelled most reluctantly and unavoidably"" to do this following the decision of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to review the date for scrapping interconnect usage charge (IUC) from 1 January 2020, which has led to regulatory uncertainty.
Jio’s move came three weeks after Trai on 18 September floated a fresh consultation paper to see if there is a need to revise the applicable date for scrapping IUC, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic.
IUC, which has been set at 6 paise a minute, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks.
Scrapping IUC or reducing it would benefit an operator with more outgoing traffic than incoming calls. As of June-end, 64% of Jio’s total traffic was outgoing.
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea would stand to gain if Trai decides to postpone the date of scrapping IUC as these telecom operators get more incoming calls than outgoing.
immediately after Jio’s announcement to charge for calls, Bharti Airtel, without naming Jio, said that one of its competitors suggested that Trai reopen this issue, while the regulator had in September 2017 already said it might undertake an exercise to revisit the matter at a later date.
“Clearly, this off net charge being levied, therefore, is to force IUC to be brought down despite the heavy burden it puts in the receiving network. We are grateful that this very timely consultation paper to reassess IUC has been issued by Trai,"" Airtel had then said.
Meanwhile, Jio has said these charges will only continue till the time the regulator abolishes IUC."

Telecom companies would be relieved by the government’s assurance that it will review the pricing mechanism of radio frequencies that carry the voice and data traffic of over a billion people. Telecommunications minister Ravi Shankar Prasad’s statement at the India Mobile Congress, an industry gathering, that policymakers were alive to the industry’s concerns and were instituting a process to reform the pricing of spectrum is likely to revive flagging interest in auctions slated for later this fiscal year. Mobile service operators had previously indicated that the base prices of air waves that were to go under the hammer in this round were exorbitant. Older telecom companies such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are already laden with large debts incurred in bidding for spectrum at earlier auctions, and had indicated that they might have to sit out this round if the minimum bid prices arrived at by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, or Trai, were not lowered significantly. Also, they argued, not enough radio frequencies were being put up for sale for the country’s networks to shift to fifth generation (5G) telecom services.
Now that Prasad has indicated that base prices are not yet final and that they would be reviewed, the Cellular Operators Association of India, an industry lobby, could pat itself on the back. The regulator had refused to reconsider its price estimates for upcoming auctions despite it being pointed out that air waves were being sold in India at rates that were almost four times those in other countries. Trai had argued that its projections were based on a holistic appraisal of circumstances. For Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, both involved in a bruising price war with new entrant Reliance Jio since 2016, that stance was a deep disappointment. Having lost nearly all their pricing power, telecom service operators were in no position to pass on the costs of high spectrum fees to subscribers. Analysts had even forecast tepid interest in spectrum for 4G services, given that Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have excess radio frequencies for these and their networks are still being rolled out. Half their subscribers are still on 2G and 3G networks, which make for high carriage charges.
The government, however, is not solely to blame for expensive spectrum, although successive regimes have displayed an inordinate dependence on the sale of radio frequencies to shore up their capital receipts. Air waves are a scarce national resource, and, in general, the Centre has tried assorted methods to allot them. At various stages, India has rationed radio frequencies, made companies queue up for them, and put them up for auction. As a result, the country’s telecom market has undergone several transformations, with all twists and turns leading to the conclusion that auctions were the most efficient mechanism. This has meant that top bidders suffer the so-called “winner’s curse"", often having overpaid for spectrum. This time around, this is what needs to be guarded against. As the government gets down to revisit the process, apart from reducing base prices, perhaps it could consider auction models that are specifically designed to overcome that curse. High spectrum prices cannot co-exist with cheap mobile telephony for too long. Something has to give. Let’s hope it’s not service charges. Low-cost communication helps turn the economy competitive. But for that, the market needs to be bustling with competition. Cheap spectrum could enable that."
158,2019-10-14,Reliance,"India is investing $60 billion in gas infrastructureTotal buys 37.4% stake in Adani Gas Ltd

NEW DELHI :
Global oil and gas majors are looking to India, the world's third biggest oil importer, to buy some of their excess liquefied natural gas (LNG) as the South Asian nation improves its gas infrastructure and strives to reduce emissions.
Spot LNG prices have more than halved since last year due to oversupply as producers battle for market share.
The Indian market looks set to grow, however.
The country is investing $60 billion in gas infrastructure, including setting up cross country pipelines and LNG import terminals to connect gas-starved regions to supply hubs.
Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said that by the end of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's current term in 2024, India will be ready with a cross country natural gas grid.
""India is emerging as a major demand centre for gas. India is going to be a very exciting market ... We see it as an important energy market for decades to come,"" Peter Clarke, senior vice president - global LNG at Exxon Mobil Corp told Reuters at the India Energy Forum by CERA Week, on Monday.
Exxon has a deal to supply LNG to Petronet LNG Ltd , India's biggest gas importer, under a long term agreement from its Gorgon Project in Australia.
Clarke said Exxon was signing gas supply deals with various parties and was keen to strengthen its foothold in India, which needs fuel to power its economic expansion.
India's current gas consumption is not a true reflection of its demand potential as the nation lacks infrastructure to transport gas. Most of its LNG import infrastructure is located in the western part, leading to higher gas consumption there compared with the rest of country.
Total SA said on Monday it was buying a 37.4% stake in private Indian gas distribution company Adani Gas Ltd. The French company also said it would explore opportunities in Adani Group's LNG terminals in the east and west coast.
""We want to bring competitive LNG to India,"" said Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne.
Pouyanne added that one of the reasons Total recently bought a major LNG project offshore Mozambique was because the project was ""perfectly positioned to deliver LNG to India very efficiently.""
Total has committed to investing $600 million in India's gas business and ""there is more to come,"" Pouyanne said.
India's gas demand is expected to double to 75 billion cubic metres by 2030, energy consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie said on Monday.
LNG will account for half of this demand, or equivalent to 10% of today's global LNG market, the consultancy firm said.
Global majors are also bullish on India's domestic gas production and hope it will complement imported LNG to meet the growing need of cleaner fuels than coal and oil.
India allows higher prices for natural gas produced from difficult and challenging fields and gives companies a freedom to sell it without federal intervention at best prices.
""I believe that there is close to 100 tcf (trillion cubic feet) of natural gas resources yet to be found below ground here in India,"" said Bob Dudley, CEO of British oil firm BP Plc .
BP, in a tie up with Reliance Industries, is investing $5 billion in India's east coast to produce gas from April-May, he said.
""That in itself can meet half of the natural gas demand out to 2050,"" Dudley added, referring to India's gas reserves."
159,2019-10-14,Reliance,"This comes in the backdrop of RIL and BP JV having announced in August their fuel retailing partnership for IndiaBP CEO Bob Dudley said there's close to 100 trillion cubic feet of yet-to-be-found natural gas reserves in India that would be enough to meet half of the nation's gas demand till 2050

New Delhi: Attracted by India’s electric vehicle (EV) mobility play, the BP’s group joint venture (JV) with Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) may roll out charging networks across the country in the future, according to a top executive.
This comes in the backdrop of RIL and BP JV having announced on 6 August their fuel retailing partnership for India. The joint venture, which is owned 51% by RIL and 49% by BP, plans to set up 5,500 fuel retail outlets across India.
“As we plan to go forward is providing electric charging at the retail sites and networks. So, it doesn’t involve constructing the cars or vehicles…And over time when it makes sense, we will put charging networks,"" BP’s group chief executive officer Bob Dudley on Monday here told reporters.
Mint had on July 2017 reported that RIL plans to foray into retailing CNG and LNG and setting up charging points for EVs.
This comes at a time when a lack of charging infrastructure is one of the main reasons behind poor adoption of electric mobility in India. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government on its part plans to install one electric vehicle charging station after every four kilometers in cities and twenty five kilometers on both ways of highways connecting to these cities.
The plan to increase charging infrastructure will go through different phases wherein the mega cities with a population of over 4 million and highways connected to these cities will be considered in the first one- to three-year period. Subsequently, in the second phase within three to five years period, big cities like state capitals, union territory headquarters may be covered for distributed and demonstrative effect. The government will also install separate charging stations for heavy electric vehicles like buses or trucks after every 100 kilometres on both sides of highways.
EverSource Capital, the joint venture between private equity firm Everstone Capital and global solar project developer Lightsource BP, is also looking to invest over $1 billion in renewable energy investments through its Green Growth Equity Fund. The National Investments and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) of India and the UK government are anchor investors in Green Growth Equity Fund.
“The $1 billion Green Growth Equity Fund we manage with partners in India will support the Indian government’s plan to increase renewable capacity to 450 GW over the next few years,"" Dudley said.
In response to a Mint’s query about whether BP would be interested in entering the electricity distribution business, Dudley said, “Probably not.""
This comes at a time of a crisis in Indian electricity distribution companies (discoms) because of their poor financial health, which has resulted in delayed payment to generation utilities. The discoms owe  ₹76,336 crore for the power bought from the generation companies (gencos) at the end of July, according to information available on the union power ministry’s PRAAPTI portal. This comprised  ₹56,710 crore as the overdue amount. Seized of the issue, union power minister Raj Kumar Singh discussed payment security at a two-day conference of state power ministers last week at Tent City, Narmada, Gujarat.
While speaking at India Energy Forum by CERAWEEK, Dudley said, that there is close to 100 trillion cubic feet of yet-to-be-found natural gas reserves in India that would be enough to meet half of the nation's gas demand till 2050.
India will see a massive investment of $118 billion in oil and gas exploration as well as in setting up of natural gas infrastructure in the next few years as the country prepares to meet the needs of a fast growing economy, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Monday.
Amid reports of ONGC's inability to derive any benefit out of its HPCL acquisition, Pradhan said the state-owned firm was free to sell its stake in the oil refining and marketing company.
Pradhan added that no single form of energy can meet the growing energy demand in India given India’s development imperative that aims to ensure energy justice to all. “Mixing all commercially viable energy sources is the only feasible way forward in our context. India will chart its own course of energy transition in a responsible manner,"" he said.
India, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after the US and China, has been pushing for a gas-based economy and plans to connect 10 million households to piped natural gas by 2020. India plans to reduce its carbon emissions by 33-35% from its 2005 levels by 2030, as part of its commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted by 195 countries in Paris in 2015.
BP in partnership with Reliance Industries is investing about $5 billion to bring about 1 billion cubic feet a day of new domestic gas onstream beginning mid-2020, Dudley added.
""We have $5 billion worth of projects coming onstream next May, and we would like to be able to sell gas in an open market to our customers as well as our own companies as well,"" he said.
""I am very optimistic about the joint venture we are forming with Reliance on the (fuel) retail market. So, we will bring all types of new things, electrification, mobility, bringing convenience marketing together with Reliance,"" Dudley said.
The unfolding events in West Asia have raised the spectre of a spike in transportation fuel prices in India, with traders worldwide speculating if oil will cross the $100-mark yet again. Any sudden increase in global prices will affect India’s oil import bill and its trade deficit. Every dollar increase in the price of oil raises India’s import bill by  ₹10,700 crore on an annualised basis. India spent $111.9 billion on crude oil imports of 207.3 million tonnes in 2018-19.
“Areas which are very critical for the flow of crude oil are coming under heavy insecurities… Earlier cycles have also seen oil related speculative tendencies. But I am sure today in a world where not just oil, not just crude but there are so many others sources of energy which many countries are driving to get on to their basket. The challenge is in widening this basket and also challenges for countries like India where we still have a very big gap between energy consumption and what it is got to be ideally. We would like to move forward towards better energy security for the country and also from a varied wide basket,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.
The cost of the Indian basket of crude, which averaged $47.56 and $56.43 a barrel in FY17 and FY18, respectively, was at $59.35 in August, according to data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell. The average price jumped to $60.89 a barrel on 11 October. The Indian basket of crude represents the average of Oman, Dubai and Brent Crude.

161,2019-10-14,Reliance,"Minister’s remarks come as a relief to debt-laden telecom firms clamouring for lower spectrum pricesDoT will review prices, said Ravi Shankar Prasad at the India Mobile Congress

New Delhi: The government is aware of the concerns raised by mobile service providers about expensive spectrum, Union telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, adding the department of telecommunications (DoT) will review prices and expects to see a healthy competition among operators for upcoming auctions.
Prasad’s statement comes as a relief to telecom operators clamouring for lower spectrum prices as they struggle with rising debt, mainly on account of airwaves bought in previous auctions, amid a brutal tariff war.
“Spectrum auction will be conducted in this financial year (2019-20) itself. We are also in the process of undertaking some reform in the spectrum pricing,"" Prasad said at the inaugural session of India Mobile Congress (IMC).
Apart from 4G spectrum, India is planning its first auction of 5G airwaves this year.
The government did not auction any spectrum in 2017-18 and 2018-19. In 2016-17, it raised  ₹65,789 crore through the sale of spectrum at base price, a fraction of the  ₹5.63 trillion worth of spectrum it had offered for sale. While the total spectrum put up for sale was 2,354.44 megahertz (MHz) across seven bands, the government managed to auction just 965 MHz. There were no takers for 4G spectrum in the 700 Mhz band.
Telecom operators have always complained that compared to the rest of the world, airwaves in India are priced exorbitantly. In fact, Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal in February said the telecom company would not buy any spectrum at the base prices suggested by the telecom regulator in the 3,300-3,600 MHz band, the first band identified for 5G in the country.
Even after the DoT asked the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) in July to review reserve prices of spectrum that it had suggested in August last year given the government’s objectives of deploying 5G for social sectors and ensuring broadband for all, the regulator stuck to the spectrum pricing architecture it had suggested earlier.
“Prices for 5G spectrum need to be critically looked at,"" said Mahendra Nahata, board member, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. “Higher floor prices will lead to 5G networks being unviable and therefore getting delayed. An equilibrium, therefore, needs to be established between government revenue and overall growth,"" Nahata said at the inaugural session of IMC, now in its third edition.
Jio also urged the government to avoid long delays in spectrum auction and ensure that airwaves are continuously available to operators between two auctions.
Vodafone Idea chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla sought an “enabling regulatory environment"" in the telecom sector so that companies can make the “necessary investments"".
Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries and Sunil Mittal of Bharti Enterprises skipped the IMC, the first time in its three years. Ambani’s daughter Isha and son Akash, and Mittal’s son and founder of Hike Messenger Kavin Mittal, who were expected to participate in a panel on “next generation leaders"" were absent as well.
The absence of top leaders at the expo comes at a time when their telecom companies engage in a fresh battle over the interconnect usage charges. The war of words erupted last week when Jio, India’s only profitable telecom operator, said it will start charging for calls made to rival networks at 6 paise a minute, reneging on a promise to keep calls free. IUC, which has been set at 6 paise a minute, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks."
162,2019-10-14,Reliance,"'We seek an enabling regulatory environment so that we can make the necessary investment in this sector''We look forward to working with the government to take the leap for the next wave of growth'

New Delhi: The telecom sector needs an enabling regulatory environment as the growth of the sector is key to the digital transformation of the Indian economy, industry leader Kumar Mangalam Birla said on Monday.
Birla is the chairman of Vodafone Idea Ltd — India’s largest telecom operator by subscriber base.
“We seek an enabling regulatory environment so that we can make the necessary investment in this sector...we look forward to working with the government to take the leap for the next wave of growth,"" Birla said in his speech at the inauguration of the India Mobile Congress.
The statement comes in the backdrop of the latest war of words that has emerged between Reliance Jio and rivals Airtel and Vodafone Idea after the telecom regulator sought to review the move to scrap interconnect usage charges. Jio wants IUC to be scrapped as it is a cost for it, while Airtel and Vodafone Idea want the 6 paise a minute charge to continue as both earn revenue from the charge.
The three-day India Mobile Congress is India’s attempt to showcase itself as a vibrant telecom market and woo investors
Kumar Mangalam Birla’s statement comes two weeks Vodafone Group chairman Gerard Kleisterlee and CEO Nick Read came to India.
The two executives were expected to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad but could not as Modi was in Chennai while Prasad was in Bihar monitoring the flood situation. Instead, Read and Kleisterlee had a half-an-hour meeting with telecom secretary Anshu Prakash. Vodafone Idea CEO Ravinder Takkar was also present at the meeting.
Vodafone has sought lowering of levies paid to the government and easier payment schedule for spectrum purchases.
Birla’s statement also assumes significance given the loss-making Indian entity has been witnessing a fall in revenue generation streams, and comes over two months after Vodafone Idea Ltd, which is in the midst of a complex integration process, said its chief executive Balesh Sharma has resigned citing “personal reasons"" and was replaced by Takkar.
Sharma’s exit came less than a year after the merged entity started operations on 31 August 2018. The merged company has since lost market share and posted losses in every quarter of the past year, amid a bruising tariff war.
Vodafone India and Idea Cellular announced their merger in March 2017 in response to the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in September 2016.
Vodafone Idea has so far completed the network integration process in 11 of 22 circles and hopes to complete the rest by June 2020. Despite the merger, Vodafone Idea has been facing a rough ride, with shrinking revenue and gross debt of  ₹1.2 trillion as on 30 June.
Since the completion of the merger, the company has lost subscribers every month. Its active subscriber base declined from 334.1 million in the March quarter to 320 million in the June quarter.
Because of the customer churn that was triggered by the introduction of minimum monthly recharge plans in November to weed out low-paying users, Vodafone Idea’s revenue fell 4.3% to  ₹11,269.9 crore in the June quarter from  ₹11,775 crore in the preceding three months.
The telecom operator had posted a loss of  ₹4,873.9 crore in the June quarter, despite witnessing higher data consumption on its network and signing up more 4G subscribers.
Before that, the company posted a loss of  ₹4,881.9 crore in the March quarter,  ₹5,004.6 crore loss in the three months ended December, and  ₹4,973.8 crore in the September quarter."

The roadmap for the rollout of 5G technology in India is still under examination and the government will appoint an auctioneer soon as it plans to conduct an auction for the premium airwaves by January.
5G technology will lead to much higher data speeds and propel Internet of Things, which will transform sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, healthcare, and education.

The event is being held against the backdrop of a bitter war of words that erupted last week after Jio said it will start charging for calls made to rival networks at 6 paise a minute, reneging on a promise to keep voice calls free for its customers.
The operator said it “has been compelled most reluctantly and unavoidably"" to do this following the decision of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to review the date for scrapping interconnect usage charge (IUC) from 1 January 2020, which has led to regulatory uncertainty.
Jio’s rival Airtel said the move is to force IUC to be brought down despite the heavy burden it puts in the receiving network. Vodafone Idea said that this seemed like the consultative process by Trai is being challenged and is potentially drawing attention away from the real issue that the industry is in deep financial stress."

156,2019-10-15,Reliance,"Interconnect usage charge is a bilateral deal between operators, says VittalTrai has floated a consultation paper to see if there is a need to revise the date for scrapping IUC

NEW DELHI :
Interconnect usage charge (IUC) is not related to the tariff charged by telecom operators from users and is simply a bilateral arrangement between operators, Bharti Airtel chief executive Gopal Vittal said on Tuesday.
“IUC has nothing to do with tariff. It’s a clearing house for the cost of carrying the call. It’s a bilateral thing between carriers,"" Vittal said on the sidelines of a session at the India Mobile Congress on Tuesday.
Vittal’s statement comes a week after a fresh war of words erupted between Airtel and Reliance Jio after the latter, India’s only profitable telecom operator, said it will start charging for calls made to rival networks at 6 paise a minute, reneging on a promise to keep voice calls free for its customers.
Jio said it “had been compelled most reluctantly and unavoidably"" to do this following the decision of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to review the date for scrapping interconnect usage charge from 1 January 2020, which has led to regulatory uncertainty.
“Over the last 20 years, the IUC has always been absorbed in the cost of doing business and the tariff is what it is,"" Vittal said.
Jio’s move came three weeks after Trai on 18 September floated a fresh consultation paper to see if there is a need to revise the applicable date for scrapping IUC, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic.
“As far as IUC is concerned, there is a consultation paper that Trai has released. We await the outcome of that,"" Vittal said.
IUC, which has been set at 6 paise a minute, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks.
Scrapping IUC or reducing it would benefit an operator with more outgoing traffic than incoming calls.
As of June-end, 64% of Jio’s total traffic was outgoing.
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea would stand to gain if Trai decides to postpone the date of scrapping IUC as these telecom operators get more incoming calls than outgoing.
Immediately after Jio’s announcement to charge for calls, Bharti Airtel, without naming Jio, said that one of its competitors suggested that Trai reopen this issue, while the regulator had in September 2017 already said it might undertake an exercise to revisit the matter at a later date.
“Clearly, this off net charge being levied, therefore, is to force IUC to be brought down despite the heavy burden it puts in the receiving network. We are grateful that this very timely consultation paper to reassess IUC has been issued by Trai,"" Airtel had then said.
Jio has said that these charges will only continue till the time the regulator abolishes IUC."

Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea would stand to gain if Trai decides to postpone the date of scrapping IUC as these telecom operators get more incoming calls than outgoing.
Immediately after Jio’s announcement to charge for calls, Bharti Airtel, without naming Jio, said one of its competitors suggested that Trai reopen this issue, while the regulator had in September 2017 already said it might undertake an exercise to revisit the matter at a later date.
“Clearly, this off net charge being levied, therefore, is to force IUC to be brought down despite the heavy burden it puts in the receiving network. We are grateful that this very timely consultation paper to reassess IUC has been issued by Trai,"" Airtel had then said.
Meanwhile, Jio has said these charges will only continue till the time the regulator abolishes IUC.
“The concept of temporary, fixed etc is driven by the industry,"" Oommen said on a question on whether Jio’s move to charge 6 paise a minute for calls was temporary.
“This is something that the industry, the regulator, and the whole framework have to do together to decide when we move down from 2G to 4G rather than deliberating now about 5G because if you don’t have the baseline of all IT and all VoLTE, I’m not sure how you will do 5G,"" he said."
153,2019-10-15,Reliance,"Accusing the incumbent operators of lacking transparency, the telco said these players have invested in wrong technologiesA telecom operator has to pay IUC charges to the operator on whose network a call is made

NEW DELHI :
Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio on Tuesday defended its move to charge customers 6 paise per minute for interconnect usage charges (IUC) and alleged that other telecom operators are levying the same in a hidden manner.
Accusing the incumbent operators of lacking transparency, the telco said these players have invested in wrong technologies that have cost them dearly and they cannot offset inefficiency in their networks in the name of interconnection usage charges.
Reliance Jio President for network, global strategy and service development Mathew Oommen told PTI that telecom operators need to build an all IP network for transitioning to 5G and not invest in old technologies like 2G.
A telecom operator has to pay IUC charges to the operator on whose network a call is made. It is associated with the cost of carrying calls in old technology networks. At present this charge is 6 paise per minute for calls made to other network.
""Operators made windfall for many years. ...rather 2G/ IUC cannot be seen as a mechanism to offset for the inefficiencies they have,"" Oommen said.
On Reliance Jio's IUC decision, he said, ""We could have given unlimited plans like the rest of the industry. Nobody would have ever known but we chose not to do so because we want to be transparent for every paisa that we charge. It was a choice we made. Instead we identify it as IUC charge. Just like it is charged to users in the lower spectrum of  ₹20-100 bracket. There minimum charge for voice calls could be anywhere about Re 1 to  ₹1.5. The top tiers have unlimited and bottom layers are penalised.""
Telecom regulator Trai in 2017 had slashed the so-called interconnect usage charge (IUC) to 6 paise per minute from 14 paise and had said this regime would end by January 2020. But it has now floated a consultation paper to review whether the regime timeline needs to be extended.
In this backdrop, Jio has announced it will charge customers 6 paise per minute for voice calls made to rival phone networks, but will compensate them by giving free data of equal value.
Jio has transparently announced charging of IUC while other telecom operators impose it on customers in a ""hidden manner"", he said, adding that 2G customers are being penalised most in the country with IUC.
""In my opinion having wrong technology has cost them dearly... Who charges customer  ₹23 or  ₹33 to stay on network. We don't charge customers in the name of unlimited plans, and that is the difference between transparency and a lot of hidden charges,"" Oommen said.
He said telecom operators should instead make investments in the right technology. ""That offset should be made in making right technology investment, right service investment. We have said IUC is a charge and that has been brought out transparently. 5G is not realisable unless you have all 4G. The concept of IUC is 2G based,"" Oomen said.
He, however, expressed disappointment with the telecom ministry proposal submitted before International Telecommunication Union (ITU) as it will make rolling of 5G unafforadable and thus unrealisable in the country.
""It is unviable 26 Ghz. I do not believe and I am not aware of any operator who will or who can afford to take 26Ghz and make 5G realisable. It is not about pricing, It is about the submission that has been made on specification that has been made in submission to ITU,"" Oommen said.
The Department of Telecom (DoT) has accepted the demand of ISRO to use 26 Ghz band, in which 5G ecosystem has been developed, primarily for satellite service. Consequently, the department has submitted this proposal for consideration to the ITU, which sets global benchmark for wireless services.
The proposal allows use of 26 Ghz band for mobile services with conditions to ensure that 5G services will not interfere with satellite operations.
The DoT has proposed radiation power of 7 decibel watt per 200 megahertz for base stations to be deployed in the 26 Ghz band against industry estimate of 33 dbW per 200 Mhz band.
The DoT has set a target to roll out 5G in 2020. Industry sources, however, do not see possibility of auction of spectrum for 5G services in the current financial year as it is yet to approach Trai for recommendations on pricing of 26 Ghz band, identified by various countries for 5G services.
The telecom department has received recommendation of Trai for frequency band 3,300-3,600 Mhz band that can be used for 5G services. However, after the claim of ISRO the DoT is learnt to have been left with 175 Mhz of radiowaves for mobile services. PTI PRS MKJ

147,2019-10-16,Reliance,"Reliance Jio tells Trai that BSNL, Airtel, Vodafone Idea are masquerading landline numbers as mobile numbers to earn interconnect usage charges

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio has alleged that Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd are masquerading fixed landline numbers as mobile numbers to earn undue revenue through the interconnect usage charge.
In a letter to the telecom regulator, Jio has alleged this is a fraudulent attempt by incumbent telecom operators for which they must be penalised.
“The incumbent operators have implemented a process under which various enterprises are offered mobile numbers as their customer care or helpline numbers. In these cases, the mobile number is used just as a virtual number for routing all such calls to call centres,"" Jio said in a letter dated 14 October.
Mint has seen a copy of the letter.
This exercise, Jio has alleged, changes the nature of the call from ‘mobile to wireline’ to ‘mobile to mobile’ which is a “fraudulent attempt"" made by incumbent operators to illegally extract the interconnect usage charge at 6 paise a minute.
This fresh letter from Jio comes in the midst of the latest controversy over the IUC which has erupted after TRAI last month said it will review its decision to scrap IUC from 1 January 2020. The regulator has floated a consultation paper to deliberate on this matter with stakeholders.
IUC, which has been set at 6 paise a minute, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks.
Scrapping IUC or reducing it would benefit an operator like Jio with more outgoing traffic than incoming calls. As of June-end, 64% of Jio’s total traffic was outgoing.
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea would stand to gain if Trai decides to postpone the date of scrapping IUC as these telecom operators get more incoming calls than outgoing.
With the fresh letter, Jio has also alleged that incumbent operators are not only earning IUC revenue illegally but are also denying Jio of the revenue it should earn at 52 paise a minute that originating operators earn for calls made to universal access and toll-free numbers.
“We suspect that thousands of such numbers are operational in the market deployed by incumbent operators,"" Jio said in the letter.
“Such illegal, fraudulent and cheating practice has resulted in millions of minutes originating on Jio network getting considered as mobile terminating minutes instead of wireline termination, not only causing huge loss in hundreds of crores to Jio and undue enrichment to incumbent operators but also to influence the authority on apparent traffic asymmetry between Jio and incumbents, which is the only reason cited by the authority to review IUC regulations,"" Jio alleged."
148,2019-10-16,Reliance,"In a report, the brokerage listed the key drivers necessary for Reliance to breach the milestone from current $122 billion market capEntry into SME enterprise space with Microsoft, Jio's fiber broadband business will be crucial in next two years, says BofAML

New Delhi: Reliance Industries in 24 months can become the first Indian company to reach $200 billion market cap on the back of its new commerce venture and fixed broadband business, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Wednesday.
In a report, the brokerage said the key drivers necessary for Reliance to breach $200 billion market cap in 24 months from current $122 billion market cap are new commerce initiative of empowering Kiranas in unorganised retail market by offering MPoS (mobile point-of-sale), entry into SME enterprise space with Microsoft, Jio's fiber broadband business and digital initiatives like advertising.
""We think the market is giving little credit to these initiatives given limited visibility,"" it said. ""We expect near-term momentum to be strong.""
Its bull case scenario that takes m-cap to $200 billion assumed Jio's per mobile phone user revenue increasing to  ₹177 in FY22 from  ₹151, 10 million Kirana's paying the company  ₹750 a month for installing M-PoS, and broadband users reaching 12 million by FY22 with 60 per cent of them paying an average of  ₹840 a month.
""In our bull-case, we look at a 24-month fair-value of the company as we believe most of the new businesses which are in gestation period will take around 24 months to acquire scale and contribute meaningfully to RIL's fair value,"" it said.
Reliance Industries (RIL) is India's largest petrochemical and second-largest oil refining company. It has significant investments in telecom, consumer retail and media businesses in India. Its telecom subsidiary, Jio has garnered a large number of paying subscribers and has the opportunity to emerge as a top-three telecom player in a growing Indian market on the back of the launch of fiber-based broadband services.
The report said the ""upside from base-case is predominately driven by new commerce gaining scale and helping B2B retail momentum as well ($32 billion in additional enterprise value); Jio gaining traction in enterprise, fixed broadband business better than expected ad revenues/upselling services ($222 billion in additional EV); more pronounced telecom tariff hike ($10 bn in additional EV); and better than expected IMO contribution lower capex for a couple of year"".
India's domestic shipping sector is to implement the International Maritime Organization's low sulfur mandate for marine fuels, which will raise margins for diesel.
The brokerage said retail will be the biggest driver of upside as the firm's new commerce business gains traction in the $800 billion unorganised markets.
""On an average, we expect 10 million Kirana's to contribute to RIL of  ₹750/month on back of its M-POS monthly fees and contribution from inventory management etc,"" it said.
Stating that the entire cellular phone business industry would see a meaningful tariff hike by FY2022, it said telecom business of RIL will contribute more than a quarter of the projected EV (enterprise value).
Also, Jio's entry would expand the SME market - currently the majority of them do not use any enterprise offerings. ""In the enterprise business, we expect Jio to target 15 million SME users. In this, we assume 60 per cent conversion (i.e. 9 million paying SME by FY22) and expect each SME to pay on an average  ₹2,000 per month,"" it said.
It estimated the Jio's broadband business users would be 12 million by FY22, of which 60 per cent could pay an average of  ₹800 per cent, it said.
In the oil-to-chemicals business, it expected better than expected IMO impact, with refining margins moving to $13 per barrel from $11.

149,2019-10-16,Reliance,"Vodafone Idea has teamed up with dairy firms to offer them an IoT platform which will help build an intelligent supply chain to sell ice creamIf successful, Vodafone Idea plans to roll out the solution for other business segments also

NEW DELHI :
Vodafone Idea, facing the heat in the telecom sector thanks to Jio’s cut-throat tariffs, has now decided that it will help bring chilled ice cream from a smartcart to customers.
To do this, India’s largest telecom operator by subscriber base has teamed up with dairy companies to offer them an Internet Of Things (IoT) platform which will help build an intelligent supply chain to sell ice cream.
With Vodafone Idea’s solution, the ice cream cart would be connected to an aggregation platform and dairy companies can get real time connectivity and data such as location, temperature, etc. This platform will be akin to what Uber has built for taxis.
“If you look at the ice cream cart, we started with the idea of a (smart) fridge on wheels…we did a lot of trials in Delhi with different customers and what we found was ice cream cart owners tend to go to areas where there is shade. But that might not be the best place to sell ice cream. So customers asked us for mapping information and how to find the best routes for sellers, how to become more intelligent with restocking of ice cream at the warehouse, etc,"" Nick Gliddon, chief business officer Vodafone Idea, told Mint in an interview.
For this, the telecom company has combined big data and artificial intelligence seamlessly on to a platform which will go commercially live this year. It will also offer predictive analysis of a route the ice cream seller should take to maximise sales and how to stock carts.
Vodafone Idea, which has posted huge losses in the last four financial quarters and is battling falling revenue streams, has stepped up focus on business-to-business enterprise solutions to create stickier revenue streams.
Since the completion of the merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, the combined entity has lost subscribers every month. Its active subscriber base declined from 334.1 million in the March quarter to 320 million in the June quarter. Hence, driving growth from its enterprise segment is more crucial now and focus on IoT solutions such as the connected ice cream cart platform is key.
“What we saw in trials is the guys were able to sell five times more ice cream,"" Gliddon said, without divulging the dairy companies the telco has teamed up with.
If successful, the company plans to roll out the solution for other business segments also.
“These pilots have happened in Delhi. But the same intelligence can be offered to pani puri sellers in Mumbai as well,"" Gliddon said. “Once we prove it with one segment, the opportunities are pretty big. So whether it is a pani puri stall or a vegetable cart. You get telematics which gives temperature, time, location, etc…Then you connect that digital value chain."""
155,2019-10-16,Reliance,"Reliance Jio now has two types of recharge plansWhile recharging your Jio mobile connection you have the option of selecting IUC top-ups

NEW DELHI :
If you are planning to recharge your Jio prepaid mobile connection, then you must keep in mind that the Mukesh Ambani-promoted telecom operator now offers two types of recharge plans which offer you the flexibility to choose whether you want IUC (Interconnect Usage Charges) top-ups or not.
With effect from October 10, Reliance Jio has started charging 6 paise per minute for all voice calls made to a non-Jio mobile number like that of Airtel and Vodafone Idea. The basic recharge plan for Jio remains the same as before but now customers have the option of buying an add-on top-up for IUC calls while doing their recharge.
All Jio customers who recharged till October 9 are, however, exempt from paying IUC till the time their current recharge plan expires. So all Jio customers who recharged after October 10 will have to buy IUC top-ups alongwith the regular recharge plans if they want to make outgoing calls to any mobile number beyond the Jio network.
Jio has clarified that the IUC top-up is not mandatory. It is only required if you make calls to non-Jio mobile numbers.
Jio Recharge Main Plan:
Jio's ""Main Plan"" for prepaid recharge comes with several denominations of IUC top-ups starting from  ₹10 and going up to  ₹1,000.
Jio has several recharge plans -  ₹98, 149, 198, 299, 349, 398, 399, 448, 449, 498, 509, 799, besides long term plans going up to  ₹9,999.
If you select the ""Main Plan"", each of the above recharge plans come bundled with IUC top-ups starting from  ₹10 and going up to  ₹1,000. For example, under the popular  ₹399 plan, you can choose an IUC to-up of  ₹10 which will give you 124 minutes of IUC talktime and 1 GB extra data. With every subsequent  ₹10 increase in IUC top-up, you are eligible for extra IUC talktime and 1 GB data.
Jio's No IUC Voice Plan:
In case you are sure you do not need to make voice calls to any non-Jio mobile number, you can opt for the no-IUC voice plan. There is no change in rates as you do not pay extra for IUC top-ups and cannot make outgoing calls to other operators.
Jio has clarified that IUC charges are only limited to outgoing calls made to other mobile operators and you can still make free calls to all Jio numbers and landline phones. You can also freely call any mobile number using voice calling apps like WhatsApp which continues to be free.
IUC charges are also not applicable on sending SMS to other operators."

India wants to comply with global sanctions, including US sanctions on Venezuela and Russia, but also needs to maintain its own strength and strategic interests, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in an interview on Tuesday.
The United States in January imposed the toughest sanctions yet on Venezuela's oil industry. The move has scared away some global customers, but with few alternative suppliers of heavy oil, Indian refiner Reliance Industries Ltd  has been buying Venezuelan crude from Russian major Rosneft . The company is set to resume direct oil loadings in the South American nation after a four-month pause.
Sitharaman said the Indian government has expressed its view to the United States.
""In specific issues which are critical for India's strategic interests, we have explained to the United States that India is a strategic partner for the United States of America and you want a strategic partner to be strong and not weakened,"" she said.
""We value the strong partnership with the USA, but we should equally be allowed to be a strong economy.""
The International Monetary Fund earlier on Tuesday lowered its outlook for Indian growth in 2019, citing weaker-than-expected domestic demand. The US-China trade war will cut 2019 global growth to its slowest pace since the 2008/09 financial crisis, the IMF said.
India's gross domestic product grew at its weakest pace since 2013 between April and June, stoking expectations of further stimulus.
""Global headwinds ... are getting stronger by the day,"" Sitharaman said. Asked about further fiscal stimulus, she said: ""I have not closed the door"" on that.
New Delhi has been trying to boost domestic growth through an infrastructure package and a new loan programme organised with the banking sector that has doled out loans worth over 80,000 crore (8.7 billion pounds), she said.

Earlier on Tuesday, VTB Capital said it has secured rights to sell Essel Media Ventures Ltd’s 10.71% stake in Zee Entertainment to recover loan dues. If the deal goes through, it may threaten promoter Subhash Chandra’s control over the company he founded and could expose Zee to hostile takeover bids. Chandra is also in negotiations with VTB to buy back the shares. The promoter group led by Subhash Chandra has offered to prepay a portion of VTB’s outstanding loan of around  ₹2,000 crore from the proceeds of the remaining stake sale to Invesco Oppenheimer, which already owns a substantial stake in the company.

Nexus, Prestige in talks to merge mall business
Blackstone-owned Nexus Malls and Bengaluru-based Prestige Group are in initial talks to merge their mall businesses, The Economic Times reported citing two people with knowledge of the matter. If the talks fructify, it will create the largest mall operator in the country and the combined entity could be listed as a real estate investment trust (REIT) as part of the plans. Blackstone-backed Embassy Office Park REIT earlier this year listed its units, which jumped 35% on the first day. Embassy Office Park is the first REIT in India to make an initial public offering and so far the only one listed on the National Stock Exchange. Blackstone has been active in India’s real estate space since 2007 and its retail arm, Nexus Malls, has been adding to its portfolio since 2016. In 2017, Blackstone acquired Elante Mall in Chandigarh for an undisclosed amount. Blackstone has said in the past that it wanted to expand the India mall portfolio.
Flipkart enters food retail via FarmerMart
Walmart-owned Flipkart is entering food retail in India, where consumers spend around $500 billion on groceries annually, The Economic Times reported citing Flipkart Group CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy. Newly registered Flipkart FarmerMart, with an authorised equity capital of  ₹1,845 crore, will sell items produced locally. Sales will initially be online, although the company can also sell through physical stores. Flipkart is applying for appropriate licences from the government as the FDI (foreign direct investment) policy allows 100% FDI in food retail for food produced and manufactured in India. The entity will focus on food retail and help boost agriculture as well as the food-processing industry in the country. In India, Walmart doesn’t sell directly to consumers and is an organised wholesaler or cash-andcarry operator that sells merchandise to small neighbourhood stores, hotels and catering firms. The world’s largest retailer acquired Flipkart for $16 billion in 2017 to gain access to India’s $670-billion retail market.
Adani, Reliance Group vie for Mumbai-Pune e-way rights
The Adani Group and the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group are competing with a consortium of IRB Infrastructure and Govt of Singapore Investment Corp (GIC) for the toll operation rights to the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, arguably the country’s busiest road stretch, The Economic Times reported citing sources. Cube Highways and Infrastructure, a road platform backed by I Squared Capital and a few other private equity firms, is also in the fray, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The Maharashtra State Road Development Corp (MSRDC) and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) are expecting at least  ₹8,000 crore from the sale of rights. SBI Capital Market has been mandated to find a new operator as IRB Infrastructure’s 15-year contract expired in August. The Mumbai-Pune Expressway, a build-operate-transfer (BOT) project, contributed the highest revenue of  ₹918 crore in FY19 to IRB. In revenue terms, the next was the Ahmedabad-Vadodara Expressway at  ₹429 crore. Global and domestic infrastructure developers such as Macquarie, Cube Highways and National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) have also been approached. The winning bid is expected to be picked within a month.
CDPQ to acquire IDFC PE’s road portfolio for  ₹2,400 crore
Canadian pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) has agreed to buy erstwhile IDFC Private Equity’s road portfolio Highway Concessions One for  ₹2,400 crore, The Economic Times reported citing three people with direct knowledge of the development. CDPQ pipped its Canadian peer Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and Indian sovereign wealth fund National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), among others, to emerge as the highest bidder for the Highway Concessions One (HC1) portfolio that comprises seven road assets covering 472 kilometres and having a consolidated revenue of  ₹620 crore a year. Global infrastructure fund manager Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) had taken over private equity and other non-core businesses of IDFC in 2018 after the latter’s merger with First Capital. It had mandated investment bank Edelweiss to look for buyers for the road assets.

Baring Partners, Strategic Investor in race to buy 30% in Can Fin Homes
Baring Partners, the private-equity major, and a strategic investor are in the race to buy 30% in Can Fin Homes, the housing-finance subsidiary at state-run lender Canara Bank, The Economic Times reported. Competitive intensity is less evident as many earlier bidders, such as Warburg Pincus, have already bought into different entities, and the industry itself is losing sheen due to a credit squeeze. The prime driver for this deal is Canara Bank seeking to get  ₹1,000 crore out of the transaction as the cost of funds has shot up from last year. Caladium Investment, an affiliate of Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, owns 13.45% stake in Can Fin Homes, and is the second biggest shareholder after Canara Bank. The lender had sold 13.45% stake in Can Fin Homes in 2017 to Singapore-based Caladium Investment Pte for  ₹754 crore. Can Fin Homes had loans outstanding of  ₹19003 crore at the end of March 2019. It has a market cap of  ₹5085 crore."
146,2019-10-17,Reliance,"State-run oil marketing companies BPCL, IOC and HPCL are expected to cough up a good set of numbers for the September quarterA sequential recovery in refining margin should help RIL’s refining business earnings

Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) have increased as much as 18% since its annual general meeting on 12 August where chairman and managing director, Mukesh Ambani, said the company will be a zero net debt one within the next 18 months by 31 March 2021. In that backdrop, when RIL announces its September quarter results on Friday, “any signs of decline in capex intensity should increase confidence in our view,"" said analysts from HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Pvt. Ltd.
That apart, the sequential recovery in refining margin, should help RIL’s refining business earnings. For perspective, benchmark Singapore GRMs have averaged to $6.5 a barrel for the September quarter from $3.5 a barrel during the June quarter. “A sharp recovery in refining margins coupled with lower ethane and LNG prices, and higher petchem volumes should partly offset weakness in benchmark chemical margins and deliver a 7% qoq growth in standalone earnings,"" said HSBC analysts in a report on 8 October.
Separately, state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) are expected to cough up a good set of numbers for the September quarter. OMCs include Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC). Performance of these companies will get a boost from the rebound in refining margin. Further, auto fuel marketing margins have remained resilient. These two factors are likely to set off inventory and forex losses to some extent.
Analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities expect BPCL and HPCL to report 20-23% qoq increase in Ebitda, despite accounting for  ₹1000-1100 crore of inventory and forex losses. The broker expects IOC to report 20% qoq decline in Ebitda, impacted by  ₹3300 crore of inventory and forex losses. Ebitda, a key measure of profitability, is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. IOC’s profitability is expected to be relatively weaker than its peers, HPCL and BPCL, mainly owing to higher inventory losses.
Meanwhile, crude oil prices have declined by about 18% on a year-on-year basis. This is expected to drag down profits of oil producers such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltd as price realisation gets adversely affected.
In keeping with the optimism in broader markets, shares of all these companies have run up after the corporate tax rate cuts. As such, September quarter results are not expected to fuel big jumps in share prices. “The stock prices, in our view, are unlikely to move on earnings but would be news flow dependent,"" wrote analysts from J.P. Morgan India in a report on 7 October. “For the broader state owned enterprises space, how the government moves on the potential BPCL privatization would be an important driver for stocks. For Reliance, the key events that investors are focused on are the completion of various deleveraging deals,"" add J.P. Morgan analysts."
145,2019-10-17,Reliance,"Vodafone Idea has batted for the ringer time to be set at 30 secondsThis was a tit-for-tat move after its bitter rival Jio did the same

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio locked horns again on Thursday over how long should a voice call ring on your mobile phone even as the telecom regulator is set to issue a regulation on this matter in two weeks.
While Bharti Airtel wants the ringing time be set at 45 seconds and has argued that networks receiving the call must be allowed sufficient time, Jio has batted for a reduction in this to 20-25 seconds stating that this will save spectrum resources.
After floating a consultation paper on the matter on 16 September, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India on Thursday conducted an open house discussion with stakeholders.
Last month, Airtel, the country’s second-ranked operator by revenue, shot off a letter to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, saying that it has cut the ringing time for outgoing calls on a rival network to 25 seconds from 45.
This was a tit-for-tat move after its bitter rival Jio did the same.
“Every second reduction on the ringing time saves spectrum resources for us,"" Mahipal Singh, Associate Vice-President of Jio, said on Thursday.
“94% calls on Jio’s network are answered within 25 seconds,"" he said, adding that the ringer time should be outside regulatory intervention.
Rival Airtel, on the other hand, said that the timer should be set based on the preference of the network which is receiving the phone call.
“The time taken to terminate the call on a network should be uniform across networks. And the terminating or receiving network should be allowed sufficient time to answer the call. This should be 45 seconds,"" Ravi Gandhi, Chief Regulatory Officer, Bharti Airtel, said.
If these ringing timers are set differently by different network operators, the chances of answering the call by user of one network would be different from the user of another network as one party would get more time to answer the call than the other party.
Also, every call that lands on a mobile network fetches it money. The interconnect usage charge or IUC is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks, and is a source of revenue for telcos such as Airtel and Vodafone Idea who enjoy more incoming traffic than outgoing.
At present, the IUC is at 6 paise a minute.
Interestingly, Jio, which reduced its outgoing call ringer time to 25 seconds, has more outgoing traffic than incoming. Jio’s outgoing traffic is 64% of its total voice traffic, as of June end.
Airtel had last month alleged that by Jio reducing its outgoing call ringing time, the change in pattern results in a missed call, and forces the call receiver on the rival network network to dial back and, hence, create incoming call traffic for Jio.
“Reducing the call ringing time and hence reducing traffic asymmetry artificially is not the way to go,"" Gandhi said.
Jio, however, has argued that globally, most operators have an average ringing time of only 15-20 seconds, and 25 seconds ringing time on Jio network is in line with global practice.
It is important to note that the timer for domestic calls is not regulated by any authority in India at present. Operators have the freedom to choose the ringer timers.
Vodafone Idea has batted for the ringer time to be set at 30 seconds.
“Networks where a call originates should not have any timer. This timer should be set only for terminating or receiving networks,"" Sundeep Kathuria, Executive Vice-President, Policy and Regulation, Regulatory Affairs, Vodafone Idea, said at the open house.
The ringing time also impacts network efficiency. The maximum time allowed to answer the call takes on more importance as the alerting phase also engages scarce radio spectrum resources. Ringing for a long time, when a user is unlikely to accept the phone call, would led to non-optimal utilization of resources.
The reverse also has implications. Configuring duration of ringing time on lower side might save resources but on the other hand it may cause concerns related to network performance, if duration is much lower than the typical time one takes to answer the call."
133,2019-10-18,Reliance,"Consumer-facing businesses offset energy weakness in September quarterRIL’s outstanding debt as on 30 September was  ₹2.91 trillion, compared to  ₹2.87 trillion on 31 March

Mumbai/New Delhi: Oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) on Friday reported 18.3% year-on-year increase in net profit for the September quarter to a record  ₹11,262 crore, backed by strong performances by retail and digital services businesses.
Consumer-facing businesses offset weaknesses in the refining, oil and gas, and petrochemical businesses, as RIL’s net profit increased from  ₹9,516 crore in the year-ago period, beating street estimates, which had pegged the profits at  ₹11,078 crore.
During the quarter, RIL’s revenue rose 4.8% from  ₹1.56 trillion in the year-ago period to  ₹1.63 trillion. Eleven analysts had estimated quarterly revenue at  ₹1.53 trillion.
Ahead of its Q2 results announcement, shares of RIL touched a new 52-week high of  ₹1,427.90 apiece on Friday, taking the company’s market capitalization to more than  ₹9 trillion—the first Indian company to cross the threshold.
“These excellent results reflect the benefits of our integrated oil to chemicals (O2C) value chain and the rapid scale-up of our consumer businesses. During this quarter, our O2C businesses gained from favourable fuel margins environment, feedstock sourcing flexibility and higher petrochemicals volumes,"" said Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director, RIL.
Ambani said Reliance Retail delivered a robust performance with record quarterly revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda. “Our digital services business is recognized for having the nation’s widest 4G wireless network,"" he said.
“The business continues to seize the large market opportunity in the country through expanding its presence—covering the breadth of consumption baskets of groceries, consumer electronics and fashion and lifestyle across geographies,"" RIL said. It opened 337 stores during the quarter.
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, RIL’s telecom subsidiary, posted net profit of  ₹990 crore for the September quarter, up 45.4% year-on-year, as data consumption surged on the back of more subscribers joining the network. The company’s operating revenue rose 33.7% year-on-year to  ₹12,354 crore. Despite the growth in operating revenue, its average revenue per user, or ARPU, fell for the seventh consecutive quarter as most new subscribers were low-paying users.
ARPU—the total revenue of the operator divided by the number of users or connections on its network—stood at  ₹120 with 355.2 million subscribers at September end.
Jio’s ARPU fell 15.6% from  ₹154 in the December 2017 quarter to  ₹130 in the corresponding quarter of 2018 and to  ₹126.2 in the March 2019 quarter. It was  ₹122 in the June quarter.
Anshuman Thakur, head strategy, Reliance Jio Infocomm, said: “At this point we are more focused on creating a digital ecosystem and not ARPU. All our customers continue to be very active and that is our priority—to get more customers to create a digital ecosystem.""
RIL’s retail business saw its segment revenue at  ₹41,202 crore for the quarter, up 27%.
RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM), or the amount a refiner earns by refining one barrel of crude oil, came in at $9.4 a barrel. GRM for the corresponding period of last year was $9.5 per barrel. Analysts had expected RIL’s GRM in the range of $9.5-$10.5 per barrel.
Revenue from the refining and marketing segment decreased 1.6% to  ₹97,229 crore, reflecting lower crude prices during the quarter, while the segment’s Ebit margin came in at 5.1% against 5.4% in the corresponding quarter of last fiscal year.
Revenue from the petrochemicals segment dropped 11.9% to  ₹38,538 crore in the September quarter from  ₹43,745 crore in the second quarter of the last fiscal year. Segment Ebit margin decreased by 6.4% year-on-year to  ₹7,602 crore, primarily due to weaker petrochemical product margins offset by record petrochemical production and cost optimization through light-feed cracking, RIL said. “Demand environment is clearly weak but some of the margin expansion with regard to the international maritime organization regulations you have seen now could have been potentially higher,"" V. Srikanth, joint chief financial officer, RIL, said.
RIL’s outstanding debt as on 30 September was  ₹2.91 trillion, compared to  ₹2.87 trillion on 31 March. Cash and cash equivalents as on 30 September were at  ₹1.34 trillion, compared to  ₹1.33 trillion on 31 March. The capex for this quarter was  ₹19,095 crore."

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, India’s newest and only profitable telecom operator, posted a net profit of  ₹990 crore in the September quarter, up 45.4% year-on-year, as data consumption surged on the back of more subscribers onboarding the network.
The company’s operating revenue rose 33.7% year on year to  ₹12,354 crore.
Despite the growth in operating revenue, its average revenue per user fell for the seventh consecutive quarter as most of the subscribers added were low-paying users.
ARPU stood at  ₹120 with 355.2 million subscribers of September end.
ARPU is the total revenue of the operator divided by the number of users or connections on its network.
From  ₹154 in the December 2017 quarter, Jio’s ARPU fell 15.6% to  ₹130 in the same quarter in 2018 and to  ₹126.2 in the March 2019 quarter. It was  ₹122 in the June quarter.
“Incrementally we expect the growth to come more from the mid-to-low end subscribers and in process diluting the overall ARPU,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a report dated 16 October.
At a time when its rivals are weaning away bottom-of-the-pyramid subscribers by launching minimum recharge plans and improving their ARPU, Jio continues to widen its subscriber base by adding low-paying users on its network.
Comparatively, Airtel’s ARPU rose to  ₹129 in the June quarter from  ₹123 in the preceding three months. Vodafone Idea posted an ARPU of  ₹108 in the June quarter. Airtel and Vodafone Idea are yet to announce financial results for September quarter.
In the June quarter itself, Jio beat rivals Airtel and Vodafone Idea to become the largest operator in terms of revenue. It achieved the rare feat of market leadership in the telecom industry in less than three years of starting its operations in September 2016.
In the June quarter, Bharti Airtel also posted its first quarterly loss in 14 years. It swung to a  ₹2,866 crore loss in the quarter ended 30 June from a net profit of  ₹97 crore in the year earlier as finance costs rose and it incurred a one-time loss of  ₹1,445 crore. Vodafone Idea posted net loss of  ₹4,873.9 crore in the June quarter."
134,2019-10-18,Reliance,"Profit of refining business rose 10% sequentially, on a strong recovery in refining marginsPetchem margins were weak, but higher volumes resulted in marginal growth in profits

Ahead of its Q2 results announcement, shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) touched a new 52-week high of Rs1427.90 a piece on Friday. This took the company’s market capitalization to over Rs9 trillion, making it the first Indian company to cross this threshold. Do the company’s September quarter results justify the optimism?
In keeping with better refining conditions, RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM) has increased to $9.4 per barrel in Q2FY20 from $8.1 per barrel in the June quarter. Benchmark Singapore GRM improved on a quarter-on-quarter basis to $6.5 a barrel. The broad expectation was that RIL’s GRM would be around $9.5 a barrel, but the company’s premium over Singapore margins fell. According to the company, “The premium over Singapore complex margins declined as strength in FO (fuel oil) cracks supported Singapore margins. Additionally, tighter crude markets for heavy crudes resulted in higher costs.""
Nevertheless, earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) of the refining business rose 10% sequentially. The implementation of the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) new regulations from 2020 are resulting in a recovery in refining margins, and hence prospects for this division are clearly looking up compared to earlier this year.
On the other hand, petrochemicals margins remained weak. Revenues from the petchem business rose only 2.5% sequentially, although production volumes rose 13.8%. The division’s Ebit saw a quarter-on-quarter increase of only 1.3%. Spreads on most petchem products have been soft, which has been offset by higher volumes.
Reliance Jio Infocomm continued on its strong growth path, with Ebit rising as much as 11.9% sequentially, on the back of steady subscriber growth and a 5.8% increase in revenues. The retail business continues to perform well with its Ebit increasing by 14.5% sequentially, on the back of a 7.9% q-o-q increase in revenues.
On a year-on-year basis, Ebit of both the refining and petchem businesses were lower, but the consumer business more than made up for this. As a result, consolidated Ebit rose 8.7%, which is commendable, considering that the two energy businesses accounted for over 80% of consolidated Ebit a year ago.
Going forward, investors will watch the trend in refining margins and the progress on the planned debt reduction. “While we should see GRMs remain strong in the near term, the key questions are a) how long would any IMO related uplift sustain; b) how margins trends as outages and maintenance is behind us; and c) what happens to refining margins in 2HCY20 once IMO is broadly behind us,"" J.P. Morgan India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 7 October.
There was not much debt reduction to speak of in Q2, although the company said that capex has come down. This would be a key area to monitor, as RIL shares have zoomed ever since the company said it intends to cut net debt to zero by fiscal 2020-21."
135,2019-10-18,Reliance,"Despite the growth in all these metrics, its average revenue per user fell as most of the subscribers added were low-paying usersA declining ARPU means subscriber additions on the network outpace its growth in revenue

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, India’s newest and only profitable telecom operator, has witnessed seven consecutive quarters of decline in its average revenue per user even as its net profit surged and more subscribers onboarded its network.
The company posted a net profit of  ₹990 crore in the September quarter, up 45.4% year-on-year, as data consumption rose. Its operating revenue increased 33.7% year on year to  ₹12,354 crore.
Despite the growth in all these metrics, its average revenue per user fell as most of the subscribers added were low-paying users.
ARPU stood at  ₹120 with 355.2 million subscribers of September end as against  ₹122 with 331.3 million subscribers as of June end.
ARPU is the total revenue of the operator divided by the number of users or connections on its network.
A declining ARPU means subscriber additions on the network outpace its growth in revenue. In other words, every incremental user contributes less to the total revenue.
This essentially implies that the quality of Jio’s subscriber base is becoming weaker in terms of paying capacity of the user. Moreover, a declining ARPU for Jio is good for its rivals as it would put pressure on Jio to raise tariffs, as the industry clamours for higher prices.
This also comes at a time when Jio has started charging 6 paise a minute for voice calls, after giving it free for over three years.
Earlier this month, Jio said it “had been compelled most reluctantly and unavoidably"" to do this following the decision of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to review the date for scrapping interconnect usage charge (IUC) from 1 January 2020, which has led to regulatory uncertainty.
However, the silver lining amidst a falling ARPU is that data consumption on the network continues to rise. From 11.4 GB in the June quarter, it rose to 11.7 GB in the September quarter.
At a time when its rivals are weaning away bottom-of-the-pyramid subscribers by launching minimum recharge plans and improving their ARPU, Jio continues to widen its subscriber base by adding low-paying users on its network.
“Incrementally we expect the growth to come more from the mid-to-low end subscribers and in process diluting the overall ARPU,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a report dated 16 October.
Comparatively, Airtel’s ARPU rose to  ₹129 in the June quarter from  ₹123 in the preceding three months. Vodafone Idea posted an ARPU of  ₹108 in the June quarter.

Mumbai: Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries reported 18% jump in Q2 net profit to a record  ₹11,262 crore on turnaround in refining margins in the July-September period of the financial year 2019-2020 as against  ₹9,516 crore a year ago.
Revenue from operations grew 4.8% to  ₹1.64 trillion for the quarter ended 30 September, 2019 from  ₹1.56 trillion for the same quarter last year as increase in revenue was primarily on account of robust growth in Retail & Digital Services businesses, which grew by 27% and 43%, respectively.
According to a Bloomberg poll of 14 analysts, RIL’s consolidated net profit is estimated to be  ₹11,256 crores as per the estimate of 10 analysts. However, nine analysts estimated RIL's revenue at  ₹1.51 trillion.
RIL's gross refining margin (GRM) or what it makes from turning every barrel of crude to fuel came in at $9.4 per barrel, which was the best in four quarters. Analysts had expected RIL’s GRM to come in at $9.5-$10.5 per barrel this quarter.
Reliance Retail's revenue for September quarter grew by 27% to  ₹41,202 crore with strong growth across formats despite consumption slowdown as against  ₹32,436 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. During the quarter, Reliance Retail added 337 stores taking the total store count to 10,901 stores, with area under operations of 24.5 Mn.sq.ft.
The telecom business Jio Infocomm reported  ₹990 crore profit and revenue stood at  ₹12,354 crore. Analysts had expected it to report around 7% quarter-on-quarter revenue growth with a marginal dip in average revenue per user (ARPU) by 1-2% to  ₹125. Subscriber base as on 30th Sept stood at 355.2 million.
The Singapore benchmark GRMs practically doubled quarter-on-quarter to $6.6 per barrel, backed by improvement in petrol, diesel, and aviation turbine fuel crack spreads.
Refinery margins have seen an uptick thanks to a reduced global refining activity during the quarter, as refiners underwent planned maintenance across regions. This was done in order to gear up for upcoming winter demand and demand stemming from the new International Maritime Organisation regulations.
Revenue from the petrochemicals segment stood at  ₹38,538 crore. Analysts had expected Petchem earnings to remain under pressure from lower polymer and polyester product cracks.
“While the Petchem environment has weakened, we believe RIL’s ability to switch feedstock to gas for as much as 60-70% of its requirement, should limit Petchem margin decline quarter-on-quarter,"" JP Morgan had said in a report dated 7 October.
Reliance's shares ended 1.42% higher to close at  ₹1,415.30 on Friday, after surging as much as 2.25%. The company became the country's first to reach a market cap of  ₹9 trillion ($126.51 billion) during the session.
In August 2018, RIL became the first domestic firm to cross the  ₹8 lakh crore mark in terms of market valuation.
Reliance Industries would be the first Indian company to reach $200-billion market cap in 24 months, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Wednesday. Currently, RIL commands a market cap of $122 billion.
The foreign fund and advisory firm has reiterated its buy rating on RIL with a price target of  ₹1,615.
In a report, BofA-ML said, its analysis indicates that incrementally three transformational drivers — new commerce venture, fixed broadband business and digital initiatives — could add $55-billion enterprise value for the company."
143,2019-10-18,Reliance,"The sequential recovery in refining margins should help RIL’s earningsFor perspective, benchmark Singapore gross refining margins have averaged $6.5 a barrel for the September quarter, up from $3.5 a barrel in the June quarter

Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) have gained nearly 20% since its annual general meeting on 12 August, when chairman and managing director Mukesh Ambani said the company will have zero net debt by 31 March 2021.
In that backdrop, when RIL announces its September quarter results on Friday, “any signs of decline in capex intensity should increase confidence in our view"", said analysts from HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Pvt. Ltd.
That apart, the sequential recovery in refining margins should help RIL’s earnings. For perspective, benchmark Singapore gross refining margins have averaged $6.5 a barrel for the September quarter, up from $3.5 a barrel in the June quarter.
“A sharp recovery in refining margins, coupled with lower ethane and LNG prices, and higher petchem volumes, should partly offset weakness in benchmark chemical margins and deliver 7% qoq growth in standalone earnings,"" HSBC analysts said in a report on 8 October.
Separately, state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) are expected to report a good set of numbers for the September quarter. OMCs include Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC). Performance of these companies will get a boost from the rebound in refining margins. Further, auto fuel marketing margins have remained resilient. These two factors are likely to set off inventory and forex losses to some extent.
Analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities expect BPCL and HPCL to report 20-23% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) increase in Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), despite accounting for  ₹1,000-1,100 crore of inventory and forex losses. The broker expects IOC to report 20% q-o-q decline in Ebitda, impacted by the  ₹3,300 crore in inventory and forex losses. IOC’s profitability is expected to be relatively weaker than its peers, HPCL and BPCL, primarily owing to higher inventory losses.
Meanwhile, crude oil prices have dropped by about 18% in the September quarter from a year ago. This is likely to drag down profits of oil producers such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltd, as price realization gets adversely affected.
In keeping with the optimism in the broader markets and talks of BPCL’s privatization, shares of all these companies have run up after the corporate tax rate cuts. As such, September quarter results are not expected to fuel big jumps in share prices.
“The stock prices, in our view, are unlikely to move on earnings but would be news flow dependent,"" wrote analysts from JP Morgan India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 7 October.
“For the broader state-owned enterprises space, how the government moves on the potential BPCL privatization would be an important driver for stocks. For Reliance, the key events that investors are focused on are the completion of various deleveraging deals,"" added the analysts."

Macquarie Research expects Reliance Industries’ telecom arm to report 351 million subscribers, while ARPU is expected to drop to  ₹120 in the September quarter from  ₹ 122 in the June quarter.
According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch RIL can become the first Indian company to achieve a market capitalisation of $200 billion in the next two years. The foreign fund and advisory firm has reiterated its buy rating on RIL with a price target of  ₹1,615.
The brokerage firm assumes that the market cap to rise over $200 billion on three informational drivers - new commerce venture, fixed broadband operations and digital initiatives - could add $55 billion enterprise value for the company. The brokerage firm also assumes that its digital initiatives like advertising, lending along with SME/broadband may add $22 billion incremental value.
""RIL targets 10 million Kiranas by FY22; SME enterprise/broadband base of 9 million/7 million base by FY22 and EBITDA margins of 50%/40%; We estimate Jio’s ARPU would increase to  ₹177 in FY22 from  ₹122 (in 1Q20) and estimate better than expected IMO impact leading to GRMs of $13 in FY21"", the brokerage firm added."

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), India's largest private-sector enterprise, is expected to report strong earnings in the September quarter on the back of a recovery in refining margins which is likely to offset weakness in petrochemicals, retail, and telecom operations.
Ten of the 14 analysts polled by Bloomberg expect RIL’s consolidated net profit to be  ₹11256 crore. Nine analysts estimate the company’s revenue at Rs1.51 trillion.
Five leads to watch out for in RIL's second quarter earnings:
Omnichannel strategy and launch of new commerce
New commerce is Reliance Retail’s offline-to-online initiative, which would link producers, traders, small merchants, brands and consumers through technology. The company, the retail arm of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), has been working on its new commerce plan for nearly two years. Currently, it operates neighborhood stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets, wholesale, specialty and online stores. Reliance Retail aims to connect as many as 30 million neighborhood stores through the venture, Ambani said at the company’s annual general meeting on 12 August. The Street expects announcement on the plans shortly.
Revision in ARPU
Strong subscriber additions may aid growth at Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd with analysts expecting Reliance Jio to add close to 2.4 crore subscribers in the quarter ended September. However, average revenue per user is expected to fall yet again as Jio adds more JioPhone subscribers who enroll at lower rentals, lured by cashback on digital recharges. Besides, now Jio customers with a prepaid mobile connection will have to choose between the IUC (Interconnect Usage Charges) and non-IUC top-up plans being offered by the company. Reliance Jio recently announced that it will be charging an additional 6 paise per minute for calls made by its users to any non-Jio mobile number.
Updates on the deal with Saudi Aramco
The Street would be keenly awaiting any updates on RIL’s deal with Saudi Arabian Oil Co, under which the oil-to-telecom company plans to sell a 20% stake in its flagship chemicals and refining business to Saudi Aramco in a deal valued at $15 billion. RIL seeks to cut its massive debt and also secure an assured supply of crude oil to its refineries through this deal.
Recovery in petrochemicals margin
Key petrochemical products, especially in the polyethylene (PE) chain, prices are at decadal lows. Paraxylene prices have also collapsed. The weakness is more pronounced in the PE chain. While oil prices are down, so is naphtha, spreads (based on naphtha) are down 10-20% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Given the relentless wave of capacity addition across the petchem chain getting commissioned globally and weak demand outlook, JP Morgan analysts said they struggle to see a sharp recovery in petchem spreads anytime soon.
Outlook on refining margins
RIL is expected to report an increase in its gross refining margin (GRMs), which is what a refiner makes from turning every barrel of crude to fuel. Analysts expect RIL’s GRM to be at $9.5-10.5 per barrel during the quarter. The Singapore benchmark GRMs practically doubled quarter-on-quarter to $6.6 per barrel, backed by improvement in petrol, diesel, and aviation turbine fuel crack spreads. However, RIL’s premium to the benchmark is expected to be the lowest in 18 quarters, due to maintenance shutdowns during the quarter and lower production of petrol and fuel-oil. RIL produces more diesel. Margins have seen an uptick thanks to a reduced global refining activity during the quarter due to maintenance shutdown across regions. This was done to gear up for upcoming winter and demand stemming from the new International Maritime Organisation regulations."

The company’s subscriber base as of June end was 331.3 million. It had reported a profit of  ₹8.91 billion in the June quarter, up 45.6% year-on-year and an operating revenue of  ₹116.79 billion rupees, up 44% on year.
Macquarie Research expects Reliance Industries’ telecom arm to report 351 million subscribers, while ARPU is expected to drop to  ₹120 in the September quarter from  ₹122 in the June quarter.
To be sure, while Jio has witnessed a continuous drop in its average monthly billings over the past six quarters, it still outperforms its rivals on this metric.
From  ₹154 in the December 2017 quarter, Jio’s ARPU fell 15.6% to  ₹130 in the same quarter in 2018 and to  ₹126.2 in the March 2019 quarter.
“Incrementally we expect the growth to come more from the mid-to-low end subscribers and in process diluting the overall ARPU,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a report dated 16 October.
ARPU is the total revenue of the operator divided by the number of users or connections on its network.
Comparatively, Airtel’s ARPU rose to  ₹129 in the June quarter from  ₹123 in the preceding three months. It has not yet announced its September quarter earnings. Vodafone Idea posted an ARPU of  ₹108 in the June quarter.
At a time when its rivals are weaning away bottom-of-the-pyramid subscribers by launching minimum recharge plans and improving their ARPU, Jio continues to widen its subscriber base by adding low-paying users on its network.
“In the next 12-18 months, we expect Jio to bundle content, add more value and would raise tariffs by offering more value to the consumer,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.
Industry analysts will look out for management commentary on the company’s ability to maintain revenue momentum, capex outlook and update on the rollout of its fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) offering Jio GigaFiber.
Jio GigaFiber is touted as the largest greenfield fixed-line broadband rollout globally, with simultaneous introduction in 1,600 cities across India."

BENGALURU :
Two years ago, Vikas Sethia, co-founder of distribution logistics platform Udaan Logisure, conceived of a petroleum transportation service in collaboration with Reliance Petroleum, a unit of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL). What took shape was the outcome of the 2017 summer cohort of JioGenNext, a startup accelerator backed by RIL.
Not only did RIL guide Logisure by alerting them to all the “logistics challenges they face"" but it “also made us a part of their initiatives to optimize their logistics"", said Sethia.
JioGenNext has mentored 131 startups including Udaan Logisure in agritech, digital consumer services, edtech, fintech, healthtech, fitness, and retail with more than $60 million of funding raised.
Udaan Logisure is a case in point that the startup ecosystem has never had it better. Thousands of aspiring unicorns across India are being nurtured by multinational and homegrown companies, including Bharti Airtel, Reliance Industries, Accenture Ventures, Google, Microsoft, SAP, and Oracle. Besides mentoring the founders, companies are also acqui-hiring many of these early- and growth-stage startups for their domain expertise.
In 2017, Bharti Airtel Ltd acquired a strategic stake in Juggernaut Books and a strategic equity stake in Seynse Technologies, a fintech company. In 2018, the telecom company announced an acqui-hire deal with AuthMe ID Services, a Bengaluru-based AI startup. The Accenture Ventures programme that seeks to provide Indian startups a global platform tracks more than a thousand business-to-business (B2B) deep-tech startups at any given time, said Avnish Sabharwal, managing director (MD), Accenture Ventures and Open Innovation in India and the Middle-East.
“In India, we track more than 1,300 B2B deep-tech startups, engage with nearly 200 startups and have deployed more than 100 startup solutions with clients in the last financial year. We work with B2B growth-stage, deep-tech startups using disruptive technologies such as AI (artificial intelligence), analytics, blockchain, IoT (Internet of Things), and automation,"" said Sabharwal.
On its part, SAP Startup Studio, a 75-seat accelerator programme for early stage startups, on the SAP Labs India campus in Bengaluru, incubates 10 startups at present. Over the last two batches it has accelerated 24 startups. “To support employees who want to pursue their entrepreneurial desires, SAP Labs offers an entrepreneurship sabbatical,"" said Sindhu Gangadharan, senior vice president and MD, SAP Labs India.
Microsoft, too, has several initiatives worldwide to support startups. Its ScaleUp programme supports Seed or Series A funded B2B and select business-to-consumer tech-enabled startups to co-sell with Microsoft sales teams, get access to top technology venture capitalists globally and receive mentorship from the startup ecosystem. Microsoft for Startups has closed more than 120 co-sell deals with more than $126 million in active pipeline for startups, in about 18 months, the company said in June.
Homegrown software-as-a-service major Zoho engages with more than 2,400 startups in India. Kuppulakshmi Krishnamoorthy, global head, Zoho for Startups, says, via this programme Zoho “is associated with over 35 startup bodies"" in India. This includes incubators, accelerators, co-working spaces, and government initiatives.
Corporate accelerator and incubator programmes in India are growing at an average rate of 37-40% per annum, said industry body Nasscom’s vice-president, industry initiatives, K.S. Viswanathan. “Corporate accelerators leverage the innovation that is available in the ecosystem. Not all innovation necessarily needs to take place within the enterprise,"" he said.
Sudhir Sethi, founder and chairman of VC firm Chiratae Ventures India Advisors, feels more such programmes are needed. “The places that can mentor and help a new company start, whether it is from a corporate or educational institution or by a venture investor are all needed,"" Sethi said."

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio added over 84.45 lakh mobile subscribers in August, witnessing the highest monthly growth rate of nearly 2.5% in comparison to other operators.
Jio's total subscriber base now stands at 34.82 crore, according to data released on Friday by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).
Vodafone Idea lost 49.56 lakh subscribers during the month, bringing its subscriber base down to 37.5 crore. Bharti Airtel reported 5.61 lakh customers exiting its network, pulling down its subscriber base to 32.79 crore.
Government-owned BSNL and MTNL posted 2.15 lakh and 6,701 subscribers respectively leaving its network, TRAI data added.
In August, 48.6 lakh subscribers submitted their requests for mobile number portability (MNP). With this, the cumulative MNP requests increased from 44.7 crore at the end of July to 452.26 million at the end of August since the implementation of MNP.
As on August 31, private access service providers held 89.78 per cent market share of the wireless subscribers while BSNL and MTNL had a market share of only 10.22 per cent.
Of the total wireless subscribers (117 crore), 97 crore were active on the date of peak VLR in August. The proportion of active wireless subscribers was 82.85 per cent of the total wireless subscriber base."

MUMBAI :
Two years after Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) adopted a zero drilling strategy to conserve cash, the company has resumed drilling in its shale gas joint venture with Chevron.
""Development momentum continued at both Chevron and Ensign joint ventures. In Chevron joint venture, eight wells were drilled during the quarter. Six new wells were also put on production, which is the first set of wells to be turned-in-line after a two-year hiatus,"" RIL said in its earnings press statement released on Friday.
RIL said overall production was 11% higher at 19.9 billion cubic feet equivalent (bcfe). New volumes during the second half of the quarter mitigated the natural decline of wells across both the joint ventures. Production expected to increase further during the fourth quarter of the year 2019, RIL added.
During the second quarter of calendar year 2019, RIL saw revenue from its Shale oil and gas operations drop 41.4% to  ₹343 crore against  ₹585 crore during the second quarter of the calendar year 2018. EBIT margin was down 101.5% against 50.3% during the same period, RIL said in the press statement.
RIL's US shale gas ventures have been facing challenges due to low shale gas prices. RIL and its partners had thus decided to rationalize portfolio investments.
Till 2014, RIL had been bullish on the shale gas segment but a fall in crude oil prices since late 2014 have hit valuations of oil and gas assets. Shale gas blocks have suffered far more than conventional oil and gas blocks as they are economically viable only when prices are above a certain threshold.
RIL had between 2010 and 2013, bought stakes in three upstream oil exploration joint ventures with Chevron, Pioneer Natural Resource, and Carrizo Oil and Gas, and a midstream joint venture with Pioneer. (Midstream refers to the processing, storing, transporting and marketing of hydrocarbons) Aggregate investments since the inception of these ventures were $8.2 billion till 2016.
In June 2015, the company sold its Eagle Ford (EFS) midstream joint venture with Pioneer Natural Resources in the US, realising $1 billion from the sale. RIL had spent $46 million in acquiring the 49.9% stake in EFS and invested another $208 million over the years.
RIL in March 2018 sold some of its assets in Eagle Ford shale position in the US to Sundance Energy Inc. for $100 million. It continues to retain its interest in the remaining Eagle Ford assets."

130,2019-10-20,Reliance,"The letter contains Jio’s official response to the consultation paper floated by Trai on 18 SeptemberScrapping IUC or reducing it would benefit an operator which has more outgoing traffic than incoming calls

New Delhi: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai) rethink to scrap interconnect usage charges is unwarranted, arbitrary and anti-poor and not only affects the credibility of the authority but also sabotages the government’s Digital India mission, Reliance Jio has alleged.
In a letter written to Trai, the telecom operator said that if the authority does not scrap IUC, there will be little incentive for mobile service providers to invest in technology migration as long as the returns are assured to them in the form of this subsidy.
“The consultation paper aids and abets sabotage of the Prime Minister’s Digital India mission because it protects and perpetuates the vested interests of certain incumbent telecom operators who do want their large body of 2G customers to forever remain digitally disempowered and deprived of the fruits of the Digital Revolution,"" Jio said in the letter dated 18 October.
Mint has seen a copy of the letter.
The letter contains Jio’s official response to the consultation paper floated by Trai on 18 September to see if there is a need to revise the applicable date for scrapping IUC from 1 January, 2020, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic.
In September 2017, Trai had ordered a reduction in IUC to six paise per minute from 1 October 2017 from 14 paise earlier and an end to it from 1 January 2020.
Telecom operators, already reeling from a fierce price war that started with the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016, were hit hard by the order. At the time Trai decided to scrap IUC, Airtel, Vodafone and Idea had resisted the change, while Jio was in favour.
IUC, at 6 paise a minute, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks.
Scrapping the IUC or reducing it would benefit an operator such as Jio which has more outgoing traffic than incoming calls. Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd earn a portion of their revenue from IUC as their incoming traffic is higher than outgoing.
Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which are currently battling shrinking revenue streams thanks to Jio’s cut-throat tariffs, have welcomed Trai's regulatory rethink.
Jio, however, has alleged that perfect traffic symmetry is statistically impossible and Trai’s rethink will result in “protectionism which is bound to result into technology stagnation"" which will jeopardise Digital India programme.
In a scathing attack on the regulator, Jio has also said that it is “unfortunate that instead of profiting the poor and marginalised sections of Indian society, the consultation paper has chosen to help profiteers in the telecom business"".
Jio, which is the newest entrant and the only profitable telecom operator, has also alleged that incumbent operators are deliberately keeping users on 2G networks and that the date to scrap IUC – 1 January, 2020, must be adhered to.
“This is a malicious intent to keep a large number of subscribers on the per minute calling plans by forcing them to use 2G voice technology and ensuring they make missed calls to Jio’s network in order to perpetuate traffic asymmetry which can be used to justify the continued use of the subsidy given to them in form of IUC charges,"" Jio said.
Jio is the only pure-4G network in India. Vodafone Idea operates 2G, 3G and 4G networks. Airtel operates 2G and 4G and is in the process of phasing out 3G networks by March 2020."
129,2019-10-20,Reliance,"Reliance and its partner BP Plc had announced an investment of  ₹40,000 crore in the three sets of discoveries to reverse the flagging production in KG-D6 blockReliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block

Reliance Industries Ltd has said that it is on track to start production from a new gas field in the flagging KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal from mid-2020 even as output from its existing fields continued to fall.
Reliance and its partner BP Plc of the UK had in June 2017 announced an investment of  ₹40,000 crore in the three sets of discoveries to reverse the flagging production in KG-D6 block.
These finds were expected to bring a total 30-35 million cubic metres (1 billion cubic feet) of gas a day onstream, phased over 2020-22.
The three sets of discoveries are R-Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ field. R-Cluster will be first to come on stream.
""On track for gas from R-Cluster in mid-2020,"" Reliance said in an investor presentation post announcing its second quarter earnings.
The company has already drilled all the six wells on the field and ""second campaign for installation of subsea production system (SPS)"" was progressing, it said.
Drilling of three out of the five wells on Satellite Cluster has been completed and engineering and fabrication for SPS was on track, it said.
Satellite Cluster is to begin production in 2021.
For MJ, first phase of drilling will commence in January-March 2021, it said.
Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block, was put to production in September 2008.
The output from D-1 and D-3 has fallen sharply from 54 million standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) in March 2010 to 1.68 mmscmd in the July-September, the presentation said.
The fields had produced an average of 1.76 mmscmd of gas in April-June 2019. MA field ceased to produce last year.
""D1-D3 fields in a late life stage and affected by low pressure and water ingress related challenges,"" the presentation said.
Reliance is the operator of the block with 66.6% interest while BP holds the remaining stake in the block.
MJ gas find is located about 2,000 metres directly below the currently producing Dhirubhai-1 and 3 (D1 and D3) fields in the KG-D6 block and is estimated to hold a minimum of 0.988 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of contingent resource.
Besides MJ-1, four deepsea satellite gas discoveries -- D-2, 6, 19 and 22 -- are planned to be developed together with D29 and D30 finds on the block. The third set is the D-34 or R-Series find.
The government had in 2012 approved a USD 1.529 billion plan to produce 10.36 mmscmd of gas from four satellite fields of block KG-DWN-98/3 (KG-D6) by 2016-17.
The four fields have 617 billion cubic feet of reserves and can produce gas for eight years.
However, the companies did not begin the investment citing uncertainty over gas pricing.
After the government allowed a higher gas price for yet-to-be-developed gas finds in difficult areas like the deep sea, RIL and BP decided to take up their development.
RIL-BP have kept the USD 3.18 billion investment plan for D-34 or R-Series gas field in the same block, which was approved in August 2013. About 12.9 mmscmd of gas for 13 years can be produced from D-34 discovery, which is estimated to hold recoverable reserves of 1.4 trillion cubic feet.
Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production."

NEW DELHI :
More cracks have emerged in the already divided telecom sector with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in favour of scrapping interconnect usage charge (IUC) from next year, while Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, or BSNL, opposing the move.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had recently floated a fresh consultation paper to see if there was a need to revise the date for scrapping IUC from 1 January 2020, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic.
Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which are currently battling shrinking revenue, thanks to Jio’s cut-throat tariffs, have welcomed Trai’s regulatory rethink.
Jio, however, said it believes this rethink to scrap IUC was unwarranted, arbitrary and anti-poor, and not only affects the credibility of the authority, but also sabotages the government’s Digital India mission.
“We firmly recommend that the applicable date for Bill and Keep regime be moved by at least three years,"" Airtel said in its comments on Trai’s consultation paper.
Under the Bill and Keep regime, operators do not pay any charge to each other for receiving calls on their network. Simply put, Bill and Keep means scrapping IUC.
IUC, at 6 paise per minute, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks.
Scrapping IUC, or reducing it, would benefit Jio, which has more outgoing traffic than incoming calls. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea earn a portion of their revenue from IUC as their incoming traffic is higher than outgoing.
Airtel has backed the extension as it believes that traffic symmetry has not been achieved. Vodafone Idea, too, has said in its comments that there was a need to extend the applicable date to move to a zero-IUC regime and, wherever Bill and Keep exists, it is based on mutual agreement among operators when there is symmetry in traffic.
However, Jio has alleged that perfect traffic symmetry is statistically impossible and Trai’s rethink will result in “protectionism, which is bound to result into technology stagnation"". This, Jio said, will jeopardize the government’s Digital India programme.
On Monday, Trai uploaded the submissions made by operators on its website. In its comments to the regulator, Jio said if the authority does not scrap IUC, there will be little incentive for mobile service providers to invest in technology migration as long as the returns are assured to them in the form of this subsidy.
Meanwhile, Airtel and Vodafone Idea have said many customers in India still remain on legacy networks. “The projections by GSMA for India also predict that 12-13% of customers will continue to be on 2G handsets till 2025,"" Airtel said.
In September 2017, Trai had ordered a reduction in IUC to 6 paise per minute from 1 October 2017 from 14 paise earlier and an end to it from 1 January 2020.
The telecom operators, already reeling from a fierce price war that started with the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016, were hit hard by the order. At the time Trai decided to scrap IUC, Airtel, Vodafone and Idea had resisted the change, while Jio was in favour.
“Even after considering that 100% subscribers of new greenfield operator i.e. Jio are on 4G VoLTE, 56% of overall subscribers are on 2G/3G networks... Also, 78% of Vodafone Idea’s subscriber base is on 2G/3G despite 4G VoLTE offered by the company and also competition,"" Vodafone Idea said in its comments to Trai.
State-run BSNL has also urged Trai to reconsider scrapping IUC."
125,2019-10-21,Reliance,"Move comes less than a fortnight after Jio announced that it would start charging 6 paise a minute for voice callsRemoval or reduction of the IUC would benefit Jio which has more outgoing traffic than incoming calls

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has raised basic monthly tariff plans to account for interconnect usage charges (IUC) that the telecom operator has to incur for calls made to rival networks.
The company earlier offered a 28-day validity plan with unlimited voice calls and 2GB data per day for  ₹198. A  ₹222 plan introduced on Monday would have the same data benefits, unlimited Jio-to-Jio calls and 1000 minutes of calling for Jio to non-Jio numbers. This translates to a tariff hike of  ₹24.
Reliance Jio also announced a new  ₹333 plan offering 2GB data a day for 56 days, along with unlimited calls within the Jio network and 1000 minutes of Jio to non-Jio calls. This would mean a daily expense of  ₹5.94 for the user. The closest existing plan with similar data benefits was for  ₹398 with 70-day validity, which meant a daily expense of  ₹5.68 for the user.
The company has also withdrawn packs of  ₹19 and  ₹52 — valid for one and seven days, respectively.
The move comes less than a fortnight after Jio announced that it would start charging 6 paise a minute for voice calls, as it “had been compelled, most reluctantly and unavoidably"" by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai) move to review the date for scrapping IUC from 1 January 2020.
IUC, at 6 paise a minute, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks. A removal or reduction of the IUC would benefit an operator such as Jio which has more outgoing traffic than incoming calls. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd earn a portion of their revenue from IUC as their incoming traffic is higher than outgoing.
Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which are currently battling shrinking revenue streams thanks to Jio’s cut-throat tariffs, have welcomed Trai’s regulatory rethink.
“It looks like 6 paise per minute charging doesn’t seem to have gone well with customers,"" said Himanshu Shah, an analyst at Dolat Capital.
Analysts said the price rise bodes well for incumbents Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea which have been complaining that current tariffs are unsustainable and price repair must happen in the sector.
“Jio said that it will only charge 6 paise per minute till Trai scraps IUC. That consultation is still happening and the regulator is yet to take a decision. Hence it is strange that at this time Jio has come out with new plans which are inclusive of IUC minutes. This will lead to a rise in ARPU for Jio,"" a Mumbai-based analyst said requesting anonymity.
Responding to Mint’s query, a Jio spokesperson said that there was no price increase. “The user currently pays  ₹198 + IUC top-up for off-net mobile calls. The same is being made available in a bundled form,"" the spokesperson said.
However, a user of the  ₹198 plan which earlier had unlimited calls across networks will now also have to buy a top-up voucher to make calls to rival networks.
“The users continue to get the earlier packs as well, so it (new plan) is for those users who want peace of mind,"" the spokesperson said.
This price increase also comes at a time when Jio’s average revenue per user (ARPU) has fallen for seven straight quarters. ARPU is the total revenue of the operator divided by the number of users or connections on its network.
Jio’s ARPU fell to  ₹120 with 355.2 million users of September end from  ₹122 with 331.3 million users as of June end.
A declining ARPU means subscriber additions on the network outpace its growth in revenue. In other words, every incremental user contributes less to the total revenue. This essentially implies that the quality of Jio’s subscriber base is becoming weaker in terms of paying capacity of the user."

This is sharply lower than quarterly averages of  ₹25,000-26,000 crore over FY18-19, added Centrum in a report on 19 October.
Separately, RIL’s September quarter performance doesn’t disappoint with its consumer businesses, retail and telecom, firing strongly, boosting overall earnings. Consumer business contribution in overall consolidated Ebitda stood at 33% for the September quarter, up from 23% in the same period last year.
That said, investor focus will be on debt reduction by March 2021. “Our capex forecasts are even lower on average in FY20-22E (barring spectrum renewal) but find limited scope of meaningful organic free cash flow keeping net liabilities flattish in this period contrary to Reliance's guidance of a ~US$25bn fall by March 2021 (including Aramco),"" said Jefferies."

NEW DELHI :
Leading telecom operator Reliance Jio today launched Jio 'All-In-One' plans which gives 2GB data everyday alongwith 1,000 minutes of free talktime to non-Jio mobile numbers. Jio to Jio calls remain free, as ever.
Giving consumers the flexibility to choose a plan of their choice, Jio's new plan starts from  ₹222 for 1 month,  ₹333 for 2 months and  ₹444 for 3 months.
In a release, Jio said the new recharge plans are cheaper by at least 20-50% in the market than other rival telecom operators. Jio said other rival telecom operators offer similar packs at  ₹249.
Jio customers can also upgrade their existing one-month plan at  ₹111 as every  ₹111 additional payment over base plan provides 1-month extra service.
When compared to Jio’s existing 1.5GB/day plan, the new plans offer extra GBs at  ₹1/GB and free additional 1,000 minutes of offnet IUC (Interconnect Usage Charges) minutes, which would have cost users  ₹80 if purchased separately.
For example, at  ₹399 (3-month plan), Jio customer pays  ₹45 to get 42 GB, which comes at only Re 1/GB.
When compared to Jio’s existing 2GB/day plan, the 3-month 2GB per day pack will now cost only  ₹444 instead of 448 earlier. It also comes with additional 1,000 minutes of IUC voice calls which would have come at nearly  ₹80 separately.
The 2GB, 2-month plan now costs  ₹333 against the earlier cost of  ₹396 (198x2). It also comes with an additional 1,000 minutes of IUC voice calls which would have come at nearly  ₹80 separately.
IUC voice calls, for which Jio has now started charging at the rate of 6 paise per minute, are calls which are made to other operators. Jio customers can make free voice calls only to other Jio numbers and landline numbers. For calling any mobile number outside of the Jio network like that of Airtel and Vodafone Idea, consumers will have to pay an IUC charge of 6 paise a minute."

Over the next 6-9 months, it plans to extend it to 200 brands for 60,000 stores across 800 cities

BENGALURU :
Over a month after Reliance Industries Ltd’s investment in Fynd, the retail tech startup is in the process of deploying some of its tech solutions in the Reliance ecosystem, said a top company executive.
“Reliance is focused on offline-to-online commerce and whatever we are doing in terms of the technology platform is a step in that direction,"" said Harsh Shah, co-founder of Fynd. “We are also figuring out more synergies but nothing has been rolled out or deployed yet.""
Co-founded by Farooq Adam, Sreeraman M.G. and Shah, Fynd provides an omni-channel retail product to brick-and-mortar stores, allowing stores to list their entire inventory on Fynd’s online e-commerce marketplace.
Over the last 4-5 years, Fynd has taken its core platform of integration with brands and a layer of logistics facility to add use cases on top of it.
And now, capitalizing on their synergies with brands, the firm recently launched a new retail solution - Uniket—which could eventually form almost half of the company’s revenue.
Uniket is a retail solution for unorganized retailers who can now buy branded products from Fynd—either in bulk to be housed in the store or for a customer who wants to purchase a branded product.
For now, Fynd offers products across 51 brands to 6,500 retailers in 350 cities. Over the next 6-9 months, they plan to extend it to 200 brands for 60,000 stores across 800 cities.
“During Uniket’s pilot, around 12-15% of our revenues started coming from it and over the next nine months, we expect it to become 35-40% of our revenue,"" added Shah.
While currently Reliance is not playing a role in this product, if it goes as per plans, Fynd expects to utilize the Reliance ecosystem to expand further.
In August, Reliance Industries had announced that it will acquire 87.6% stake in Shopsense Retail Technologies that runs Fynd for  ₹295 crore. As part of this deal, the company also has the option to further invest up to  ₹100 crore by December 2021 in Fynd.
This transaction provided an exit to a long list of Fynd’s initial investors. Since its launch in September 2012, Fynd has had several investors including the likes of search giant Google which led its series C funding round in March 2018.
Other investors of Fynd included Kae Capital, IIFL, Singularity Ventures, GrowX, Tracxn Labs, Venture Catalyst, Patni family office and Hong Kong-based Axis Capital."

121,2019-10-22,Reliance,"Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL have also favoured levying of the interconnect usage chargeTrai had proposed to move from the current IUC regime to the BAK (bill and keep), regime where no operator will charge for mobile call transmission, from January 1, 2020

NEW DELHI :
Telecom operator Bharti Airtel in its submission to sector regulator Trai has favoured charging incoming calls originating from network of other mobile phone service provider till 2022.
Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL have also favoured levying of the interconnect usage charge (IUC), currently 6 paise per minute, on every incoming calls from network of other operators. However, Jio has opposed continuation of the charges.
Trai had proposed to move from the current IUC regime to the BAK (bill and keep), regime where no operator will charge for mobile call transmission, from January 1, 2020. However, the regulator recently floated consultation paper on whether there is a need to defer the date of removing mobile call termination charges.
Airtel and Vodafone Idea have said IUC is a fee charged from a telecom operator for using infrastructure of other service provider to complete call of his subscriber.
""There is a dire need to move the applicable date for BAK (bill and keep) regime by at least 3 years,"" Airtel said in its submission to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).
Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has alleged that review of call connect charges by Trai ""sabotages"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision for Digital India and will hit not only the regulator's credibility but also investor confidence, as the move protects vested interests of some old operators.
Any change in implementation of original timeline of January 1, 2020, will end the free voice call regime and is likely to increase tariffs which is against consumer interest, Jio claimed.
Think-tank Broadband India Forum said there is absolutely no need to revise the applicable date of January 1, 2020, for zero termination charge and that it should be firmly held, as earlier scheduled by the Trai.
""Continuing to incentivise or subsidise operators in the form of IUC for managing the significantly less-efficient 2G voice networks will not only be detrimental to consumers, but also adversely impact the growth of all digital players, start-ups, OTTs (over-the-top players), application developers, etc,"" BIF said.
However, Airtel and Vodafone Idea claimed that many users continue to use 2G network, and transmission of calls incurs expenses more than 6 paise per minute fixed by the Trai at present.
IUC has been considered to be applicable in case of 2G and 3G network, while negligible in case of VoLTE which is voice calls using 4G networks.
Trai was under the impression that the reduction of IUC will push operator to deploy modern IP (internet protocol)-based network.
Airtel said it has invested about  ₹40,000 crore into the network only in the past two years but still, 67 per cent subscribers on its network use non-4G devices.
The company said its 4G network currently covers about 93 per cent population as compared to the 94.5 per cent population covered by 2G. Still the adoption of 4G by customers both in terms of migration to 4G handsets and use of VoLTE for voice has been slow primarily due to costlier 4G hand, said the Sunil Bharti Mittal-led firm.
""Out of the total 328 million Airtel customers, only 107 million (33 per cent) are using the 4G–LTE data network. The remaining (67 per cent) are still using non-4G (2G/3G) handsets, as these handsets are more affordable,"" Airtel said.
Vodafone Idea said that even after the roll-out of 4G networks, there is a huge demand for 2G devices with 80 lakh to 1 crore phones being sold every month.
""Thus a large base of consumers in India uses voice only as a service and they are using or buying 2G, 3G devices by choice...Therefore, the consumer behaviour and demand is the reason for the continuing substantial use of circuit switch networks (technology used 2G and 3G networks) for voice,"" Vodafone Idea said.
BSNL said removing of termination charges should be kept in abeyance."

119,2019-10-22,Reliance,"The government, in March last year, enhanced the number of annual instalments for spectrum payment from 10 to 16 yearsThe telecom sector has been battered by falling tariffs, eroding profitability and mounting debt

NEW DELHI :
Private telecom operators Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have paid the Telecom Department over  ₹4,500 crore in spectrum dues in the last three to four days, according to sources.
Sources said that the payments came in before the due date.
The sparring telcos -- some of which are reeling under acute financial stress and are seeking immediate relief measures -- have made the payment towards deferred spectrum liability (or instalment payment for radiowaves bought in past auctions) which fell due on October 21.
While Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has paid  ₹1,133 crore to the Department of Telecom, Vodafone Idea has made  ₹2,421 crore payment towards spectrum dues. Sunil Mittal's Bharti Airtel has paid  ₹977 crore. Taken together, these three players have paid over  ₹4,531 crore towards spectrum dues late last week.
Emails sent to Reliance Jio and Airtel went unanswered, while a Vodafone Idea spokesperson said that the company does not comment on matters that are business as usual.
The government, in March last year, enhanced the number of annual instalments for spectrum payment from 10 to 16 years to provide a breather to the debt-laden telecom sector.
But with the industry reeling under financial stress, Vodafone Group Chairman Gerard Kleisterlee and CEO Nick Read recently met Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash, as the company sought a two-year moratorium on deferred spectrum payments, and other relief measures from the government.
The British telecom giant has asserted that it is focused on the successful integration of business between Vodafone and Idea.
The telecom sector has been battered by falling tariffs, eroding profitability and mounting debt in the face of stiff competition triggered by disruptive offerings of Reliance Jio. The industry has been seeking urgent relief such as cut in levies like licence fee and spectrum charges, and release of GST input tax credit locked up with the government.
In a sector stung by policy and regulatory issues, battlelines have been drawn more recently over the contentious matter of call connect charges, where the regulator is reviewing whether or not the zero termination charge regime should be pushed back from the originally-stated timeline of January 1, 2020.
Reliance Jio has alleged that any review of call connect charges by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) ""sabotages"" the Prime Minister's vision for Digital India, and will hit not only the regulator's credibility but also investor confidence as the move protects vested interests of some old operators. Bharti Airtel has favoured continuation of call connect charges till 2022.
Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL too have favoured levying of the interconnect usage charge (IUC), currently 6 paise per minute, on every incoming calls from the network of other operators."

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel has displayed fastest download speeds of 9.6 mbps and best video experience across all telecom circles in India, while Reliance Jio has extended its 4G availability to 97 per cent, according to OpenSignal's latest mobile network experience report.
Airtel has excelled in the download speed experience category by scoring 9.6 mbps, followed by Vodafone (7.9 mbps), Idea (7.6 mbps), Jio (6.7 mbps) and 3G-only BSNL (3.1 mbps).
The download speeds are key for streaming of online content, especially videos and games, said mobile analytics company Opensignal.
Latency is crucial for response time. Jio has won the battle on latency with users on its network experiencing response time of 54.2 milliseconds, followed by Airtel at 57.1 milliseconds.
The latencies have improved over the past six months across all operators. As per April 2019 data, Jio's latency was 62.5 milliseconds.
""The lower latency is on a network, the better experience you'll receive on a host of mobile applications and services, from web browsing to voice over IP to real-time multi-player gaming,"" the report says.
Vodafone topped in voice app experience -- a new metric introduced by Opensignal in the latest survey. This captures the quality perceived by users of voice communication mobile apps -- WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Skype.
Vodafone scored 72.6 that was marginally better than Airtel's 72. Though this parameter is important from the users' point of view, for operators, voice calls made through OTT (over-the-top) apps directly compete with their own voice call services.

New Delhi: Broadband download speeds in India rose by 16.5% during Q2-Q3 2019 and topped 34.07 Mbps in September, according to Ookla's report examining the recent trends in Indian telecom market during the last two quarters.
According to the findings of the report, India is the leader in mean fixed broadband download speed amongst other neighboring countries with Bangladesh at 24.02 Mbps and Pakistan, with flat speeds between 8.54 and 9.14 Mbps. The report highlights that with Reliance Jio’s rollout of its new GigaFiber service in India in early September, the fixed broadband speeds will continue to increase country-wide.
As per the report, the mobile download speeds were relatively flat in India, fluctuating between 10.63 Mbps and 11.18 Mbps during Q2-Q3 2019. Regionally, India’s mobile performance is marginally faster than Bangladesh’s, which saw average speeds max out at 10.43 Mbps, and somewhat slower than Pakistan’s top speeds of 15.55 Mbps.
As per the findings of the report, 4G availability continues to improve in India. India’s 4G availability was relatively high at 87.9% across providers during Q2-Q3 2019. For comparison, 4G availability was 58.9% in Pakistan and 58.7% in Bangladesh during the same period.
On comparing the fixed and mobile download speeds in the 15 largest cities in India, the reports shows wide disparities between the cities.
Chennai had by far the fastest mean download speed over fixed broadband (51.07 Mbps), followed by Bengaluru (42.50 Mbps) and Hyderabad (41.68 Mbps). The slowest download speeds were measured in Nagpur (20.10 Mbps), followed by Pune (22.78 Mbps) and Kanpur (23.20 Mbps).
Mobile download speeds, which include all cellular technologies, showed somewhat less variation from city to city. This includes Mumbai (11.87 Mbps), Indore (11.80 Mbps), Visakhapatnam (11.74 Mbps), Hyderabad (11.48) and Kolkata (11.46 Mbps) had the fastest mobile download speeds.

New Delhi: India is not likely to benefit from the US-China trade tensions largely owing to existing policy barriers to large-scale production, strict labour laws and difficult land-acquisition process, says an EIU report.
The US-China trade war has prompted some global companies to diversify their manufacturing base and moving some production out of China, but India is unlikely to be at the receiving end.
India may lose out on investment to regional peers because of policy barriers to large-scale production, strict labour laws, difficult land-acquisition and permitting processes and a limited number of free-trade agreements (FTAs), Sarthak Gupta, Analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) said.
""While the recent corporate tax cut is likely to improve the attractiveness of the Indian business environment, we believe that the country is likely to remain relatively far down the list of favoured manufacturing alternatives to China,"" Gupta noted.
As the US-China trade war continues to disrupt global commerce, South-East Asia — especially Vietnam and Thailand — has emerged as the leading destination for firms seeking to reduce their reliance on production bases in China.
""Brazil, East Africa and Bangladesh may also become more attractive manufacturing destinations than India over the medium term if their respective policy environments continue to improve at a more rapid pace than India's,"" Gupta noted.
As per the report, even though India's ranking has improved dramatically in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business index for 2019, and infrastructure investment has increased, acquiring land for large industrial projects remains time-consuming and expensive and restrictive labour laws.
Besides, obtaining permits and approvals can still be ""challenging,"" he said.
Moreover, India's stance in the ongoing negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade area will be seen widely as a litmus test of the government's stance toward trade liberalisation.
An RCEP without India would probably make South-East Asian countries an even more attractive destination for companies seeking to relocate some production out of China, Gupta said, adding that Vietnam, which is also a member of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), would be particularly well-placed.
In the medium term, we believe that India will fail to realise the potential benefits from production diversification out of China, and it will lose out to its regional peers as they continue to promote more favourable trade and investment policies, he added."
113,2019-10-24,Reliance,"SC, upholding the Centre’s demand of  ₹92,000 cr in arrears on licence and spectrum usage fees, dealt a blow to telecom service providers

The Supreme Court (SC) dealt a crushing blow to India’s telecom service providers on Thursday. It upheld the Centre’s demand of  ₹92,000 crore in arrears on licence and spectrum usage fees, which are charged as a fraction of their adjusted gross revenues (AGR) under India’s revenue-sharing regime. For 14 years, telecom operators had argued that only their intake from core telecom services should qualify as AGR, and had paid accordingly. The government, which contended that all revenue streams had to be counted, won its case.
The blow is especially severe for Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which are laden with heavy debt that was incurred for buying expensive telecom airwaves in government auctions. They have not been able to raise tariffs ever since Reliance Jio entered the market in 2016, sparking a price war. Jio, having been in this business for just three years, has much less money to cough up as arrears. Now, with 5G spectrum auctions on the anvil, it’s unclear whether its cash-strapped rivals have the resources needed to fight another round of battle. The minimum bids for 5G airwaves were to be lowered, but this may not help them much."

Microsoft is empowering small businesses in India in their Cloud journey with Reliance Jio, the company's CEO Satya Nadella has said.
Reliance Industries (RIL) in August announced partnership of its subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm with Microsoft in the technology space, including creation on cloud solutions.
As per the partnership, Jio will leverage the Microsoft Azure cloud platform to develop innovative cloud solutions focused on the needs of Indian businesses.
""Organisations today need a distributed computing fabric to meet their real world operational sovereignty and regulatory needs,"" Nadella said during the company's earnings call after posting $33.1 billion in revenue with $10.7 billion in net income (an increase of 21%) for its first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
""In India, we're bringing the power of Microsoft Cloud to millions of small businesses through our partnership with Jio, one of the largest mobile carriers in the country,"" Nadella added.
According to Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries (RIL), by working together to develop innovative and affordable cloud-enabled digital solutions built around Jio's world-class digital infrastructure and Microsoft''s Azure cloud platform, ""we will accelerate the digitization of the Indian economy and make Indian businesses globally competitive"".
Jio will set up data centres in locations across India, consisting of next-generation compute, storage and networking capabilities, and Microsoft will deploy its Azure platform in these data centres to support Jio's offerings.
The initial two data centres, which can house IT equipment consuming up to 7.5 MW of power, are being set up in the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra. These are targeted to be fully operational in 2020.
""Every Fortune 500 customer today is on a cloud migration journey, and we are making it faster and easier,"" said Nadella.
Due to the solutions developed by Jio through the Microsoft Azure platform, Indian start-ups will have access to efficient and affordable cloud infrastructure and platform services, enabling them to develop innovative products and services faster and more cost-effectively.
Small and medium businesses in India also will have access to a range of cloud-based productivity, collaboration and business applications including Office 365, enabling them to compete more effectively in the Indian marketplace, the company said.
The Microsoft CEO said the company is re-imagining customers' data estates with the cloud era with new limitless capabilities.

115,2019-10-24,Reliance,"At Jio’s launch, the Street was assigning very little value to RIL’s telecom as well as retail businessesRIL’s consumer businesses contribute over 50% of the EV estimates of most brokers now

Three years ago, when Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL’s) telecom unit, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, launched commercial operations, investors were uncertain, even sceptical, about how the business will shape up. Back then, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities had assigned zero equity value to the telecom piece in their sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation.
RIL’s other consumer play, Reliance Retail Ltd, contributed merely 3.7% to Kotak’s SOTP back then as well, and along with the debt in Jio's books, the two consumer businesses accounted for about 25% of total enterprise value estimate of the broker.
Now, both consumer businesses put together account for nearly 55% of the brokerage firm’s enterprise value (EV) estimate for RIL. EV is a measure of valuing companies by adding their market capitalization and net debt.
For some brokers, the two businesses accounted for merely 10% of EV.
Clearly, the past three years have been a remarkable zero to hero journey for Reliance Jio and Reliance Retail.
RIL’s consumer businesses now contribute more than half of the EV estimates for most brokerage firms.
“This just shows that RIL’s transition to a customer service conglomerate is in full bloom,"" said Probal Sen, senior vice president (research) at Centrum Broking Pvt. Ltd. “Additionally, the trend is a reflection of the higher multiples that the consumer businesses enjoy. In any case, outlook for RIL’s downstream energy businesses remains muted from a medium-term perspective as margins remain subdued.""
While telecom and retail businesses account for 50-60% of valuation estimates, they still comprise a lower 33% share of the company’s operating profit. But it’s also worth noting here that growth in the consumer businesses hasn’t disappointed, firing each quarter to boost overall profit.
Just a year ago, RIL’s consumer businesses accounted for a much lower 23% consolidated Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization).
What’s more, Goldman Sachs Services Pvt. Ltd expects strong growth at RIL’s consumer businesses to continue, with the three-year Ebitda compound annual growth rate of 40-35% for telecom and retail. “We expect consumer businesses to account for 40% of RIL Ebitda in financial year 2022 (estimates),"" said Goldman Sachs in a report on 21 October.
Even as the implementation of the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) new regulations from 2020 are expected to support stronger refining margin environment, analysts aren’t particularly gung-ho. “While IMO should benefit refining. Overall, given the weak global macro, large new refining addition, and continued pressure on heavy crude supply, beyond the next two quarters, refining could weaken,"" wrote JPMorgan’s analysts in a report on 21 October.
Simply put, it would hardly be surprising if RIL’s investors continued to assign more value to the consumer businesses, going ahead."

MUMBAI :
The Board of Directors of Reliance Industries (RIL) today approved the formation of a wholly-owned subsidiary for digital initiatives with the investment of  ₹1,08,000 crore in the subsidiary through optionally convertible preference shares, the company said in a press statement.
The subsidiary will acquire RIL’s equity investment of  ₹65,000 crore in its telecom subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
Consequent to the above, RJIL will become virtually net debt-free company by 31st March 2020, with exception of spectrum-related liabilities, RIL said.
""With the completion of the majority of RJIL’s capital expenditure, for optimizing operational efficiencies and better monetization of the Core Digital Connectivity Platform, tower and fiber passive infrastructure assets of approximately Rs. 1,25,000 crore were demerged from RJIL in March 2019 to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs). Post this demerger, RJIL has become asset-light having a balance sheet size of Rs. 2,37,000 crore,"" RIL said.
RIL said that like global technology peers, the subsidiary with negligible leverage makes a compelling investment proposition for both strategic and financial investors, many of whom have evinced strong interest in partnering with us.
Mukesh Ambani, chairman, RIL said,"" “This new Company will be a truly transformational and disruptive digital services platform. Given the reach and scale of our digital ecosystem, we have received strong interest from potential strategic partners. We will induct the right partners in our Platform Company, creating and unlocking meaningful value for RIL shareholders.""
The proposed consolidated structure will be compliant with all statutory requirements, RIL said."
112,2019-10-25,Reliance,"Ironically, the govt stands to lose more by winning in the Supreme Court against the telcosMost of the licence fee dues are from companies that are already bankrupt or facing bankruptcy

Regardless of who has been at the helm of affairs, the Indian government has been known to treat the telecom industry as the goose that lays golden eggs. For years, the industry met the expectations by buying spectrum at absurd prices, enriching the government in the process.
It’s another matter the goose has progressively grown weaker, and golden eggs have been a thing of the past. There seems to be a glimmer of hope, with the Supreme Court (SC) ruling that telcos need to pay the government licence fee dues, along with penalties and interest, amounting to more than  ₹92,500 crore, according to numbers collated by the industry.
Ironically, this was a case the government was better off losing. It should now be the first to protest the court ruling.
Here’s why. More than 40% of the dues to the government, affirmed by the apex court ruling, need to come from firms such as Aircel Ltd and Reliance Communications Ltd, which have either filed for bankruptcy or shut shop.
The bulk of the remainder needs to come from Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd, which together owe about  ₹50,000 crore, in a 4:3 proportion. Following the SC ruling, shares of Vodafone Idea fell by 23% to  ₹4.35 apiece on Thursday. After all, its cash balance at the end of the June quarter stood at  ₹21,200 crore, far lower than what is needed to meet the latest government demand.
Traders expect telecom to be a two-player market soon, with Vodafone Idea crushed under the weight of the SC order. Therefore, even though Bharti Airtel needs to shell out a huge amount as dues and penalties, its shares rose 3.3% on Thursday in early celebration of the prospects of a duopoly. Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), parent of market leader Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, rose 3.2% as well.
The big irony about the government winning in the apex court is that it stands to lose far more than what it would gain. Vodafone Idea owes the government roughly  ₹90,000 crore in deferred spectrum payment dues. “If the court order is enforced, the government is likely to get neither the licence fee dues from Vodafone Idea nor the deferred spectrum dues,"" said an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm, requesting anonymity. Talk of pyrrhic victories.
Of course, the moot question would be why the government has fought it thus far, if it stands to lose more, with yet another telco facing bankruptcy.
Perhaps it believes the future will be better with a duopoly, rather than with a struggling three-player market. Besides, it might be thinking that some of the licence fee dues may be used to revive Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd, and the two state-owned firms may stop being a burden on the exchequer.
Whatever the thought process, the fact remains that the government’s actions increasingly resemble the part in the fable where the goose is killed to get all the golden eggs at once."

Mumbai: A potential stake dilution in Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd ( RJIL) via an IPO or to a strategic investor is among the primary reasons behind the creation of wholly-owned digital subsidiary announced by Reliance Industries on Friday. With the new structure in place, the newly created entity will house all of the group's digital initiatives and will receive an investment of  ₹ ₹1,08,000 crore from its parent. The subsidiary will acquire RIL’s equity investment of  ₹65,000 crore in its telecom subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. Consequent to the above, RJIL will become virtually net debt-free company by 31st March 2020, with the exception of spectrum-related liabilities, RIL said.
As part of this transaction, RIL will take  ₹1.08 trillion of liabilities off RJIL (Jio) balance sheet into its own to ensure that the new digital business holding company has negligible debt on the books. The objective of this move is to make Reliance Jio (RJio) debt-free that will pave the way for attracting strategic investors and financial investors in the digital business to monetize the substantial investments of over $25 billion made by RIL in this business.
The new 100% subsidiary will hold all the digital business assets including Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd which holds the Jio connectivity business - Mobile, broadband and enterprise and also the other digital assets (JIO Apps, Tech backbone and Investments in other tech entities like Haptic, Hathaway and Den Networks among others.
Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio set off a brutal price war among telcos when it launched services in September 2016, triggering a wave of consolidation in one of the world’s most crowded telecom markets. The consolidation of the industry into about three large operators and an increase in Reliance Jio’s market share will set the stage for the listing of the company.
In July, Reliance Industries inked a deal with Canada's Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. and its affiliates raise  ₹25,215 crore ($3.66 billion) via sale of its telecom tower assets. The multi-stage transaction became the single-biggest private-equity deal ever in India.Currently, RIL is engaged with potential investor to divest a significant stake in its fibre assets and an announcement in this regard is expected in the coming months."

106,2019-10-28,Reliance,"With the new holding firm, Ambani is also readying the businesses for an IPOThe board of Reliance Industries approved a proposal to plow  ₹1.08 trillion  into the fully owned subsidiary

Mumbai: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani moved a step closer to creating an e-commerce giant for India, unveiling plans to set up a $24 billion digital-services holding company that would become the main vehicle in his ambition to dominate the country’s internet shopping space.
The board of Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. approved a proposal to plow  ₹1.08 trillion ($15 billion) into the fully owned subsidiary, which will in turn invest that amount in Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., the conglomerate’s telecommunications venture. A series of capital transfers would make Jio, which already has capital of  ₹65,000 crore, almost debt free by March 2020, the parent said October 25.
The move by Asia’s richest man is the latest sign of the oil-to-petrochemicals group’s pivot toward data and digital services for future growth, as it builds an online platform to take on the likes of Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.‘s Flipkart Online Services Pvt. in India. Ambani, 62, told shareholders in August that the new businesses, including retail, are likely to contribute half of Reliance’s earnings in a few years, versus about 32% now.
With the new holding firm, Ambani is also readying the businesses for an initial public offering, which he has vowed to complete within five years. Since Jio’s 4G network rolled out in 2016, the carrier has vaulted to the top in India with more than 350 million users. Ambani has also been stitching together a network of partners through acquisitions and stake purchases to build a backbone for his e-commerce plans.
“Given the reach and scale of our digital ecosystem, we have received strong interest from potential strategic partners,"" Ambani said in a statement. “We will induct the right partners in our platform company, creating and unlocking meaningful value for RIL shareholders.""
Reliance Industries will invest the money in the holding company -- likely on the lines of Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. and Alphabet Inc. -- through optionally convertible preference shares. The unit will acquire the parent’s equity investment of  ₹65,000 crore in Jio, according to Reliance Industries.
Following the equity infusion, Reliance Jio will transfer liabilities worth  ₹1.08 trillion to a subsidiary of the parent, turning Jio almost debt free, excluding airwave-related liabilities.
Streamlining Structure
“The reorganization of Jio’s capital structure is intended at consolidating all digital assets under one entity, reducing debt at this entity and streamlining the structure to make it attractive for eventual monetization,"" Citigroup said in a research report.
While former English teacher Jack Ma started Alibaba in 1999 from scratch, Ambani is using the heft of his empire to build something similar for India by connecting retailers and consumers. Alibaba, whose market value is $454 billion, reported a profit of $13 billion in the year to March, on a revenue of $56 billion. The Chinese giant’s expansion has included mom-and-pop shops -- a key segment Ambani is also seeking to tap.
Shares of Reliance Industries have rallied 28% this year, compared with an 8.8% gain in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex index. The stock, near an all-time high, will resume trading Tuesday when India returns from a holiday.
Ambani said in August that Reliance Industries has spent almost $50 billion on Jio, whose entry with free calls and cheap data pushed some rivals to exit or merge in a consolidation that shook up the industry.
Jio’s debt stood at about  ₹84,000 crore as on September 30, Chief Financial Officer V. Srikanth said earlier this month. It had a stand-alone profit of  ₹990 crore for the quarter through September on revenue of  ₹12,354 crore.
The tycoon, whose net worth is about $56 billion as per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has also revealed a plan to sell 20% of Reliance’s oil and chemicals business to Saudi Arabian Oil Co. at an enterprise value of $75 billion. After years of spending billions of dollars on the new businesses, Ambani is cleaning up the parent’s balance sheet, with the goal of making it free of net debt in less than two years.

104,2019-10-29,Reliance,"Vodafone Idea, whose cash levels are depleting, is expected to curb investments, affecting Bharti Infratel’s growthBharti Infratel stock slipped over 7% on Tuesday to  ₹197.35

Shares of Bharti Infratel Ltd slumped 9% on Tuesday, taking the cumulative losses since the Supreme Court (SC) verdict on licence fees to 25%.
Last week, the apex court ruled that telecom operators need to pay the government licence fee dues, along with penalties, totalling  ₹92,000 crore.
Traders and investors fear the new payouts may worsen the already precarious financial condition of Vodafone Idea Ltd, pushing it to bankruptcy. The ruling pegs the collective liability of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea, the major tenants of Bharti Infratel, at  ₹50,000 crore.
Click to expand image
The exact liabilities are not clear yet. Even so, the prospect of large payouts are making stakeholders worried. Bharti Airtel delayed its September quarter results to determine the exact liability.
Analysts at two domestic broking firms fear that the payouts may weigh on the already slow progress of capital investments at telcos. Vodafone Idea, whose cash levels are depleting, is expected to curtail investments, impacting Bharti Infratel’s growth, warns one analyst.
The latest financial results and technological innovations corroborate the view. Though tenancies stabilized last quarter, the company is not seeing a pick-up in tenancy additions. In fact, net tenancy additions dropped from 523 in June to 159 last quarter. “Tower addition was at its highest level in the past 15 months, but tenancy additions were muted as exits continue,"" Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
As a consequence, financial performance remains lacklustre. Sequential revenues were down 2% last quarter. Operating profit was down 3.5% from the June quarter.
Meanwhile, telcos, faced with earnings pressure, are giving preference to network enhancement through multiple input multiple output (mimo) and small cell techniques, rather than linear expansion, analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd said. This, combined with the fact that the network coverage of the new entrant, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, has already reached optimal levels, means that the scope of fresh investments may remain low for the near term.
“With Bharti Airtel the only telco operator that is likely to provide any further tenancies, the likelihood of growth in tenancies for Bharti Infratel is muted, in our view,"" SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a results review note last week.
“We are factoring in further tenancy declines as we expect Vodafone-Idea to remain in cost-conscious mode over the next 2-3 quarters at the least,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities added."
103,2019-10-29,Reliance,"Jio’s net debt to equity ratio of about 2.6 times at the end of the Sep quarter will fall to 0.3But the company’s total capital employed remains high at about  ₹2.4 trillion

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) said it will take over debt worth  ₹1.08 trillion from its telecom subsidiary, in exchange for an equity investment of the same amount. The investment in Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd will come through the newly created subsidiary of the parent company, which will reportedly be called Jio Platforms Ltd.
For Reliance Jio, what this means is that its net debt-to-equity ratio of about 2.6 times at the end of the September quarter will be down to 0.3.
Click to expand image
But while debt may be on its way down, it doesn’t change the fact that Jio remains a capital-intensive business, and question marks about earning a decent return on capital remain.
Jio’s total capital employed stood at as much as  ₹2.37 trillion at the end of the September quarter. This is after transferring assets and liabilities worth  ₹1.25 trillion as part of the demerger of the tower and fibre infrastructure units.
Last year, when the company’s balance sheet size stood at  ₹2.5 trillion, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities had said in a note to clients that generating a reasonable rate of return would require a huge leap in profits.
“Generating reasonable returns (say a 10% post-tax return on capital employed) off a balance sheet Jio’s size (current levels) needs the company to generate an Ebitda (we compute it to be $8 billion) that is higher than the peak historical annual Ebitda ever generated by the aggregate Indian telecom industry, including the home broadband and enterprise data players, per our math,"" they added.
Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
In the past 12 months, Jio’s Ebitda stood at $2.2 billion; this was after capitalizing some expenses related to the broadband business, and using a depreciation policy that results in higher reported profit vis-à-vis peers. Clearly, Jio’s profits would need to grow by leaps and bounds to generate decent returns on its massive balance sheet.
For now, though, the debt reduction will help attract investors, something that can help RIL monetize its investment in Jio.
RIL is clearly aiming big. The creation of the new subsidiary, Jio Platforms, is to position it as a digital platform along the lines of China’s Tencent, rather than sell a stake in Jio, which is seen as a mere connectivity business.
But, as has been pointed out in these pages, the big difference between Jio and a company such as Tencent is that the latter isn’t a telecom company, and its services can be used across different networks.
The way things are going on in India’s telecom sector, who knows, Jio may be the only network standing. For investors who were anticipating such a scenario, of course, there is no need to worry about return ratios in the interim."
102,2019-10-29,Reliance,"The Reliance Industries' chairman was speaking at Saudi Arabia's annual investment forum, also known as 'Davos in the desert'The government has taken a string of policy measures over the past couple of months to shore up the economy and revive credit

Riyadh: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani on Tuesday said the slowdown in the Indian economy is temporary and the recent measures taken by the government will help reverse the trend in the coming quarters.
Speaking at Saudi Arabia's annual investment forum, also known as 'Davos in the desert', he said the reforms undertaken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government since August will bear fruits in the next few quarters.
""Yes, there has been a slight slowdown (in the Indian economy). But my own view is that it is temporary,"" he said at the Future Investment Initiative (FII) conference here.
""All the reform measures that have been taken in the last few months will see the outcome and I am quite sure that in coming quarters this will reverse,"" he said.
Indian economy, which till recently was hailed as the fastest-growing major economy, has seen growth rate decline in each of the past five quarters, falling to 5 per cent in April-June 2019 from 8 per cent recorded a year earlier. This is the lowest growth outturn since 2013 and has largely been attributed to the slowdown in investment that has now broadened into consumption, driven by financial stress among rural households and weak job creation.
The government has taken a string of policy measures over the past couple of months to shore up the economy and revive credit.
The measures include attempts to ease NBFCs' liquidity positions by encouraging banks to purchase high-quality NBFC assets through credit guarantees and additional liquidity. Also, further capital is being injected into banks and the corporate tax rate was cut to their lowest level.
These measures should gradually improve the flows of credit and nudge up growth, analysts have said.
Ambani, who is in talks with Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco to sell one-fifth of his oil-to-chemical business in India for $15 billion, said the two countries have almost factors to drive growth - technology, young demography, and leadership.
""Above all, there is a leadership accelerator. Both the countries are blessed with leadership that is unique in the whole world, at least in today's time,"" he said referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud and his son Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz.
Saudi Arabia, he said, has seen tremendous transformation in the last 2-3 years. ""For me, this is 1980 vintage China or India of the 1990s where India really took on the world map.""
Ambani, the Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries Ltd, was speaking at the forum on the topic 'The next decade: How will a new era of economic ambition shape the global economy?'
Modi is a keynote speaker at this year's FII, the third annual conference.
Ambani had in August announced that Saudi Aramco has agreed to take a 20 per cent stake in Reliance Industries' refining and petrochemicals business, as the world's largest crude oil exporter deepens its ties with India, the fastest-growing energy consumer.
The deal, which values the business at $75 billion including debt, is supposed to close the first half of 2020 and would be one of the largest foreign investments in India. As part of the deal, Aramco will provide Reliance's refinery business with about 500,000 barrels of oil a day, double the size Ambani firm currently buys from the OPEC kingpin.
Last month, the government announced a reduction in the base corporation tax rate to 22 per cent from 30 per cent as part of stimulus measures to revive slowing economic growth. The tax cuts rates were aimed at bringing India closer to peers throughout Asia and support the business environment and competitiveness.

101,2019-10-29,Reliance,"PM Modi said that India imports around 18% of its crude oil from the Saudi Arabia, making it the second-largest source of crude oil for IndiaDuring PM Modi’s visit, several business partnership deals between the nations are being explored

NEW DELHI :
India and Saudi Arabia are graduating from a purely oil buyer-seller relationship to one of closer strategic partnership with the West Asian nation investing in downstream oil and gas projects in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said in an interview given to Arab News newspaper published on Tuesday.
The Prime Minister said that India imports around 18% of its crude oil from the Saudi Arabia, making it the second-largest source of crude oil for India. India imports about 80% of its crude oil requirement and has been making diplomatic efforts to secure more sources of energy at stable prices, while promoting electric mobility at home. Greater economic interlinkage between India and its key supplier of oil is expected to benefit business partners in both the countries. For Saudi Arabia, investments into India’s downstream oil and gas industry will enable it to diversify its energy assets.
Saudi Arabia’s national oil company Saudi Aramco along with United Arab Emirates’ national oil company ADNOC has inked a deal with state-run companies in India for a 50% stake in a planned 1.2 million barrels per day refinery in India’s west coast. In August, Reliance Industries had announced that it has agreed with Saudi Aramco to a non-binding Letter of Intent for an investment in RIL’s oil to chemicals division comprising the refining, petrochemicals and fuels marketing business. Saudi Aramco’s potential 20% stake was based upon an enterprise value of $ 75 billion for the said business division, RIL had said.
“From a purely buyer-seller relationship, we are now moving toward a closer strategic partnership that will include Saudi investments in downstream oil and gas projects… Saudi Aramco is participating in a major refinery and petrochemical project on India’s west coast. We are also looking forward to the participation of Aramco in India’s Strategic Petroleum Reserves,"" Arab News said quoting Modi in the interview.
During Modi’s visit, several business partnership deals between the nations are being explored. India wants investments in its downstream energy assets as well as in upstream oil and gas exploration, in addition to other large infrastructure projects as New Delhi is trying to boost economic growth rate and add more jobs.
Modi said in the interview that one of the major areas of cooperation between India and Saudi Arabia is in investments in India’s infrastructure projects. Saudi Arabia had earlier expressed intent to invest about $100 billion in India in sectors including petrochemicals, infrastructure and mining. “We welcome greater Saudi investments in our infrastructure projects, including in the smart cities program. We also welcome Saudi interest in investing in the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund,"" Arab News said quoting Modi."

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, one of the three core members of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), objected to the lobby group seeking relief for the telecom sector and claimed that the group’s plea to the government does not represent the view of the industry.
COAI’s petition came after the Supreme Court ordered legacy telecom companies to pay up  ₹92,000 crore in dues, rejecting Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd’s plea that the government’s revenue share be calculated excluding income from non-core operations such as rent, dividend and interest income.
In a letter to the industry body, Jio alleged that COAI has acted as “a mouthpiece of two service providers"", without naming Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea.
“COAI’s intent of using this as an opportunity to seek non-enforcement of the Supreme Court judgement and asking for relief is strongly objected by Jio,"" the company said in a 30 October letter, reviewed by Mint. “Jio will like to point out to COAI that the judgement of Supreme Court is final and to be implemented as law of the land. These operators have capacity and enough monetization possibilities to comfortably pay government dues.""
Last week, the top court upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue, on which it calculates levies on telecom operators, dealing a blow to telecom operators that are already burdened with losses and mounting debt.
The order marked the end of a 14-year legal tussle between the department of telecommunications and operators. Telcos will now have to pay the government  ₹92,000 crore in spectrum and licence fee dues, plus interest that has accrued over these years. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, the only non-state firms that have survived a brutal consolidation in the sector over the past three years and posted a loss in the June quarter, have been the worst-hit by the order.
“In this letter (to the government), COAI has again attempted to rake up the issue of merits of AGR case like notional revenue, which has already been settled by the Supreme Court judgement,"" Jio said, adding that “seeking relief on the very same grounds amounts to seeking relief for these operators for their wilful decision of continuing non-compliance by withholding legitimate government dues"".
COAI director general Rajan Mathews said the issue is a private matter between the members of the group. “We respect the inputs, feedback and opinions of all our members even though we may disagree with some of them. We stand by our letter on behalf of the majority of our members and it stands on its own merits and needs no further explanation,"" he said"

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel reported a fall in its average revenue per user (ARPU) in the September quarter, with growth in its subscriber base outpacing revenue growth from mobile services in India.
Airtel recorded an ARPU of  ₹128 in the September quarter, down from  ₹129 in the June quarter. ARPU is the total revenue of an operator divided by the number of users, or connections, on its network.
Airtel’s revenue from mobile services in India was  ₹10,811 crore in the three months ended 30 September, up from  ₹10,724 crore in the June quarter. Its subscriber base grew from 276.81 million in the preceding quarter to 279.43 million in the September quarter.
Reliance Jio also recorded a drop in ARPU in the September quarter. Its ARPU fell to  ₹120 with 355.2 million users as of September end, from  ₹122 with 331.3 million users as of June end. Vodafone Idea has not announced operational highlights or financial statements for the quarter.
Bharti Airtel on Tuesday also said that it has postponed the announcement of its financial results for the September quarter from 29 October to 14 November, as the company awaits clarity on the recent Supreme Court verdict. It will also approach the department of telecommunications (DoT) for clarity on the total amount due. The company, thus, restricted itself to sharing the operational highlights for the quarter.
Last week, the top court upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue, on which it calculates levies on telecom operators, dealing a  ₹92,000 crore blow to the telecom industry, which is already burdened with falling tariffs and mounting debt.
The apex court rejected the definition of the adjusted gross revenue proposed by telecom operators and excluded revenue from non-core telecom operations, such as rent, dividend and interest income. The order marked the end of a 14-year legal tussle between the DoT and operators.
Telcos will now have to pay the government  ₹92,000 crore in spectrum and licence fee dues, plus interest that has accrued over these years. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, the companies that survived the brutal consolidation witnessed in the sector over the past three years, and posted a loss in the June quarter, have been the worst hit by the order.
Bharti Airtel also saw an increase in data consumption on its network in the three months ended September. Data usage per customer rose from 11.9 GB in the June quarter to 13.1 GB in the September quarter."

MUMBAI :
Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has surpassed its strategic partner British oil major BP Plc in terms of market capitalization. The rise in market value of the Indian company was, however, driven by its retail and telecom businesses.
RIL hit a market cap of $132.24 billion on Wednesday compared with BP’s $130.51 billion. At closing, shares of RIL traded at  ₹1,478.70 on BSE, up 0.8% from its previous close. So far this year, it has gained 31.9%. The story has used a dollar-rupee conversion rate of  ₹70.89 per dollar.
At 10.30 am (GMT), BP was trading $6.42 in London trade, up 1.3% from its previous close. On Tuesday, shares of BP, closed at $6.33, down 3.8%, the most in four weeks, after dashing investor hopes of a higher dividend this year. Year to date, the BP stock has risen 0.4%.
RIL’s refining and marketing segment contributes 51.15% of the company’s revenue, while its petrochemicals unit bring in 22.34%. Organised retail’s share in the revenue pie is at 17%, while that of the digital business is 6%, and exploration and production at 0.65% as on 31 March.
BP reported adjusted net income of $2.25 billion for the September quarter, exceeding the average analyst estimate of $1.77 billion. This compares with a profit of $3.84 billion a year earlier, when BP decided to buy a $10.5 billion package of US shale assets in cash, rather than in shares, because it was confident of oil prices staying high.
Globally, in the listed universe, Exxon Mobil Corp. is the biggest oil and gas firm, with a market cap of $289.58 billion, followed by Royal Dutch Shell Plc. at $238.74 billion, Chevron Corp. at $224.26 billion, Petrochina Co. Ltd with $149.19 billion in market cap, and Total SA at $141.34 billion.
However, the world’s largest energy entity is Saudi Aramco, which pumps out about 10% of the world’s crude, and had emerged as the most profitable company in 2018. Saudi Aramco beat Exxon Mobil Corp. in terms of earnings. The energy giant plans to launch its initial public offering in November.
BP is RIL’s partner in its exploration and production ventures in India. Both companies also operate an equal joint venture, India Gas Solutions, and are forming a joint venture to set up fuel retail outlets in India, wherein RIL will have a 51% stake, while 49% will be held by BP. The joint venture will also look into innovative models such as mobile fuelling units and home delivery, in addition to providing electric charging facilities in some of their outlets.
On the exploration and production front, both companies are investing $5 billion in the KG deep-sea project, which is set to begin production from May 2020.
RIL, which has embarked on a deleveraging exercise after being on a spending spree over the last five years, is in the process of creating three verticals—oil-to-chemicals with Saudi Aramco as the proposed strategic partner, a digital/technology platform with a wholly-owned subsidiary (announced last week), and a retail business, which will trigger value creation.
“RIL is in the process of inducting strategic partners into each business vertical, potentially triggering value recognition. During a spin-off of different verticals in 2005–06, RIL had triggered a value appreciation in excess of 35%,"" said Edelweiss Securities Ltd in its report dated 29 October.

Indian equities are expected to extend rally on Thursday. On Wednesday the benchmark Sensex reclaimed the 40,000-mark for the first time since 5 July. The 30-share BSE Sensex is just 260 points shy of its record 40,312.07 touched on 4 June while the Nifty is only 258.95 points away from its all-time high of 12103.05 hit on 3 June.
Asian shares rose on Thursday and US stock futures edged higher after the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates as expected to keep economic expansion on track. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.2%. Japan's Nikkei stock index rose 0.41%, but Australian shares fell 0.24%.
US Treasury yields extended declines in Asia after the rate cut, but further declines may be limited as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signalled additional rate cuts are unlikely because there are several areas of strength in the US economy.
The yen held steady versus the dollar before a Bank of Japan policy meeting later on Thursday. The BOJ is expected to keep its ultra-easy monetary policy in place, but the decision could be a close call. Debate at the Fed and the BOJ highlights the struggle that many central banks are facing.
The US China trade war and Britain's divorce from the European Union have increased uncertainty, but central banks are somewhat reluctant to ease policy aggressively because interest rates are already very low in many major economies.
The Fed lowered its policy rate to 1.50%-1.75%, but dropped a previous reference in its statement to ""act as appropriate"" to sustain the economic expansion. In his news conference, Powell listed several reasons why he feels the economy is doing well, such as robust consumer spending, strengthening home sales, and healthy asset prices.
Back home, telecom stocks are likely to be in focus again. According to a Mint report, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, one of the three core members of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), objected to the lobby group seeking relief for the telecom sector and claimed that the group’s plea to the government does not represent the view of the industry.
COAI’s petition came after the Supreme Court ordered legacy telecom companies to pay up  ₹92,000 crore in dues, rejecting Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd’s plea that the government’s revenue share be calculated excluding income from non-core operations such as rent, dividend and interest income.
State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar on Wednesday pitched for a higher valuation of the bank’s enterprise value, asking analysts to take into account the growth prospects of its subsidiaries, as well as forecasts of a better-than-expected performance in 2020-21. Kumar said the bank’s performance is set to improve from FY21, following an improvement in asset quality and better growth.
Meanwhile, the yield on benchmark 10-year US Treasury notes fell to 1.7838% in Asia on Thursday, while the two-year yield eased slightly to 1.6076%. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies fell 0.22% to 97.427, extending declines from Wednesday.
The yen was little changed at 108.80 per dollar as traders awaited the outcome of the BOJ meeting.
Japan's central bank may trim its consumer price forecasts but leave policy unchanged due to hopes that progress in scaling back a U.S.-China trade dispute will give it room to save its dwindling policy tools.
Optimism that Washington and Beijing will sign a preliminary agreement to call a truce to their 16-month trade war was also a factor behind the Fed's decision to signal that further rate cuts are on hold, highlighting the importance of trade talks to global monetary policy.
In the energy market, oil futures extended declines on Thursday as a massive buildup in US crude stock piles reinforced concerns about oversupply in the world's energy markets.
US crude fell 0.29% to $54.90 per barrel.

95,2019-10-31,Reliance,"Reliance Jio alleges that incumbent operators have enough funds to pay dues to the governmentGovernment should not be obliged to bail out telecom operators for their own commercial failure and financial mismanagement, says Jio

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd on Thursday urged telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad not to grant any relief sought by rival telecom operators, a day after it said the telecom lobby’s call for relief does not reflect the industry view.
Without specifically naming Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd, Jio alleged that the operators have enough funds to pay their dues to the government, after a court order went against them.
“We request the government to reject the COAI demand for a financial relief on the Supreme Court judgement and their other outstanding liabilities including the spectrum payments etc and all operators should be mandated to deposit applicable amounts within the three-month time period, as mandated by the Supreme Court,"" Jio said in a 31 October letter to Prasad. Mint has seen a copy of the letter.
The government should not be obliged to bail out telecom operators for their own commercial failure and financial mismanagement, said Jio, which has clashed with other members of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) over relief for the sector.
“It will not be out of context to mention that any such package which prima facie appears to mitigate perceived financial strains, if granted, is likely to raise similar demands from other sectors such as aviation,"" Jio added.
Jio had written to COAI on Wednesday alleging the industry body was acting as “a mouthpiece of two service providers"".
Jio, the only profitable telecom operator in India, said it does not agree with a single contention in the COAI’s letter, which it said was submitted under the influence of two of its members in pursuance of their vested interests.
The other two members of COAI are Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea.
Last week, the Supreme Court upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue on which it calculates levies on telecom operators, dealing a blow to telecom operators that are already burdened with losses and mounting debt.
Telcos will now have to pay the government  ₹92,000 crore in spectrum and licence fee dues, plus interest that has accrued over these years. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have been the worst-hit by the order.

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio Infocom on Thursday wrote to top government functionaries, stating that telecom operators, Airtel and Vodafone Idea, have sufficient financial capacity to pay the dues to the government by monetising assets and issuing fresh equity.
In response to the missive by the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) seeking urgent relief for these service providers, Reliance Jio wrote a letter to Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, a copy of which was marked to the Prime Minister's Principal Secretary, P.K. Mishra, Prime Minister's Principal Advisor, P.K. Sinha, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash, Economic Affairs Secretary Atanu Chakraborty, Law Secretary Anoop Kumar Mendiratta, and Member, Finance, Department of Telecom, P.K. Sinha.
In the letter, Reliance Jio wrote: ""We submit the so-called affected service providers have sufficient financial capacity to pay the government dues by monetising their existing assets/investments and by issuing fresh equity in their companies."" Although it did not name Airtel and Vodafone Idea, it is implicit that the reference is to these private operators.
""These service providers have stakes in many profitable ventures in the country and abroad and have made multi-million dollars of profits in the countries post investing the proceeds from the telecom business including the regulatory levies withheld for decades,"" Reliance Jio said.
Making the argument about financial ability to pay, it said that the telecom assets of these service providers have been further divested in their profitable telecom tower ventures like Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel.
""Moreover, these operators have 'Principals' with sound financial positions and they must step in to clear the dues which were withheld by them and utilised elsewhere. Thus there is no constraint of making funds available to pay-off their legal obligations, the issue seems to be only with the intent, which is being manifested by COAI through its letter,"" the letter reads.
It pointed out the service providers are also in violation of the Indian accounting standards and have wilfully violated all disclosure norms continuously since 2011 by not provisioning for these liabilities. Reliance Jio has asked the government to take cognisance of such blatant violations and take appropriate action.
Despite the COAI's and these two operators' continued highlighting of the so-called financial stress, Reliance Jio said these service providers have chosen to continue with their below cost tariffs, especially when there is no competitive pressure compelling these tariffs.
""We submit that COAI's intent of using this is an opportunity to seek non-enforcement of the Supreme Court judgement and asking for relief is strongly objected by RJIL. The Judgement of Hon. Supreme Court is final and to be implemented as law of land. These operators have capacity and enough monetization possibilities to comfortably pay government dues,"" Reliance Jio said in the communication to the Telecom Minister."

NEW DELHI :
UK-based Vodafone Group on Thursday quashed rumours of it exiting its India operations, and said that it was supportive of the local management and was also actively engaging with the Indian government.
“Vodafone is aware of the unfounded and baseless rumours circulating in some of the Indian media that we have decided to exit the market. We would like to categorically state that this is not true and is malicious,"" Vodafone Group said in a statement, which comes a day after news agency IANS reported that the telecom major was planning to exit India given its mounting losses.
“Vodafone is actively engaging with the government and we are fully supportive of our local management as they continue to manage our joint venture in these challenging times,"" it added.
Vodafone Idea, the merged entity of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, which is India’s largest operator by subscriber base, said it was not in a position to comment on media reports, as it was not aware of anything regarding Vodafone Group’s exit from India.
In a clarification to BSE on Thursday, Vodafone Idea said: “As regards exit of India operations by Vodafone Group is concerned, we wish to inform you that the company is not aware about anything on the subject as it pertains to Vodafone Group and, hence, cannot comment on the same.""
In March 2017, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular had announced their merger following Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s entry in 2016.
Vodafone Idea has completed the network integration process in 11 out of 22 circles, and expects to complete the process by June 2020. The combined entity has been facing tough times, with shrinking revenue and a gross debt of  ₹1.2 trillion as on 30 June.
Since the merger, the company has lost subscribers every month. Its active subscriber base declined from 334.1 million in the March quarter to 320 million in the June quarter. It had posted a loss of  ₹4,873.9 crore in the June quarter, despite witnessing higher data consumption on its network and signing up more 4G subscribers."

Mumbai: At a time when consumption demand in India has been hit hard, renewed focus on small towns such as Sikar in Rajasthan and Gulbarga in Karnataka is helping billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd clock higher revenues in its retail businesses.
Not only that, the company’s retail arm has been planning a new commerce venture, an offline-to-online initiative to take on rivals like Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, which would link producers, traders, small merchants, brands and consumers through technology. It has been working on its new commerce plan for nearly two years. Currently, it operates neighborhood stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets, wholesale, specialty, and online stores.
The current slowdown has dragged down average industry growth rates to 3-5% from 12-13% recorded over the past two years, but Reliance Retail Ltd (RRL) —India’s largest retailer — recorded its highest-ever revenue and operating profit in a quarter during July-September.
""Our business has largely been resilient to market headwinds when it comes to the softening of demand. Our grocery business continues to grow really strong along with apparel and consumer electronics,"" said Gaurav Jain, head of Strategy and Business Development at Reliance Retail.
So what is driving Reliance Retail?
Store expansion in small towns and cities and private labels which led to higher margins, said Jain. ""Stores in tier II, III and IV towns are where customers are getting a first-hand experience of getting into a modern trade shopping environment. Though these are in markets like Sikar (Rajasthan) or Gulbarga (Karnataka), the number of tickets and footfalls and some of the key metrics pretty much match that of a city like Mumbai,"" he said.
The first-mover advantage in these cities and towns has also helped RRL secure cheaper leases, lowering its costs. ""One of the challenges for us is to get hold of a good location. If we find difficulty in one market in one particular format, then we are able to spread the risk across (multiple formats) and operate and open in other markets as well. Broadly we are able to de-risk ourselves to that extent on new store openings,"" added Jain.
Reliance Retail, which runs the largest network of stores at 10,415 across 6,600 plus towns and cities, has more than two-thirds of this are in tier-II, III and IV towns, according to the company. It predominantly operates through three core divisions – grocery (18% of sales), consumer electronics (30%) and fashion and lifestyle (8%).
The company has added 337 stores across India in the second quarter. ""We are also creating newer markets. We are able to upsell and cross-sell a larger basket to the consumer which was not available earlier,"" said Jain.
Under the grocery segment, RRL operates three core formats — neighborhood store (Reliance Fresh), supermarkets (Reliance SMART) and wholesale/B2B cash and carry stores (Reliance Market). RRL also operates its grocery portal RelianceSMART.in and has recently launched a new store concept, Qwik Mart, a convenience store co-located with Reliance Fuel outlets. According to Nielsen, Reliance Fresh and Smart account for over 50% of all fruits and vegetables sold in the modern trade.
RRL's private labels through which it operates a wide range of own brands across categories led to a higher margin for the company. RRL sells own branded products under the name — Best Farms, Good Life, Masti Oye, Kaffe, Enzo, Mopz, Expelz, Home One, Graphite, RelGlow, etc.
In the fashion and lifestyle category — Reliance Trends — RRL saw 70% of its revenues coming from private label portfolio. RRL has a dedicated manufacturing base of 250+ vendors in South Asia and India and sourcing offices in China and Bangladesh to support low-cost manufacturing. “If we control products (private label) and breakdown the prices, then what we have is the product sourcing cost and the product packaging cost. Because the private label is part of the store brand, we are able to pass on the savings to consumers and price the product right. “That’s what results in a 40-50% savings for customers.""
RRL is also the leading for consumer durables and information technology organized retailers in India. The segment operats 8,067 stores across locations through its Reliance Digital Stores (Big-box Consumer Electronics store), Jio Stores/Jio Points (Smaller stores facilitating sale of Jio services, mobility and connectivity products) and ResQ service centers (full-fledged service arm)."

91,2019-11-01,Reliance,"In a market that had a dozen carriers two years ago, just three are left standing today — two of them, barelyReliance Jio’s entry shook up the industry that was already hobbling

When Arun Sarin, Vodafone Group Plc’s India-born former CEO, was charting the British telecommunications firm’s expansion into emerging markets in the mid-2000s, his home country with more than a billion potential phone users seemed a compelling choice.
Sarin wasn’t alone. Norway’s Telenor ASA, Russia’s Mobile TeleSystems PJSC and Malaysia’s Maxis Bhd were also among a slew of companies that flocked to this fast-growing market. The carriers banded with local partners, bid for airwaves and licenses, spending billions of dollars to prepare their networks.
But what once appeared to be their most-promising Asian wireless market has turned sour. Vodafone’s Indian venture with billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla, saddled with $14 billion of debt, is said to be seeking to revamp its borrowings amid mounting losses and a tariff war. Tycoon Sunil Mittal’s Bharti Airtel Ltd. is rated junk by Moody’s Investors Service. In a market that had a dozen carriers two years ago, just three are left standing today — two of them, barely.
High fees, frequent policy flip-flops, endless tax demands from an unsympathetic bureaucracy that treated carriers as cash cows have driven most of the operators aground. The industry has become the latest cautionary tale for investors in India, showing why despite moving up the global rankings for ease of business, the burgeoning $2.7 trillion economy with a massive consumer base remains a tough, unpredictable place for those who still dare.
The latest blow to the survivors came last week. The nation’s Supreme Court, ruling on a years-long dispute, ordered several carriers to pay the government an additional $13 billion in past fees. The British firm’s venture, Vodafone Idea Ltd., faces a bill of $4 billion, a burden that could sink the company.
“The government is becoming greedy and extracting the maximum from them,"" said Mohan Guruswamy, a former finance ministry official and now chairman of the Centre for Policy Alternatives in New Delhi. “The whole sector is in the doldrums. This judgment will effectively destroy Vodafone Idea, and what you’ll have is an emerging duopoly.""
When India announced its New Telecom Policy in 1999, it said the industry was of “vital importance"" with “widespread ramifications on the entire economy,"" and vowed to create an “enabling framework for the development"" of telecommunications.
Record Raking
While that worked in theory, policy makers also realized that the auction of airwaves and sale of licenses could fetch billions of dollars, a revenue source key to narrowing the government’s budget deficit. For instance, in a 2015 auction, India raised a record $18 billion, after getting almost $10 billion in the previous year. But in 2012, a plan to collect as much as 400 billion rupees ($7.3 billion at the then exchange rate) flopped as bidders balked, prompting it to cut prices later.
Spectrum costs in India are among the highest in the world, according to data compiled by Analysys Mason Spectrum Tracker. The leading telecom operators in India pay the largest share of their aggregate revenue for airwaves at 7.6%, followed by Thailand at 7.3% and Bangladesh at 7%, according to Moody’s Investors Service.
Driving Up Costs
While the government set high prices, the carriers had themselves to blame too. Competition drove the operators to outbid each other at spectrum auctions, driving up their costs.
As a result, companies took on billions of dollars in debt to stay in the game even as competition among a dozen operators for a slice of the market drove down tariffs to less than a cent, weighing on their earnings. Then came Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. in 2016, offering free calls and cheap data on its 4G network, backed by the deep pockets of billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s oil-to-petrochemicals empire.
Jio’s entry shook up the industry that was already hobbling.
In the past two years, two of India’s larger telecom operators -- Malaysian tycoon T. Ananda Krishnan’s Aircel Ltd., and Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications Ltd. -- went into bankruptcy. Vodafone’s India unit announced its merger with Birla’s Idea Cellular Ltd. in 2017 to take on Jio, but it has reported losses every quarter since.
“The Indian telecom market had three major challenges,"" said Sanjay Kapoor, former CEO of Bharti Airtel’s India and South Asia operations and now a director on the board of Saudi Telecom Co. “Intense competition, high cost structure with exorbitant spectrum prices coupled with government charges and lowest average revenue per user.""
But there were other equally daunting hurdles too. Some examples of policy flip-flops here:
A decade after its struggle in India, Newbury, England-based Vodafone Group has one foot out the door. CEO Nick Read said in September that the company isn’t keen to plow any more money into the local venture, in which Vodafone holds about 44%. Sarin didn’t immediately respond to requests for comments.
Warned Lenders
Vodafone Idea has approached creditors for better terms, including a temporary halt to payments, and has warned lenders it won’t be able to honor its comments for long under current conditions, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The company denied making such a move, but said “all telecom operators have asked for requisite help in reducing"" the financial stress.
Following the Supreme Court ruling on the extra fees, Bharti Airtel deferred its quarterly earnings announcement by two weeks to Nov. 14. Fitch Ratings said Oct. 30 that it’s placed Bharti on negative watch at BBB-, the lowest investment grade.
The court order is the “last straw,"" the Cellular Operators Association of India said last week, while Bharti and Vodafone Idea urged the government to address their concerns and mitigate their financial stress.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government said this week that it is considering some relief measures. A panel of senior bureaucrats will look into steps including deferment of airwaves payments that are due by March 2021 and 2022.
“The government on its end is in a difficult position where if it lets Vodafone Idea fail, it will lead to a duopoly, which is not the healthiest market structure for any country,"" said Rohan Dhamija, head of South Asia and Middle East at Analysys Mason. “We, hence, feel that the government might step in with subtle help for the sector.""

The finance industry is in turmoil. Tax collections have hit stall speed. India’s credit and fiscal crises are joined at the hip.
Consider the $13 billion in past fees that the government is asking from telecom operators. It’s a desperate attempt to squeeze money from an industry in which most players have already vanished or gone bankrupt. The two old firms that are still standing amid intense price competition from newcomer Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. will bear the brunt of the recently court-approved demand. 
Among them, Vodafone Idea Ltd. has a one-year default probability of 7.5%, according to a Bloomberg risk model. That puts its $14 billion debt within shouting distance of distressed. If Vodafone Idea goes to banks asking to recast its borrowings, something that the company has so far denied doing, lenders will receive a fresh blow.  
India’s banks are miserable, and not just because they’ve already piled up $200 billion in bad debt. In at least five ways, New Delhi’s tax kitty, which has grown by just 1.5% so far this fiscal year, the slowest in a decade, is exacerbating lenders’ unease:"
88,2019-11-03,Reliance,"Reliance Jio has alleged that Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have enough funds to pay their duesLast week, SC upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue on which it calculates levies on telecom operators

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has cautioned that offering any relief to rival operators after a Supreme Court judgement put a  ₹92,000 crore burden on the telecom industry would go against the judgement and set a wrong precedent for other sectors. In a 1 November letter to Union telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the telecom arm of Reliance Industries Ltd also alleged that Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd have enough funds to pay dues.
“Any reduction in the financial liability of the licensees arising from the judgement of the Court would in effect be rewarding them for their conduct in initiating frivolous and vexatious proceedings to delay payment of their just dues,"" Jio said in its letter, a copy of which was seen by Mint.
“Any proposal for waiver will be considered as loss to the public exchequer and contrary to the Supreme Court judgement,"" Jio said.
The fresh salvo from Jio, one of the three core members of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), came just a day after it wrote to the government on 31 October stating that COAI’s plea to the government seeking relief measures does not represent the view of the industry.
Last month, the top court upheld the government’s broader definition of telecom revenue, on which it calculates levies, dealing a blow to operators already burdened with losses and mounting debt. The order marked the end of a 14-year legal tussle between the department of telecommunications and telcos. Telcos will now have to pay the government  ₹92,000 crore in spectrum fees, licence fees and accumulated interest. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, the only non-state firms that have survived a brutal consolidation in the sector over the past three years and posted a loss in the June quarter, have been the worst-hit by the order.
The verdict stated that dues must be paid in three months. However, COAI has urged the government to offer operators a moratorium of two years and 10-year term for payment of dues, post waiver of interest, penalty and interest on penalty.
An email query sent to COAI was unanswered till press time.
“Such largesse, if granted, will become an iniquitous precedent emboldening and encouraging others in similar situations including other sectors and spreading across industry to commit similar breaches and get away with it,"" Jio said in its latest letter.
It has also alleged that Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have “no dearth of funds"" to pay government dues.
“While the market cap of Airtel is over  ₹2,50,000 crore, Bharti Infratel which is 100% owned by Airtel, is having market cap of  ₹37,000 crore. The market cap of Indus Towers, as and when listed, will be three times that of Bharti Infratel. Airtel is having 33% stake in Indus Towers. If Airtel liquidates small parts of its assets or issue 15-20% new equity, it can easily arrange  ₹40,000 crore to pay its obligations,"" Jio said.
“Similarly, market cap of Aditya Birla group, one of the Principals of Vodafone Idea, is around  ₹2.3 lakh crore and of Vodafone, the other Principal of Vodafone Idea is $54.88 billion. Vodafone Idea also has stake in Indus Towers,"" it said.
Jio, which is currently the only profitable operator in the sector, has also said that it does not agree with even a single contention in COAI’s letter seeking relief, which was submitted under the influence of two of its members.
“The government has set up the committee of secretaries and we expect they will independently evaluate the situation and make the right decision for the country, its citizens and the industry. This situation did not arise overnight but has been the result of multiple dynamics which COAI has been highlighting over the past several years. We expect and encourage the CoS not to be distracted by motivated rhetoric from any source but do the right thing. We fully respect the honourable SC’s ruling which deals with the past, but believe an independent arm of government can make policy decisions going forward that impact the citizens, economy and industry for the betterment of all,"" Rajan Mathews, Director General, COAI, told Mint."

87,2019-11-05,Reliance,"Raising funds for broadband, network expansion and Digital India is likely to hit a significant roadblockOperators have pinned their hopes on a govt panel set up to suggest relief measures for sector

NEW DELHI :
Two weeks after the country’s top court ordered the telecom industry to pay  ₹92,000 crore in dues to the government, operators have pinned their hopes on a government panel that was set up to suggest relief measures for the sector that is struggling with heavy debt and mounting losses.
The relief measures, experts said, will not only help the telecom industry stay viable and protect billions of dollars in investments, but also prevent the digital economy, which runs on the mobile services infrastructure, from being disrupted.
“The demand of  ₹92,000 crore will dampen the sentiment of telecom operators, and raising funds for broadband, network expansion and Digital India will hit a significant roadblock. The impact is not limited to telecom operators but will have a domino effect on the larger digital value chain. This requires immediate intervention by all stakeholders to get the sector back in shape,"" said Prashant Singhal, emerging markets, technology, media and telecom leader, EY India.
Following the court verdict, the Centre last week set up a Committee of Secretaries under the cabinet secretary to suggest measures to alleviate financial stress in the sector. The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has sought an easier payment schedule for spectrum bought in previous auctions, waiving penalty and interest arising out of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, and a 14-year period to pay the principal amount of AGR dues.
“We expect they will independently evaluate the situation and make the right decision for the country, its citizens and the industry,"" Rajan Mathews, director general, COAI, said.
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which reported losses in the June quarter, were the worst hit by the apex court order.
Bharti Airtel’s dues are roughly  ₹21,682 crore, while Vodafone Idea will need to cough up at least  ₹28,309 crore. In contrast, Jio’s dues are just  ₹13 crore. There is no other private operator left in the sector. Aircel and Reliance Communications are bankrupt and Tatas have sold their business to Airtel.
“In a cruel twist of fate, the two companies which actually survived the competitive intensity post Jio’s entry and the consolidation that followed in the three years have effectively been penalised by the verdict on AGR. No one will knock on the doors of companies that shut shop but owed money to the government,"" a senior industry executive said requesting anonymity.
A bruising price war, initiated after Reliance Jio launched services in September 2016 at rock bottom tariffs, has left Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd bleeding financially. In addition, the continuous need for large capital investments and spectrum acquisitions through auctions has resulted in ballooning debt.
If the current wave of consolidation further reduces the number of operators, India may become a monopoly or a duopoly market which will not only reduce customer choices but may potentially lead to higher prices for telecom services.
The DoT is yet to formally issue demand notices to operators.
These dues, incumbent operators believe, will be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.
“Vodafone Idea’s future depends on relief measures at this stage. If it goes to NCLT, the government will not be able to recover even the spectrum dues that the company owes for airwaves bought in the past. If that happens, the question of recovering AGR dues goes out of the window,"" the executive cited above said.
The stress on Vodafone Idea is clear from the fall in its stock price. It was  ₹30 on 31 August 2018, when it started trading as a merged entity. On Monday, the share price closed at  ₹4.51.
After the verdict, even Bharti Airtel has postponed its September quarter earnings as it awaits clarity from the government.
“We fully respect the SC’s ruling which deals with the past, but believe an independent arm of government can make policy decisions going forward that impact the citizens, economy and industry for the betterment of all,"" Mathews said.

MUMBAI :
India won’t back down from collecting $13 billion of past dues from debt-laden telecom carriers because the industry is not under stress, a government official with knowledge of the matter said, a move that could deepen Bharti Airtel Ltd. and Vodafone Idea Ltd.’s financial woes.
India expects the carriers to pay up within 90 days as ordered by the Supreme Court last month, the official said, asking not to be identified, as the discussions are private. A panel of top bureaucrats could look at deferred payment plan for some of the dues, the person said.
The government’s stand about the health of the industry mirrors comments made by billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., which has said it has a “divergent view"" from its rivals. High fees, frequent flip-flops and endless tax demands over the years have driven most operators aground. From over 10 operators few years ago, India has just three non-state players left with two of them saddled with a mountain of debt.
Vodafone Group Plc’s Indian venture has $14 billion worth of obligations, while Bharti Airtel is rated junk by Moody’s Investors Service. “All telecom operators have asked for requisite help in reducing"" the financial stress, Vodafone Idea said last month.
The “extraordinary scenario"" being shown is “just a machination to extract relief,"" Reliance Jio said in a letter to the minister of communications on Oct. 31.
In the latest instance, the court ordered operators to pay dues using a disputed method for calculating the annual adjusted gross revenue, a share of which is paid as license and spectrum fees. It upheld the government’s method that includes income from non-telecom businesses like dividend from income and capital gains from the sale of assets while rejecting a plea to exclude them.
Spectrum payment
Still, the official said the government is working on a plan to reduce the license fee and providing a two-year moratorium on pending spectrum payments. The proposal will be sent to the finance ministry first before it is taken up by the cabinet, the official said, adding that this may happen in the current financial year.
The telecom ministry spokesman didn’t immediately respond to requests for a comment.
A panel of senior government officials is examining feasibility of deferring payment for airwaves that are due by March 2021 and March 2022 as demanded by telecom companies, a government official told reporters last week. It will also consider the demand for reduction in spectrum usage levies and the Universal Service Obligation Fund charge.
On the introduction of 5G airwaves, the official said there will be no delay in auction, which is due this financial year, and that the government isn’t presuming the telecom sector is under stress. The reserve price for 5G spectrum will not be lowered, he said.
India has fallen behind China and some other countries in plans to introduce 5G, super fast networks seen as essential to developing factory automation, autonomous driving and other artificial intelligence applications.

MUMBAI :
Reliance Industries' (RIL) plans to re-organise its investment in Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) to make Jio a net debt-free company by the end of the current fiscal, which could unlock significant value, global brokerage firm UBS has said.
Making this estimate in a report on Monday, UBS reiterated its 'Buy' advice for RIL stocks and increased the stock price target from  ₹1,500 to  ₹1,750. RIL is currently trading at  ₹1,448 a share on the BSE.
""RIL announced plans to reorganize its investment in RJIL to make Jio a net debt free company by end-FY20. We think the reorganisation could unlock significant value at the platform entity or even at the Jio level,"" UBS said.
The brokerage firm further said that the reorganisation proposal for Jio involves a debt transfer from Jio to RIL standalone, which would make Jio's capital structure similar to global technology peers.
""Our understanding from interactions with management is that the strategy would: optimize platform entity capital structure with fair value of $60-70 billion, facilitate early monetisation and potential partnerships with global platform companies like Alphabet, Amazon and Alibaba."
84,2019-11-06,Reliance,"Is the fact that the company doesn’t have servers in India unfair towards the consumer?The Indian government has, in the past, asked WhatsApp and other instant messaging (IM) platforms to create methods for the government to trace texts on the platform

The recent debacle around WhatsApp has raised one pertinent issue. Is the fact that the company doesn’t have servers in India unfair towards the consumer? The Indian government has, in the past, asked WhatsApp and other instant messaging (IM) platforms to create methods for the government to trace texts on the platform, but IMs have almost unanimously refused to create backdoors around encryption.
However, a recent development in text messaging technology may provide an answer to the government’s problems. Rich Communication Services (RCS) isn’t particularly new. In fact, it has been spoken about in global markets for a while now, but it has only just reached Indian shores.
RCS messages allow newer features, like read receipts, payments and more on SMS and work over a data network. Since they’re supported by operators, the data travels over an operator network, hence staying inside a country’s border and within the jurisdiction of its laws.
In messaging apps like Messenger, WhatsApp etc, the data travels through a company’s servers, thereby transcending the country’s borders and out of reach of our legal jurisdiction.
Rajdip Gupta, Group CEO, Route Mobile, suggests that this could make RCS a viable replacement for IM platforms here. Route Mobile is a cloud communication platform provider for over the top players (OTT) and mobile network operators (MNO).
Because it allows features from instant messaging platforms (like WhatsApp, Viber etc.) to be used on regular SMS, RCS has often been called SMS 2.0. It’s close to Apple’s iMessage for iPhones but not quite as advanced.
Having said that, RCS has another advantage for governments, which is also a distinct disadvantage for users. Unlike most IMs, RCS is not end-to-end encrypted, meaning the messages you send using this technology can be intercepted more easily.
Route Mobiles’ Gupta contested the lack of end-to-end encryption, saying, “Anything that’s going over a GSM (Global System for Mobile) band is secure enough. When the data goes over IP (Internet Protocol), it goes out of the country where the security aspect is a big point of concern,"" he said.
Gupta said the fact that RCS is just a version of SMS should make it dependable and secure.
Security experts though disagree. “From a security perspective, we see the lack of end to end encryption as a challenge, compared to applications such as WhatsApp and other platforms like Telegram and Signal,"" said Rahul Tyagi, co-founder of cybersecurity firm Lucideus.
“End to end encryption is essential as it is difficult to penetrate and ensures security starting from application vendor to the network provider and only the sender and receiver of the message can view the content. A consumer who is cautious about privacy and security will not want their messages to be viewed in between and with RCS, it is not that way!"" he added.
Tyagi, however, said that RCS does have “standard security protocols"" like Transport Layer Security and Internet Protocol Security. The first is the underlying technology behind the creation of HTTPS, while the other is “widely used by VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)"".
The biggest challenge for RCS globally has been operator support. Android-maker Google stepped in recently to rectify that. The company announced its Jibe Cloud platform, which would rollout internationally and handle RCS operations on Android phones. In fact, recent reports have indicated that RCS is now available on the Google Messages app in India.
Reports and Reddit posts indicate that Vodafone users in India can already use RCS features on the network. Reliance Jio also supports RCS.
The move from SMS to IMs by consumers has usually been credited to two things — better features on IMs and the fact that Internet messaging didn’t incur costs like SMS did. RCS, at least on paper, makes the ageing SMS platform better in terms of features, and given that most operators have made SMSes free in some way, it does seem to offer a feasible alternative to IMs.
Whether it indeed convinces users in India remains to be seen."
83,2019-11-07,Reliance,"Irdai has asked Reliance Health Insurance Company to transfer the entire policyholders’ liabilities along with financial assets to Reliance General InsuranceThe company, which commenced its operations in October last year, has not been able to maintain the required solvency margin since June 2019

Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) on Wednesday ordered Reliance Health Insurance Co. Ltd (RHIC) to stop selling new policies, considering its inability to meet solvency margins. Irdai also directed it to transfer its assets and policyholders’ liabilities to Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd (RGIC).
The regulator directed RHIC to comply with the order by 15 November, and ordered RGIC to service claims of the troubled insurer.
Solvency margin at RHIC, which began operations in October 2018, had slipped below the regulatory minimum in June 2019. Since then, the regulator has followed up on the issue with the insurer. Solvency margin is the margin of assets over liabilities, and indicates whether a company is solvent enough to be able to cover for its liabilities. It is mandatory to maintain the margin for all life and non-life insurers, as per Irdai’s Assets, Liabilities and Solvency Margin of Insurers Rule 2000.
“Solvency margin is a key indicator to evaluate an insurance company’s capacity to pay all risks it has covered in the market. Whether it will impact policyholders depends on the quality of business (profitable/not profitable) underwritten and consequent claim ratios,"" said Mahavir Chopra, director, health, life and strategic initiatives, Coverfox, an insurance broking firm.
RHIC’s solvency margin, which stood at 106% in June, dipped to 77% in August, against the 150% mandatory for health insurers. When the margin fell further to 63% in September, Irdai asked it not to make any payments towards capital expenditure, or towards any of the related parties of RHIC.
In October, Reliance Capital Ltd, the sole promoter of the insurer, admitted to the weak margins, in a letter to Irdai. It said plans to bring in a new investor were not proceeding and, therefore, it would like to amalgamate the company with RGIC. The regulator found that the firm’s underlying assets would suffice to meet claims of existing policyholders. Irdai asked RHIC to ensure policyholders were not impacted in the long run.
According to a senior official at RGIC, who requested anonymity, RHIC will amalgamate with RGIC and given that it’s only a small book vis-a-vis RGIC, it will not have any impact on its solvency margins."
82,2019-11-07,Reliance,"A DoT official privy to the development said instructions have gone to the licencing wing to carefully examine the implication of the apex court's recent ruling The Supreme Court last month upheld the government's way of calculating telecom revenue

The communications ministry has started examining whether the Supreme Court's ruling on definition of telecom revenue may apply to any company that utilises radiowaves and has a telecom licence, throwing up the possibility of statutory dues swelling beyond  ₹3 lakh crore, according to a source.
A DoT official privy to the development said instructions have gone to the licencing wing to carefully examine the implication of the apex court's recent ruling for all such companies.
The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) will take a week or so to arrive at a definitive conclusion on the matter, the source added.
The Supreme Court last month upheld the government's way of calculating telecom revenue, on which licence fee and spectrum usage charges are computed.
As per the initial calculations, access players like Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other telecom operators may have to pay the government a whopping  ₹1.42 lakh crore within three months.
Bharti Airtel faces a liability of around  ₹42,000 crore after including licence fees and spectrum usage charges, while Vodafone Idea may have to pay about  ₹40,000 crore. Jio may have to pay around  ₹14 crore. The remaining liability is with state-owned BSNL/MTNL and some of the shut/bankrupt companies.
However, DoT is now applying its mind on whether the apex court order also impacts any other company which uses spectrum or has a licence. Discussions are going beyond the scope of 4-5 pure play telecom access providers.
""As we dwell deeper, the issue of larger implications of the SC order is coming up for other firms,"" the source said.
These may even include other category of licences or companies utilising radiowaves in oil and gas, power and even railways sectors, the source said, adding that the question before the telecom department is whether the statutory dues therefore have to be calculated on the overall revenue.
The matter has, however, not been placed before the newly-constituted Committee of Secretaries, as the telecom department first needs to arrive at a final view on the matter, the source added.
Back-of-the-envelope calculations show that if indeed the impact of the SC judgement on AGR goes beyond the pure-play telecom access firms, the statutory dues may climb beyond  ₹3 lakh crore, the source added.
The government recently constituted a Committee of Secretaries to work out a financial bailout package that may include lowering of spectrum charges as well as ending the era of free mobile phone calls and dirt cheap data.
The Committee of Secretaries, headed by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, has been asked to examine ""all aspects"" of ""financial stress"" faced by service providers such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea and suggest measures to mitigate them. The panel has already held two meetings since it was constituted."
81,2019-11-08,Reliance,"DGTR felt there is prima facie evidence to justify initiation of the safeguard investigationThe period considered for the purposes of present investigation is from April 2015 to June 2019

New Delhi: The Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) will initiate safeguard investigation to determine if import of synthetic rubber from South Korea was harming the domestic manufacturers. Reliance Industries, the sole manufacturer of the rubber in India, had pleaded with the body that imports of ‘polybutadiene rubber’ were harming the local industry. The rubber is used to make tyres.
DGTR felt there is prima facie evidence to justify initiation of the safeguard investigation, according to a release posted on its website. The period considered for the purposes of present investigation is from April 2015 to June 2019.
RIL claims that imports of the product have increased in absolute terms as well as in relation to production and consumption in India. DGTR said it is noted that there is significant increase in imports of synthetic rubber in recent period. The rate of increase in imports of subject goods is considered significant considering the duration, the quantum, the total imports and the consumption in India, it said.
Interested parties will have 30 days to file their responses the DGTR notice. Such exercises undertaken by the DGTR usually take a year to complete.
Polybutadiene rubber (also referred to as PBR) is a synthetic rubber that is a polymer formed from the polymerization of the monomer 1,3-butadiene. It is used in the manufacture of tyres mainly and is also used as an additive to improve the mechanical strength of plastics such as polystyrene and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene.
The product is produced in more than one grade. RIL has identified five grades, differentiated on the basis of the catalyst used in production. As per the company, the grades may be identified as: neodymium, cobalt, nickel, titanium and lithium. It does not produce two grades, ie, titanium and lithium.
DGTR falls under the department of commerce in Ministry of Commerce and Industry and its recommendations are final.
India has a free trade agreement with South Korea called the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) and the increase in imports is a fallout of that. India had a trade deficit of $5 billion in 2009-10 with South Korea and CEPA became effective on 1 Jan, 2010. The deficit has since jumped to $12 billion as of 2018-19."
80,2019-11-11,Reliance,"A relief package is in the works, but any lasting solution will need hard decisions on cut-throat pricing in the industryInvestors are unlikely to commit more capital unless there is clarity on the relief package and the government’s stance on pricing, say analysts

For years, the telecom industry helped successive governments line up their coffers. Now, things have come full circle, with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government working on a relief package for the industry. While the exact nature of the relief package is still being worked out, reports suggest there are four options on the table: a reduction in license fees from the current level of 8% of adjusted gross revenues (AGR); a waiver of penalties and interest on past dues; a reduction in interest rates to market-linked rates; and a moratorium on dues.
Thanks to the double whammy of declining revenues and rising debt, there is the distinct possibility that Vodafone Idea Ltd may end up in bankruptcy court. The government is anxious about how this could impact competitive dynamics in the industry. That’s not all. Most of the debt of the industry is held by the government and government-owned banks. So another default will have severe implications for the government’s own finances, besides pulling down an already strained banking sector.
Of course, since various other industries have also asked for relief from the government, it will need to make a strong case of why the telecom sector is being singled out for help. The government’s own finances aren’t in the best of shape—the rating agency, Moody’s Investors Service, cut India’s credit ratings outlook to negative on Friday—and a relief package, depending on what form it takes, can impact the fiscal deficit in the near term.
And then the BJP government has to contend with industry leader, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which has been vociferously pointing out that taxpayer money needn’t be spent on bailing out private firms which have themselves to blame for their situation.
Jio, thanks to a  ₹1.75 trillion equity infusion from its parent, Reliance Industries Ltd, has the least leverage in the industry. Bharti Airtel Ltd has also managed the turmoil in the industry fairly well, thanks to regular fundraising and a recent equity infusion by its shareholders. But Vodafone Idea is precariously placed. A recent Supreme Court ruling, which confirmed a regulatory levy along with a massive penalty, has threatened the firm’s existence. Its cash balance is far lower than the amount owed to the government as a result of the SC order.
“While in Bharti’s case the impact will be material…for Vodafone, the impact could be nearly back-breaking,"" analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd said in a note to its clients.
But the big worry for the industry is that relief may come only in the form of a quick fix solution. What’s really needed is a holistic policy approach that is not only pro-consumer, but also encourages sustainable growth for the industry. “Telecom consumers have had it really great, with progressively declining tariffs over the past many years. But this also means that producers have had it really bad,"" says a former official of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) who asked not to be identified.
Clearly, the elephant in the room is the cut-throat pricing in the industry.
The pricing factor
In the past three years, since Reliance Jio launched services, consumers have had it so good that the size of the industry has shrunk by a third. Three years ago, consumer-level spends on mobile services stood at about  ₹1.8 trillion, which has now fallen to around  ₹1.2 trillion, numbers collated by Kotak Institutional Equities show.
“The relief package being discussed deals primarily with the debt burden of the industry. But this wouldn’t be sufficient to sustain the industry. All it would do is kick the can down the road. The heart of the matter is that current tariffs are way below optimal levels, and the government should consider regulations on pricing if it is really interested in a three-player market,"" says an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage. Put simply, what would be the point of a moratorium of a couple of years on debt repayment if the companies seeking relief find themselves in the same situation when the moratorium ends?
But regulations related to pricing are a sticky affair, especially in an industry where the regulator has preferred forbearance over strictures on pricing. Besides, there is hardly any precedent for this in large telecom markets, and it won’t be surprising if consumer interest groups rise up against the move. And to make the matter even more complicated, there have been turf issues between Trai and the Competition Commission of India (CCI), with even Supreme Court weighing in on the matter. On matters related to competition, the SC said CCI is the competent authority, and added that this is an area Trai is not at all equipped to deal with.
In this backdrop, the government almost faces a catch-22 situation. It can claim the SC order ties its hands on matters such as pricing, but to opt for inaction could mean that more relief is needed to be provided in the future, or that it eventually settles for a haircut on its dues.
A change in stance
Hints of the government’s anxiety about a bankruptcy filing first came in mid-September. Out of the blue, Trai said it will review its decision to completely do away with interconnection usage charges (IUC) from 1 January 2020. Two years ago, it had cut IUC by about 57%, which resulted in huge savings for Jio and dealt a massive blow to the incumbents.
The cut in IUC to zero early next year was taken as a given by almost everyone concerned. “The last-minute change in stance shows that the government is keen that the current market structure with three private operators continues; it wants to avoid a monopoly or a duopoly kind of situation,"" said the head of research at a multinational brokerage, requesting anonymity. Vodafone Idea gets about a third of its operating profit from net IUC receipts. A review of the charge means that these receipts will continue longer than was earlier anticipated.
About a month after the decision to review IUC, the Supreme Court ruled in the government’s favour on a dispute related to the calculation of AGR, and its implications for license fees and other charges levied on telcos. Along with penalties and interest on penalties, the total amount owed to the government by telcos stands at about  ₹1.3 trillion, according to industry estimates.
For Vodafone Idea, the estimated outgo of about  ₹40,000 crore is far in excess of its cash balance of around  ₹20,000 crore. What’s more, with the Supreme Court setting a three-month deadline for the payment of the dues, hardly any investors were willing to bet that the company would survive. Its shares fell to below  ₹4 per share, and tellingly, stocks of banks such as State Bank of India fell sharply as well. Most of the dues owed to the government as a result of the Supreme Court order were from firms which were already bankrupt or are now facing bankruptcy. So it isn’t surprising that the government has moved relatively quickly since the SC ruling. It has set up a committee of secretaries (CoS) to suggest ways to alleviate the stress being faced by the telecom sector, news reports said.
Once bitten, twice shy
Having telcos both bid for spectrum and also share a portion of their gross revenues is akin to the government having its cake and eating it too. The revenue share arrangement was part of a regime when the spectrum was administratively allocated to these firms. To continue with it in the post-auction regime amounts to a double levy of sorts. The auction process, itself, left much to be desired. Telcos were forced to get into a bidding war for spectrum that they needed to survive. They ended up overbidding, which explains a large part of the massive debt on the books of some telcos.
With this background, some feel that a relief package will only help in undoing some of the past wrongs by the government. Besides, it’s common practice for lenders to provide a moratorium on dues on the hope that a revival in the industry’s fortunes will improve chances of recovery. As such, it makes sense for the government to opt for a solution that has a more lasting impact.
Talk of a floor on pricing is typically met with criticism, especially in an industry that has been a child of the country’s reforms in the 1990s. But the former Trai official says that regulation on pricing in a regulated industry isn’t out of order. “Besides, if consumers have been willing to pay higher prices for nearly all goods and services as a result of inflation, what separates this industry that its tariffs only head downward,"" he says.
Analysts say investors are unlikely to commit more capital unless there is clarity on the relief package and the government’s stance on pricing.
The counter view
While Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel’s concerns are being highlighted by the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), Reliance Jio has a diametrically opposite view. Incidentally, while the incumbents have been reporting losses in their India mobile operations, Jio has been reporting profits, giving the impression that Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel’s troubles are their own doing.
But, Jio’s profits need to be seen in the light of its massive investments. “Jio’s return on invested capital is only around 5%, and that too after having an accounting policy that results in relatively low depreciation charges,"" says the analyst at the domestic institutional brokerage. Generating a 10% return on invested capital would require Jio’s operating profit to exceed the peak historical annual Ebitda ever generated by the aggregate Indian telecom industry, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities have calculated. If competitive pressures remain, achieving these targets will be an uphill task. What’s more, Jio has made it clear that investors should see it as a digital platform rather than a mere connectivity business. The thing with a platform business such as Tencent of China is that it operates across different telecom networks. Needless to say, the higher Jio’s subscriber market share, the more likely it will be valued as a platform business, with a monopoly structure being the ideal scenario for its investors.
From the government’s perspective, however, there is much to worry about in such a situation. To start with, it would need to write off large sums owed by the incumbents to the government. It also needs to worry about the impact on the banking sector. Its future revenues streams from the sector, too, can take a hit. With no competition for the auction of spectrum, it may well have to settle for a sub-optimal price for its prized asset.
While this may appear to sound like an extreme scenario, it isn’t outside the realm of possibility. Sure, the government seems keen on supporting state-run telcos such as Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, but hardly anyone views them as a worthy competitor in the market.
In sum, encouraging ultra-low prices may look like a pro-consumer move now, but if this results in a monopoly situation, it can quickly turn anti-consumer. To start with, it makes sense for the government to ask CCI to weigh in on the concerns about pricing and give its recommendations."
79,2019-11-11,Reliance,"The firm reined in operating costs, although the big savings came from lower raw material prices as a percent of salesThe company reined in costs on all operating fronts, including raw material, staff and other expenses

Ashok Leyland Ltd’s shares fell sharply in the first hour of trading on Monday, but recovered to close 3.5% higher at  ₹79.20. While the company’s September quarter earnings didn’t have much to write home about, its conference call with analysts on Monday morning calmed some nerves.
The management said inventory (including company and dealer level) is down to 13,200 vehicles at the end of October from 18,200 in end-September and 27,500 vehicles in end-June. This will help lower working capital, and hence, interest costs in the quarters ahead.
Investors now seem to be coming to the conclusion that the worst is behind Ashok Leyland.
To be sure, the 44% year-on-year drop in quarterly sales was bad news. However, the decline was less steep than in Q1 FY20 when sales plunged about 70%. But, the management commentary was less pessimistic this time around.
The management said that while the company gained market share in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle (M&HCV) segment in Q1 FY20, the focus was to bring down inventory in the subsequent quarter. This was important considering the 48% jump in interest cost during the quarter on account of higher working capital that necessitated more borrowings.
Fortunately, the company reined in operating costs, although the big savings came from lower raw material prices as a percentage of sales. According to Edelweiss Securities Ltd, “The management’s unwavering focus on profitable growth rather than on chasing market share is encouraging. The increasing share of LCV (whose margin profile is similar to overall business) will aid further profitability.""
However, negative operating leverage due to the sharp fall in vehicle sales dragged profitability. Net realizations too fell by 4% year-on-year on the back of lower mix of M&HCV sales and discounts offered to customers in order to cut inventory.
Hence, Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin came under pressure falling nearly 510 basis points year-on-year to 5.8%, which was lower than Bloomberg’s consensus estimate of 6.5%.
Note that this compares favourably with even market leader Tata Motors Ltd whose M&HCV segment recorded a weaker 3.8% Ebitda margin.
Still, the uncertainty on truck owners’ purchasing pattern ahead of the BS-VI emission norms as well as the economic slowdown, will keep Ashok Leyland’s shares range-bound in the near term.
“Although the near term outlook remains tough due to the BS-VI transition, we maintain our stance that the M&HCV recovery will play out from second half of FY21,"" analysts at Nomura Rsearch said in a note to clients."
78,2019-11-12,Reliance,"Reliance General Insurance, to which all Reliance Health policies will be transferred, will take on the responsibility and settle all claims after 15 NovExisting policyholders can port their policies at the time of renewal to other insurers, including Reliance General

With effect from 15 November, Reliance Health Insurance Co. Ltd (RHICL) will stop selling new policies and transfer all its policyholders’ liabilities and financial assets to Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd (RGICL). RHICL was ordered to do so by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) as it has not been able to maintain its solvency margin, which indicates a company’s ability to cover its liabilities, since June 2019. Insurers are required to maintain a solvency ratio of 150%.
RHICL, which started operations in October 2018, has sold just 82,134 policies as of March 2019. These policies will now be taken care of by RGICL and there is no cause for panic for policyholders. We explain the process, but first a bit about what happened at RHICL.
What happened with RHICL
RHICL’s solvency margin dipped to 63% in September from 106% in June. In a letter dated 26 September 2019, the regulator asked the company to restore the solvency to the minimum requirement by 30 September. However, in October, Reliance Capital Ltd, the sole promoter of the insurer, admitted to not being able to restore the margin (in a letter to Irdai) and said that the proposed induction of a new investor was not proceeding as envisaged and, therefore, it would like to merge the company with RGICL.
Noting RHICL’s declining solvency, Irdai concluded that it won’t be in policyholders’ favour to continue the health insurance business. After weighing all the options and considering that Reliance Capital is the sole promoter of both RHICL and RGICL, Irdai decided to entrust RHICL’s insurance portfolio to RGICL. As of September, RHICL has a market share of only 0.01%, whereas RGICL has a market share of 4.63%.
Impact on policyholders
Irdai has asked RHICL to ensure policyholders are not impacted in the long run.
In a statement, RGICL said there will be no impact on policyholders due to the transition, which will begin from 15 November, and they will continue to avail the benefits as per the policies’ terms and conditions. “Customers will most likely not get impacted given that RGICL has mentioned there is only a marginal impact on their solvency ratio due to the merger,"" said Mahavir Chopra, director, health, life and strategic initiatives, Coverfox, an insurance broking firm.
During such events, insurers are required to submit plans of the merger to Irdai that include insuring seamless claims and customer service transition. “The products will get integrated into the RGICL portfolio and there could only be a change in the name of the products, customer service numbers, etc., which RGICL will need to communicate with the customers of RHICL. Policyholders need not do anything other than expecting communication through various modes and be aware of the change in toll-free numbers, website etc.,"" added Chopra.
Kapil Mehta, co-founder, Securenow.in, an insurance broker, too said no sizeable impact is expected because the insurer’s customer base is quite small.
According to Irdai, gross direct premium underwritten by RHICL till 31 March 2019 was only  ₹4.09 crore, whereas RGICL reported  ₹6,191.03 crore. “Similar situations have occurred in the past where one insurer has left the country and transferred their book to another so it’s nothing to worry too much about,"" said Mehta.
The way ahead
Irdai has asked RHICL to transfer RGICL all the investments pertaining to policyholders and those lying in shareholders’ account, bank balance and cash in hand and all cheques lying with agents and branches of RHICL by way of premium collection. RGICL has also been asked to maintain a separate account to disburse the liabilities (claims) of policyholders of RHICL which arise on or after 15 November. Until then, the liabilities will be discharged by RHICL.
The troubled insurer will have to give notice to all policyholders, informing them about the changes and about the procedure to file claims with RGICL to settle the claims. Also, RHICL shall completely stop underwriting new business; a communication about that has already been displayed on the company’s website.
After 15 November, RGICL will service the claims of the ailing insurer by displaying the procedure for the same on its website. Also, RGICL can neither sell any new policy on behalf of RHICL nor renew existing ones. Existing policyholders will be given the option to port their policies at the time of renewal to other insurers, including RGICL, which can’t deny a cover, said the company’s spokesperson.
“You can either keep your existing policy or you could port to some other insurer or product, including RGICL. In that case, you will get the benefit of the waiting period of the previous policy which means the waiting period for pre-existing conditions will be reduced,"" said Mehta. So if you’ve already spent three years in the previous policy, the three-year credit will get ported to the new policy. Other benefits such as the no-claim bonus is also transferred. You can port your policy provided both are indemnity plans that cover hospitalization.
RHICL policyholders don’t have much to worry about as of now. In due course of time, if you find the premiums to be high or the services not good enough, you have the option of porting to another insurer"

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel and private equity firm Varde Partners have submitted their bids for assets of debt-laden Reliance Communications, while Reliance Jio has sought extension of the asset sale deal deadline by another 10 days.
Airtel has placed conditional bid to buy spectrum of RCom while Bharti Infratel has submitted bids for mobile towers, a Bharti spokesperson said.
Banking sources involved in the process told PTI that a total of six bids have come for assets of Anil Ambani-led RCom on Monday.
""Six bids have come for assets of Reliance Communications. This includes bid from Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel, private equity firm Varde Partners. RCom committee of creditors is scheduled to meet on November 13, 2019 to take call on the bids opening,"" a banking source said.
Reliance Jio did not comment on the email query.
""The bid conditions include that the overall consideration will primarily be by way of the deferred spectrum payables to the government being passed on to us on terms and schedules applicable to such deferred payments,"" Bharti Airtel spokesperson said.
Apart from real assets, RCom telecom assets on sale include spectrum holding of 122 MHz which the company before insolvency proceedings had estimated to be around  ₹14,000 crore, towers business for  ₹7,000 crore, optical fibre network  ₹3,000 crore and data centres worth  ₹4,000 crore.
Sources estimate that RCom Group's total secured debt is around  ₹33,000 crore. Lenders have submitted claim of around  ₹49,000 crore in August.

75,2019-11-12,Reliance,"Opening up the fuel retail sector may open the floodgates for investors, the government needs to adopt a cautious approach as opening an uncontrolled number of outlets may led to inviability of many existing as well as new outlets

The government of India was right in imposing a condition of  ₹2,000 crore investment in the oil and gas infrastructure sector at the beginning of the century, as demand for petrol and diesel was growing almost in double digits. This made fuel retail business a very lucrative one.
Today, though there has been a demand growth of diesel, it has become almost stagnant. However, petrol demand growth is still around 6%, necessitating opening of retail outlets (ROs) every year. The government has now approved further opening up the fuel retail sector for private players with a meagre net worth of  ₹250 crore as compared to the prior investment requirement of  ₹2,000 crore.
While this may open the floodgates for investors, the government needs to adopt a cautious approach, as opening an uncontrolled number of outlets may led to inviability of many existing as well as new outlets. The situation may get exacerbated with public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs)—Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd —planning to set up over 78,493 more fuel pumps around the country.
Ratings agency Crisil rightly pointed out the concerns in its report, “Hence, the question that arises is whether the players will be able to maintain operational sustainability and profitability, and ensure a return on investment (RoI) with the more than doubling of pumps in the country.""
“Mature fuel retail markets such as the US have ~150,000 petrol pumps, which is a sharp decline from the 202,800 pumps in 1994. Stagnating fuel demand and deteriorating pump economics led to the closure or consolidation of pumps,"" the report added.
The Indian government also needs to factor in the impact of alternative fuels entering the Indian market in the near future. A case in point being India’s Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles or FAME 2 scheme—to expand commercial vehicle fleet—announced with an outlay of  ₹10,000 crore.
That day is not far, given that BP Plc’s group joint venture (JV) with Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) plans to roll out charging networks across the country in the future. The government also plans to install one electric vehicle charging station after every 4km in cities and 25km on both ways of highways connecting to these cities. Also, as reported by Mint, India is currently giving final touches to a plan to build Tesla-style giga factories to develop its own domestic battery manufacturing ecosystem. This involves a raft of incentives such as concessional financing options, friendly tax regimes and a suitable basic customs duty safeguard.
These measures come at a time when India, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after the US and China, has been pushing for a gas-based economy and plans to connect 10 million households to piped natural gas by 2020.
Given the imperatives involved, India should err on the side of caution at a time when the country is battling a demand slowdown.
B.M. Bansal is a former Indian Oil Corp. chairman."
74,2019-11-12,Reliance,"The move to allow all firms with a net worth of  ₹250 crore to set up fuel retail outlets aims to boost investmentThe change in the fuel retail policy will definitely lead to an increase in competition and the customers will benefit, IOC chairman said

In a significant move last month, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government opened up the fuel retail market by lowering the entry barrier.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved the review guidelines, which will allow all companies with a net worth of  ₹250 crore to set up retail fuel outlets.
Under existing rules, companies were required to invest at least  ₹2,000 crore in the petroleum sector to enter the fuel retail segment, which many believed, favoured state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs).
The Centre’s move will now allow even non-energy companies to sell petrol and diesel to consumers, but with a few riders—they can open multiple dealerships of more than one state-run OMC, but the outlets must be set up at different locations. Besides, the companies will have to install facilities for marketing at least one new-generation alternative fuel, such as compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), biofuels, or electric charging units. Apart from OMCs, any private entity can source and sell fuel from anyone.
The landmark decision comes amid a slump in fuel demand in September, and a fall in commercial vehicle traffic on highways, besides the consumption demand slump in a slowing economy. However, there was a rise in domestic cooking gas and petrol consumption.
Private sector oil companies such as Reliance Industries Ltd, Essar Oil Ltd and Shell India, have some presence in fuel retailing, but the segment is dominated by state-run OMCs such as Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd.
“The existing policy for granting authorization to market transportation fuels had not undergone any change for the last 17 years since 2002. It has now been revised to bring it in line with the changing market dynamics and with a view to encourage investment from private players, including foreign players,"" the government said in a statement.
In recent times, the Indian energy space has been witnessing growing interest from investors. While Adani Gas Ltd and Total SA plan to build a gas fuel retail network of 1,500 outlets along highways, the world’s largest oil producer, Saudi Arabian Oil Co. (Saudi Aramco), is also considering entering the fuel retailing market in India. That apart, other global energy majors, such as Rosneft, Kuwait Petroleum, ExxonMobil, Shell and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. are planning to acquire the government’s stake in BPCL.
“As far as pricing is concerned, existing companies are fairly efficient. Large multinational players are already present in the retail market. So, competition is already there,"" IOC chairman Sanjiv Singh had said last month. “But, the change in policy will definitely lead to an increase in competition and the customers will benefit.""
Experts welcomed the move. “The Indian retail fuel market is overarchingly dominated by PSUs, which control about 90% of the existing retail outlets and occupy the high-traffic sites at urban centres and highways. Accordingly, the decision...would allow an increase in market participation,"" said K. Ravichandran, senior vice-president and group head, corporate ratings, Icra in a statement.
IOC, the largest OMC in India with around 43% market share in fuel retailing, or 65,202 outlets, said on 31 October that diesel consumption grew by around 1% in the first six months of the current financial year.
“When we talk about gasoline (petrol), in the first six months, we saw growth of close to 9%, which is fairly good in spite of a reduced sale of auto vehicles. We are still seeing decent growth as far as gasoline is concerned,"" Singh added.
“While demand for petroleum products has been declining globally on account of increasing environmental concerns and thrust on electric vehicles, India continues to be a growth market, and thus a key market for international players,"" India Ratings and Research wrote in a 5 November report.
However, concerns remain. Indian businesses have been battling a demand slowdown and liquidity crunch, which resulted in the economic growth rate cooling to a six-year-low of 5% in the June quarter, and private consumption expenditure was at an 18-quarter-low of 3.1%.
Besides, according to the latest survey by Delhi-based think tank National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), the Business Confidence Index (BCI) fell dipped to 103.1, falling 15.3% from the quarter ended July. The BCI was at 100.4 in October 2013."

NEW DELHI :
Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,"" goes the saying. Government policy for India’s telecom sector over the past 25 years has left much to be desired. Not only have mistakes been repeated, but the industry has also had to grapple with various flip-flops in policy.
The upshot: exactly two decades after the government’s relief package for the industry through the New Telecom Policy of 1999, the present government is considering another relief package for the industry. Besides, from the looks of it, Indian telecom seems headed towards a duopoly market again, which is ironic given that this is how it all began for the industry."

Tata Group, the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, has approached carmakers including China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. and BMW AG as it seeks partnerships for the beleaguered British automotive business, Bloomberg reported citing people with knowledge of the matter. India’s largest conglomerate has said it’s open to finding partners for JLR to save on costs and share the burden of investing in electric vehicles. The deliberations were at an early stage and Tata could still approach other potential partners. Any tie-up with a Chinese automaker could potentially help JLR in that market, where its struggles led to a $3.9 billion writedown earlier this year. Deeper ties between the British luxury brand and BMW would build on an existing collaboration to develop engines and electric-drive technology, though the German carmaker’s former chief executive officer in August ruled out any equity investment.

71,2019-11-13,Reliance,"Sebi ruling was related to alleged fraudulent trading in the F&O space in the securities of Reliance PetroleumThe Sebi had barred the company and 12 of its promoter group entities from dealing in equity derivatives

MUMBAI :
Reliance Industries on Wednesday began its arguments against a 2017 Sebi order barring it from the equity derivative market in the Securities Appellate Tribunal, claiming it had done no wrong in the case.
The Sebi had barred the company and 12 of its promoter group entities from dealing in equity derivatives.
The watchdog had barred the company and the entities for alleged unfair trade practices related to the securities market.
Through an order on March 24, 2017, Sebi had also directed RIL to disgorge  ₹447 crore along with interest.
Appearing on behalf of RIL, senior counsel Harish Salve said there is nothing in the law which would prevent the company from undertaking the transactions for which it was acted against by the Sebi.
He also suggested that after considering the law, the capital markets regulator may have imposed a small penalty. The real question, he said, is whether the transactions were a part of market manipulation strategy.
The case dates back to March 2007, when Mukesh Ambani-led RIL decided to sell 5% stake in Reliance Petroleum, a listed subsidiary which was later merged with RIL in 2009.
Sebi ruling was related to alleged fraudulent trading in the F&O space in the securities of Reliance Petroleum.
Salve said sale of shares got RIL  ₹4,000 crore and the trades in the future and options got it  ₹400 crore.
He also agreed with Sebi's contention of RIL having funded a few of the entities in the case, pointing that the company had an agreement to fund them."

How many telcos does it take to keep the Digital India bulb bright and burning?
For some experts, a disruption in the current market structure with three private operators will have adverse ramifications for the industry.
“Telecom sector is under immense financial stress (as) admitted by all stakeholders. Further demand of  ₹92,000 crore will dampen the sentiment of telecom operators and raising funds for broadband, network expansion and Digital India will hit a significant roadblock. The impact is not limited to telecom operators but will have a domino effect on the larger digital value chain. This requires immediate intervention by all stakeholders to get the sector back in shape,"" said Prashant Singhal, emerging markets, technology, media and telecom leader, EY India.

When telcos such as Aircel Ltd and Reliance Communications Ltd went bust, Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal had said that the consolidation in the sector had happened in a disorderly fashion and that a whopping $50 billion in investments in the sector had been wiped out.
Vodafone Idea Ltd is certainly in a far bigger league. It happens to be India’s largest telecom company by number of subscribers and it is also the company with the largest foreign direct investment into the country.
Its possible demise will clearly be more disorderly, both in terms of the disruption it causes in the industry, but also for future foreign direct investment prospects.
Among other things, experts have blamed an unstable regulatory environment, high cost of operations, hyper-intensive competition and rock-bottom tariffs for the current state of the company.
On Tuesday, however, its chief executive officer Nick Read said that Vodafone has pledged not to put any more money into the business in India, and Vodafone Idea may be headed for liquidation unless the government eases off on demands for mobile spectrum fees, according to a Reuters report.
“If you don’t get the remedies being suggested, the situation is critical,"" Read said at a press round-table in London on Tuesday. “If you’re not a going concern, you’re moving into a liquidation scenario—can’t get any clearer than that.""
The UK-based telecom company’s 12-year journey in India has seen highs and lows, much like the telecom sector. The big hit came with the government enacting a retrospective tax rule to recover what it thought was its rightful share of profit from Hutchison’s sale of its stake in its India operations to Vodafone Group.
Even as the operator was reeling under the effects of this blow, the next big shock hit Vodafone India when Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani’s new telecom venture Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd entered the market in September 2016.
Jio disrupted the market with free data and voice offerings, shrinking revenue streams of all other operators. This also led to a brutal consolidation that reshaped the entire telecom sector. Companies that were already saddled with debt, due to expensive airwaves bought in previous spectrum auctions could not compete with the sharply low tariffs offered by Jio.
As a result, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular in March 2017 decided to merge their pan India networks to stay in the battlefield. Airtel acquired Tata Teleservices, Telenor and Tikona Digital. Aircel and Reliance Communications went bankrupt.
The next hit to both Airtel and Vodafone Idea came in September 2017 when the regulator decided to slash interconnect usage charges (IUC) from 14 paise to 6 paise a minute. The two incumbents which both enjoyed huge incoming traffic were hit hard. On the other hand, Jio’s costs on delivering voice calls to rival networks also came down.
At that time, Vodafone also lashed out at the regulator. “We only ask for a level-playing field in terms of regulation. I think it’s fair to say that for the last two years, we have had many regulatory outcomes that have worked against everyone in the market except Jio. We have made these points clear even earlier,"" Read said at a press briefing at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February.
Today, however, Vodafone Idea and its arch-rival Airtel are fighting for survival, having been dealt a body-blow after the recent Supreme Court verdict upheld the Union government’s definition of revenue, which requires these telcos to pay past dues to the government. Bharti Airtel on Thursday said that its liabilities/provisions as on 30 September aggregate  ₹34,260 crore. Vodafone Idea has made provisions for  ₹25,677.9 crore. This demand, at a time when the industry faces a mountain of debt and rock-bottom revenues, will not only hurt investment climate in the country, but will also be detrimental given the huge resources that telcos need to raise for broadband proliferation, network expansion and to realize Digital India.
Telcos are the backbone of digital services and a crucial stakeholder for the country to unlock the $5 trillion GDP dream by 2024. Without government offering relief, there will be a domino effect on the larger digital value chain.
However, Reliance Jio disagrees with this prognosis. In a letter to the government, the company said, “We further submit that the failure of two operators, even in the unlikely event of it actually happening, will not have an impact on the sector dynamics with existence of vibrant competition including presence of the PSUs and there is no restriction on entry by new operators. Further, there will be no impact on digitization and government programmes, as these operators, anyway were not investing sufficiently in the sector and have been claiming a financial stress for a long time now and they have not shown any inclination to modernize the networks, as evident for Trai data in its IUC consultation paper."" Incumbents such as Vodafone Idea and Airtel, on the other hand, claim that their networks reach the poorest of the poor, given the fact that 4G compatible handsets are out of the reach for this set of customers.
“A sudden demise of a player in India will reduce competition within the sector becoming a two-player market. The market will not be able to handle extra subscribers and quality of service will be impacted especially in rural markets which has a large 2G and 3G base, which is not catered to by Jio’s pure 4G network,"" said Rajiv Sharma, head of institutional equity research, SBICAP Securities.
To be sure, following the court verdict, the Centre last month set up a Committee of Secretaries under the cabinet secretary to suggest measures to alleviate financial stress in the sector. The panel will look into the demand of telcos for deferment of spectrum auction payment dues for the years 2020-21 and 2021-22 in order to ease cash flow. It will also look at measures such as reducing levies, including spectrum usage charges and the universal service obligation fund (Usof) fee paid by telcos.
Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has sought an easier payment schedule for spectrum bought in previous auctions, waiving penalty and interest arising out of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, and a 14-year period to pay the principal amount of AGR dues.
The DoT, however, has now demanded payments from telcos within the three-month deadline set by the SC. Even as it awaits recommendations of the top panel, Union telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has assured operators that the department of telecommunications (DoT) will review prices for upcoming auctions."
68,2019-11-14,Reliance,"The video streaming industry in India will continue to enjoy creative freedom, said the top official at the ministry of information and broadcastingKhare said the government’s recognition of the need for self-regulation stems from the fact that the OTT industry is entirely controlled by private players

NEW DELHI :
Amid looming fear of the government cracking a whip on the over-the-top (OTT) video streaming industry in India through some kind of a censor board, comes a good news for OTT firms. Unlike television broadcasting and feature films, the video streaming industry in India will continue to enjoy creative freedom and platforms will only have to come together to create a self-regulation model, said a top official at the ministry of information and broadcasting.
“We’ve been in consultation with players in Mumbai and Chennai lately and are working towards a system of self-regulation for the OTT industry,"" Amit Khare, secretary, ministry of information and broadcasting, said at the CII Big Picture Summit 2019 in New Delhi on Thursday.
Khare said the government’s recognition of the need for self-regulation, and not censorship or certification, stems from the fact that the OTT industry is entirely controlled by private players and requires creative freedom of a different kind.
Earlier this year, nine video streaming sites in India decided to adopt a self-regulatory Code of Best Practices under the aegis of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). However, soon after, a couple of shows ruffled some feathers in the corridors of power. These included Leila on Netflix that hints at the repercussions of right-wing Hindu fundamentalism and the kind of dystopian society it could create, and Gandii Baat on ALTBalaji that featured erotic stories from rural India. To be sure, both Netflix and ALTBalaji were among those, along with Hotstar, Voot, ZEE5, Arre, SonyLIV, Reliance Jio and Eros Now, that had agreed to self-regulation.
Self-regulation under the IAMAI classified content into three separate and distinct categories, including those meant for general or universal viewing; content that requires parental guidance and/or content that is solely meant for age-appropriate audiences (such age-appropriate audience may be further sub-categorized into different age groups). Platforms are also required to display a content descriptor or guidance message that indicate and inform the viewer about the nature of the content, particularly around age-inappropriate content for minors.
Also, the signatories to the code agreed to a grievance redressal mechanism whereby they would appoint or institute, as part of their operational systems, a dedicated person, team or department, to receive and address any consumer-related concerns and complaints in relation to the content they are showcasing.
Details of the self-regulation code proposed by the government are not known yet.
On Thursday, Khare re-emphasised that the media and entertainment industry in India was predominantly private, including films, television, and OTT offerings. The government’s recent initiatives to aid the sector include digitization of the film certification process, archival of old classics for the National Film Heritage Mission and a single-window clearance for ease of shooting. “We are moving towards a system where the government is not a parent, but a friend to the industry. We want to be seen as a facilitator to help the growth of the sector,"" Khare said."

MUMBAI :
Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) on Thursday affirmed Reliance Industries Limited's (RIL) Baa2 domestic long-term issuer rating and foreign currency senior unsecured rating.
Moody's also affirmed the Baa2 backed domestic currency senior unsecured debt ratings on the dollar-denominated bonds issued by Reliance Holding USA, Inc., with a guarantee from RIL. The outlook on the ratings above is stable.
""The rating affirmation reflects the significant improvement in RIL's scale and business mix over the last two years, as it reaps the benefits from its investments over the last five years in its hydrocarbon and consumer businesses,"" said Vikas Halan, a Moody's Senior Vice President.
Moody's added that the affirmation also incorporates its expectation that RIL's credit metrics will remain appropriate for its Baa2 ratings over the next 12-18 months, as the company has completed its investment cycle and will start reducing its borrowings through higher earnings.
Over the last five years, RIL has spent  ₹3.6 trillion on increasing its refinery complexity, expanding its petrochemical capacity, building its digital services business and expanding its retail business. In addition to the improved efficiency and scale of the legacy refining and petrochemical segments, RIL has also added highly resilient digital services and retail segments into its business mix.
RIL's Jamnagar refinery complexity increased to 21.1 as of March 2019 from 12.7 as of March 2018. It's petrochemical production also increased to 37.7 million tons for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2019 from 24.9 million tons for fiscal 2017. Meanwhile, Reliance Jio--RIL's digital business subsidiary has emerged as the second-largest telecommunications operator in India, with 355 million subscribers as of 30 September 2019.
Supported by these improvements, RIL's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) increased by 71.6% to Rs959 billion for fiscal 2019 from  ₹559 billion for fiscal 2017. The composition of Ebitda has also become more balanced between the hydrocarbon and consumer businesses. Moody's expects that by fiscal 2022, the hydrocarbon businesses will only account for about 50% of RIL's consolidated Ebitda.
Given the change in RIL's business mix, Moody's no longer views RIL as only an oil refining and marketing company but a mix of diverse businesses, it said.
""The affirmation of RIL's Baa2 ratings with a stable outlook at a time when India's Baa2 sovereign rating carries a negative outlook also reflects our view that RIL's ratings can be maintained one notch above the sovereign, even if the sovereign rating is downgraded to Baa3,"" added Halan, also Moody's Lead Analyst for RIL.
RIL's ratings will be constrained to no more than one notch above the sovereign rating, given the increase in RIL's dependence on the Indian economy through its consumer businesses, Moody's added."
70,2019-11-14,Reliance,"Indian telcos, which offer cheapest data, pay more for airwaves, a situation that has proved ruinous for manyEffectively, of every  ₹100 telcos receive from customers, the government gets  ₹30

NEW DELHI :
In levying taxes and in shearing sheep, it is well to stop when you get down to the skin"" said American author Austin O’Malley.
The aphorism pithily captures what Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman of Bharti Airtel Ltd, and other top executives of the Indian telecom industry have been trying to convey to the government in many ways.
Mittal, in fact, went to the extent of comparing the taxation on the sector to that of the tobacco industry, a target of high taxes because of its harmful impact on society.
“On the one hand, we have the prime minister’s vision of a digitally enabled India, which requires tremendous investments, and on the other, we keep spectrum prices very high, licence fee is high, spectrum charges are high and GST is at 18%, which is almost at the highest tax bracket. We cannot have these two competing positions in the industry,"" Mittal said at the India Mobile Congress in October last year.
Ironically, Indian telecom operators, which offer the cheapest mobile data services in the world, pay more for airwaves than any of their global counterparts, an unsustainable situation that has proved ruinous for many.
In addition, they pay 18% goods and services tax (GST) and also 3-5% of the adjusted gross revenue as spectrum usage charges and 8% as licence fee to the government.
Effectively, for every  ₹100 telcos receive from customers,  ₹30 go straight to the government’s coffers. If one were to include the high interest costs associated with the deferred spectrum liabilities owed to the government, the amount of revenues shared with the government would be of a higher order. In Vodafone Idea Ltd’s case, net interest costs accounted for 30% of revenue in the quarter ended 30 June.
With a significant share of its revenue going to the government in the form of levies and interest payments, it’s little wonder that the company hasn’t had enough left to cover its other costs, leave alone capital expenditure needs. In the June quarter, the firm’s pre-tax loss stood at as high as  ₹5,900 crore.
Vodafone Group Plc has now written off its investment in the India joint venture with the Birla group. “Financially, there’s been a heavy burden through unsupportive regulation and excessive taxes..."" the London-based company’s CEO Nick Read said about its India operations while announcing the September quarter earnings."
72,2019-11-14,Reliance,"On 24 October, SC directed telcos to pay at least  ₹92,000 crore in past dues to the govt within three monthsDoT’s letter comes about three weeks after SC rejected the definition of AGR proposed by telcos

The department of telecommunications has asked operators to conduct a self-assessment of dues after last month’s Supreme Court verdict upheld the government’s definition of adjusted gross revenue.
“It is the responsibility of licencees to pay licence fees and other dues after carrying out their own assessment as prescribed in the licence agreement. You are therefore directed to make the payment in accordance with the order of Supreme Court and submit requisite documents to ensure compliance within stipulated timeframe,"" DoT said in a 13 November letter to operators, a copy of which was reviewed by Mint. Self-assessment of dues will minimize the risk of mismatch in calculations. On 24 October, the court directed operators to pay at least  ₹92,000 crore in past dues to the government within three months.
The latest demand may spell more trouble for the telecom operators, which are struggling under a mountain of debt, declining revenues and widening losses. Further pressure on telcos to pay the dues may also hurt the investment climate in the country, and the forthcoming roll-out of 5G services.
Bharti Airtel Ltd’s dues are roughly  ₹21,682 crore, while Vodafone Idea Ltd will need to cough up at least  ₹28,309 crore. In contrast, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s dues are just  ₹13 crore.
DoT’s letter comes about three weeks after the top court rejected the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) proposed by the telecom operators that excluded revenue from non-core telecom operations such as rent, dividend and interest income, marking the end of a 14-year-long legal battle.
The tussle started when telecom operators migrated to a new revenue-sharing system offered by the government in 1999 under which they agreed to share a certain percentage of revenue with the government.
Operators had argued that AGR should comprise revenue from telecom services, but DoT insisted that it should include all revenue generated by an operator. Currently, telcos pay 3-6% and 8% of their AGR as spectrum usage charges and licence fee (including USOF), respectively.
Meanwhile, a committee of secretaries under the cabinet secretary is considering demands of telcos for relief and will suggest ways to alleviate their financial stress and create a favourable investment environment.
The government panel will also look into the demand of telcos for deferment of spectrum auction payment dues for 2020-21 and 2021-22 in order to ease cash flow as well as measures such as reducing levies, including spectrum usage charges and the USOF fee.

The stock plummeted 21.6% to  ₹2.90 a share. At 9.45am, the stock traded at  ₹3.02 on BSE, down 18.4% from its previous close.
Last month, the Supreme Court ordered Vodafone Idea to pay $4 billion of fees in past dues upholding a government definition of gross revenue, from which licence fee and spectrum payments made by telecom operators are calculated.
The troubled telecom company had a debt of around  ₹1 trillion as of June end. It reported a net loss for the fourth consecutive quarter in April-June, with over  ₹5,000 crore in losses. For fiscal 2019, the company had reported a loss of  ₹14,056 crore.
The company will report its September quarter earnings later today. According to 5 analyst estimates polled by Bloomberg, the company is expected to report a loss of  ₹4,387.60 crore, while revenue is seen at  ₹10,925.10 crore.

NEW DELHI :
 Reliance Jio on Friday said that delaying the implementation of zero call connect charges beyond January 2020 will hurt affordability of telecom services in a sector where users have benefited from free voice calls.
Reliance Jio Director Mahendra Nahata said that the ratio of incoming and outgoing call is now at par with each other and traffic asymmetry can, therefore, no longer be the reason to delay implementation of Bill and Keep (BAK) regime (that is zero mobile termination charge from January 1, 2020).
Traffic symmetry indicates that telecom operator will not have any outstanding balance of interconnect usage charges (IUC) against other networks.
Speaking at Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's (Trai) open house on IUC issue, Nahata said Airtel had expanded 4G network and Vodafone Idea too is talking about expanding their 4G network.
""We are not considering any profit or loss, but opposing it on the basis of principle. Criticising the decision of government or regulatory authorities from a distant location is beyond our understanding. Therefore, please take a decision after due diligence on all the points that we have raised,"" he said.
Nahata questioned data being shown by telecom operators and alleged that the subscriber traffic is being diverted to 2G, 3G network to show cost of voice is high.
Nahata said that in case Trai does not favour implementation of BAK regime from January 2020 then at least interconnect usage charges currently at 6 paise should be brought down.
""When you had implemented 6 paise charge, 4G traffic was one per cent. Today that traffic is much higher so the costs must have come down,"" he said.
A Vodafone Idea official said that consumers today have the option of moving to other networks through mobile number portability (MNP).
""Today customers have option of MNP and they can move to other network. It is wrong to say that any operator is holding back customers on 2G network,"" the official said, demanding that the mobile call termination charges should continue.
Airtel said that IUC should not come down to zero and the BAK regime should be postponed by at least three years.
Meanwhile, Bharti Airtel's Chief Regulatory Officer Ravi Gandhi rejected allegations of data fudging terming them as ""misplaced"" and said that people at times used the company's SIM into second slot of mobile phone which generally supports 2G or 3G network.
He said there are 40 crore consumers are on 2G network and they use low-cost feature phones. Shutting down 2G network will mean depriving such consumers of telecom services."

Debt-ridden Reliance Communications on Friday posted a consolidated loss of  ₹30,142 crore for July September 2019 due to provisioning for liabilities after the Supreme Court ruling on statutory dues.
The company, which is going through insolvency process, had made a profit of  ₹1,141 crore in the corresponding three months a year ago. During July-September 2019, the company set aside  ₹28,314 crore on account of provisioning following the Supreme Court order on calculation of annual adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of telecom companies. The apex court last month upheld the government's position on including revenue from non-telecommunication businesses in calculating the annual AGR, a share of which has to be paid as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer.
Total liability on telecom operators after the SC ruling is estimated to be around  ₹1.6 lakh crore, of which  ₹1.33 lakh crore due has to be paid by the companies that are operational. RCom's total liability includes  ₹23,327 crore licence fee and  ₹4.987 crore spectrum usage charges.
RCom and its subsidiaries did not provide interest of  ₹1,210 crore and foreign exchange variation of  ₹458 crore. ""Had the company provided interest and foreign exchange variation, the loss would have been higher by  ₹1,668 crore...for the quarter,"" RCom said.
Revenue from operations of RCom dipped to  ₹302 crore during the reported quarter from  ₹977 crore it recorded in the corresponding period of 2018-19. RCom shares closed at  ₹0.59 apiece, down by 3.28% compared to previous close, at BSE.

65,2019-11-16,Reliance,"Mobile tariffs are now under forbearance, which means operators have a free hand in fixing ratesIf a floor price is set, free services could be passé

The telecom regulator has not received any communication regarding the setting up of a floor price on voice or data services either from the department of telecommunications or the government panel looking into the revival of the sector.
“We have not received any reference,"" Telecom Regulatory Authority of India chairman R.S. Sharma told reporters on Friday.
At present, mobile tariffs are under forbearance, which means operators have a free hand in fixing rates—they only have to report tariff plans to Trai within seven days of the launch.
If a floor price is set, free services could be passé.
In 2017, after Reliance Jio entered the telecom space with free data and voice tariffs, existing telcos had approached the regulator to consider setting up a floor price as their revenue streams started shrinking. Back then, Trai had said a floor price “was not a workable idea"" and, subsequently, operators, too, were in agreement.
Sharma’s statement comes at a time when the sector is reeling under severe financial stress. The Centre has set up a committee to look into relief measures, such as reduction of levies and a moratorium on spectrum fees.
This panel will also examine the aspect of minimum charge (floor tariff) for voice and data services to ensure that the financial health of the sector remains robust and viable, Mint had reported on 29 October.
Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd have reported record losses for the September quarter, ravaged by a Supreme Court verdict that upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue, based on which it calculates the licence fees of telecom operators.
Vodafone Idea’s loss for the September quarter was at  ₹50,922 crore—the highest in India’s corporate history—as it set aside money to pay dues to the government following the court order. The loss is roughly five times the telecom operator’s consolidated revenue.
Airtel, too, reported its highest quarterly loss in 14 years, amid a brutal price war unleashed by Jio, which has reshaped India’s telecom market. The New Delhi-based operator swung to a  ₹23,045 crore loss in the quarter ended 30 September from a profit of  ₹118 crore in the year earlier."

NEW DELHI :
Essar Steel, Adani Group and state-owned GAIL have bought majority of natural gas from Reliance Industries' newer fields in the KG-D6 block at an indicative price of USD 5.04 - 5.16 per unit, industry sources said.
Essar Steel picked up 2.25 million standard cubic meters per day or about half of the available volumes in the day long auction conducted on November 15.
Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) picked up 1.2 mmscmd while Adani Group, Mahanagar Gas Ltd and GAIL bought 0.3 mmscmd each, sources said.
Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) bought 0.35 mmscmd and the remaining 0.10 mmscmd went to GSFC/GNFC.
Reliance and its partner BP Plc of the UK had sought bids from potential users for the 5 mmsmcd of natural gas they plan to produce from the R-Cluster Field in KG-D6 block from mid-2020.
Bidders were asked to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required. Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made.
Sources said Reliance had set a floor or minimum quote of 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price -- which meant that bidders had to quote 8.4 per cent or a higher percentage for seeking gas supplies.
In the November 15 auction, bidders quoted between 8.4 and 8.6 per cent slope to corner all of the 5 mmscmd supplies available. This translates into a price of between USD 5.04 per million British termal unit and USD 5.16 per mmBtu rate at Brent oil price of USD 60 per barrel.
Sources said while bankruptcy-hit Essar bought gas to feed its steel plants, other buyers including Adani Group picked up the volumes for their city gas operations of retailing CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households.
The volumes are mostly planned for usage in western India particularly in Gujarat where the gas can be delivered through a single pipeline - East-West pipeline. The delivered price in Gujarat is likely to be around USD 6.50 per mmBtu, they said.
Initially, Reliance had set a floor of 9 per cent of dated Brent price, which translated into a gas price of USD 5.4 per mmBtu at USD 60 oil price. But consumers saw this as a very high price considering that imported LNG in the spot market is available at around USD 4 per mmBtu rate currently.
To pacify the consumers, Reliance lowered the floor/minimum quote to 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price.
The company did not immediately respond to an email sent for comments.
According to the bid document, the gas price will be subject to the ceiling price mandated by the government. The ceiling price for gas from difficult fields such as those in deep-sea currently is USD 8.43 per mmBtu.
The government-mandated rate for other fields currently is $3.23 per mmBtu.
Reliance and BP are developing three sets of discoveries in KG-D6 block -- R-Cluster, Satellites, and MJ by 2022.
R-Cluster will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd while Satellites, which are supposed to begin output from mid-2021, would produce a maximum of 7 mmscmd. MJ field will start production in second half of 2022 and will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd.
Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block was put to production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block was put to production in September 2008.

60,2019-11-17,Reliance,"Airtel termed the CoC’s move to extend the bid submission deadline as ‘extremely unfair’ and ‘biased’Lenders have submitted claim of around  ₹49,000 crore in August

NEW DELHI :
Telecom operator Bharti Airtel has withdrawn its bid to purchase assets of Reliance Communications (RCom) after terming the move of committee of creditors to extend the bid submission deadline on the request of Reliance Jio as ""extremely unfair"" and ""biased"".
Without naming Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel Director (Finance) Harjeet Kohli in a letter to resolution professional Anish Niranjan Nanavaty said his company's request to extend the deadline was turned down by the committee of creditors (CoC) of RCom but surprisingly, the dates have been extended to accommodate submission by a bidder.
""Given the complexities involved in the proposed transaction, vide our letter dated October 31, 2019, we requested for an extension of time to submit the resolution plan from November 11, 2019, till December 1, 2019... Disappointingly, our request for extension was rejected by CoC,"" Kohli said.
Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel and private equity firm Varde Partners have already submitted their bids for assets of Reliance Communications, while Reliance Jio has sought extension of the asset sale deal deadline by another 10 days. Airtel has placed conditional bid to buy spectrum of RCom, while Bharti Infratel has submitted bids for mobile towers.
The CoC extended the deadline by 10 days and has decided to open bid now on November 25.
""To our utter shock, we have learnt that the CoC has now decided to extend the submission timeline to November 25, 2019, until 1200 hours, solely based on the request of another potential bidder,"" Kohli said.
He said that since Bharti Airtel's request was formally declined by the CoC, the company was constrained to submit the bids under due haste without the benefit of sufficient time to complete the resolution plan within the set deadline.
""We find this conduct, inequitable, questionable and against the spirit of what should be a highly transparent process. To say the least, it is extremely unfair and rather biased...we hereby formally withdraw our resolution plans while reserving all rights, including the right to submit our resolution plan afresh within the new deadline communicated now,"" Kohli said.
RCom tried to sell assets to various companies, including Reliance Jio, to clear debt but the deals did not crystallise. Reliance Jio cancelled agreement to buy RCom assets, including spectrum, as it did not want to bear the past liabilities of the debt-ridden firm.
Later, the insolvency proceedings against RCom started on a plea filed by Swedish telecom gear maker Ericsson after the company failed to clear its dues.
RCom Chairman Anil Ambani has tendered his resignation after the company posted a consolidated loss of  ₹30,142 crore for July-September 2019 due to provisioning for liabilities after the Supreme Court ruling on statutory dues.
This was the second-highest loss posted by any Indian corporate till date.
The National Company Law Tribunal has handed over the control of the company to an insolvency resolution professional.
Sources estimate that RCom Group's total secured debt is around  ₹33,000 crore. Lenders have submitted claim of around  ₹49,000 crore in August.
RCom has put its all assets for sale which include spectrum holding of 122 MHz that the company before insolvency proceedings estimated to be around  ₹14,000 crore, towers business for  ₹7,000 crore, optical fibre network  ₹3,000 crore and data centres worth  ₹4,000 crore.

59,2019-11-18,Reliance,"The deal will carve out the profitable airports business into a separate entity, which would then be demerged from the other non-airports businessesTo minimize reliance on the energy segment, GMR Infrastructure is divesting its stakes in some of the unviable assets

In its Q2 results media release, GMR Infrastructure Ltd said it has received all key regulatory approvals for Tata group, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd and Hong Kong-based SSG Capital Management Ltd to buy a 44.44% stake in GMR Airports Ltd. Clearance from the government (expected in a few weeks) is now critical to unlock value for shareholders who have borne the brunt of value erosion for over a decade.
The deal will carve out the profitable airports business into a separate entity, which would then be demerged from the other non-airports businesses. Note that the airports segment has churned out cash steadily in the last few quarters, and boosted GMR’s overall Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization). Airports have clocked 87% of the profit in Q2 FY20, when the overall Ebitda, at  ₹642.9 crore, was higher than analysts’ expectations.
In fact, the airports segment has proved its mettle by steadily churning out about 70% of the total revenue, and 90% of operating profits over several quarters.
A report by Edelweiss Securities Ltd said: “GMR has ~50% market share in the airports developed by the private sector in India since the turn of the millennium."" Strong traffic growth in its key airports of Delhi and Hyderabad have helped maintain Ebitda margin at above 50% for the last several quarters.
Even so, the company is battling problems of weak plant load factor on account of fuel linkage issues in the energy segment. With losses mounting at the operating level, the energy segment recorded a net loss of  ₹114 crore in Q2 FY20.
To minimize reliance on the energy segment, GMR Infrastructure is divesting its stakes in some of the unviable assets. This should shore up overall profitability in the coming quarters.
In Q2 FY20, the firm’s consolidated net revenue at  ₹1,527 crore was in line with Bloomberg’s consensus estimate, albeit just 4% higher than the year-ago period. With costs reined in, the overall Ebitda margin jumped from 36% a year ago to 42%. However, higher interest charges have been the bane of the infrastructure sector. The quarter’s interest outflow at  ₹827 crore jumped 22% year-on-year.
As a result, net loss for the September quarter deepened from  ₹334 crore in the year-ago period to  ₹457 crore, and was worse than what the Street had pencilled in.
Yet, the stock was rock steady on the bourses. Investors are perhaps hanging on to the hope that they would gain in the final run from the demerger of the airports business, where skies are clear on the growth prospects. “Regulatory upsides in existing airports, new airport wins in India and asset monetisation will be key stock drivers,"" said the Edelweiss report. The proposed Tata-led consortium will help GMR Airports repay  ₹1,000 crore debt, besides retiring  ₹7,000 crore of parent corporate debt."

NEW DELHI :
The Walt Disney Co. India has signed a record 67 brands as sponsors for its upcoming animated musical fantasy Frozen 2 that hits screens this Friday. This is the highest number for an animation flick in the country till date.
The range of consumer products includes partnerships with brands like toy retailer Hamleys, fashion brands Max and Reliance Trends, clothing chain Pantaloons and e-commerce company Flipkart.
“Frozen merchandise has been one of the top-selling products for us and is enjoyed all year round,"" said Sanjeet Mehta, executive director and head, consumer products, Disney India. “On the occasion of the movie’s release, we will be launching an all-new range of Frozen inspired products to celebrate the love young fans have towards the franchise and give them an opportunity to take home a piece of their favourite character.""

51,2019-11-19,Reliance,"Move signals an end to three-year-long price war that upended the sectorThe news of the tariff hike catapulted Bharti Airtel to the top of the gainers in the Sensex on Tuesday

New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, India’s only profitable telecom company, unexpectedly said it will join rivals Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd in raising tariffs, indicating that a three-year-long price war that unleashed an unprecedented consolidation in the industry is nearing an end.
The Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Jio will “take measures including appropriate increase in tariffs in the next few weeks in a manner that does not adversely impact data consumption or growth in digital adoption and sustains investments,"" the company said on Tuesday.
If Reliance Jio indeed raises tariffs, it will provide much-needed relief for rivals Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, which have reported record losses in the September quarter. If the truce sustains, it will also mark the end of the bloodiest chapter in India’s telecom history that saw units of large Indian conglomerates as well as overseas telcos, including UAE’s Etisalat, Japan’s Docomo and Norway’s Telenor shutting shop or selling their India businesses.
“Much will depend on the quantum of price hikes but this is a welcome step given that the companies needed to boost their revenues,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm Com First India.
Separately, a spokesperson for Reliance Jio said the company will hike tariffs in compliance with any regulatory action that sets a price floor on services of telecom operators. He was referring to media reports that the government plans to introduce a floor price for telecom tariffs to prevent predatory pricing.
In a statement directed at its rivals who still operate 2G networks, Reliance Jio called upon the government and the regulator to mandate a ‘2G-mukt’ policy to achieve the objectives of Digital India. Reliance Jio is the only operator in the country to have a pan-India 4G network. ‘
Others operate a mix of 2G, 3G and 4G services.
Airtel and Vodafone Idea had on Monday said they would hike tariffs of their services from 1 December. The tariff hike will come after a decade-long period of hyper competition and adverse regulatory orders. The news of the tariff hike catapulted Bharti Airtel to the top of the gainers in the S&P BSE Sensex on Tuesday. The shares climbed 7.4% to close the session at  ₹439.25.
Similarly, Vodafone Idea’s market cap climbed by more than a third as its share rose 34.7% to  ₹6.02 on BSE.
“Ahead-of-the-event press releases, without specifics, on price increases is a first-of-its-kind development in the sector, if our memory serves us right,"" an earlier Mint story earlier cited analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities as saying in a note to its clients.
Jio’s surprise move adds an interesting twist in the saga that has only seen it setting the agenda for the industry right from the day of its launch in 2016.
Bundling of unlimited free voice services with very cheap data prices had then forced established rivals like Airtel and Vodafone Idea to match tariffs, leading to a deterioration in their finances.
A price hike had come to be an “unheard-of event"" in an industry that has seen unrelenting competition and had at one point more than a dozen operators in the country.
Dealing a severe blow to older telecom operators, the Supreme Court on 24 October directed them to pay at least  ₹92,000 crore in past dues to the government within three months.
Many of these companies have shut shop following the bruising price war unleashed by the deep-pocketed Reliance Jio.
The verdict upheld the government’s definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) which included revenue from non-core telecom operations such as rent, dividend and interest income, marking the end of a 14-year-long legal battle.
“Nobody asked them to take the tariffs to ridiculously low levels. They must have realized this was unsustainable. It’s a good sign in the interest of the sectors as consumers need the companies to survive as much as the companies need the consumers,"" a senior official at Telecom Regulatory Authority of India said."
50,2019-11-19,Reliance,"Tariff hikes may not be enough for older telecom operators to overcome their financial woes. But, with 5G on its way, sensible policies could work in favour of the whole market

Indian telecom companies have decided to raise tariffs after a particularly challenging phase of flux that saw disruptive technological change, intense competition, and bitter disputes over policy compliance. A glaring sign of the funk that much of this sector finds itself in was the eye-popping losses posted by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea for the last quarter, with little clarity on how they will pay their accumulated dues to the Union exchequer—yes, the large sums arrived at by a widened definition of the “revenues"" that telecom operators must share with the government. 
The concerted price response by Airtel and Vodafone Idea may be a bid to stay afloat, but it is also the kind of market behaviour that regulators are wont to frown upon. Late on Tuesday, Reliance Jio also said it will raise tariffs. In a field of just three major players, the former two are arrayed on the wrong side of technology; Jio uses superior systems to offer calls and data at throwaway rates. Varying network technologies seem to have caused cost differentials that are likely to result in industry consolidation, and the government, as an assurer of market efficiency, will have to step in at some point. It’s clear that survival in telecom requires every operator to adapt to disruptive technology and policy settings without losing consumer orientation. It’s not easy.
So what are the lessons from the latest telecom crisis? First, the government must price spectrum sensibly. It needs to lower its reliance on the sale of radio frequencies to plug its fiscal gaps. These receipts filter through the industry to the consumer; if they don’t, they balloon as losses somewhere along the value chain, and investors get lumped with the tab. Second, don’t put a price on a permit. A licence comes with a set of obligations; a holder must provide services of acceptable quality to telecom subscribers, for example. Licence fees, however, provide no signals that could adjust demand and supply. That’s the job of airwaves, the main resource that operators depend on, and this can be done well so long as they are priced correctly through auctions. Finally, don’t thwart technology. Telecom companies are always keen on the efficiencies of modern advancements, and policymakers need to be alive to factors holding back their adoption.
The policy environment is vital as India begins preparations for adopting fifth generation (5G) cellular technology that can carry data at a tenth of the cost that current 4G networks do. Ericsson, a telecom equipment maker that has tested the technology in the country, estimates the business potential of 5G-enabled digitalization in India by 2026 at $27 billion, as the country adds every fourth new subscriber in the world. A government committee sees a $1 trillion economic impact of 5G by 2035 once stuff like Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and augmented reality gets going. Gigabit-speed networks that give rise to various new ways to use the internet could significantly alter the nature of telecom regulation; 5G architecture is radically different from existing networks, and would call for considerable investment by cellular operators as they go about setting up their grids. Airtel and Vodafone Idea have indicated that the price floor set by the government for 5G spectrum is beyond their reach. If they are forced to sell assets or take on fresh debt to pay the sums demanded by the government, their ability to join the upcoming auctions could diminish further. That would leave India’s telecom market in worse shape."

The registration of Reliance Capital Pension Fund under National Pension Scheme (NPS) has been cancelled following a request by the company, pension fund regulator PFRDA said. Reliance Capital Pension is no longer available for subscription under NPS, said PFRDA. It was one of the eight companies registered under NPS to manage funds for subscribers for the private sector.
Earlier this year, the company had surrendered its NPS licence.
""This is to inform to general public that based on the request received from Reliance Capital Pension Fund Ltd, the certificate of registration granted to Reliance Capital Pension Fund Ltd has been cancelled by the Authority and the pension fund is no longer available for subscription under NPS,"" PFRDA said in a notification dated 15th November.
The other seven funds for private sector subscribers are HDFC Pension Management Co, ICICI Prudential Pension Fund Management Co, Kotak Mahindra Pension Fund, LIC Pension Fund, SBI Pension Funds, UTI Retirement Solutions, and Birla Sunlife Pension Management.
NPS, which was initially introduced for government employees, was later thrown open to all citizens of the country, including unorganised sector workers. Recently, PFRDA permitted Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) to enroll in NPS at par with Non-Resident Indians (NRIs).
The contributions made towards the NPS are eligible for an additional tax deduction under section 80CCD (1B) up to  ₹50,000 which is over and above the  ₹1,50,000 limit of deduction available under sec 80CCD (1).
In the Union Budget 2019, the tax exemption limit for lumpsum withdrawal on exit/maturity from the NPS was increased from the present 40% to 60% under Section 10 (12A) of the IT Act and the remaining 40% of the corpus is already tax-exempt as it is mandatorily utilized for annuity purchase.
PFRDA runs two pension schemes - NPS and Atal Pension Yojana. The former caters to the government and organised sector employees, the latter is mainly for the workers in the unorganised sector.
As on October 26, 2019, the total number of subscribers under the NPS and Atal Pension Yojana has crossed 3.18 crore. The asset under management (AUM) stands at  ₹3,79,758 crore."

55,2019-11-19,Reliance,"Even if the three operators raise tariffs by only 10%, losses in the industry will reduce significantlyApart from better tariffs, telcos also need a breather on the debt front, and clarity on that as well

Mumbai: Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd have added about $5.5 billion and $1.25 billion, respectively, to their market capitalization in the past three trading sessions alone.
Just last week, they reported record losses and it seemed like at least one of these companies was staring at the end. Evidently, things have gotten so bad for the industry that help from the government has become increasingly certain.
But it looks like telcos have been asked to help themselves before the government can. Before news of any relief package, Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and surprisingly, even Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, have announced that they will raise tariffs within the next few weeks.
For Reliance Jio, which has become the market leader thanks to aggressive, price-based competition, a truce over tariffs seems uncharacteristic.
Besides, being the only telco to report profits in recent quarters, it has suggested in the past that there is no pressing need for it to raise tariffs. “There are evidently bigger forces at play,"" said an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm on condition of anonymity.
The transformation in the industry is striking. In the past, the incumbents and Reliance Jio have dragged each other to the Competition Commission of India, citing anticompetitive practices. Their latest decision to hike tariffs in tandem may raise anticompetition issues of a new order.
But given the dire straits the industry is in, and given the hole this was expected to cause in the government’s finances, anticompetition issues aren’t exactly at the top of anyone’s mind.
“After years of wealth destruction, the industry will now be headed in the right direction,"" said the analyst quoted above. “I would be surprised if the tariff hikes being talked about will be anything less than 20%,"" he added.
In Vodafone Idea’s case, this means that its Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) loss of  ₹2,962 crore in Q2 can reduce by about 64%, while for Bharti Airtel, instead of an Ebit loss of  ₹1,145 crore in its India mobile services division, there would be a profit of around  ₹750 crore instead. Quarterly revenues in both cases are around  ₹11,000 crore.
If tariffs and revenues increase by a much lower 10% even, losses would fall by 32% and 83%, respectively, for Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel’s India mobile division.
It’s little wonder investors are so excited.
But if Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea gain so much by raising tariffs, why wait until December?
“It looks like the incumbents want greater clarity from the telecom regulator on the official view on pricing and about the extension of the interconnection usage charges regime, which works effectively as a floor on voice tariffs,"" says the analyst quoted above.
Besides, apart from better tariffs, telcos also need a breather on the debt front, and need clarity from the government on that front as well."
49,2019-11-20,Reliance,"Reliance’s shares have increased at three times the pace of India’s benchmark index this yearSurge in shares gives Ambani a net worth of $56 billion, making him Asia’s richest person, above Jack Ma

New Delhi: Reliance Industries Ltd., run by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, has eclipsed BP Plc to break into an elite club of energy supermajors.
The Indian conglomerate’s market capitalization was about $133 billion, overtaking the British energy giant’s $132 billion value at the close of trading on Tuesday. Reliance’s shares have increased at three times the pace of India’s benchmark index this year after its billionaire owner in August announced plans to cut the company’s net debt to zero in 18 months through measures including a stake sale in the oil-to-chemicals business to Saudi Aramco.
The surge in shares gives Ambani a net worth of $56 billion, making him Asia’s richest person, above Alibaba Group’s Jack Ma, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Reliance’s market value briefly surpassed BP for the first time at the end of last month, and it has now regained the lead over the British company after its shares ended at a record high in Mumbai. It also narrowing the gap with PetroChina Co., currently Asia’s biggest oil company by market cap.
Reliance has increased 35% this year, compared with BP’s 1.2% gain as it works on cutting high debt levels. Oil companies have struggled because of swings in crude prices and as uncertainty persists over future energy demand.
Reliance, meanwhile, has benefited in a number of ways. It operates the world’s biggest oil-refining complex in western India, which can process low-quality crude and turn it into higher-grade fuels, partly protecting it from volatility in prices.
Telecom, Retail
While Reliance gets two-third of its revenue from energy, Ambani has also made massive investments in telecom and digital services as he looks to benefit from growing demand in the world’s second-biggest market for mobile phone users. He has also expanded the company’s retail business to take on Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.
The telecom unit, Reliance Jio, which claims to be world’s largest mobile data network, was also bolstered by a recent blow to India’s wireless carriers that left Ambani’s company largely unscathed.
Reliance is now the world’s sixth-largest oil company, with Exxon Mobil Corp. topping the list with a market value of about $290 billion. Aramco, formally known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., is planning an initial public offering with a valuation target of between $1.6 trillion and $1.7 trillion, which would make it the world’s biggest.

NEW DELHI :
The market valuation of Reliance Industries, the country's most valued firm, is fast nearing the  ₹10 lakh crore mark helped by continuous rise in its share price.

45,2019-11-20,Reliance,"While this could mark the long-awaited beginning of price recovery for telecom firms, the extent of gains could be decided by the quantum of hike and govt reliefThe move does not materially change price targets, unless the hike is significantly above 20%

NEW DELHI :
Following in the footsteps of Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, which will hike the mobile tariffs on 1 December, Reliance Jio too on Tuesday said it would hike tariffs in ‘next few weeks’. While this could mark the long-awaited beginning of price recovery for telecom companies, the extent of gains could be decided by the quantum of hike and government relief.
Is the hike sustainable?
According to equity research analysts at Jefferies Financial Group, “The tariff hikes are positive, in our view, and come five months ahead of our expectation. However, the move does not materially change our price targets, unless the hike is significantly above 20%. Our estimates currently factor in a 20% hike in early FY21.""
Besides tariff hike, government relief for the ailing telecom sector is also important. The sector has been reeling under stress due to intense competition, adverse regulatory and judicial orders.
The last nail in the coffin of the beleaguered industry was the 24 October SC judgement that imposed a penalty of at least Rs92,000 crore on the operators, many of whom have also since folded up. The verdict upheld the government’s definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) which included revenue from non-core telecom operations such as rent, dividend and interest income, marking the end of a 14-year-long legal battle.
A committee of secretaries under the cabinet secretary is considering demand of telecom companies for relief and will suggest ways to alleviate their financial stress and create a favourable investment climate.
“Despite the tariff hike, we think relief from the government on AGR dues and other measures remain important for the incumbents, especially for Vodafone Idea. We expect the government to put a moratorium on AGR and spectrum dues for the next two years, aiding cash flows. A reduction in license fee and an extension of Interconnection Usage Charges (IUC) is also likely,"" Jefferies added.
Should you buy?
The telecom stocks have rallied sharply in the last few days, and analysts expect the positive momentum to continue in the near-term. Vodafone Idea stock has more than doubled this month to  ₹7.07 from its 30-day low of  ₹2.61.
Goldman Sachs recommends ‘buy’ for shares of Bharti Airtel with a target price of  ₹415. Bharti Airtel has surged over 34% to  ₹437.25 from its 30-day low of 325.60 in the last month.
“Despite recent outperformance, we reiterate our buy rating on Bharti, as we believe a sustained tariff hike, market share gains and government relief will help business momentum. Given sector stress and government focus, we expect the tariff hike to be sustained for the next few months. We consider Vodafone Idea to be the biggest beneficiary, but overhang from the AGR case still puts a question on long-term recovery,"" say analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Mogran Stanley has raised the price target for Bharti Airtel to  ₹410 from  ₹360 per share."

Providing relief to telecom companies, the Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a moratorium of two years for spectrum payments, sources said.
The move to defer payments for 2020-21 and 2021-22 will give  ₹42,000 crore relief to Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio, they said.

NEW DELHI :
The Union cabinet on Wednesday gave beleaguered telecom operators Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd a breather by allowing them to defer payments for spectrum purchases by up to two years.
The move to defer payments for 2020-21 and 2021-22 will be a relief to these companies while helping Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd as well. It follows the Supreme Court’s 24 October ruling that directed older telecom firms to pay at least  ₹92,000 crore in past dues to the government within three months.
“Department of Telecommunication will give an option to the Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) to defer payment of the spectrum auction instalments due for 2020-21 & 2021-22, either for one or both years. These deferred amounts bill be spread equally in the remaining instalments to be paid by TSPs. Interest as stipulated while auctioning of the concerned spectrum will however be charged so that NPV (net present value) is protected,"" the government said.
Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel suffered record losses in the September quarter, hit by the apex court’s ruling that upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue on which it calculates levies on telecom operators. Bundling of unlimited free voice services with very cheap data prices by Reliance Jio had forced Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea to match tariffs, leading to an erosion in earnings.
“The decision for deferring spectrum payment instalments for two years will be implemented within a fortnight. Amendment to the license shall be issued expeditiously with the approval of hon’ble minister of communications,"" the government statement added.
This also comes at a time when Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio are raising tariffs, indicating that a three-year-long price war that led to an unprecedented industry consolidation is nearing an end.
“Deferment of spectrum auction instalments will ease the cash outflow of the stressed TSPs and facilitate payment of statutory liabilities and interest on bank loans. Continued operation by TSPs will give a fillip to employment and economic growth. Improved financial health of TSPs will facilitate maintenance of quality of services to consumer,"" the statement said."
42,2019-11-21,Reliance,"Spectrum and licence fee constitute a significant part of telcos’ costsMoratorium on telcos’ spectrum instalments and tariff hikes will help improve cash flows

Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd tumbled 2-6% on Thursday despite the government giving telecom operators the option to defer payment of spectrum dues by two fiscal years. The fall is in contrast to the gains the stocks had made earlier this week when private operators including Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd announced plans to raise tariffs.
Deferment of spectrum payment dues will bring a reprieve for the troubled telcos. In the September quarter, licence fee and spectrum usage charges for Vodafone Idea was  ₹1,114 crore, amounting to 37% of its operating loss, or earnings before interest and taxes. For Bharti Airtel, licence fee, revenue share and spectrum charges amounted to  ₹1,325 crore, while operating loss was at  ₹1,144 crore.

The waiver, combined with the proposed tariff hikes, is sure to improve cash flows at the companies. Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd estimate the move will provide an annual cash flow relief of about  ₹12,000 crore for Vodafone Idea and  ₹8,300 crore for Bharti Airtel.
Much of this, though, seems to have been captured in the recent rally in share prices of these companies. Given the dire state of some telcos, the Street was expecting bigger relief measures. “The measures were slightly lower than expected. There was consideration of lowering interest rates, which has not been incorporated. We expect further relief measures from the government even with the price hike in December; Vodafone Idea will need support, especially around aggregate gross revenue (AGR) dues payment,"" the analysts said.
Importantly, analysts fear the financial situation of the troubled telcos may not see sustained improvement. The government will have to provide significant relief on the dues arising out of the recent Supreme Court verdict on spectrum and licence fee dues, or the way AGR is calculated. Worryingly, the government’s provisional estimates of AGR dues are substantially higher than the calculations of telecom companies. The government told the Parliament there was no proposal under consideration to waive penalties, implying no immediate relief.
While the Street expects relief measures on AGR, any delay or piecemeal measures will adversely impact the telcos’ ability to invest in network upgradation and prolong the indebtedness. This will adversely impact the narrative on recovery of the telcos. “To our understanding, the department of telecom can possibly decide to either waive off penalties and interest on penalties entirely, and/or allow for staggered payments. However, without any AGR payout relief, the ability of telcos to invest in networks will remain challenged and even raise concerns on the market structure,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note.
Considering the pain in the telecom sector, the relief over spectrum instalments was warranted. But it is clear that telcos need more to stop the bleeding, and for their stocks to see light again."

NEW DELHI :
Sony Corp. is in talks to acquire a stake in the Indian television network controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, as the Japanese giant seeks to tap booming demand for content in the South Asian nation, according to people familiar with the matter.
The Tokyo-based company is currently conducting due diligence on Ambani’s Network18 Media and Investments Ltd before any possible offer, the people said, asking not to be named as the information is not public.
Sony is considering several potential deal structures, including a bid for the company or a merger of its own Indian business with Network18’s entertainment channels, one of the people said.
Talks are at a preliminary stage and may not result in a transaction, the people said. Shares of Network18 surged as much as 19% in Mumbai on Thursday, while unit TV18 Broadcast Ltd jumped 9.7%.
While a successful deal may help Sony bolster its local offerings and take on upstart rivals such as Netflix Inc., it will give Ambani access to international content. The Indian tycoon’s wireless carrier, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, has spent almost $50 billion in the past few years on its network to disrupt India’s telecommunications industry and has been luring users by offering local and overseas programming.
“Our company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis,"" a spokesman for Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd, said in an email, declining to comment further. Representatives for Sony in India and Japan didn’t immediately respond to requests for comments.
The talks come at a time when competition is heating up for paying viewers in a potentially lucrative market with more than half a billion smartphone users.
Streaming companies such as Netflix to Amazon.com Inc. Prime are increasingly offering programs created locally to lure subscribers. Ambani’s Jio, while having the technology platform, is limited by the paucity of content it can stream, making such a deal with Sony crucial

Mumbai: Shares of Reliance Naval and Engineering Ltd, an Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group company, have jumped nearly 1000% in the last eleven weeks even as the company has continued to post losses and faces cash crunch.
Shares traded at  ₹7.25 today on the National Stock Exchange, having hit a record low of  ₹0.70 on 11 September. However, since then the stock hit the 5% upper circuit for 51 consecutive trading sessions. The scrip advanced 995% during the period, while shares are down nearly 45% so far this year.
The company has reported losses for 14 consecutive quarters, while consolidated gross debt stood at  ₹10916.15 crore as of end of fiscal 2019.
During the financial year 2018-19, the company reported aggregate revenue of about  ₹184.63 crore against  ₹413.84 crore in the previous year and incurred a loss of  ₹10,481.04 crore compared with a loss of  ₹956.08 crore in the previous year
Recently, the company in its annual report disclosed that it was facing an acute crunch in cash flow due to orders having dried up.
""The Company is also facing several challenges which are impacting its operations. There is an acute cash flow crunch as the expected Debt Resolution is yet to be actualized. This is impacting the progress of the existing projects leading to extended timelines and thereby leading to erosion of confidence amongst clients,"" the company said in its 2019 annual report. ""This lack of new orders has led to the significant reduction in the Company’s current level of operations as compared to its capacity.""
IDBI Bank had filed an application in 2018 to initiate insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings against the company.
The company, earlier known as Pipavav Defence & Offshore Engineering, has been facing severe financial headwinds since 2013. It was bought over by Anil Ambani group in 2016 and renamed Reliance Defence and Engineering."

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd on Monday submitted bids for assets of bankrupt Reliance Communications Ltd and its two units, two people aware of the matter said.
Monday was the last day for submitting bids, 10 days after insolvency resolution professional Anish Niranjan Nanavaty of Deloitte India extended the previous deadline.
Airtel and Bharti Infratel, which had earlier bid together for RCom, are likely to have bid jointly again. That bid was withdrawn in protest against the deadline extension made on the request of Reliance Jio.
Spokespersons for Airtel and Reliance Jio declined to comment on the bids.
The Economic Times also named private equity (PE) investors I Squared Capital, Varde Partners and UV Asset Reconstruction Co. Ltd as bidding, but this could not be confirmed.
“We are bound by confidentiality obligations and are unable to comment on client-specific matters,"" a Deloitte India spokesperson said in an email to Mint.
China Development Bank, Life Insurance Corp. of India, State Bank of India, Exim Bank of China and Bank of Baroda are among the 41 creditors to the beleaguered Anil Ambani group company.
According to information available on the company’s website, it owed financial creditors  ₹49,193.46 crore at the time of being taken to bankruptcy court in May last year.
The company’s subsidiaries are Reliance Telecom Ltd and Reliance Infratel Ltd. They owe financial creditors  ₹24,306.27 crore and  ₹12,687.65 crore, respectively. Reliance Communications thus owes debtors  ₹86,187.58 crore at a consolidated level. This is besides  ₹28,837 crore it owes to the department of telecommunications (DoT) in spectrum dues and other charges as well as the amounts it has to pay its operational creditors.
Reliance Communications’ assets include spectrum, towers, fibre, data centres and real estate housed under its subsidiaries Reliance Telecom and Reliance Infratel.
Reliance Jio, promoted by Anil’s elder brother Mukesh Ambani, had last year agreed to buy the assets of Reliance Communications that included its spectrum, 43,000 telecom towers and 178,000 route km of optic fibre. The deal failed to secure the requisite clearance from the DoT.
The resolution professional had on 13 November received bids from firms including the Airtel-Bharti Infratel combine and PE firm Varde Partners.
Anil Ambani had on 16 November, along with four other directors, resigned from the company. But the lenders rejected the resignations on Sunday, requesting Ambani and the other officials to cooperate in the ongoing insolvency resolution proceedings.
The company had pioneered CDMA services in the country when Mukesh Ambani ran it, before he handed it to younger brother Anil after the two brothers split family assets under a 2005 agreement. As its fortunes dwindled and cut-throat competition eroded margins in the sector, the company considered selling its assets, a process more than five years in the making. The entry of Reliance Jio in 2016, which came with free voice services bundled with ultra cheap data, sounded the death knell for the company.
The company, unable to bear the onslaught of Jio, shut its mobile voice operations in December 2017, then choosing to offer only data services.
Reliance Communications, once part of the National Stock Exchange’s Nifty index, is now reduced to a penny stock. It shot up 6.7% on Monday to close the session at 80 paise, spurred by reports of various firms showing interest in its assets."

Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities attributed the record run in Indian markets to buying from FIIs since last couple of weeks and cooling down of global worries on the trade tariff front. Domestic news flow is shaping up positively, he added. The government has in recent months a slew of measures to boost economy including corporate tax rate cut and stimulus for the crucial real estate sector.

If you invest  ₹12,500 a month for 20 years, you can expect to have more than  ₹1.2 crore in your portfolio by the end of your tenure (assuming 12% CAGR portfolio returns over the period). You have an aggressive, all-equity portfolio with one large-cap fund, one value-oriented diversified fund, one multi-cap fund, and two small- and mid-cap funds. The fund choices are a mixed bag in terms of quality and track record. I would recommend a shuffle of funds in this manner—you can replace the L&T fund with the L&T Midcap fund from the same fund house. Instead of SBI Bluechip fund and HDFC Small Cap fund, you can go with HDFC Top 100 fund and SBI Small Cap fund respectively. The ABSL fund can be replaced with a multi-cap fund from the same fund house—the ABSL Equity fund. Once you do these changes, you will have a similarly aggressive portfolio as you do presently, but in a set of funds that have had better track records of performance and consistency.
I started investing in Reliance ELSS (equity-linked savings scheme) in 2016. It has run into loss throughout this three-year period and now has been taken over by Nippon Insurance.

SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd, the credit card unit of the country’s largest lender, on Wednesday, filed initial share sale documents that could see the company sell shares worth around  ₹9,600 crore.
The share sale is poised to become the fifth-largest IPO in the country after Coal India Ltd, Reliance Power Ltd, GIC Re, and Oil and Natural Gas Corp and will help parent State Bank of India (SBI) raise funds to boost credit growth.
SBI, which holds 74% stake in the unit, along with private equity firm Carlyle Group, which holds the rest 26% through its subsidiary CA Rover Holdings, will together sell 130.5 million shares through the IPO.
“The secondary component of the IPO could be  ₹9,100 crore and will give a partial exit to both its shareholders. While Carlyle is looking to sell 10% stake via the IPO, SBI would sell 4% stake in the company,"" two people aware of the matter said, requesting anonymity.
The company is looking to list within the next 3-4 months at a pre-money valuation of  ₹65,000 crore, one of the two people said.
The initial share sale also includes a fresh issue of shares that will see the company raise  ₹500 crore to augment its capital base and for business growth.
“The secondary markets have seen bit of a recovery and that has also spurred some activity in the IPO market. But the positive response is still restricted to good quality companies that have a retail consumer franchise. Many small-cap companies are still finding it tough to get the desired pricing. That said, in the past nine months, the sentiment was really negative and IPO activity was consequently very slow, but it is likely to see some pickup in the coming quarters,"" said Mukund Ranganathan, executive director at Motilal Oswal Investment Banking.
The book running lead merchants to the issue are Axis Capital, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC, Nomura, Kotak Mahindra Capital and SBI Capital.
SBI Cards is the second-largest credit card issuer in the country with 9.46 million credit cards, and had a 18% share of the Indian credit card market as on 30 September. The company started operations in 1998 as a joint venture with GE Capital Corp. In December 2017, GE Capital sold its 40% stake in the company to SBI and Carlyle.
HDFC Bank has the largest credit cards business in the country with 13.3 million cards issued, while ICICI Bank stood third with 7.9 million credit cards, as of 30 September, according to data from the Reserve Bank of India.

28,2019-11-27,Reliance,"The floor price was among key issues flagged by the industry representatives at a meeting today to chalk out the regulatory agenda for 2020Any fresh move on floor prices does not make sense, given that operators have already announced plans to hike tariffs in coming days, experts said

NEW DELHI :
With large telecom operators planning a rate hike in coming days, Trai is unlikely to make an immediate intervention on tariff issues, including fixation of any floor price as of now, people familiar with the matter said
People aware of Trai's views on the issue said that making any fresh move on floor prices or intervention does not make sense at this point, given that operators have already announced plans to hike tariffs in coming days.
The sources told PTI that any move by Trai now may ""derail"" the process which has been initiated at the operators' end. The regulator considers intervention to be the ""last resort"".
As operators have already announced that they will increase tariffs, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) will wait to see how the entire situation unfolds.
The floor price was among key issues flagged by the industry representatives at a crucial meeting held at Trai on Wednesday to chalk out the regulatory agenda for 2020. A section of the industry wanted a regulatory intervention by Trai on the tariff issue, the sources said.
According to industry sources, older operators attending the meeting told Trai that tariffs may require a ""regulatory intervention"" as the sector faces excessive competition which makes it difficult for players to raise prices of mobile services. Hence, they felt that a regulatory intervention will be desirable and that fixing floor price on tariffs by Trai would be a more effective mechanism.
However, they said, there is no decision in Trai on floor price as of now, and any call on the issue will be taken only at a later date. The regulator is in the process of finalising its agenda for 2020, and 6-7 issues are expected to be taken up in the coming year.
Issues that have been flagged by the industry for inclusion in Trai's 2020 agenda are tariff floor price, redefinition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) and infrastructure sharing, among others.
It is pertinent to mention here that telecom operators have announced plans to hike rates in the coming days, although they have not indicated just how much the tariffs will increase. On November 18, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea announced a hike in mobile phone call and data charges from December saying the increase was warranted for viability of their business.
The following day, billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio said it will increase mobile phone call and data charges in the next few weeks in compliance with rules.
Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other telecom operators have to pay  ₹1.47 lakh crore in outstanding statutory dues following a Supreme Court order on October 24 that upheld the government's position on including revenue from non-core businesses in calculating the annual AGR of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fees to the exchequer.
In the case of Bharti Airtel, the liabilities added up to nearly  ₹35,586 crore, of which  ₹21,682 crore is licence fee and another  ₹13,904.01 crore is the SUC dues (not including the dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices). For Vodafone Idea, this number stands at a cumulative  ₹53,038 crore, including  ₹24,729 crore of SUC dues and  ₹28,309 crore in licence fee.
The government, last week, threw a  ₹42,000 crore lifeline to debt-laden telecom companies after it agreed not to take any payments for spectrum they use for the next two years. It has, however, expressed unwillingness to intervene in the Supreme Court-mandated statutory payments. It wants operators to make combined efforts to relieve the stress, including raising voice calls and data tariffs."
21,2019-11-28,Reliance,"Speculation about a sale comes a week after reports said Sony Corp. was in talks to buy Network18’s entertainment unitA statement from the company’s legal department said the Bloomberg report was ‘false and malicious’

Media and entertainment conglomerate Network18 Media and Investments Ltd has denied reports of a sale of its news assets to The Times Group.
A statement from the company’s legal department said the Bloomberg report was ‘false and malicious’. An email query to the Times Group remained unanswered.
The Bloomberg report said Bennett Coleman and Co., or Times Group, is looking to hire advisers for due diligence on the news properties of the Mukesh Ambani-owned company, where options range from an outright exit to a stake sale. Talks, however, may not translate into a deal, as more suitors may emerge, it added.
The report about a possible sale of Network18’s news assets came a week after media reports said that Japanese conglomerate Sony Corp. was looking to buy the former’s entertainment division, which includes movie, music and comedy channels.
Bloomberg had reported that the Tokyo-based company was in the process of carrying out due diligence on Network18 Media and Investments Ltd before making an offer. Sony was said to be considering several deal structures, including a bid for the company or a merger of its Indian business with Network18’s entertainment channels, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity.
The move was said to be driven by Sony’s ambitions to tap into the growing demand for content in the south Asian market and to take on rivals such as streaming platform Netflix, while giving Ambani’s company access to international content.
Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has spent almost $50 billion on its network to disrupt and change India’s telecom industry with cheap data packs and has been luring users with local and overseas content, the report said.
Bloomberg said that Network18 reported a loss of  ₹178 crore in 2018-19, while its net debt stood at  ₹2,800 crore.
Network18, which was acquired by RIL in 2014, includes media and internet-based media outlets, such as News18.com, moneycontrol.com, Firstpost.com, CricketNext, print magazines such as Forbes India and Overdrive, besides TV channels in partnership with international media groups such as NBC, CNN and MTV.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani is in talks to sell his news media assets to India’s Times Group, as Asia’s richest man plans to unload a business that’s been losing money, people familiar with the matter said.
Bennett Coleman & Co., the publisher of the Times of India, is looking to hire advisers for due diligence on the news properties of Ambani’s Network18 Media & Investments Ltd., the people said, asking not to be named as the discussions are private. Ambani is considering various options, ranging from an outright exit to a stake sale, one of the people said.
Talks are at an early stage and may not result in a deal, the people said, adding more suitors may emerge. A representative for Bennett Coleman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comments, while a spokesman for Reliance Industries Ltd. said the parent of Network18 evaluates opportunities on an ongoing basis and declined to comment further.
The tycoon’s plan to dispose of his news assets comes as he pursues talks to sell a stake in Network18’s entertainment division that encompasses various movie, music and comedy channels to Sony Corp. Bloomberg News reported last week that the Japanese giant is currently examining the books of the Indian media company and is considering several potential deal structures. Network18 reported a group loss of 1.78 billion rupees ($25 million) in the year ended March, while its net debt stood at 28 billion rupees, according to the company.
Shares of Network18 jumped as much as 10% on Thursday in Mumbai and were headed for their highest level in almost six months.
Ambani’s oil-to-petrochemicals conglomerate is in the midst of streamlining its operations and pivoting more toward relatively new ventures such as retail and technology for revenue. Last month, Reliance Industries unveiled a digital-services holding company that would eventually provide services from e-commerce to entertainment on a telecommunications network built over the last few years with about $50 billion in investment.
Network18, acquired by Reliance Industries in 2014, owns and operates 56 local channels spanning news and entertainment. News properties include MoneyControl, News18, CNBCTV18.com, CricketNext and Firstpost. Shares of its subsidiary TV18 Broadcast Ltd., which houses news channels, soared as much as 6.7% in Mumbai.
Reliance Industries shares reached a record high on Thursday, giving the firm a market value of about $140 billion.
Unlisted Bennett Coleman, also known as the Times Group, owns television channels, including Times Now and ET Now. Besides the Times of India, it also publishes the Economic Times, a pink financial daily.

NEW DELHI :
Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) today became the first Indian company to hit the  ₹10 lakh crore milestone in market capitalisation, after its shares rose to a record high of  ₹1,584 apiece. The broader markets also hit a new high today. RIL shares settled 0.65% higher at  ₹1579.95, giving it a market cap of  ₹10.01 lakh crore. RIL shares have outperformed the market since the start of this year, surging nearly 40%. 
Here are 10 things to know: 
1) Recently, RIL's telecom unit Jio announced that it will increase tariffs soon after other telecom operators announced plans for a price hike.
2) Sanjiv Bhasin, director of IIFL Securities, says remains positive on RIL shares. RIL’s consumer-centric businesses like Jio, retail and other technology businesses are expected to see strong growth, he says.
3) In the immediate term, a price increase by Jio would benefit its average revenue per user, he added. Mr Bhasin also remains positive on Bharti Airtel.
4) Reliance Jio, which has a user base of about 35 crore users, had posted a stand-alone profit of  ₹990 crore for the quarter ended September 30 on revenue of  ₹12,354 crore.
5) Last month, RIL announced that it will set up a holding company for its digital services business, including telecom, potentially making way for the entry of a strategic investor.
6) RIL will infuse over  ₹1 lakh crore in the new company in the form of so-called optionally-convertible preference shares. Following the equity infusion, Reliance Jio will transfer liabilities worth over 1 lakh crore to the subsidiary of the parent, turning Jio almost debt free by March 31, 2020, excluding airwave-related liabilities.
7) Mukesh Ambani had earlier this year announced plans to cut RIL's net debt to zero in 18 months through measures, including a stake sale in the oil-to-chemicals business to Saudi Aramco. RIL had in August also announced a deal that gives the European oil major a 49% stake in the Indian conglomerate’s fuel retail business.
8) With likely receipt of  ₹1.1 lakh crore from Aramco and BP in FY21, RIL is on course to achieve its target of zero net debt, says Edelweiss Securities, which has a buy rating on the stock with target price of  ₹1,716/share.
9) RIL operates the world’s biggest oil-refining complex in Jamnagar, Gujarat, which can process low-quality crude and turn it into higher-grade fuels, partly protecting it from volatility in prices.
10) Last month, BofAML in a report said that RIL can become the first Indian company to achieve a market capitalisation of $200 billion on the back of its new commerce venture and fixed broadband business. (With Agency Inputs)"

In a related development, Tata Power Co. Ltd. has emerged as the sole contender to acquire Central Electricity Supply Utility of Odisha (CESU Odisha). PricewaterhouseCoopers is managing the sale of CESU.
This comes in the backdrop of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s ambitious target of generating  ₹1.05 trillion from asset sales in the current fiscal year.
“We are bound by confidentiality obligations and are unable to comment on client-specific matters,"" a Deloitte spokesperson said in an emailed response.
Queries emailed to Crisil on Monday evening remained unanswered.
A PricewaterhouseCoopers spokesperson in an emailed response said, “Due to client confidentiality concerns, we may not be able to provide any comment in particular.""
Power distribution companies have so far been the weakest link in the electricity value chain. Poor payment records of state-owned discoms have not only adversely affected power generation companies, but have also contributed to the stress in the banking sector. The delays in payment by state-run power distribution companies range from two months to 15 months.
However, the power distribution sector has also started witnessing large transactions. While Hyderabad-based Greenko Group, backed by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC Holdings Pte and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, had evinced interest in acquiring Reliance Infrastructure Ltd’s Mumbai power business, it was Adani Transmission Ltd that emerged successful for the  ₹18,800 crore deal in December 2017.
“Tata Power was the only technically qualified bidder for CESU. The financial bids have opened. The Odisha government’s approval is now awaited to take it ahead,"" said one of the two people cited above.
Feedback Energy Distribution Co. Ltd (FEDCO) and India Power Corp. Ltd had also placed a joint bid for CESU, Mint reported on 11 October last year.
“We have submitted the bids for CESU PPP project. The technical and price bids have been opened. The evaluation process is on. We are yet to hear from OERC (which had carried out the bidding process) on the outcome of the bids,"" a Tata Power spokesperson said in an emailed response.
Only one bidder had turned up in an earlier attempt to privatize CESU Odisha, forcing the cancellation of the process. The Central Electricity Supply Company of Odisha Ltd (CESCO), CESU Odisha’s forerunner, was privatized in 1999 with the licence granted to US-based electricity producer AES Corp. The OERC revoked the licence in 2005."

Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) on Thursday became the first Indian company to cross  ₹10 trillion in market capitalization, with its shares surging nearly 41% since the start of 2019.
The stock closed 0.65% higher at the end of the day’s trade at a record high of  ₹1,579.95 to reach a market value of  ₹10.02 trillion. During the day, the scrip gained as much as 0.91%, touching a life-time high of  ₹1,584.
Reliance Industries, which had first closed above  ₹1-trillion market cap on 19 August 2005, added every successive trillion rupees in 418 trading days, 109 days, 27 days, 2,398 days, 73 days, 180 days, 22 days, 284 days and 24 days, respectively.
“Higher refinery margins, potential for telecom tariff raise, bottoming PE cycle, start of gas production, lower capital expenditure intensity and path to deleveraging have led to investors asking if our bull case could play out despite above-average forward multiples. Sequential rise in earnings quality keeps us OW (overweight),"" said Morgan Stanley in a 19 November note.
Investors continued buying Reliance Industries shares after the company said it will increase tariffs in the next few weeks—a development that analysts expect will boost revenue growth.
Among analysts covering the stock, 29 have a “buy"" rating, six have a “hold"" rating, while two have a “sell"" rating, shows Bloomberg data.
“With Reliance Jio too announcing its intention to hike tariffs and join incumbents, it appears now that any tariff increase from here on are likely to sustain. This development gives us a sense that a meaningful increase in tariffs and improvement in average revenue per user (ARPU) is quite likely, at least by 15-20%. Our analysis suggests that average revenue per user could possibly improve 40% to 50% if Trai (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) was to decide floor tariffs for both voice and data"", said brokerage firm SBI Caps in a 19 November report.
“Another factor worth watching is whether Reliance Jio matches the incumbents on pricing or continues to operate 20% below incumbents. If Reliance Jio decides to match the others on pricing, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone may benefit from lower churn, and Reliance Jio will likely emerge as the largest beneficiary on revenue increase,"" the SBI Cap report added.
The stock also gained after the company said it’s planning to make Reliance Jio a net debt-free company by the end of 2019-20 by transferring  ₹1.08 trillion of debt from Jio to Reliance Industries.
It also announced the restructuring of its telecom and digital assets, and its plans to sell a stake in the new arm to strategic investors.
“A weakened Vodafone-Idea allows Reliance Jio to accelerate market share gains. The recently announced debt reshuffling and strategic divestment plan, peaking of the capital expenditure cycle and the possibility of tariff rationalization could lead to higher earnings and potentially multiples,"" said Emkay Global in a note to its investors.
Analysts said the stock can continue to gain.
There was a recent consolidation, which was fairly utilized as a minor dip.
These dips may be seen in the future and any correction in the stock by 3-4% should rather be seen as an opportunity, analysts added."
23,2019-11-29,Reliance,"Bharti Airtel’s cash offer is for assets including spectrum, telecom towers, fibre, data centres and real estateReliance Jio had last year agreed to buy the assets of RCom, but did not bid for the spectrum and real estate assets this time

MUMBAI :
Bharti Airtel Ltd has offered the highest upfront cash settlement among four bidders for Reliance Communications Ltd’s assets, which are currently under insolvency proceedings, said two people directly aware of the matter.
Bharti Airtel has offered about  ₹9,500 crore to acquire the assets that include spectrum, telecom towers, fibre, data centres and real estate, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. Upfront cash is often a key factor that creditors evaluate while deciding on a winning bidder.
“The conditions put forth by Airtel in their bid could reduce the viability of their bid,"" one of the two people said, without elaborating. Mint could not immediately ascertain the nature of those conditions.
Reliance Jio, which had last year agreed to buy the assets of Reliance Communications, including its spectrum, did not bid for the spectrum and real estate assets this time.
“Reliance Jio Infocomm has offered  ₹3,600 crore as upfront cash payment, but has not placed a bid on RCom’s spectrum assets or the company’s real estate,"" the person cited earlier said. “The committee of creditors would like to sell all assets in a single transaction, and not separately.""
The person said New Delhi-based UV Asset Reconstruction Co. Ltd has offered a bid of  ₹12,760 crore, which will be staggered over several years. This bid has a net present value of roughly  ₹9,000 crore. A fourth bidder, US-based private equity fund Varde Partners, is also offering staggered payments with little upfront cash for the assets on the block. The value of Varde’s offer could not be ascertained immediately.
Emailed queries to Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, UV Asset Reconstruction and insolvency resolution professional Anish Niranjan Nanavaty of Deloitte India, who is managing the sale process, remained unanswered. A spokesperson for Varde Partners declined to comment.
The last day for submitting bids was 25 November, which was an extension of 10 days from an earlier deadline.
Meanwhile, a Bharti Airtel spokesperson told The Economic Times that a conditional bid was submitted primarily for the spectrum, which is a precious asset.
“The bid conditions include that the overall consideration will primarily be by way of the deferred spectrum payables to the government being passed on to us on terms and schedules applicable to such deferred payments,’’ the spokesperson told the newspaper on 14 November.
“Thanks to the new structure of the telecom market, spectrum is not as scarce a resource as it was, say, 10 years ago,"" said Mahesh Uppal, telecom regulatory expert and director of Com First (India) Pvt. Ltd, explaining the different approaches by telecom operators. “This could explain Reliance Jio’s reluctance to take on RCom’s spectrum, especially when it comes encumbered. At the same time, Airtel might find some of RCom’s spectrum attractive, if the specific frequencies are of immediate commercial interest.""
In December, the department of telecommunications (DoT) did not approve a spectrum trading deal between Reliance Communications and Reliance Jio, as the proposed deal did not conform to the department’s spectrum trading guidelines. Jio had sought assurances from the government that it would not be held liable for past dues on RCom’s airwaves. The deal fell through as DoT did not accept the conditions. RCom owes DoT  ₹28,837 crore in past spectrum dues.
Reliance Jio had last year also agreed to acquire 43,000 telecom towers and 178,000 route kilometres of optic fibre network. The deal failed to secure the requisite clearance from lenders and DoT.
China Development Bank, Life Insurance Corporation of India, State Bank of India, Exim Bank of China and Bank of Baroda are among 41 creditors to the bankrupt telecom company.
According to information available on the company’s website, it owed financial creditors  ₹49,193.46 crore. RCom’s assets are housed under three companies—RCom, Reliance Telecom and Reliance Infratel. They owe financial creditors  ₹24,306.27 crore and  ₹12,687.65 crore, respectively. Reliance Communications thus owes debtors  ₹86,187.58 crore at a consolidated level. This is besides the  ₹28,837 crore it owes DoT in spectrum dues and other charges as well as the amounts it has to pay its operational creditors, Mint reported on Tuesday."

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio has emerged as the highest bidder for mobile tower and optical fibre assets of Reliance Infratel by placing bids of around  ₹3,600 crore, according to banking sources privy to the development.
Bharti Airtel has placed a bid of around  ₹1,800 crore for the same, according to the sources.
""Reliance Infratel's tower and fibre is likely to go to Reliance Jio as its bid of  ₹3,600 crore is the highest and the company has committed to make the payment in 60 days. Bharti Airtel has placed a bid of  ₹1,800 crore for the same,"" a banking source said.
Another source privy to the development said the process of finalising the bids will take a minimum of one-two weeks as committee of creditors (CoC) will meet all the bidders and negotiate with them and then vote on it.
Bharti Airtel has also made conditional bid for spectrum of Reliance Communications (RCom).
The sources said the conditions placed by Bharti Airtel will make it difficult for the resolution professional (RP) to close the process by January 10 as directed by the National Company Law Tribunal.
Reliance Jio did not bid for RCom spectrum.
VFSI Holdings Pte Ltd and UV Asset Reconstruction Company Limited have also submitted their bids for the assets of RCom.
RCom's secured debt is estimated to be around  ₹33,000 crore. Lenders have submitted claims of around  ₹49,000 crore in August.
Reliance Communications, which is undergoing insolvency proceedings, has put all its assets for sale, which include spectrum holding of 122 MHz that the company before insolvency proceedings estimated to be around  ₹14,000 crore, tower business worth  ₹7,000 crore, optical fibre network worth  ₹3,000 crore and data centres worth  ₹4,000 crore.
According to an NCLT order, RP has to complete the process by January 10, 2020.
RCom in the past has tried to sell assets to various companies, including Reliance Jio, to clear debts but the deals did not crystallise. Reliance Jio cancelled the agreement to buy RCom assets as it did not want to bear the previous liabilities of the debt-ridden firm.
Later, the insolvency proceeding against RCom was started on a plea filed by Swedish telecom gear maker Ericsson after the company failed to clear its dues.
RCom Chairman Anil Ambani had tendered his resignation after the company posted a consolidated loss of  ₹30,142 crore for July-September 2019 due to provisioning for liabilities after the Supreme Court ruling on statutory dues.
This was the second-highest loss posted by any Indian company till date.
The CoC has, however, rejected Ambani's resignation and asked to cooperate in insolvency proceedings."

New Delhi: Industry bodies, CII and FICCI have closed ranks and written to the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to address the situation on the precarious financial position of telecom operators with a debt of  ₹7 lakh and to ensure there is robust competition for the vibrancy in the sector.
CII and FICCI Presidents have written similar letters to the Finance Minister arguing for robust competition, which is being seen as support for beleaguered operators, Airtel and Vodafone Idea.
They have also sought relief for the telecom sector arguing that it has an impact on several sectors and the economy as a whole. The chambers have also sought a meeting with Sitharaman to propose potential remedies for the sector.
""The recent developments on the adjusted gross revenues (AGR) dues of the telecom service providers, have triggered a great deal of concern not only to the seriously affected TSPs, but also mongst others who are part of the overall telecom ecosystem. The precarious financial health of key players in this sector and their massive financial burden (estimated to be  ₹7 lakh crore), threatens not only their individual existence but also the much-needed vibrancy in this sector of national importance,"" CII President Vikram Kirloskar wrote to the Finance Minister.
""In this context, CII urges the Government to consider addressing the situation in a manner which continues the robust competition in the industry and ensures further investments in infrastructure for new technologies,"" Kirloskar said.
Kirloskar said one of the important elements of vibrancy in any sector is the presence of multiple key players. In line with this, the Government has followed a policy of encouraging healthy competition in the telecom sector, with atleast 3-4 strong players, he added.
CII has prepared a detailed note which has been sent to the Finance Minister concerning the telecom sector. CII's argument is that telecom services are a ""raw material"" for the rest of the economy-on which acts as a productivity-enhancer, more so with new technologies driving rapid digitalization and increased digital penetration.
FICCI President Sandip Somany has also written to the Finance Minister on similar lines. ""FICCI has strongly urged the Government to take immediate steps for addressing the concerns of the sector.
FICCI has said the sector is saddled with a debt of  ₹7 lakh crore and has almost no appetite to invest in networks and future technologies.
""Adding further woes to the sector, the recent ruling on Adjusted Gross Revenues (AGR), dues of the TSPs will lead to an unfortunate and disastrous collapse of the already battered sector,"" Somany said.
FICCI President added that this ruling will have a cascading effect and will severely impact many other companies in multiple sectors such as Internet Service Providers (ISP), satellite communications providers, cable operators and even companies in power, steel and railways sector.
""FICCI is confident that a timely intervention and support will not only save the sector from the brink of collapse but ensure a healthy growth adding to the economic momentum of the country,"" Somany said.

19,2019-12-01,Reliance,"Perhaps, Jio will be ready to lower tariffs when its reach, in terms of number of homes it can connect to, has greater scaleTariffs announced for JioFiber three months ago was more or less in line with prevailing market rates

MUMBAI :
Unlike the big-bang launch of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s mobile broadband services three years ago, the company’s plans for its fixed broadband services, under the JioFiber tag, have been far more restrained. While tariffs for its mobile services were far below competition, the tariffs announced for JioFiber three months ago were more or less on a par with prevailing market rates.
According to some news reports, this is set to change, with the Reliance Industries Ltd subsidiary offering a  ₹351 monthly plan for fixed broadband services.
However, a company official clarified that JioFiber offerings start from  ₹699 per month, and the  ₹351 base cost is part of all the plans which were announced three months ago. There is no new low-priced plan as of now, he added.
The confusion arose as a result of a  ₹351 plan being filed with the regulator, although it must be noted that customers can buy only bundled offerings which start at  ₹699 per month, and not the reported base plan.
Note that the total broadband subscriber base in the country is less than 20 million subscribers, and Jio’s target of reaching 20 million subscribers in the near term, and 50 million subscribers eventually, seemed far too ambitious.
Unless tariffs are brought down meaningfully, analysts expect growth to be sluggish in the segment. Even so, Reliance Jio has done well to garner about 0.7 million subscribers for its fixed broadband services by end-September, according to data collated by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.
Considering that competitor Bharti Airtel Ltd took years to reach its current subscriber base of 2.4 million in the home fixed broadband segment, Jio’s feat is commendable.
But to achieve its stated goal, tariffs will have to be lowered. There is also the matter of reach. Challenges with last-mile connectivity act as a constraint on growth. Taking broadband services to residences involve multiple approvals from authorities, such as municipal corporations and housing societies, which aren’t very easy to come by. Perhaps, Jio will be ready to offer lower tariffs when its reach, in terms of the number of homes it can connect to, reaches greater scale.
To achieve scale, Jio’s recent acquisitions of Hathway Cable and Datacom Ltd and Den Networks Ltd will help, as they have a customer base of about 14 million in terms of cable connections.
Jio’s reach of 1,600 towns and fibre layout of 700,000 route km (rising to 1.1 million going forward) is a key positive as it is likely to reach most potential customers, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients."

NEW DELHI :
Shares of telecom companies jumped in early deals on Monday as India’s major private operators—Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and Reliance Jio Infocomm—are set to hike tariffs this week.
At 0926, shares of Bharti Airtel were up nearly 9% at  ₹480.80, while those of Vodafone Idea soared 17.3%. Reliance Industries Ltd—parent of Reliance Jio Infocomm--was nearly 4% higher at  ₹1609.50. The BSE telecom index surged 7.3% to 1,197.65 points.
Analysts at ICICI Securities are bullish on both Airtel, Vodafone Idea and have a ‘buy’ rating on the stocks.
“We have incorporated the just-announced tariff hikes in our model and increased our EBITDA estimate for Bharti by 23% and 24% for FY21E and FY22E respectively. Consequently, we increase our target price to Rs550 (from Rs450), but we cut our EBITDA multiple for India business to 9x FY22E (from 11x FY22E, as our earlier multiple had option value of tariff increase, or a 2-player market, which is now included in the model). We move Voda Idea’s rating from ‘under review’ to BUY with a target price of Rs8. We still see AGR liability resolution as key for VIL’s long-term value creation. Bharti Airtel remains our preferred pick,"" the brokerage said in a report.
On Sunday, Vodafone Idea Ltd, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd said they will raise prices of their prepaid voice and data services, ending a protracted tariff war that dragged rates to the lowest in the world. The increases in most plans announced by the three operators are in the range of 15-47%. While the new tariffs for Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel will be effective starting Tuesday, Reliance Jio’s revised tariffs will come into effect on 6 December.
The tariff hike by the three operators is the first of its kind in more than a decade after years of competition ensured prices of calls and data services hit rock bottom.
“Telecom sector was reeling under multiple problems such as low tariffs, regulatory issues including AGR liability, cash burn, stretched balance sheet. We believe the just-announced tariff hikes of 15-40% were much required and will likely remedy most of the problems of the industry,"" said ICICI Securities.
With the latest tariff hike, the brokerage firm also expects the blended average revenue per user (ARPU) to increase by 21%.
“We have tried to work out the increase in blended ARPU for Bharti and Voda Idea based on their Q2FY20 numbers. However, since the companies don’t disclose the breakup, our entire working is based on our assumptions. Our working shows Bharti’s blended ARPU increasing by 21% to Rs156 from Rs128 and Voda Idea’s too by 21% to Rs131 from Rs107,"" ICICI Securities added.
According to brokerage firm Emkay Global, based on tariff hikes, sector revenues/EBITDA “will increase by  ₹530 billion/Rs420 billion given no major SIM consolidation. Risk can be on bottom-of-the-pyramid consumer spending behavior after the steep hikes.""
""We think, (tariff hike) would boost revenue growth. However, operators face large payouts after the adverse SC decision on the AGR matter and would need government support to mitigate the burden. We continue to like Bharti Airtel"", said BNP Paribas in a 25 November note.
Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, already reeling under heavy debt, reported record losses in the September quarter because of an unfavourable Supreme Court verdict that upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue on which it calculates levies on telecom operators. On 24 October, the Supreme Court directed telcos to pay at least  ₹92,000 crore in past dues to the government within three months. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, along with two others, have filed a plea in the Supreme Court to review the verdict.
According to government data, the liabilities in the case of Bharti Airtel add up to nearly  ₹35,586 crore, of which  ₹21,682 crore is licence fee and another  ₹13,904.01 crore is spectrum dues (excluding the dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices, the companies that it acquired).
In a relief to telecom companies, the Union Cabinet on 20 November approved a moratorium of two years for spectrum payments.
Jefferies India expect despite the price hike, additional government relief measures are important. The brokerage firm expect a moratorium on AGR dues for the next two years, aiding cash flows. A reduction in license fee (helps Bharti/VodaIdea's EBITDA by 5%/28%) and an extension of interconnect usage charges (IUC) are also likely."
10,2019-12-02,Reliance,"The revised prepaid plans of Vodafone Idea will be effective from 3 December, 2019The surge in most of the plans provided by various telecom operators are in the range of 15-47%

Vodafone Idea on Sunday announced tariff hikes for its prepaid customers, which will be effective from 12 am, 3 December. The announcement comes after the telecom major posted a massive quarterly loss of  ₹50,921 crore amid an adverse Supreme Court ruling on adjusted gross revenue (AGR).
Apart from Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio also announced new plans with tariff hikes. The surge in most of the plans provided by the three operators are in the range of 15-47%. While the new tariffs for Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel will be effective from 3 December for these two telecos, Reliance Jio’s revised plans will come into effect on 6 December.
""In line with its commitment to provide customers with simple, convenient and affordable products, VIL has curated an optimum range of feature rich plans for both voice and data. Customers can avail their benefits by just selecting the plan best suited to their specific needs and continue to enjoy seamless connectivity across India,"" the company said in a statement.
According to the revised tariffs, the unlimited plans for Vodafone Idea prepaid customers will increase significantly regardless of which plans they opt for. The unlimited package comes in three validity schemes - 24 days, 84 days and 365 days validity.
Here is a break-up of the unlimited plans and their revised tariff:
To recall, Vodafone Idea has been providing various above mentioned unlimited packs at a lower rate than the current tariff hike announced by the telecom major. 
As shown for the 365 days validity section, the new plan will now be dearer for prepaid customers as it will cost  ₹1,499 instead of  ₹999 and will have data usage limit of 24 GB instead of 12 GB.
Similarly, the 2 GB data per day scheme for 28 days will now cost  ₹299 instead of  ₹229 for the same services. In the 84 days validity package, the new recharge will cost  ₹599 for 1.5 GB data per day and 100 SMS instead of  ₹458 for the same scheme. There is also a  ₹399 scheme that will provide 3 GB data and 100 SMS services for 28 days.
Apart from these,  ₹699 recharge for a validity of 84 days added to the prepaid recharge schemes that provides 2 GB data and 100 SMS. However, the  ₹569 scheme for 3GB data and 100 SMS per day, which was available for earlier, is not reflected in the revised unlimited packs shared by the company. 
All the other prepaid packages and their revised tariffs are mentioned in the screenshot shared above."
9,2019-12-02,Reliance,"Analysts termed the hike as ‘better than expected’ and painted a positive outlook on telecom sharesHikes in most of the plans across the three operators are in the range of 25-30%

Telecom shares, led by Bharti Airtel Ltd, were lapped up in Monday’s trade as investors cheered Sunday’s announcement by the country’s three private sector operators that they would hike pre-paid tariffs of their call and data packs. Airtel hit a 52-week high of  ₹485.75, gaining nearly 10% intra-day on BSE. It ended the day at  ₹458.55, higher by 3.7% from Friday’s close. The maximum tariff hike in Airtel’s case is pegged at 47%.
Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL) closed 14% up at  ₹7.79 from its BSE close on Friday. Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) ended the session 2.3% higher, riding on a 40% tariff hike announced by its subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
The Sensex ended the day up merely 0.02% at 40,802.17.
Airtel and Vodafone’s tariff hikes are effective Tuesday, while those of Reliance Jio come into force on Friday.
Analysts termed the increase by the operators as “better than expected"" and painted a positive outlook on telecom shares.
Hikes in most of the plans across the three operators are in the range of 25% to 30%, though in some cases, the increases are in excess of 40%. The operators have also tweaked their data offerings to make sure the price hikes don’t force customers to shift to a lower tariff pack (downtrading). The companies have also introduced the ‘fair usage’ concept in their plans. Freebies such as subscription of popular apps have also been added to more packs.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in a report on Monday, said it does not see any negative elasticity impact as all the operators will hike tariffs by the same magnitude.
“We expect more tariff hikes to follow and remain bullish. We consider Bharti and RIL as better telco names that benefit from tariff hikes and remain bullish. While VIL may show maximum upside, the overhang from the AGR issue does not make its risk-reward favourable,"" the research and investment banking powerhouse said in the report.
Goldman Sachs is bullish on telecom stocks but doesn’t foresee another hike by Airtel or Vodafone anytime soon. “We believe there could be some risk to subscriber additions for Bharti and VIL at the lower end (feature phones), given competition from JioPhone. On bundled plans for smartphones, Bharti and VIL are now at a 26-43% premium vs Jio’s plans, and if Jio were to fully close this gap, there could be a potential re-rating in telco stocks,"" Goldman Sachs said in a report.
Jefferies expects elasticity to reflect through SIM consolidation and downtrading. SIM consolidation could also lead to increased channel incentives by the operators, it said. Jefferies has a “hold"" on Airtel and “underperform"" on VIL shares.
Industry body Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) doesn’t foresee any impact on affordability as it believes consumers are already paying well in excess of the new tariffs with substantially less consumption of voice and data. “At a time when the nation is looking to improve its growth rate, we can see no better move to do, than to sustain and improve the financial health of the TSPs,"" a COAI release quoted its director general Rajan S. Mathews as saying.
Vodafone and Bharti, already reeling under heavy debt and a hit on profitability post the 2016 entry of Reliance Jio, were left with little choice after an adverse 24 October Supreme Court ruling that penalized the companies for what the department of telecommunications (DoT) has maintained was underreporting of revenues by them. The top court imposed a penalty of  ₹92,000 on the operators, many of whom have already folded. The operators were given three months to pay the dues.
The DoT has since asked the operators to work out the final numbers on their own and pay the dues. Bharti and Vodafone, along with two others, have filed a plea with the apex court bench to review its order. The tariff hike by the three operators is arguably the first of its kind in more than a decade after years of cutthroat competition ensured rock bottom prices of calls and data services. At 1.17 billion mobile users at the end of September, India is the world’s second-largest market by the number of subscribers with tariffs that are still the lowest in the world."
6,2019-12-03,Reliance,"This is the first hike over the past five years in the country's telecom sectorBharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea announced 15-50 per cent rise in 'unlimited' usage category prepaid plans

New Delhi: Increase in prepaid plan prices by telecom operators will help them raise revenues and the companies may soon hike prices for postpaid plans as well, according to sector analysts.
The analysts also said Reliance Jio's plans are expected to be cheaper as compared to its rivals even after 40 per cent hike in mobile call and internet charges announced by the company.
This is the first hike over the past five years in the country's telecom sector that is facing tariff war with voice calls becoming almost free in 2016 and steep 95 per cent fall in data prices to  ₹11.78 per GB at present from  ₹269 per GB in 2014.
They said the hike of up to 50 per cent in prepaid plan prices by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea (VIL) will help the operators increase their revenues.
""Over the next few days, we expect Bharti (Airtel) and VIL to announce tariff changes in their postpaid plans as well,"" Emkay Global said in its report.
Bharti Airtel and VIL announced 15-50 per cent rise in 'unlimited' usage category prepaid plans. The new plans will come into effect from December 3 and existing customers under these plans will have to pay the new rates after they complete six months in their existing plan.
""Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have announced tariff hike of sub-25 per cent for  ₹349 and below plans, where about 60 per cent of subscribers reside. We believe average impact on ARPU (average revenue per user) would be 25-30 per cent due to tariff hike,"" Axis Capital said.
Kotak Institutional Equities said the hike in mobile rates is likely to enhance Bharti Airtel's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation in the range of  ₹8,000-9,500 crore and VIL about  ₹7,000-8,500 crore.
Goldman Sachs estimates VIL's revenues could be about 22 per cent higher, assuming a subsequent hike even for postpaid, compared to  ₹11,146 crore that company reported in the second quarter of current financial year.
""For Bharti Airtel, assuming the announced tariff details, revenues could potentially be 24/12 per cent higher for wireless/consolidated,"" Goldman Sachs said.
Bank of America Merrill-Lynch said Jio may raise prices by 40 per cent only on the select packs but still it may continue to be cheaper than its competitors.
""We think the incremental 300 per cent benefit which Jio is talking about is by offering more data allowances. In our view, it incrementally doesn't entice users much beyond 1.5 GB. Even after these hikes, we believe Jio will continue to be 15-20 per cent cheaper than the incumbent operators,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.
Emkay Global said content offering of telecom operators will play important role in retention of subscribers if data consumption pattern is not impacted by tariff hikes.
From December 3, customers of these two companies will have to shell out a minimum of  ₹49 to make calls, access the internet on mobile and stay connected for four weeks.
Telecom companies' move to raise mobile tariff follows the Supreme Court judgment, on October 24 this year, upholding the government's method of calculating revenue share that it should get from earnings of service providers.
Vodafone Idea last month reported a consolidated loss of  ₹50,921 crore -- the highest ever loss posted by any Indian corporate -- for the September quarter on account of liability arising out of the Supreme Court's order.
The company has estimated liability of  ₹44,150 crore post the apex court order, and made provisioning of  ₹25,680 crore in the second quarter this fiscal.
Vodafone Idea which is reeling under massive debt of around  ₹1.17 lakh crore had earlier cited acute financial stress on the company behind the decision to raise mobile call and data charges.
Bharti Airtel has posted a staggering  ₹23,045 crore net loss for the second quarter ended September 30, due to provisioning of  ₹28,450 crore in the aftermath of the SC ruling on statutory dues.
According to government data, the liabilities in the case of Bharti Airtel add up to nearly  ₹35,586 crore, of which  ₹21,682 crore is licence fee and another  ₹13,904.01 crore is the SUC dues (excluding the dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices).
The government is currently not considering any proposal on waiver of penalties and interest on outstanding licence fee based on adjusted gross revenue (AGR), or on extending the timelines for telecom companies to pay up their statutory dues.
Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service said adjusted gross revenue dues on Bharti Airtel are credit negative for the telecom operator despite a two-year moratorium given by the government on spectrum payment and the firm's plan to raise mobile call and data charges.
The credit rating agency said that in case Bharti Airtel is required to make a payment of  ₹34,260 crore immediately and in full, the debt level of the company will rise 25 per cent if the company raises entire money to make payment through debt instruments."
11,2019-12-03,Reliance,"The tariff increases will help Airtel’s India mobile business swing back into profit at pre-tax levelReliance Jio is expected to gain the most in terms of revenue accretion, market share gains

MUMBAI :
The tariff hikes announced by Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd over the weekend have been far higher than the Street’s estimates. So much so that it will help Airtel’s India mobile business swing back into profits at the pre-tax level, after several quarters of losses. In Vodafone Idea’s case, losses will reduce to a great extent. But given the fast pace of its market share losses, it would need to do much more to retain the gains from the tariff hike.
The biggest gainer, by far, is Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. Analysts at JM Financial Institutional Equities estimate incremental quarterly revenues of  ₹2,400 crore and  ₹2,100 crore, respectively, for Airtel and Vodafone Idea as a result of tariff hikes. But in the case of Jio, which has said it will raise tariffs by 40% without giving details, JM’s analysts expect incremental quarterly revenues of as much as  ₹3,900 crore. Incremental revenues are compared to reported revenues in the September quarter, assuming no change in the respective subscriber base of the three firms.
These higher gains for Jio and the concerns around Vodafone Idea are reflected in the reaction on the Street as well. The market capitalization of Jio’s parent, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), rose by about  ₹22,650 crore on Monday, while that of Airtel and Vodafone Idea gained  ₹9,370 crore and  ₹2,730 crore, respectively.
The reason Jio gains more is that Airtel and Vodafone Idea have left post-paid tariffs untouched, presumably because tariffs in this segment are already far higher than prepaid tariffs. And the post-paid segment accounts for about 30% of revenues for these companies. Jio hardly has any post-paid subscribers on its network, which means a far higher proportion of its revenue base is impacted by the tariff hike.
What’s more, Jio has stated that it will provide its customers 300% higher benefits compared to its competition. This can potentially result in an increase in the pace of its market share gains. Jio’s revenue market share has risen from 13% in FY18 to 34.2% in the first six months of FY20, according to data collated by JM Financial. While Airtel has kept its share intact at around 30%, Vodafone Idea’s market share has fallen from 38.2% to 29.5%.
One of the main reasons for this is that Jio’s plans have offered a better price-value equation. In the past, when incumbents tried to offer tariff plans with a similar price-value equation as Jio, the latter had responded by cutting tariffs further, and stating that it will always provide customers plans that are 20% cheaper.
Even in the current rising tariffs scenario, Jio is likely to position its tariffs at far more attractive levels than competition to sustain the pace of its market share gains. Besides, the industry-wide truce on tariffs has included hikes in voice-only plans, a segment where Jio is currently almost absent. This may well give the RIL group company a better shot at gaining subscriber share with its JioPhone offering for feature-phone users. When Jio announces its new tariff plans later this week, there will be greater clarity on its strategy for the smartphone and feature phone segments.
The company that is at the biggest risk of losing subscribers remains Vodafone Idea, given its relatively weaker infrastructure. While the tariff hikes will certainly give the firm breathing space—for one, its rate of cash burn will reduce—it needs to do more to retain its subscriber base.
Vodafone Idea needs to consider a fund infusion to augment its network capabilities and provide effective competition. Of course, much also depends on the final outcome of the AGR (adjusted gross revenues)- related dispute with the government. While a reprieve will certainly help, Vodafone Idea’s future depends on many other things falling in place as well, and the company’s ability and willingness to make the most of this sudden reversal in fortunes for the telecom sector."

New Delhi: Even with an announced tariff hike of 40 per cent, Reliance Jio would be cheaper by 15-20 per cent than other incumbents, analyst firms said on Monday while still awaiting for details of the company's new plans.
Along with other telcom companies, even Jio has said it will raise rates by 40 per cent but has not formalised the changes. Jio said that it will be introducing an ""all in one"" plan from December 6 across multiple price points with unlimited voice and data, which will have 300 per cent more benefits than earlier.
""Similar to incumbents, we think only select packs (of Jio) will have 40 per cent increase but popular ones could have 25-30 per cent. We think the incremental 300 per cent benefit which Jio is talking about is by offering more data allowances. In our view that incrementally doesn't entice users much beyond 1.5 GB,"" Bank of America Merril Lynch said in a note.
""Even after these hikes, we believe Jio will continue to be 15-20 per cent cheaper than the incumbent operators. If Jio data allowances are not within ""fair usage policy"" control, then we see upside risks to our capex investments"", it said.
The report also said the tariff hikes announced by Vodafone Idea (VIL) and Bharti Airtel were better than expected, which will be effective from Tuesday. While very low and very high denomination tariffs were hiked by up to 41 per cent, the popular plans saw lesser tariff hikes of 25-30 per cent.
For VIL, the popular 1.5 GB/day, 84 day pack will cost 31 per cent more at  ₹599 versus  ₹458 (33 per cent hike for Bharti) and 25 per cdent hike for  ₹199 (will be now  ₹249), 1.5 GB/day pack. A 41 per cent increase comes on the annual plan of  ₹1,699 which will now cost now  ₹2,399.
On an average, the tariff hikes by Bharti and VIL are of similar magnitude.
Credit Suisse said after that Jio details its tariff, the premium of the Airtel and Vodafone hikes are likely to decline to 10-20 per cent for the more popular tariff plans.
""Jio has also announced its intention to participate in market repair. In addition to tariff hikes by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, Jio has also announced its intention to increase tariffs effective December 6. While the details of its new plans are awaited, the company quantified the hike to be up to 40 per cent for its 'All in one plans'"", Credit Suisse said.
""We note that post the announced tariff hikes, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea's plans are at a 20-60 per cent premium over Jio's October 2019 'All-in-plans'. We think after Jio's announced tariff hikes, the premium is likely to decline to 10-20 per cent for the more popular tariff plans"", it added.
Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have raised tariffs of their popular bundled prepaid plans by 25-41 per cent as well as the low-end plans by around 40 per cent.
""Jio has indicated hikes of a similar magnitude albeit with higher benefits; details awaited. We like the way the new pricing construct is designed - it encourages up-trading and discourages down-trading; this should help recreate parity in the industry. We await details from Jio to revise our models,"" Kotak said.

The significant rate hikes are reflected in the unlimited packs offered by the telecom company. Offering the plans in three schemes, mainly 24 days, 84 days and 365 days, the plans are listed as follows:
 ₹249 monthly plan - Unlimited Voice (FUP of 1000 mins for off-net calls), 1.5 GB/day of Data, 100 SMS/ day, 28 days validity
 ₹399 monthly plan: Unlimited voice (FUP of 1000 mins for off-net calls), 3 GB/day of Data, 100 SMS/ day, 28 days validity

Apart from this, there is also a  ₹699 recharge for a validity of 84 days added to the prepaid recharge schemes that provides unlimited voice (FUP of 3000 mins for off-net calls), 2 GB data and 100 SMS
 ₹1,499 early plan: Unlimited Voice (FUP of 12000 mins for off-net calls), 24 GB data, 3600 SMS, 365 days validity. This plan has seen a significant rate hike of  ₹500. The same benefits were provided to the prepaid consumers for a much less price of  ₹999. However, the telecom major increased the data usage limit from 12 GB to 24 GB.
Apart from these major combo packs, the telecom major also has smaller talktime and data vouchers:
 ₹49 monthly plan: This plan will offer a  ₹38 talktime, 100 MB data, 2.5p/sec tariff, 28 days validity
 ₹79 monthly plan: This plan has a  ₹64 talktime, 200 MB data, 1p/sec tariff, 28 days validity.
Moreover, there is also a section for first recharges with the revised rates for monthly basis recharge:
 ₹97 plan:  ₹45 Talktime, 100 MB data, 1p/ sec tariff, 28 days validity
 ₹197 plan: Unlimited Voice (FUP of 1000 mins for off-net calls), 2 GB data, 300 SMS, 28 days validity

Note that the unlimited calls entail a cap on every recharge pack for off-net calls. Off net calls are essentially calls made from Vodafone Idea connection to other telecom connections. The company stated that off-net calls after the free usage in the plan, would be charged at 6p/min. However, Vodafone to Vodafone and Vodafone to Idea and vice versa are considered on-net and there is no charge on them, at all.
Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL) closed 14% up at  ₹7.79 from its BSE close on Friday as investors cheered Sunday’s announcement by the telecom major that it would hike prepaid tariffs of its call and data packs."

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd on Wednesday revealed the new tariffs of its ‘All in One’ plans with unlimited voice and data services. The new tariffs range from  ₹199 a month to  ₹2,199 for one year. The customers will get 28 days validity, on a top up of  ₹199, 56 days for  ₹399, 84 days for  ₹555 and 365 days for  ₹2,199 recharge. The customers will now get 1.5 GB data per day instead of 2 GB earlier and unlimited Jio to Jio calling. The new rates will come into effect from 6 December.
While the tariffs have been hiked by up to 40%, customers will now get 300% more benefits, the company said in the statement.
Jio has also asked users to take full benefits of its old recharge plans by going for advance recharge plans before tariffs are increased. Before 6 December, to get 336 days of uninterrupted services, you can recharge four times with  ₹444 plan which offers you 2GB data per day. Each such  ₹444 recharge is valid for 84 days and buying four such plans will ensure that you get 336 days of service.
On 1 December, along with other telecom operators, Jio had announced that it will launch new all-in-one plans with unlimited voice and data.
Rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have already increased their tariff plans from 3 December.
Airtel has merged its popular  ₹169 and  ₹199 plans into a single  ₹248 pack. Their previous 28-day validity remains the same. The tariff hike for users of its  ₹169 pack comes to be 47%, highest among its peers, although customers will now get 1.5GB of data per day, 50% more from what they were getting earlier and the same as what the  ₹199 plan user was enjoying. Vodafone Idea’s latest prepaid tariffs come with validity periods of 2 days, 28 days, 84 days and 365 days."

MUMBAI :
Goldman Sachs Equity Research has increased the 12-month target price of the shares of Reliance Industries to  ₹1,850 per share. The equity research firm also raised the earnings estimate for financial year 2021-22.
On Wednesday, shares of RIL on the BSE closed at  ₹1,552.55, lower by  ₹26.30 or 1.67%.
The positive comes on the back of expectation of stronger growth in the telecom segment, with higher revenue and strong subscriber base among others.
""We raise our earnings estimates for FY21/22E and 12-month target price to  ₹1,850 (from  ₹1,635) mainly on our expectation for stronger growth in the telecom business, driven by a higher ARPU from potential tariff hikes coupled with continued strong subscriber addition momentum (44% market share by FY22E),"" Goldman Sachs said in a research note.
""We maintain our positive view on the stock given: sharp sequential acceleration in refining margins due to International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) 2020 regulations and accelerating global GDP driving tight diesel markets,"" it added.
""Continued high growth in consumer-focused businesses, which we estimate to grow at 50% FY19-22E CAGR; and significant improvement in FCF (free cash flow) and asset monetisation leading to deleveraging. Our FY20/21E EBITDA is 7%/20% above Bloomberg consensus. Reiterate Buy (on CL),"" the research note said.
Further, it expects Reliance Jio to benefit the most from the recent tariff hike announced by all the three private telecom operators. It said that among the three operators, Jio is most likely to witness the highest increase in average revenue per user (ARPU).
""We believe Jio is likely to see the highest increase in ARPU/revenue from the recent tariff hikes, due to a large proportion of smartphone users in its base. Coupled with Jio's strong subscriber addition momentum, we believe the company's market share can continue to expand, and reach 44% by FY22E, from 35% in 2Q20,"" the note said.
It also said that complex refiners will be the biggest beneficiaries of IMO 2020 regulations and RIL, with the highest refining complexity, is well positioned to benefit from the same. Shipping companies have to adhere to the IMO's low sulphur fuel regulations starting January 1. The regulations 2020 mandate reduction in sulphur content of bunker fuel to less than 0.5% from 3.5% to reduce sulphur dioxide emissions globally.
RIL's refinery has the complexity of 20, which means it can break the heaviest of crude into sweet crude saving on price due to light heavy differentials and increased demand from the shipping companies.
""We expect GRMs (gross refining mining) for RIL to rise sharply from last quarter's level of $9.4/bbl to our FY21 forecast of $14.5/bbl. This improvement in GRMs is driven by IMO 2020 and accelerating global GDP driving tight diesel markets; reducing headwinds from heavy crude sourcing as lower demand of heavy and sour crude would start to offset declining supply; and benefits accruing from the petcoke gasification project,"" it said."

0,2019-12-05,Reliance,"Streaming wars will continue and content will get expensive as more people chase the same content

A Bloomberg news report dropped a bombshell last fortnight when it said that two big broadcasting companies, Japanese giant Sony Corp. and Mukesh Ambani-owned Network18 Media and Investments Ltd, are coming together in the Indian market. Later, The Economic Times reported that the two will create a joint venture (JV), in which Sony will have a bigger stake. Till now there has been no official word on the proposed deal from either company.
The entertainment channels of Ambani’s television network are housed under Viacom18 Media Pvt. Ltd, a joint venture between TV18 Broadcast Ltd and Viacom Inc., wherein TV18 has a 51% share.
When it increased its share in the equal JV in 2018, TV18 also extended its brand and content licence arrangement with Viacom for another 10 years. Currently, Viacom18 operates more than 40 channels in seven languages. It also operates a film company, Viacom18 Motion Pictures, video streaming platform Voot, has interests in live events and merchandising, besides a distribution company, IndiaCast Media. Sony Pictures Networks India, on the other hand, a subsidiary of Sony Corp., runs more than 20 channels, including several sports networks.
If indeed the deal fructifies, it could impact the media and entertainment landscape in India in several ways. “It would create a massive powerhouse in broadcasting, a multi-language and multi-genre behemoth,"" said Jehil Thakkar, partner, Deloitte India.
However, the biggest impact of the deal would probably be on sports broadcasting. In 2017, Star India paid  ₹16,347.50 crore to win the telecast rights of Indian Premier League (IPL) for five years beginning 2018, outbidding Sony Pictures Networks India, which had held IPL rights for 10 years.
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which bid  ₹3,075.72 crore for the internet and mobile rights of IPL, also lost to Star. In April 2018, both Sony Pictures Networks and Reliance Jio once again trailed Star in their bid for Board of Control for Cricket in India’s media rights (for all matches played at home), that made the latter a leader in cricket broadcasting.
“With Reliance and Sony’s combined might, the future sports rights will be fiercely contested. The International Cricket Council (ICC) has a clause where you need to have experience in sports broadcasting before you can bid for rights. Through an alliance with Sony, Reliance—which has been keen on sports—resolves that issue,"" said a TV channel executive, declining to be named.
“Sports is a very powerful genre and, remember, it is cricket that has really made Hotstar what it is today, a market leader among OTT video streaming platforms,"" said media expert Chintamani Rao. Clearly, this deal will also have a bearing on the OTT space that is teeming with 30 players of varying sizes and scales. Experts are divided on whether the new entity will retain three separate OTT platforms in its portfolio, including SonyLiv, Voot, and Jio, or merge everything under the latter and build it up. Rao believes that Reliance isn’t really interested in the broadcasting business. “For it, the TV play is nothing but a source of content for Jio,"" he said. “The full impact of the deal will unravel once fibre-to-home takes off and people switch over to OTT streaming. Then this will be huge,"" said Deloitte’s Thakkar. Although mobiles may still be the biggest platform for streaming, over the next five years, living room devices will also contribute to OTT viewership.
The other major impact will be on content spending. Streaming wars will continue and content will get expensive as more people chase the same content. “Content creators will make hay, while shows and films will up their ante in scale and quality,"" said Raj Nayak, a media consultant and former CEO of Colors. Sunil Lulla, the former group CEO of ALTBalaji, had earlier said that the “Mahabharat of all content battles will be fought on digital"", with the category expected to touch  ₹30,000 crore in the next five years. Experts believe Zee Entertainment may get bruised in this battle, considering the group’s founder, Subhash Chandra, has too minor a stake to bet on the big play. Eventually, Zee may be a target for a global media company with its new investors looking for returns. “They are not in it for emotional investment,"" said Thakkar. Clearly, for now, consolidation is the buzzword in the media and entertainment industry with large broadcasting corporations coming together to take on new tech firms such as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix, which have entered the content space. It remains to be seen whether Viacom will continue to be a part of the proposed Sony-TV18 deal, or prefer to exit the market.
