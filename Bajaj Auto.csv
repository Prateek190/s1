New Delhi: India’s two-wheeler industry continued to post robust sales growth in December, led by Royal Enfield and Bajaj Auto.

The company had sold 26,495 units in December 2016, SMIPL said in a statement. Domestic sales stood at 32,786 units last month as against 21,362 units in December 2016, a growth of 53.47%.

96,2018-01-11,Bajaj Auto,"Bajaj Auto's Discover 110 has an engine displacement of 115.5cc while the new Discover 125 packs in 124.5cc, the company expects 20% market share in 2018 in the executive segment of bikes

Pune-based Bajaj Auto Ltd plans to focus on the executive segment in motorcycles with the launch of its Discover 110 and a new version of the Discover 125 motocycles on Wednesday. 
Pune-based Bajaj Auto Ltd plans to focus on the executive segment in motorcycles with the launch of its Discover 110 and a new version of the Discover 125 motocycles on Wednesday.
Bikes with engine displacement of 100cc to 135cc are considered to be in the executive segment by the maker of Pulsar motorcycle.
“We would like to exit calendar 2018 with a 20% market share in the executive segment. These two bikes should increment annual sales by about 50,000 to 70,000 units to meet the target,"" Eric Vas, president of the company’s motorcycles division, said at a press conference.
Prior to the launch, Bajaj had a lone offering in the segment, the Discover 125, which has a market share in single digits, the company said. The executive segment is being seen as an opportunity since it accounts for nearly half of total motorcycle sales, according to Vas.
Bajaj had a cumulative market share of 31% in the entry-level (under 100cc) and premium (above 150cc) segments in the fiscal 2017, according to a company presentation made at the event. “Having created a leadership position in the entry-level and premium segments, resources will pivot around the executive segment which is a huge opportunity,"" Vas said, adding that the company will not take its eyes off other segments. 
According to Vas, consumer preference over the past 12 months has shifted to 110cc and 125cc motorcycles from the volume-driving 100cc segment. The Discover 110 has an engine displacement of 115.5cc while the new Discover 125 packs in 124.5cc. Both engines are compliant with the Bharat Stage VI pollution norms.
“We believe this brand will appeal to that customer who wants to upgrade from 100cc but doesn’t want to go to 150cc,"" he said. 
For the fiscal up to November, Bajaj’s sales grew 23.8% to 1,74,566 units in the 110cc to 125cc segment while the broader segment clocked 18,15,750 units, a 13.1% rise, as per data provided by industry body Siam (Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers). Automakers consider dispatches to dealerships as sales. The category includes other Bajaj models such as the Platina and Boxer. 
After making various changes in engine displacement within the Discover brand since its launch in 2005, Bajaj Auto seems to have settled down. “There will be no other additions under this brand. For the past two-and-a-half years, we relooked at our strategy and have aligned ourselves with the reality of the market. We believe we have the right set of decisions around the Discover,"" Vas said.
Planning to garner 23% of total motorcycle market share by the end of 2018, the maker of the Pulsar is expecting a major contribution from this segment. According to Vas, semi-urban and rural geographies would account for 65% of Discover sales, as is true for the broader executive segment. 
Bajaj’s dealership footprint has over 600 dealers, most of whom are in urban areas. The network is set to expand across geographies during the year, Sumeet Narang, vice president of marketing, said without disclosing specifics.
Analysts say the going will be tough in a fiercely competitive segment dominated by Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd (HMSI) and Hero MotoCorp Ltd. Weighing in will be the shift in preference from commuter motorcycles to scooters, said Aditya Jhawar, an analyst at Investec Capital Services (India) Pvt. Ltd.
“There is not much buoyancy in the motorcycles market, so when the market is not growing, players will need to be more aggressive. While the new launches have more features, it will be an uphill task for Bajaj to meet its target only with the Discover brand. Increased efforts towards more cohesive strategy will help,"" he added.
Lower brand recall for the Discover brand will not help matters, said another analyst on condition of anonymity. “The volumes for the Discover have been falling in the past year owing to Hero’s aggressiveness. Bajaj will be able to clock the desired volumes only if they have a unique way of reaching the customer,"" he said."
95,2018-01-25,Bajaj Auto,"Bajaj Auto management was to revise the three-year wage agreement with its over 1,000 permanent employees at the Chakan plant in 2016 but it has still not moved on the issue

Mumbai: Employees union at Bajaj Auto’s Chakan plant has threatened to go on an indefinite hunger strike from Monday over the non-revision of wages. 
Mumbai: Employees union at Bajaj Auto’s Chakan plant has threatened to go on an indefinite hunger strike from Monday over the non-revision of wages.
The Bajaj Auto management was to revise the three-year wage agreement with its over 1,000 permanent employees at the Chakan plant in 2016 but it has still not moved on the issue, a union leader said today.
The Chakan plant, which produces the Pulsar, Avenger, KTM and Dominor bikes, employs around 1,800 of which 1,000 are on the permanent roll.
“As many as 40 meetings have taken place between the management and the union over the wage revision agreement for the April 2016-March 2019 period. However, there is no outcome. All efforts of the union to arrive at an amicable solution have gone in vain,"" the leader said.
Not only this, “without consulting us, the management deposited higher wages into our accounts. Therefore, our (Vishwa Kalyan Kangar Sangathan) president Dilip Pawar has decided to go on indefinite hunger strike from January 29,"" the union leader said.
The union has already served a notice to both the Labour Commissioner as well as the company about the hunger strike decision, he said. 
Bajaj Auto management’s response to a query on this issue was awaited.
As per the union, the management has also not yet addressed the issue taking back the 16 dismissed union office-bearers for various reasons in 2016-17. “The services of our office bearers were terminated without waiting for the final outcome of a court ruling,"" the leader alleged.
The Chakan plant has a capacity of 3,000 bikes-the Pulsar (160cc, 180cc 200cc and 220cc), the Avenger (150cc and 220cc), KTM (125cc, 200cc, 250cc, 390cc) and the Dominor 400 -- per day, the union leader said."

New Delhi: Bajaj Auto on Tuesday said workers at its manufacturing plants at Akurdi and Chakan in Maharashtra have gone on an indefinite hunger strike.  
New Delhi: Bajaj Auto on Tuesday said workers at its manufacturing plants at Akurdi and Chakan in Maharashtra have gone on an indefinite hunger strike. 
Earlier this month, the company had received a notice from the workers union—Vishwa Kalyan Kamgar Sanghatana—for an indefinite hunger strike at the two plants from 29 January. In a regulatory filing, Bajaj Auto said the main reasons for the indefinite hunger strike as mentioned in the letter are the pending issue of eight workmen dismissed from the services for various acts of misconduct in 2013-14. 
Moreover, the workers were demanding the reinstatement of six dismissed workers who according to the company “did not report at the place of transfer/ deputation in spite of court orders"" and delay in conclusion of the wage review process which is due with effect from 1 April 2016. 
“The matter is pending before the Industrial Court, Pune and High Court of Bombay,"" the two wheeler major said. The company further said that “inspite of considerable progress made in concluding the wage review process, the union has chosen to adopt tools of hunger strike etc for pursuing their unreasonable and unrealistic demand."" 
Bajaj Auto claimed that production at both the plants continued to be normal. According to the union leaders, the company management was to revise the three-year wage agreement with its over 1,000 permanent employees at the Chakan plant in 2016 but it has still not moved on the issue."

92,2018-02-03,Bajaj Auto,"Bajaj Auto's net sales rose 18.7% to Rs6,246.23 crore in the December quarter from Rs5,262.8 crore a year earlier

Bajaj Auto Ltd on Friday reported a 3% rise in December quarter net profit, snapping out of a downward trend that lasted for four consecutive quarters up to September, on the back of higher three-wheeler and motorcycle sales in both overseas and domestic markets.  
Bajaj Auto Ltd on Friday reported a 3% rise in December quarter net profit, snapping out of a downward trend that lasted for four consecutive quarters up to September, on the back of higher three-wheeler and motorcycle sales in both overseas and domestic markets. 
Net profit at the maker of Pulsar and Discover motorcycles rose to Rs952.44 crore in the three months ended 31 December from Rs924.62 crore a year ago, the company said in a statement to BSE. Net sales rose 18.7% to Rs6,246.23 crore from Rs5,262.8 crore a year earlier. 
The Pune-based automaker was expected to post a profit of Rs1,025.8 crore on net sales of Rs6,106 crore, according to a Bloomberg survey of three analysts.
Sales for this fiscal year are not comparable to the previous year’s earnings because they are disclosed net of the goods and services tax introduced in July, Bajaj Auto said in the statement. 
The company’s motorcycle volumes during the quarter (including exports) advanced by 9.3% to 818,510 units over the same period a year ago while total three-wheeler sales jumped 78.2% to 182,959 units, led by the domestic market. 
Bajaj Auto’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin, a measure of operating profitability, narrowed to 20.6% in the quarter from 22% a year ago. 
Analysts warn against comparing December quarter financials with the year-ago quarter owing to the base effect created by demonetization which weakened sales and production. 
Nevertheless, margins and net profit came in lower than expected owing to lower investment income and higher promotion expenses, they said, while conceding that revenues surpassed market estimates. 
“Revenues were above our estimates due to healthy domestic realization,"" said Bibhishan Jagtap, an analyst at brokerage house IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd, in a note. Net profit, led by a higher tax rate, was below estimates, as were Ebitda margins, he added. 
Margins were further crimped by higher expenses on raw materials including steel, aluminium and lead, since raw material costs as a percentage of sales in the quarter rose to 63.6% from 56.8% a year ago. They could have shrunk further if not for a richer product mix of three-wheelers and premium motorcycles. 
The average realization per unit during the three months to December grew 7% to Rs63,600 from Rs59,400 in the year-ago period, according to S. Ravikumar, president of business development and assurance at the firm. 
In the domestic three-wheeler market, Bajaj Auto outperformed its peers with a doubling of volumes to 110,123 units during the quarter but marginally fell behind in the overseas market while still remaining India’s top exporter, growing 48.4% to 72,836 units over the previous year. 
According to data from industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, Bajaj Auto’s domestic bike sales have lagged behind India’s broader motorcycle market, which grew by 14.8% to 2,851,776 units during the quarter. The company’s sales were almost flat at 466,431 units in the same period. 
The export performance was encouraging with a 21.6% jump to 352,079 units during the quarter, though broader bike exports grew at 27.9% to 619,610 units. 
“New markets such as the Philippines, Nigeria and Bangladesh contributed close to half of overall export volumes for the fiscal so far and are expected to gain traction as they stabilize over the next two to three years,"" said Ravikumar. 
The company expects to export close to 1.7 million units in FY18, he added, down from the 1.8 million units target announced in the September quarter. 
On the domestic front, Ravikumar believes the company has filled the gaps in its “slightly weak"" product range with the launch of two Discover and Avenger bikes in early January. The Discover 110 and 125 are fresh launches, placed in the executive segment, whereas the refreshed Avenger Cruise 220 and Street 220 are premium bikes. 
“The CT, Platina, Pulsar and KTM bikes led volumes during the December quarter. Our volumes and market share will be helped further by the newly launched Discovers and Avengers, as was reflected in January sales,"" he said. 
Up to the December quarter, Bajaj Auto’s market share in the domestic motorcycle market was 16.4%. The firm aims to exit FY18 with a 24% market share. 
On Friday, Bajaj Auto shares closed at Rs3,242, down 4.9% on BSE, while the benchmark Sensex ended 2.34% lower at 35,066.75 points."
91,2018-02-05,Bajaj Auto,"Bajaj Auto's market share is being affected by competition and the lack of steady success with new motorcycles

Bajaj Auto Ltd is missing the profitability spark. Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin in the recently concluded December quarter narrowed from both the earlier quarter and a year ago despite the double digit growth in volume and revenue (see chart). 
Bajaj Auto Ltd is missing the profitability spark. Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin in the recently concluded December quarter narrowed from both the earlier quarter and a year ago despite the double digit growth in volume and revenue (see chart).
Margins softened in spite of a better product mix. Thanks to resurgent crude prices, exports recovered sharply. Even commercial vehicle sales, which in general have higher realizations, picked-up. While these two segments—exports and commercial vehicles—drove earnings performance, the domestic motorcycles business remained a laggard. Sales during the quarter increased just 2%.
To be sure, the motorcycle business was challenged by high raw material costs in Q3. But it also faces structural issues. Competition and the lack of steady success with new motorcycles is affecting market share. From around 20% three years ago, the company’s market share in domestic motorcycles market fell to 16.4% last quarter.
To shore up volume, the company increased focus on entry and mid-level motorcycle segments which have gained sales momentum of late. But this also tilted the scales in favour of relatively lower-priced models, weighing on margins. “It (Ebitda margin) came below consensus estimates due to inferior product mix from the domestic motorcycle segment,"" an analyst said in a note to clients on the earnings.
The company does have a strong presence in premium or higher-priced models. But growth is lacking. For instance, the Pulsar, Avenger and Dominar models together clocked sales of 173,000 units last quarter, slightly lower than 178,000 units in the year ago quarter. 
“Although Bajaj Auto’s performance has improved in volume terms, no participation in the growing scooter segment and failure of recent launches like Avenger & V12/15 remains a concern for us. We await any announcement on future products through their partnership with Triumph Motorcycles UK,"" ICICI Securities said in a note. The Avenger and V12/15 models are priced higher than the entry-level segment.
That said, Bharat Gianani, an analyst at Sharekhan, reasons the problem is not so much with the premium motorcycle part of the business but with the entry and mid-level segments which is a large market and where Bajaj Auto has lagged in recent years. With sales in this part (entry and mid-level) of the business gaining momentum the company may maintain volume and revenue growth in the near term. But that also means margins may remain constant or profitability may not improve much, Gianani adds.
Of course, Bajaj Auto’s profitability has historically ranged between 20-22%. The current levels are not that far away. Further they are superior to its two listed peers. But the journey to retrace operating margin to their historical levels will be arduous."

Bajaj Auto Ltd may boast about being the world’s third-largest motorcycle manufacturer, but the fact remains that it has lost out to competition on domestic roads. 
March sales numbers finally nailed it for fiscal year 2018 (FY18). The 5% growth year-on-year during the month closed FY18 with a 1% sales contraction in motorcycles on domestic roads. Fortunately robust exports gave a leg-up to total sales for the year, which were 5% higher year-on-year.
The pathetic performance stands out as motorcycle and two-wheeler sales as a whole zoomed for all its peers.
In the listed space, Hero MotoCorp Ltd’s highest-ever monthly sales in March propelled its annual sales record up by 14% from the year-ago period. Even TVS Motor Co. Ltd, which was a laggard for a long time in the comparable space, turned out a stellar 26% annual growth in motorcycle sales. The firm excelled in scooter sales that shot up by 30%.

Sales of two-wheelers have increased 25% in the quarter ended 31 March, driven by higher demand for commuter motorcycles.

Input prices continued to rise during the quarter—prices of steel sheets, used to make vehicles, increased by 12.5%.
Operating margins of vehicle makers, except Tata Motors Ltd, are expected to widen for the third straight quarter, according to analyst estimates. Among two-wheeler makers, Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp may report operating margin expanded in the fourth quarter.
The revival in sales of commercial vehicle, motorcycle and tractor sales during the quarter will boost earnings of companies including Mahindra and Mahindra, Ashok Leyland, Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto. 
With strong volume growth and operating leverage benefits coming in the fourth quarter, companies are expected to report improvement in margins correspondingly, according to Gaurant Dadwal and Vivek Sarin, analysts at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities.
“Ashok Leyland’s topline is expected to increase by 33% driven by 23% jump in volumes and 10% increase in average selling price. Ebitda (operating) margin to expand by 120 bps sequentially led by operating leverage benefit and favourable mix,"" HDFC Securities analysts said in a research note. Most brokerages expect substantial improvement in the standalone earnings of Tata Motors, driven by the recovery in commercial and passenger vehicle sales during the quarter."

Mumbai: Bajaj Auto Ltd on Friday reported a 34.67% jump in March quarter (Q4) net profit on the back of higher motorcycle and three-wheeler sales in domestic and overseas markets.
Bajaj Auto’s Q4 FY18 result is the second consecutive quarter in which its profits have shown an upturn, after a downturn that lasted four quarters.
Net profit at the maker of Pulsar and Discover motorcycles rose to Rs1,079.87 crore in the three months ended 31 March from Rs801.82 crore a year ago, the company said in a regulatory filing. Net sales rose 29.89% to Rs6,650.81 crore from Rs5,120.54 crore a year earlier.
The Pune-based automaker was expected to post a profit of Rs1,047.40 crore on net sales of Rs6645.30 crore, according to a Bloomberg survey of 27 analysts.
Bajaj Auto’s sales for FY18 are not comparable to the previous year’s earnings because they are disclosed net of the goods and services tax (GST) introduced in July, Bajaj Auto said in the statement.
Total sales during the quarter rose 32.72% to1,045,378 units, with motorcycle volumes (including exports) advancing by 22.16% to 856,389 units over a year ago, posting growth upwards of 20% in both, domestic and overseas markets.

The March quarter (Q4) earnings bring good tidings for Bajaj Auto Ltd’s investors. Particularly noteworthy is the ramp-up in three-wheeler and commercial vehicle (CV) sales. Maharashtra’s move to open up three-wheeler permits aided Bajaj Auto’s sales in the segment—they rose a huge 144% year-on-year. Further, segment exports rose 83% on the back of improving conditions in Egypt and forays in new markets. The depreciating rupee gave a leg-up to revenue during the quarter. 
The March quarter (Q4) earnings bring good tidings for Bajaj Auto Ltd’s investors. Particularly noteworthy is the ramp-up in three-wheeler and commercial vehicle (CV) sales. Maharashtra’s move to open up three-wheeler permits aided Bajaj Auto’s sales in the segment—they rose a huge 144% year-on-year. Further, segment exports rose 83% on the back of improving conditions in Egypt and forays in new markets. The depreciating rupee gave a leg-up to revenue during the quarter.
Likewise, the going was good for motorcycle exports, which grew by 25% year-on-year outperforming domestic sales growth of 20% year-on-year. In its media release, the firm explained that a strong recovery in Nigeria, focus on the sports segment in Latin America, and new launches in the Philippines and Malaysia drove export volumes.
According to some analysts, Bajaj Auto’s efforts to plug key gaps in its product portfolio and take pricing action where necessary paid rich returns. Net revenue growth of 38.3% from a year ago beat Bloomberg analysts’ forecast. Rising exports and a depreciating rupee shored up average realizations for the quarter, which was 4% higher year-on-year.
In spite of this, the pressure from rising raw material costs is evident from the decline in gross margins. As a percentage of sales, it rose by about 150 basis points. However, lower “other expenses"" offset this. Hence operating margin at 19.4% was 90 basis points higher than the year-ago period and was also in-line with estimates, maintaining the run rate of margins above 19% for the last three quarters. 
With costs reined in, high revenue growth trickled down to a 45% growth in operating profit at Rs1,315 crore that also beat the Street’s forecasts of Rs1,297 crore. Investors must note that Bajaj Auto has had a steady stream of “other income"" through prudent investments. The 25% year-on-year jump in “other income"" shored up the standalone net profit, which at Rs1,080 crore was slightly higher than what 27 brokerage firms with Bloomberg had pencilled in. 
What’s the issue then? Why is the stock lagging its peers?
While Bajaj Auto’s performance ticked all the boxes on the scorecard for the quarter, its showing in the domestic motorcycle market is worrisome. Lack of scooters in its product portfolio has dragged performance for a couple of years. Motorcycle growth has fallen prey to competition. FY18 motorcycle sales grew by a minuscule 5% compared to a roaring 14% and 22% at the top two producers Hero MotoCorp Ltd and Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd, respectively. According to Bharat Gianani, an analyst at Sharekhan Ltd, “While the export volume outlook remains strong, Bajaj faces intense competition in the domestic market which will lead to continued market share erosion for the company.""
Given this scenario, the underperformance of Bajaj Auto’s stock to benchmark indices and to the competition is not surprising. Certainly, the CV segment and exports have led the company out of the woods, but it needs to prove its mettle for valuations to stretch from the current level of 16 times one-year forward estimated earnings."

Mumbai: India’s second-largest motorcycle maker Bajaj Auto Ltd on Friday reported a 20.71% jump in June quarter (Q1) net profit, compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year on the back of higher motorcycle and three-wheeler sales in domestic and overseas markets. 
Mumbai: India’s second-largest motorcycle maker Bajaj Auto Ltd on Friday reported a 20.71% jump in June quarter (Q1) net profit, compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year on the back of higher motorcycle and three-wheeler sales in domestic and overseas markets.
Bajaj Auto continued to be in the black for the third consecutive quarter, after a downturn over four quarters.
Net profit at the maker of Pulsar and Discover motorcycles rose to  ₹ 1,115.23 crore in the three months to 30 June from  ₹ 923.93 crore in the year-ago period, the company said in a regulatory filing. Net sales rose 26.6% to  ₹ 7,267.19 crore from  ₹ 5,740.3 crore a year earlier.
The results were well below estimates. A Bloomberg survey of 23 analysts expected the Pune-based automaker to post a profit of  ₹ 1,249 crore on net sales of  ₹ 7,764.7 crore.
Bajaj Auto’s sales for this quarter are not comparable with the year ago because they are disclosed net excluding of the goods and services tax (GST) introduced in July, Bajaj Auto said. Analysts also warn against making year-on-year comparisons, because of heavy pre-buying ahead of April when the Supreme Court unexpectedly ruled in favour of migration to the Bharat Stage IV emission norms.
Total sales volumes during the quarter rose 38.1% to 1,226,641 units, with motorcycle volumes (including exports) advancing 33% to 1,029,964 units over a year ago, posting growth upwards of 20% in both domestic and overseas markets. Total three-wheeler sales jumped 74% to 196,677 units, led by the domestic market.
For the quarter, Bajaj Auto’s reported Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin, a key measure of operating profitability, remained flat at 18.4% as compared to a year ago. 
The Ebitda margin has fallen below 20% for the first time in four quarters, on the back of a 1.2% decline in net realizations during the quarter. Historically, Bajaj has prided itself on maintaining margins upwards of 20%.
Revenues, margins and net profit were below estimates, said Abhishek Jain of HDFC Securities in a note, because of price cuts taken on low-margin models CT 100 and Platina, which together accounted for 49.7% of domestic sales volumes as compared to 43.1% a year ago.
Margins were also pinched by higher expenses on inputs including steel, aluminium and lead, with raw material costs as a percentage of sales rising to 66.2% from 59.6% a year ago. Bajaj’s product mix became unfavourable as entry-level motorcycles had a greater contribution to volumes than the high-margin categories of three-wheelers and premium motorcycles.
The maker of the Dominar motorcycle will “do what it takes"" to corner a larger share of the domestic motorcycle market with “as few cost implications as possible"", according to S. Ravikumar, president of business development and assurance at the firm.
On the question of sacrificing margins to gain market share, Ravikumar said the 20% level would be maintained even as Bajaj Auto strives to improve its domestic market share.
“For each brand, we have to decide what is required. In the entry-level bikes, there is only a price play. Beyond that, there are many more levers that will enable us to recover a few thousand rupees in pricing,"" he said.
In the domestic three-wheeler market, Bajaj Auto outperformed its peers to clock 94,431 units during the quarter while marginally falling behind peers in the overseas market, growing 68.86% to 101,424 units over the previous year.
The export performance was encouraging as well, with a 24.8% jump to 435,730 units during the quarter."
79,2018-07-23,Bajaj Auto,"Bajaj Auto's strategy to push its entry-level motorcycles and perhaps dole out higher dealer incentives translated into lower-than-expected realization on sales

Bajaj Auto Ltd’s feeble performance in the April to June (Q1) quarter has shocked the Street. As revenue, profit and margins missed Bloomberg estimates, Bajaj Auto stock plunged 8.7% on Friday. What are the key takeaways from this weak quarter? 
Bajaj Auto Ltd’s feeble performance in the April to June (Q1) quarter has shocked the Street. As revenue, profit and margins missed Bloomberg estimates, Bajaj Auto stock plunged 8.7% on Friday. What are the key takeaways from this weak quarter?
Undoubtedly, the two-wheeler and commercial vehicle maker is facing the heat of competition.
At a time when costs are rising and most automakers across segments took price hikes, Bajaj Auto cut prices sharply on some vehicles. Its strategy to push its entry-level motorcycles and perhaps dole out higher dealer incentives translated into lower-than-expected realization on sales. The 1.3% decline in average realization did not go down well with investors, given expectations of a 6% year-on-year (y-o-y) increase.
To be sure, the firm’s domestic motorcycle market share inched by about 100-150 basis points (bps) to 16.3% when compared to the year-ago period. Share in the entry-level segment rose by a higher 850bps to 33.7%. On the whole, the quarter’s sales volume jumped by 38% yoy. 
But the trade-off was profitability. Ebitda (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin of 17.3% was 220bps below the estimate on the Street, although in line with the year-before period. 
Another takeaway is that the export realizations were weaker-than-expected, which is surprising given the scenario of a depreciated rupee and the highest-ever quarterly exports. Explaining the disappointing performance, Bharat Gianani, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services says, “adverse product mix, pricing pressures due to intense competition and lower than anticipated gain on USD/INR realisation led to margin miss.""
The question is whether this quarter’s performance is a temporary blip. The analysts’ call on Monday may bring greater clarity. However, analysts reckon that this may be a strategy by the firm to garner more market share through a rural push as well. After all, from FY2010-FY2018, Bajaj Auto’s Ebitda margin had narrowed from 24.3% to 15.7%. 
One can only hope that this strategy plays out in its favour over the longer term. The stock, which had just started its upward rally after strong sales numbers since April, nosedived on the results. At  ₹ 2,841, it trades at 17 times estimated earnings for FY2019. However, downside risks continue as weak realisations, rising costs and margin pressure make a strong case for a cut in earnings estimates."

72,2019-01-21,Bajaj Auto,"The company plans to launch electric version of its quadricycle Qute along with electric three-wheelers next yearBajaj said that the company has leadership positions in over 20 overseas markets 

Pune-based Bajaj Auto is planning to make a foray into electric vehicles (EV) next year, simultaneously with the migration of its conventional engine vehicles to BS-VI emission norms, its Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj said Monday.
The company plans to launch electric version of its quadricycle Qute along with electric three-wheelers next year, even as it gears up to introduce the conventional engine version of the quadricycle around March after much delay.
Bajaj Auto, which on Monday announced a new identity -- 'The World's Favourite Indian' -- to reflect its leadership position in motorcycle segment in many of the overseas markets, also said it was looking to replicate the success in its home market and increase its share.
He also said the company would bring KTM-owned 'Husqvarna' motorcycle brand to the Indian market this year with ""half a dozen"" products in the pipeline.
""Electric Qute and electric three-wheelers are very much on our agenda...In line with BS-VI, which comes into force from April next year, just as we make our petrol and diesel vehicles compliant with BS-VI, it is our objective to also introduce electric vehicles in terms of Qute and three-wheelers,"" Bajaj told reporters here.
He, however, hastened to add that there could be a bit of 'back and forth' in terms of the exact timeline as ""when you are dealing with new technology, everything is not certain"".
Stressing on the significance of the company's foray into EVs, he said: ""This we need to do not only for India but for many of our other markets as well. The problem of pollution and congestion and the need for EVs, shared and connected mobility is there, too.""
Bajaj Auto has already started exporting Qute to around 20 countries but has not been able to launch it in India due to regulatory hurdles.
When asked by when the Qute would finally be launched in India, Bajaj Auto Executive Director Rakesh Sharma said it could happen around March as the company is in the last stage of getting final approvals in various states.
Commenting on ambitions for the domestic market in the motorcycle segment, Bajaj said the company has leadership positions in over 20 overseas markets such as 70 per cent share in Bangladesh and around 50 per cent in Nepal and Sri Lanka and it would like to replicate the same in India also.
""We are also a company which, we would like to be a little more successful in the domestic market than we have been so far in the motorcycles market,"" he said.
In India, he further said: ""We have only 20-21 per cent share. We think now the time has also come that after having done a good job overseas, after having huge dominant position in India in three-wheelers, it is about time we make the same impact in the domestic motorcycle segment in India as we have done across the world.""
Citing SIAM data, Bajaj said that in the last nine months, the company has added almost 6-7 per cent market share to its domestic motocycle market.
This is double of Yamaha's bike market share in its 35 years of presence in India, equivalent of TVS Motor Co's lifetime market share and Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India's motorcycle market share since parting ways with Hero in 2010, Bajaj said.
Stating that the company wants to increase its market share, Bajaj said: ""This is now the main focus of our energy and attention in the near future.""
When asked if the company had set any target, he replied in the negative.
""Last year, if we had asked ourselves, if we could add market share equal to that of TVS, double of Yamaha and almost half of HMSI in just nine months, it could have sounded frightening,"" he said.
On the Husqvarna bikes, Bajaj said the brand had a potential to become even bigger than KTM, not just in India but across the globe.
Bajaj, however, declined to comment on future products from the company's partnership with British niche bikemaker Triumph saying work has already started with Bajaj Auto taking responsibility of the engineering part.

69,2019-01-31,Bajaj Auto,"Ebitda margin at 15.6% plunged 400 basis points year-on-year. This dampened an already weak market sentimentThe moot question is whether margins would continue their downward trajectory

There’s no gain without pain"". Bajaj Auto Ltd’s December quarter performance ratifies this idiom, although investors seem to be finding the pain too much to bear. Without doubt, its aggressive pricing strategy in motorcycles over the last few quarters accelerated sales. It also helped regain lost market share. But it took a hefty toll on profitability.
Bajaj Auto’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin at 15.6% plunged 400 basis points year-on-year. This dampened an already weak investor sentiment. Analysts had estimated margins of 16-17%, which the management was also confident of achieving. Ebitda fell 7.5% to  ₹1,156 crore, below the average forecast of 22 analysts on Bloomberg.
The margin problem is centred around Bajaj Auto’s need to regain market share in domestic motorcycles. Recall that about six months ago, its managing director Rajiv Bajaj had said the company was pursuing aggressive pricing in the entry-level segment. Analysts had then turned cautious in their earnings outlook, estimating that it would take a toll on profitability.
Of course, the pricing strategy improved the market share in motorcycles by 400 basis points to 20%. Higher sales also grew revenue by 16% despite an 8% drop in net realizations.
Meanwhile, there have been other challenges too. Bajaj Auto’s commercial vehicle (mainly three-wheelers) sales fell 17% year-on-year.
What disappointed the Street even more was the sequential drop of 120 basis points in profit margins, in spite of lower material costs. In the analysts’ concall, the management explained that this was due to adverse foreign exchange impact, lower exports and lower commercial vehicle volumes.
The moot question is whether margins would continue their downward trajectory. At this juncture, it does not look like things will turn in a jiffy given both the industry and the company are faced with headwinds. The Street and industry expect demand to remain subdued for the next 12-18 months. Higher ownership costs due to higher cost of insurance and emission-related technological modifications in the product, will lead to slower sales offtake at least for some quarters.
Further, Bajaj Auto is likely to incur high ad spend in the current quarter that would also weigh on profitability. In addition, “its strategy to gain market share in domestic motorcycles through pricing strategy would continue to hurt margins"", explains Bharat Gianani, analyst at Sharekhan Ltd.
That said, the company is trying to enhance realizations through a better sales mix in the domestic markets and higher exports. The management is also trying to increase localization in exports in large markets such as Egypt and save costs.
However, stiff competition in the domestic two-wheeler segment and watered down realizations will keep margin expansion at bay for some more quarters. Obviously, this will keep the share price range bound. The Bajaj Auto stock has already fallen by about 9% since April. Even so, the current price of  ₹2,499 discounts estimated FY21 earnings by around 15 times, which is not cheap given the challenges ahead."

The tie-up between Bajaj Auto Ltd and Britain’s Triumph Motorcycles Ltd is set to pose a significant challenge to Royal Enfield, the undisputed leader of the 350-600cc middleweight premium motorcycle pack in India and other emerging markets. As part of the partnership, Triumph, a premium British motorcycle manufacturer, will take the lead in product development and design, while Bajaj will use its extensive vendor base to reduce the manufacturing cost.
The Bajaj-Triumph alliance is also eyeing the South-East Asian, African and Latin American markets, where Royal Enfield is present.
Bajaj and Triumph had formed a non-equity partnership in August 2017 for a global alliance to develop “mid-capacity motorcycles"". However, final touches to the commercial agreement between the two are still in the works.
According to Shoeb Farooq, general manager, Triumph Motorcycles India, the idea is to use the strength of Bajaj and its huge vendor base to bring down costs.
“On the product side, things are progressing well and, in another few months, the commercial agreement will be there. The research and development, design and quality of the b will be driven by Triumph. Every manufacturer has certain capabilities, such as the vendor base and the ability to bring down the price, which Triumph does not possess,"" said Farooq in an interview.
Royal Enfield has dominated middleweight bikes in India, but this segment is attracting increasing interest from both domestic and foreign firms, drawn by the potential of bigger operating margins accruing from higher price points.
In addition, following an increase in sales of bikes above 150cc, companies expect the market for the 350cc category to expand. The re-entry of Czech’s Jawa Motorcycles into India, announcements by American motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc., and the Bajaj-Triumph alliance are a testament to the emerging opportunities.
According to Farooq, there is huge growth possibility in this segment not only in India, but also in South-East Asia, Africa and Latin America.
“It is not about India alone, but also about picking up the right markets globally and taking this product and the collaboration there. Once the commercial agreement is done, I guess work on the distribution side of the business will begin, which is regarding how the product will be launched in the market,"" Farooq said."
65,2019-02-28,Bajaj Auto,"For two-wheeler firms, inventory levels continue to remain high at 40-45 days, with no respite seen in the near termDiscounts and incentives are failing to power two-wheeler sales at Hero, Honda, TVS and Bajaj in a seasonally strong quarter

It looks like the pressure on two-wheeler companies is mounting. February data on two-wheeler retail sales paints a weak picture for March quarter sales, analysts at some leading brokerage firms have pointed out.
Even though dispatches from companies to dealers were lowered, inventory continues to pile up. Discounts and incentives are failing to power sales. Inventory levels continue to remain high at 40-45 days, with no respite seen in the near term. Normally, with January and February being the season for weddings, demand for two-wheelers tends to rev up. For instance, sales grew 25-35% year-on-year in these two months.
The slowdown in two-wheeler sales was triggered by a hike in insurance premium about six months ago. The payment schedule for mandatory third-party insurance was changed from an annual fee to a five-year term, payable upfront at the time of purchase of a new bike. This led to a sharp increase in the purchase price of motorcycles.
Meanwhile, Bajaj Auto Ltd’s aggressive pricing strategy to regain lost market share in motorcycles increased competition. According to Bharat Gianani, analyst at Sharekhan Ltd, “Bajaj Auto’s market share in domestic motorcycles inched up sharply by 280 bps (basis points) to 18.4% in the nine months of FY2019 and it is targeting 24% market share. So, the strategy will continue for some time, implying high competitive intensity in two-wheelers.""
Analysts and dealers say even Hero MotoCorp Ltd has enhanced incentives at the retail level, which are about  ₹3,500 per bike. Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd too has been battling in the marketplace, as it had ceded share to some incumbents in the recent past.
To sum up, falling sales and high discounts are the order of the day. This does not augur well for two-wheeler manufacturers. A report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd says, “We expect Bajaj Auto and TVS wholesales to grow 2.4%/15.3% yoy (year-on-year), while Hero MotoCorp dispatches are seen declining 13%"".
Also read: Budget proposals can put two-wheeler segment in the fast lane
That’s not all. Profit margins are bound to be impacted too. “Persistent weakness in retail volumes and higher discounting could trigger further earnings downgrades,"" says Gianani of Sharekhan. Note that brokerage firms had flagged these concerns almost two quarters before, and stock prices have corrected already.
Share prices of Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motor Co. Ltd are down 25% and 32%, respectively, in the past year. Bajaj Auto has been better off, as it gained market share, besides which exports and its three-wheeler segment supported revenue and profit growth."

62,2019-03-29,Bajaj Auto,"The top court said the cap imposed on autorickshaw in Delhi can be removed only after empirical data collectionThe apex court said adding more autos in the city may lead to more congestion and traffic snarls in the city

New Delhi: The Supreme Court Friday said the cap imposed on autorickshaw in the national capital can be removed only after empirical data collection and by ascertaining how many vehicles the roads in the city can tolerate.
The top court said Delhi is already overcrowded with almost 32 lakh cars and adding more autos in the city may lead to more congestion and traffic snarls in the city.
A bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta said views of the Delhi government are also required in the matter before passing any direction on the plea filed by Bajaj Auto seeking removal of cap on autorickshaw.
The lawyer, appearing for Bajaj, referred to the Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA) report which has sought removal of the present cap of one lakh autos in Delhi.
The EPCA, in its report, said the lack of a competitive, comprehensive origin-to-destination public transport system, including first and last-mile connectivity, has directly contributed to increased private ownership of vehicles, as well as the congestion and pollution resulting from it.
The lawyer told the court that Bajaj was coming out with a new technology in its auto which is more environment-friendly and said the public transport system in the city needs to be strengthened.
""We have to look into the basis of the cap imposed. There has to be some objectivity. We have to see the requirement and how much the roads in Delhi can tolerate. There is already overcrowding of cars. Better technology is ok, but we have to see the requirement and for that an empirical data collection is needed,"" the bench observed.
The apex court said the city is facing parking problems and there is a need to regulate private vehicles as one person has five cars.
The apex court in December 1997 had directed the Delhi government to freeze the total number of fresh autorickshaw permits, and issue new permits only to replace any existing permit.
Later in 1998, the Delhi government launched an incentive programme to replace the autorickshaws with compressed natural gas (CNG).
In 2011, the number was raised to one lakh autorickshaws.

61,2019-04-03,Bajaj Auto,"The sharp drop in two-wheeler sales in March signals production and dispatch cuts in order to rationalize inventory levelsA quick rebound in two-wheeler sales is unlikely as well due to ABS and BS-VI emission norms kicking in from 1 April 2020

Hopes of demand recovery in two-wheelers crashed after manufacturers put up a dismal show in March. Worse, this warrants an earnings cut for FY19. It also paints a gloomy sales growth picture for FY20.
Aggregate domestic sales for March of five leading auto manufacturers plunged 19% year-on-year. This was more than three times the drop in the January-February period. It also weighed on the quarter’s performance, with sales retracing by 11%.
Hero MotoCorp. Ltd’s March sales dropped 20%. Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd’s (HMSI) sales halved from the year-ago period. Even TVS Motor Co. Ltd and Royal Enfield saw sales fall 7% and 20%, respectively.
The outlier in the pack, Bajaj Auto Ltd, however, posted 39% year-on-year increase in domestic sales during March, ending the quarter on an optimistic note with 22% growth.
What’s worrying is that the green shoots of recovery are not visible. “Reports suggest that unemployment is at an all-time high, with the services sector severely hit. More than 60% of farm produce has been sold below the minimum support price, reprising rural distress,"" said Yadvinder Singh Guleria, senior vice-president (sales and marketing), HMSI.
As witnessed in the last decade, whenever two-wheeler demand stuttered, it soon gathered pace. This time around, manufacturers say that the first signs of a slowdown came with the Kerala floods. Later, higher insurance costs pushed up two-wheeler prices by 7-10%, hurting demand. Add to this, fuel price increases, lack of liquidity due to the debacle in non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), clipped sales even during peak seasons of Navaratri and Diwali.
These headwinds kept sales at bay in the second half of FY19. Inventory levels by January-February soared to levels of 70-80 days. The sharp drop in March sales, therefore, signals production and dispatch cuts in order to rationalize inventory levels.
Bleak prospects still stare at auto companies. According to an IIFL Holdings Ltd report, “Our checks with dealers and OEMs suggest that industry-level end-demand, which weakened in mid-FY19, persists. Discounts and promotional schemes are not helping improve volumes."" OEM stands for original equipment manufacturer.
Even if demand picks up following positive triggers such as a good monsoon and the festival season, other challenges exist. Mandatory anti-lock braking system (ABS) and a combi-brake system (CBS) will lead to further price increases. Dealers are cautious regarding sales prospects, given customers have already seen price hikes of 10-15% between 2017 and 2018.
The industry also has to face new BS-VI emission norms, effective April 2021. This will again see the need for clearing inventory of BS-IV vehicles.
The consensus on the Street points to an earnings cut of 4-8% for both FY19 and FY20 across listed two-wheeler firms. “High inventory levels will keep discounts and promotional expenses elevated, which, along with negative operating leverage, will weigh on profit margins,"" adds IIFL Holdings.
No wonder shares of Hero MotoCorp., Eicher Motors Ltd, manufacturer of Royal Enfield motorcycles, and TVS Motor are down around 25% from a year ago. Shares of Bajaj Auto, too, were flat over a year, in spite of clocking an impressive sales growth due to its aggressive marketing strategy."

New Delhi: Hero MotoCorp stretched its lead to around 20 lakh units over rival and erstwhile partner Honda in two-wheeler sales in 2018-19 amid a slowdown in the domestic market.
In the fiscal year ended 31 March, the homegrown two-wheeler major sold 78,20,745 units as compared to 59,00,840 units sold by Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI), according to the latest sales figures issued by the companies.
In the fiscal 2017-18, Hero MotoCorp sold 75,87,130 lakh units, while HMSI sold 61,23,877 units. Thus, Hero's lead over HMSI increased by 19,19,905 lakh units in FY19 as compared to 14,63,253 units in FY18.
Hero said it has been able to keep sales higher during FY19 through forays into premium motorcycle segment with the launch of the 'Xtreme 200R' and the fast growing 125cc scooter segment with Destini 125, besides existing models.
On the other hand, HMSI, which had declared its ambition to be the number one two-wheeler maker in India by 2020 overtaking Hero, said challenging and disruptive second half of 2018-19 significantly wiped off the two-wheeler industry growth of first half.
HMSI cited issue such as increased insurance premium in September 2018 dampened festival sentiments, and pre-festival stock buildup was converted into high inventories for the two-wheeler industry.
The company said it had re-aligned supplies with domestic demand to correct inventories and support its dealer partners.
In FY19, Pune-based Bajaj Auto maintained its position as the third biggest two-wheeler maker in India with sales of 42,36,873 units as against 33,69,334 units in the previous fiscal, a growth of 26%.
TVS Motor Co said it sold 37.57 lakh units in 2018-19 as compared to 33.67 lakh units in the previous year, a growth of 12%."

New Delhi: Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), on Monday appealed to the government to cut goods and services tax (GST) on cars and scooters and bikes from 28% to 18% to ease the incoming pricing pressure on the automobile industry. 
Automobiles, cars and two-wheelers alike, are expected to cost 10-15% more from 1 April 2020, when Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) emission norms and new safety regulations are expected to kick in. The industry fears that with the increase in prices, the demand for their products would be impacted. 
Cars, bikes and scooters at present attract peak GST rate of 28% with additional cess ranging from 1% to 15%, depending on the length, engine size and type.
""We want the government to be sensitive to the fact that BS-VI emission introduction (from 1 Apri1 2020) and other safety regulations will add to the cost. If it adds to the cost it is likely to lead to slowdown in the demand,"" Siam president Rajan Wadhera said. 
If the demand goes down, government collection of taxes would also go down, he said.
""Therefore, for a win-win situation, we are seeking a 18% GST on automobiles.""
A price hike of even 10% would impact the sales of two-wheeler segment, which currently witnesses offtake of over 22 million units annually, Wadhera said.
""On passenger vehicles also, the prices are going to go up in the range of 10-15% due to technology and safety enhancements. There also we need serious considerations by government so that it is a win-win situation for all,"" Wadhera said.
Earlier this year, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd's managing director and chief executive officer, Kenichi Ayukawa, had sought GST cut on cars in order to create demand and develop the industry.
Major two-wheeler companies like TVS Motor Co., Hero MotoCorp Ltd and Bajaj Auto had also demanded a GST rate cut on two-wheelers."

Other recent departures include Ashok Bhasin, who headed the sales and marketing vertical of Hero MotoCorp; Amit Nandi, who headed KTM in India and in other South Asian markets such as Indonesia and Malaysia; Rudratej Singh, former president, Royal Enfield; Vimal Sumbly, ex-managing director, Triumph Motorcycles India; Sajeev Rajasekharan, ex-EVP, Suzuki Motorcycle India; and Roy Kurian, former senior vice president, sales and marketing, Yamaha Motor India Sales.
Bhasin, Hero MotoCorp said, has superannuated at the age of 58.
Industry experts suggest that tough market conditions, including low demand, absence of liquidity, and incoming emission and safety mandates are key contributors to the moves. Data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers earlier on Monday showed domestic dispatches in the two-wheeler industry grew by 4.86% year-on-year in fiscal year 2019.
Speaking to Mint, an industry veteran, who currently occupies a senior leadership position in one of the largest two-wheeler companies in India, requesting anonymity, said: “The two-wheeler market is clearly not doing well, thanks to the tight liquidity. Companies are already having a tough time handling the current headwinds. We have emission and safety norms that are coming up. This shakes up the value chain across R&D and production.""
“We are no leaders in technology. Instead, we lack risk-taking appetite and are driven by paybacks on investments in shorter terms. Indian two-wheeler industry has, for several years, lacked any long-term technology-driven vision, and it has never been at par with the fast changing tech trends globally. Many in their leadership roles don’t know how to handle this transition smoothly and balance out sales at the same time,"" he added.
Siddharth, who has worked with Chennai-based TVS Motor for more than 16 years and was closely involved in building the Apache motorcycle brand, has already served his notice period.
Nandi, on the other hand, has worked with the Pune-based motorcycle manufacturer for more than 12 years across two stints. The primary reasons behind their respective departures are unknown at the moment.
Meanwhile, Sarang Kanade has taken up his new role as head of the motorcycle business unit at Bajaj Auto, the company confirmed.
Last July, Rajiv Bajaj, MD, Bajaj Auto, in a letter to his employees, had announced a major management reshuffle attributing it to “a complex future combining unyielding competitive forces, intensifying regulatory requirements, and escalating disruptive technologies"".
The top boss at Bajaj Auto had, in July 2018, created the position of chief commercial officer (CCO) to bring together all business units in the pursuit of four key issues: Product harmonization, marketing synergies, customer focus and corporate alignment. Rakesh Sharma, who prior to this announcement headed the international business, was promoted to take up the new role. As a result, K.S. Grihapathy was given the role to lead the export business unit.
Explaining her outlook on the prospects of the two-wheeler industry in FY20, Anupama Arora, vice president, sector head – corporate ratings, ICRA, said: “We expect Indian two-wheeler industry to report modest volume growth during FY20 with subdued consumer sentiments continuing to weigh on demand in H1. While easing liquidity issues for NBFC financiers, as well as moderation in commodity inflation, are positives, the tightened safety norms (effective FY20) as well as transition to BS VI norms from April 2020 with significant cost implications, would have significant bearing on vehicle costs, thus dampening demand prospects."""
56,2019-04-09,Bajaj Auto,"Going into previous election cycles, the promise of certainty and a dedicated government has driven sales in the auto sector. This time, it won’t matter if Modi’s party returns—shoppers need to feel like they’ve got the power in their wallets

Heading into an election, India’s enthusiasm for cars and motorcycles has all but evaporated. It’s unlikely to return anytime soon, despite all the grand promises to improve the lives of masses.
Passenger car sales, which have been sliding since last summer, fell another 6% last month while those for two-wheelers—the larger and more profitable market—collapsed 15%. Commercial vehicle sales, which include trucks and buses, also slowed. Overall production in the country’s $70 billion auto industry is slumping. Hero MotoCorp Ltd which commands a third of the market, posted a 20% drop.
This downbeat sentiment should worry investors and policymakers, particularly as Prime Minister Narendra Modi drums up nationalist pride. Inventories are piling up and consumers don't feel like spending. With unemployment soaring, affordability remains a sticking point.
That's partly why India is largely a two-wheeler market, with annual sales of more than 20 million units compared with about 4 million for passenger vehicles.
True, there are lots of cars and motorbikes on the road in India—at close to 30 million and about 170 million, respectively. With more than 1 billion people and low levels of car ownership, this downturn may be a temporary blip, given sales have grown at an average annual rate of 8% to 10% over the past five years.
So why is demand this tepid? Because buyers just can’t spend. That’s particularly the case among younger people, as well as those in rural and smaller urban areas. Hopes are high that Modi’s manifesto will double farmers’ income and create opportunities for India’s youth (which his government thus far has failed to do). Both are unlikely.
Even for those who have money to spend, their choices are, well, boring. Most cars look and feel the same, with models made by Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor Co. dominating the roads. Fancier cars remain inaccessible. On top of that, congestion and pollution are becoming a real menace.
Consumers’ apathy has spread to manufacturers. Despite heavy government protection with import duties, margins are shrinking and companies aren’t re-investing much. While India’s auto sector has outperformed the benchmark stock index for the past decade, it has under-performed by more than 25% since July, Bernstein analysts note.
Until cars become more affordable, demand will waver. One way around this is to boost auto financing. But that’s already a well-trodden path: such loans already back around 70% of passenger car buyers and 50% of the two-wheeler market, according to the Bernstein analysts.

Meanwhile, other outlays continue to pile up. Fuel is expensive and the upfront cost of insurance is also set to rise because of new rules that went into effect in September. With high interest rates, it’s probably imprudent for borrowing to outpace income gains. Consumers aren’t feeling wealthy, and there isn’t much incentive for them to buy.
Going into previous election cycles, the promise of certainty and a dedicated government has driven sales in the auto sector. This time, it won’t matter if Modi’s party returns—shoppers need to feel like they’ve got the power in their wallets.

55,2019-04-10,Bajaj Auto,"Auto production in FY19 grew by 6.3%, not even half the growth rate clocked in FY18Soft commodity prices will not aid margins due to weak sales and a negative operating leverage

Mumbai: Automobile sales are decelerating, and incentives and discounts are not helping shore up demand. The uncertain outlook and mounting unsold inventory have compelled companies to cut production in the March quarter. The auto sector is thus faced with earnings downgrades for the next two years.
Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, a leading brokerage firm, in its March quarter preview, has cut earnings estimates for FY20 and FY21 for all 8 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that it covers. In contrast to the expectations of a turnaround in fortunes during the March quarter, which typically registers strong numbers for the sector, the net profit of almost all auto companies may witness double-digit declines for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Recent data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) shows that vehicle production in FY19 grew 6.3% year-on-year. This was not even half the growth witnessed in FY18.
The headwinds are strengthening. A truant 2019 monsoon, rampant rural distress led by weak farm income, increasing influence of shared mobility in urban areas, a rise in unemployment and the liquidity crunch are roadblocks to improved consumer sentiment. Pre-election sales of vehicles have also dipped in the past. 
All these point to a weak demand until after the elections.
Therefore, any improvement in sales can be expected only in the second half of FY20, beginning from the festival season, say analysts. There is hope of pre-buying in the March quarter of FY20, just before the BS-VI emission norms kick in. This is likely to substantially increase vehicle costs. Unfortunately, such regulatory changes have coincided with a cyclical downturn that would weigh on demand.
One would have expected some relief in margins on account of softer commodity prices. However, the forthcoming results are not expected to factor much gains. Low sales will translate to low operating leverage, which will weigh on profitability. “Weak demand is bringing in margin pressure from higher customer acquisition costs (marketing), as well as negative operating leverage,"" says IIFL Research.
ALSO READ | India's $70 billion car market could use a jump
In the auto sector, two-wheeler makers will feel more pain than commercial and passenger vehicle firms. Also, demand for two-wheelers may take longer to revive because of prolonged weakness in rural demand.
Siam’s outlook for FY20 is not encouraging with single-digit growth estimates in sales across most sub-sectors, except commercial vehicles.
No wonder auto stocks have been hammered on the Street since August, when the first signs of weakening sales were visible.
The Nifty Auto index has shed 33% in a year, widely under-pacing the Nifty 500 index for the first time in a decade. The only silver lining is that the valuations have come off."
54,2019-04-11,Bajaj Auto,"Two-wheeler inventories have fallen to 45-50 days from 90-100 days in January and FebruaryThe inventory for cars is still in the range of 45-50 days, higher than usual inventory of 30 days

Retail sales of automobiles in India increased 8% sequentially in March to 1.68 million vehicles as companies offered discounts and other incentives to lure buyers and reduce dealer stocks, showed data issued by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) on Wednesday.
Retail sales however fell compared with March last year because of the high base and prevailing weak market sentiments.
Retail sales of two-wheelers rose 10% month-on-month (m-o-m) in March to 1.32 million units, while those for passenger vehicles grew 5% to 242,708 units.
Sales of commercial vehicles grew at a modest 2% m-o-m to 61,896 units amid the prevailing liquidity crunch at non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), which has squeezed financing options for fleet owners.
Retail sales of automobiles started to decline since last September when customer sentiments turned negative as crude oil prices started moving north, and the rupee depreciated against the dollar to an all-time high which impacted returns in the stock markets.
The bankruptcy of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd, meanwhile, led to a liquidity crunch as NBFCs became over cautious in lending. As a result, vehicle sales fell to a six-year low during Diwali and Navratri last year.
With dealer inventories touching record high, companies had to cut production and offer increased benefits or discounts on vehicles to clear stocks.
The average inventory for passenger vehicles is, however, still in the range of 45-50 days, much higher than the inventory of 30 days typically maintained by most manufacturers, according to FADA. Two-wheeler makers managed to halve their inventories to 45-50 days from almost 90-100 days in January and February by enforcing production cuts at factories.
Showroom sales of passenger vehicles dropped 10% from the year-earlier in March, while sales in the two-wheeler segment fell 7%. Retail sales of commercial vehicles fell around 12% from the year earlier in March.
However, FADA, a lobby group for automobile dealers, said it expects customers to resume automobile purchases after the Lok Sabha elections, which conclude on 23 May.
“We at FADA believe that the worst for the automobile industry is now behind us and expect demand to stay at the current level in the months to come. We believe inquiry to conversion ratio to improve with a stable government at the centre and improvement in the liquidity situation,"" said Ashish Harsharaj Kale, president of FADA.
The subdued demand condition prevailing in the market was reflected in the wholesales data issued by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) on Monday.
Factory dispatches of passenger vehicles grew by just 2.7% to 3.37 million units in fiscal year 2019 (FY19)—the slowest since FY14 when sales fell 6%.
Anticipating continued pressure of sales volumes, Siam has projected a growth of around 3-5% in passenger vehicle sales for this fiscal year."
53,2019-04-16,Bajaj Auto,"Since commuter bikes account for nearly one-fifth of Bajaj Auto’s overall sales, its pricing strategy will result in lower realizationsHowever, performance of exports and commercial vehicles (three-wheelers) may partially alleviate margin pressures for Bajaj Auto

Mumbai: Bajaj Auto Ltd is an outlier among two-wheeler stocks. It has risen 9% in the past year, at a time when shares of peers, such as Hero MotoCorp Ltd and TVS Motor Co. Ltd, have fallen by 27% and 24%, respectively. The benchmark Nifty Auto Index has also corrected 22% in the same period.
Surely, Bajaj Auto’s much-touted aggressive pricing strategy has worked well for it. The company has clawed back market share losses of the previous year. But the million-dollar question is, if this will translate into higher earnings, which is key to sustaining valuations.
The margin forecast for the March quarter is far from optimistic. Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd expects a 340 basis point Ebitda margin contraction year-on-year due to the competitive pricing strategy. On a similar note, Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd has factored in a 320 basis point drop in margins.
Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Hundred basis points equal one percentage point.
Note that the company’s FY19 domestic motorcycle sales surged by 29%. This was primarily due to an increase in commuter bike sales, where the pricing strategy helped increase its market share by nearly 500 basis points. Meanwhile, peers such as Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd and Hero MotoCorp, suffered market share losses.
Since the entry-level motorcycle segment accounts for nearly one-fifth of Bajaj Auto’s overall sales, the pricing strategy will result in lower realizations. Analysts have estimated 6-8% year-on-year fall in average blended realizations for the March quarter. Obviously, this would weigh on revenue and profit growth for Q4 and the full year.
That said, there could be some positives in the March quarter earnings. The performance of exports and commercial vehicles (three-wheelers) may partially alleviate margin pressures. Besides, management commentary on the road ahead for the entry-level and premium two-wheeler market, wherein intense competition is taking a toll on profitability, will be key to the stock’s valuation."

New Delhi: Hero MotoCorp, India’s largest two-wheeler manufacturer, on Wednesday expanded its offering in the premium 200cc segment by launching three new motorcycles — Xtreme 200S, XPulse 200, and Xpulse 200T.
The company last year re-entered the premium segment with the Xtreme 200R.
The new motorcycles will compete with products, including the Pulsar range of motorcycles from Bajaj Auto and the Apache range motorcycles from TVS Motor Company.
According to Malo Le Masson, head, global product planning, Hero MotoCorp, these three new products showcase the company’s focused product portfolio approach for the premium segment. The company has now successfully developed and appointed a horizontal strategy for the premium motorcycles.
The new vehicles will be dispatched to the company’s dealerships by the end of May. The new products have been developed at the company’s new research and development centre in Jaipur.
“These new motorcycles are the outcome of years of concerted and determined product development efforts at the Hero Centre of Innovation and Technology. Now our 200cc line up comprises four powerful and performance-oriented and contemporary motorcycles,"" said Marcus Braunsperger, chief technology officer, Hero MotoCorp.
The Xpluse 200 will be launched at a price of  ₹97,000, while the fuel injection variant will be priced at  ₹1,05,000. The XPulse 200T will be available at a price of  ₹94,000. The Xtreme 200S will be offered at a price of  ₹98,500.
According to the senior management of the company, most premium motorcycles sold in India are under  ₹1 lakh, hence the company has decided to launch all the three products within the price range."
51,2019-05-06,Bajaj Auto,"Bajaj Auto’s aggressive pricing strategy in the entry-level commuter segment has kept its sales tickingBajaj’s success in garnering share also needs to be seen against the backdrop of intense competition in the two-wheeler market

MUMBAI :
Bajaj Auto Ltd has made a heroic comeback in the domestic motorcycle market. The company has steadily increased its market share to 20% in the fourth quarter of FY19, after sliding to a low of 14% seven quarters ago. In doing so, it has given incumbents such as Hero Motocorp Ltd and Honda Motorcycle and Scooters India Pvt. Ltd a run for their money. Market share of the two companies fell by 100 basis points (bps) and 550 bps, respectively, during the period.
Bajaj Auto’s two-wheeler sales rose by 4.8% year-on-year in April. To be sure, it had grown in double digits for several months in FY2018. Sales of Hero and Honda contracted by 17% and 33%, respectively, in April, continuing the decelerating trend in sales.
What has kept Bajaj Auto ticking through such turbulent times? It seems the firm’s aggressive pricing strategy in the entry-level commuter category, which it adopted about 18-20 months back, has done the trick. It launched variants of existing products at not just affordable prices, but also with additional features that swung customers in its favour. Analysts say its share zoomed by 500 bps in this segment that now earns a fifth of its revenue.
While there is normally many a slip between the cup and the lip, it’s worth noting that the management has met its targeted 20% market share in motorcycles for FY19.
That’s not all. Analysts say Bajaj’s strategy to flood the dealer pipeline with the relatively cheaper non-ABS (anti-braking system) variants in March fuelled wholesale numbers. Note that from April, ABS variants are mandatory.
To add to this, Bajaj’s absence in the scooter segment, which analysts always took a jibe at, turned out to be a boon. For the first time in 10 years, growth rates in the scooters segment has underperformed that of motorcycles. Also, one cannot ignore the presence of a captive auto finance company in the group that gives a leg-up to Bajaj’s sales when the economy is in the grip of a liquidity crunch.
Be that as it may, there is some apprehension setting in on the street even as Bajaj’s management is confident of scaling 24% share of the motorcycle market soon. “We don’t expect Bajaj’s outperformance to continue as base effect catches up and its discounting strategy is unlikely to work in the long run,"" says Arya Sen, an analyst at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd. Further, some of the entry-level variants are margin-dilutive, which could weigh on profit growth ahead.
As such, the strategy has taken the juice out of its profits. Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin is down to 16% in the December 2018 quarter from around 21% eight quarters ago. This is despite the higher-margin exports business comprising nearly half of its revenue. But note that the problem of margin erosion has trickled down to rivals such as Hero and Eicher Motors too, albeit to a lesser degree.
Bajaj’s success in garnering share also needs to be seen against the backdrop of intense competition in the two-wheeler market. A CLSA note says the measure of market concentration, Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, shows that the highest competition in the auto universe is among two-wheelers. This is despite the fact that there are more incumbents in the four-wheeler passenger vehicle segment.
Having said all this, analysts fear that rivals will do relatively better if there is a demand reversal due to a relatively low base. Against this backdrop, the Bajaj stock’s outperformance needs to be considered carefully by investors. Shares of two-wheeler firms Hero, Eicher Motors Ltd (representing Royal Enfield motorcycles) and TVS have fallen by 13-17% since January. Only Bajaj’s stock has been an outlier, rising 13% since January. If Bajaj can’t continue its upward climb in terms of market share, its shares could be on a fast downhill journey.
""Against this backdrop, the Bajaj stock’s outperformance needs to be considered carefully by investors. In spite of sales growth, margins may stay range bound, leading to slower earnings growth,"" says Bharat Gianani, analyst at Sharekhan"

Indian markets are expected to stay volatile today as investors are likely to remain cautious ahead of the exit poll results of general election that will be out on Sunday. The final phase of voting ends on Sunday. Final outcome of the general elections will be declared on 23 May.
Among global markets, Asian shares were trying to end a bleak week in the black on Friday as upbeat US economic news and solid company earnings offered a respite from the interminable China-US trade saga.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan inched up 0.1% and off a 15-week trough, but was still down 1.8% for the week. Japan’s Nikkei bounced 0.7% in early trade, while the main Australian index added 0.5%.
Sentiment had been bolstered by better US economic news, with US housing starts surprisingly strong and a welcome pickup in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s manufacturing survey. The Dow ended Thursday with gains of 0.84%, while the S&P 500 added 0.89% and the Nasdaq 0.97%.
Back home, major companies to declare their March quarter results today include Bajaj Auto, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).
Among currencies, the dollar regained a little lost ground on the safe-haven yen to stand at 109.85, while the euro eased to $1.1171 and was off 0.5% for the week so far.
Sterling was one of the worst performers as Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May battled to keep her Brexit deal, and her premiership, intact amid growing fears of a disorderly departure from the European Union. The pound touched a three-month low of $1.2785 and was down a hefty 1.6% for the week so far.
In commodity markets, spot gold dropped off to $1,286.37 per ounce as risk sentiment improved. Oil futures firmed as tensions in the Middle East grew, with a Saudi-led coalition launching air strikes in retaliation for recent attacks on its crude infrastructure.

44,2019-05-19,Bajaj Auto,"India’s second-largest motorcycle maker by sales volume hopes that the new products would help to augment its portfolioThe company says that it sold more than 742,000 units of its 100cc CT model in FY19

MUMBAI :
Bajaj Auto Ltd plans to offer entry-level and mid-segment motorcycles in the next three to four months to intensify its rivalry with Hero MotoCorp Ltd and Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India Pvt. Ltd (HMSI).
India’s second-largest motorcycle maker by sales volume hopes that the new products would help to augment its portfolio and also boost marketshare, said Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto.
“We plan to launch new products based on innovative features. We will target the entry and the middle-level segments with the new launches,"" Sharma said. He, however, declined to elaborate on the products the company plans to launch this fiscal year.
Motorcycles with 100cc-110cc engines comprise the entry-level category, while 125cc models are termed as executive. Hero and Honda commanded market shares of 72% and 51% each in the 75-110cc and 111cc-125cc motorcycle categories, respectively, in FY19, according to Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers data.
Bajaj Auto, which took aggressive pricing and product positioning strategies in the 100cc category with its CT and Platina brands, grew its market share from 12.77% in FY18 to 17.13% in FY19.
“The segment that is driving the growth for us is the entry level. We are represented in this category with brands like CT and Platina. Here, we have increased our market share by about six percentage points,"" said Sharma.
The company says that it sold more than 742,000 units of its 100cc CT model in FY19, posting a 59% rise. Sales of the Platina rose 44% last fiscal to 626,000 units, the company said in it’s official statement.
The entry-level motorcycle category is the most competitive. Smaller players such as Yamaha, Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra have exited the category in the recent past, and it currently has only the four top companies: Hero, Honda, TVS Motor and Bajaj Auto.
Bajaj Auto’s market share more than halved in the 125cc category to 2.71% in FY19 from 5.31% in FY18, which the company aims to address with the new products.
“Due to sensitivity of the matter, I won’t be able to divulge specific details. But I can say that we plan to launch meaningful products with value-for-money features to complete our portfolio,"" Sharma said.
Bajaj Auto recorded a jump of 25% in its total FY19 volumes to about 5.01 million units, its best-ever. It comprised sales of about 4.24 million motorcycles (up 26% YoY) and 782,630 commercial vehicles (up 23% YoY).
“Bajaj Auto is looking to complete its portfolio by filling in the current gaps, which primarily exist in the 100cc-125cc sub-segment. It will do so by launching new bikes this year. The competition in the entry-level bikes will remain heightened between Bajaj Auto and other players. The company is relatively better placed in the two-wheeler market, which is expected to remain subdued this year,"" said Jinesh Gandhi, auto analyst at Motilal Oswal Securities."
43,2019-05-19,Bajaj Auto,"Bajaj Auto beat competitors hands down in fiscal year 2019 with volume growth of 28.7%Meanwhile, valuations are rich at 19 times trailing earnings, despite dull earnings growth

It’s a well-known fact that Bajaj Auto Ltd has beaten competitors hands down in FY19. While the company reported growth of 28.7% in the domestic two-wheeler market in FY19, all other competitors put together grew volumes by just 2.3%. As this column has pointed out, Bajaj Auto’s aggressive pricing strategy in the entry-level commuter category did the trick for it.
But aggressive pricing also means lower profit margins, and this has been a concern for some investors. So, how has Bajaj Auto done on this front in the March quarter? To cut a long story short, the message on the margins front is not very encouraging. Despite meaningful tailwinds, Ebitda margin widened by only 10 basis points sequentially. What’s more, they are down 370 basis points compared to a year ago. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
The tailwinds were in the form of better-than-expected price realizations in the last quarter. Even though volumes fell 5.3% compared to the seasonally better December quarter, revenues were more or less flat at  ₹7,225 crore. Average price realization rose 5.3% sequentially, thanks to a better product mix.
In addition, the company had the benefit of softer commodity prices. Some analysts were expecting margins to rise 40-50 basis points sequentially with much lower revenue assumptions. The fact that Bajaj Auto reported a mere 10 basis point improvement in margins, despite reporting higher-than-expected revenues, is clearly a negative.
So, for all the excitement about the company’s strong volume growth, the fact remains that Ebitda fell 12.6% year-on-year in the March quarter. For the year as a whole, Ebitda rose just 3%, despite an 18% rise in operating revenue.
Of course, the majority of investors are cheering Bajaj Auto’s strategy of aggressively pursuing market share in the domestic market, even if profit growth is sluggish. Its stock is up about 8% in the past one year, compared to the 27% drop in the stock of Hero MotoCorp Ltd and a 17% fall in TVS Motor Co. Ltd’s stock.
“We expect to continue outpacing industry growth rates; we are driving with our feet hard on the accelerator, and are pursuing growth through new product launches and branding and marketing initiatives,"" the company management said on a call with analysts.
Apart from the pressure on margins, Bajaj Auto has also reported a large rise in receivables. The company said that debtor days have risen by four-five days, which is understandable in the backdrop of an unusually tough year for the automobile sector, where inventories were rising.
In this backdrop, Bajaj Auto’s trailing price-earnings multiple of around 19 times looks rich, especially since earnings are expected to grow only about 10% annually in the next two fiscal years."

Mumbai: Shares of Bajaj Auto defied the broader market sentiment on Monday and fell nearly 3% in morning trade on bourses.
Market experts said, though the fourth quarter earnings for the auto major was a good show in a tough environment, the company is expected to face margin pressure.
The shares of Bajaj Auto opened at  ₹3,071, but lost ground and touched  ₹2,953.95, down 2.88% over its previous close of  ₹3,041.80.

""While we believe that margin downgrade cycle (but for any change to product mix) is behind, focus on domestic market share and higher share of Africa in exports are likely to keep margin range bound,"" Edelweiss Research said in a note.
Edelweiss Research further noted that, a subdued demand environment, costs related to the entry in middle/executive segment (current market share of around 3%) and technological changes due to BSVI will restrict margin to the current level.

Bajaj Auto has joined hands with Austrian sports bike maker KTM Industries to manufacture electric two-wheelers vehicles in the power range of 3 to 10 kW (48 volt). Under this partnership, Bajaj Auto and KTM will support different product variants - scooters, mopeds, small mopeds - under brands of both partners. 
The production of Bajaj Auto and KTM electric two-wheelers will start at Bajaj's Pune plant by 2022. 
Meanwhile, KTM Industries said that ""the possibility of transferring Bajaj's 48% stake in KTM AG to KTM Industries AG are not being further pursued for the time being. The successful cooperation with the Bajaj-Group, which has existed since 2007, will thus continue unchanged at the level of KTM AG.""
In the European market, KTM increased its market share to 12.3% with a registration increase of 22%.

Despite decelerating sales volumes reported by most auto companies, their shares have been trading higher. Down more than 23% in the last one year, the Nifty Auto index rose 1.9% on Monday, making it the biggest gainers among NSE’s sectoral indices.
A bulk of the index is being lifted by two-wheeler stocks. Most of these two-wheeler stocks had lost significantly over the latter half of last year. Shares of the three listed two-wheeler companies rose between 3.6% to 5.8% on the NSE.
TVS Motor Company Ltd registered sales of 3.07 lakh units in May 2019 as against 3.09 lakh units in May 2018. Hero Motocorp Ltd reported sales of 6.52 lakh units of motorcycles and scooters in May 2019, down from 7.06 lakh in May 2018. Bajaj Auto seemed to have bucked the trend showing an increase of 3% in sales volumes to 4.19 lakh units in May 2019 over the same period last year. Still, a low single-digit growth is nothing to get excited about.
What then explains the excitement? The reason probably why these shares are once again coming back into focus is because of the improving month-on-month volumes, according to analysts. For instance, Hero MotoCorp saw a sequential increase in sales volumes from April 2019 when it sold 5.74 lakh units. This seems to suggest that the auto sector may be slowly moving on to the higher gears.
Investors are also pinning their hopes on the upcoming monetary policy, and the buzz is that interest rates are expected to be cut by around 25 basis points at least. Analysts see this as spurring further auto sales and boosting sentiments in the credit market. Investors are also expecting sops to revive the auto sector.
“There is a hope that the new government will provide some stimulus either through incentives or a lower Goods and Services Tax,"" said Jigar Shah, managing director, MayBank Kim Eng Securities Private Ltd. “The market is also banking on the cut in interest rates to spur demand.""
Heavily dependent on the finance sector, most passenger vehicles are still showing sluggish growth. For instance, Maruti Suzuki Ltd saw its sales volumes decline nearly 22% in May over the same period last year.
While Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd was not hit too much by the slowdown, its volumes still dipped 3% in May 2019. Ashok Leyland Ltd’s too faced a similar decline of 3.6% in May 2019 over the same period last year.
Analysts also reckon that much of the slowdown is now factored in the stock prices. As the auto sector underperformed the broader market, analysts say that some auto stocks are at low valuations. But still the sector is not out of the woods yet, and investors may well consider how the volume growth sustains over the coming months. And last but not the least, the fact that the liquidity crisis is still taking its toll on the sector cannot be ignored."
39,2019-06-10,Bajaj Auto,"TVS Motor and Bajaj Auto are both planning to launch electric two-wheelers later in FY20It is ill-timed to target a date so close to BS-VI implementation, says Rajiv Bajaj

Mumbai: After industry bodies CII and SIAM reacted to the anticipated government plan of ensuring faster adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) by suggesting 100% EVs for sale of three-wheelers by 2023 and two-wheelers below 150 cc by 2025, vehicle manufacturers such as TVS Motor Company and Bajaj Auto have now termed the plan as 'unrealistic' and 'impractical'.
TVS Motor and Bajaj Auto are both planning to launch electric two-wheelers later in FY20.
In an official statement, Venu Srinivasan, Chairman, TVS Motor Company said: “Automakers are supportive of the overall goal of introducing EVs and easing consumers into electric mobility. As a result we have been doing serious development work to ensure we can offer a mass market EV product that delivers on safety and high performance. This is necessary to co-opt consumers into making a switch, so it’s driven by consumer willingness and, therefore, adopted easily and widely. The supporting infrastructure for charging also needs to be as robust as conventional fuel options.""
“The auto industry globally is still a long way away from all of this, as is India. To force an unrealistic deadline for mass adoption of electric two- and three-wheelers, will not just create consumer discontent, it risks derailing auto-manufacturing in India that supports 4 million jobs. We need gradual and seamless adoption of EVs to avoid such collateral damage and ensure our technology-driven disruption is positive and lasting,"" Srinivasan added cautioning against potential disruption that the new government plans to usher in.
Meanwhile, Rajiv Bajaj, MD, Bajaj Auto underlined three key concerns including the incompetence of India’s automotive value chain to locally develop and produce electric vehicles. Notably, the development of EVs demands key R&D and manufacturing capabilities in the area of electrical and electronics domain, which, however, remains one of the biggest weaknesses of India’s automotive value chain.
“I have three execution related concerns. First, that it may be impractical to target such a scale when none of the stakeholders currently possess any meaningful experience with any of the pieces of the EV puzzle. Secondly, that it's ill-timed to target a date so close to BS-VI implementation. And finally, to target two and three wheelers but not cars makes it an incomplete initiative,"" said Bajaj.
The Bajaj Auto MD added: “An appropriate middle path to my mind would be in the first phase to target such a changeover through Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFÉ) norms/EVs for all vehicle categories from a particular date such as 2023 or 2025 starting with the most polluted cities of India. Based on the learnings from that experience a collective plan can be put together to scale up as desired.""
Siddhartha Lal, MD, Eicher Motors has recently said that Royal Enfield will be an early follower in EVs than leading the development from the front. “We are still studying the business model on parameters such as price, weight, value and others. There is a whole new business model that will emerge with EVs. It has not matured yet for the bikes at the moment,"" he told investors last week."
38,2019-06-22,Bajaj Auto,"Niti Aayog officials met with executives from companies including Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp and TVS late on FridayThe think-tank had recommended that only electric models of scooters and motorbikes with engine capacity of more than 150cc must be sold from 2025

India's federal think-tank has asked scooter and motorbike manufacturers to draw up a plan to switch to electric vehicles, days after they publicly opposed the government's proposals saying they would disrupt the sector, two sources told Reuters.
Niti Aayog officials met with executives from companies including Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp and TVS late on Friday, giving them two weeks to come up with the plan, according to one of the executives.
The think-tank, which is chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and plays a key role in policymaking, had recommended that only electric models of scooters and motorbikes with engine capacity of more than 150cc must be sold from 2025, sources have told Reuters.
Automakers opposed the proposal and warned that a sudden transition, at a time when auto sales have slumped to a two-decade low, would cause market disruption and job losses.
India is one of the world’s largest two wheeler markets with sales of more than 20 million scooters and motorbikes last year.
During Friday's meeting government officials argued that switching to EVs is of national importance so India does not miss out on the global drive towards environmentally cleaner vehicles, one of sources said.
But industry executives responded that a premature switch with no established supply chain, charging infrastructure or skilled labour in India, could result in India losing its leadership position in scooters and motorbikes, the second source said.
“There were clearly drawn out positions,"" said the source, adding there were ""strong opinions"" at the meeting.
Bajaj, Hero and Niti Aayog did not respond to a request for comment, while TVS declined to comment.
ELECTRIFICATION
Niti Aayog is working with several other ministries on the recommendations, which are part of an electrification effort to help India reduce its fuel import bill and curb pollution.
The proposal also includes incentives for local production of batteries, an increase ownership cost of gasoline cars and forming a policy to scrap old vehicles, according to records of government meetings seen by Reuters.
The panel has also suggested measures such as directing taxi aggregators like Uber and Ola to convert 40% of their fleets to electric by April 2026, Reuters has reported.
Executives from EV start-up Ather Energy, ride-sharing firm Ola and officials from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), an industry trade body, also attended the meeting, the sources said.
The proposals are India's second attempt for a switch to EVs. In 2017 it proposed an ambitious plan mainly for electric cars but rowed back after facing resistance from car makers.
The current push could disrupt the market order for two-wheelers and open up avenues for local start-ups, analysts say.
Scooter and bike start-ups like Ather, 22Motors and Okinawa are already making in-roads in India.
“It is extremely critical that we make the transition to electric quickly lest we get wiped out by another global wave,"" Tarun Mehta, CEO and co-founder at Ather said.

NEW DELHI :
Changing from conventional two-wheelers to 100% electric is ""not like Aadhaar, not a software and print cards"" and such transition is completely uncalled for, according to TVS Motor Co and Bajaj Auto.
Strongly objecting to government think tank Niti Aayog's proposal to transition to electric vehicles (EVs) for three-wheelers by 2023 and two-wheelers by 2025, the two companies said the policy has not been made with adequate study and diligence.
""This is not like Aadhaar, not a software and print cards. You have to set up a whole supply chain, and migrate from the current supply chain,"" TVS Motor Co Chairman & Managing Director Venu Srinivasan told PTI.
Last week, Niti Aayog had asked auto industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) along with conventional two-and three-wheeler makers to suggest within two weeks, concrete steps towards transition to electric mobility keeping in mind the 2025 deadline.
Srinivasan further said,""we have said we will take four months to come with a plan. The plans will start with one city (that has the highest number of two-wheeler population) and that too, to a percentage of one city and migrate over a period of time.""
Asserting that a ""black or white, zero-one change"" is not possible ""with 20 million vehicles, USD 15 billion in sales, one million employees"", he said and added that ""the whole thing is not thought through. I hope saner thoughts will prevail and people will think through the real implications of all this.""
When contacted for comments, Bajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj said ""we believe 100 per cent transition is completely uncalled for"".
Earlier, he had also asserted that the move was impractical and ill-timed, considering the scale involved when stakeholders do not have ""any meaningful experience with any of the pieces of the EV puzzle"" and that too a date so close to BSVI implementation.
Besides, he had argued that ""to target two and three wheelers but not cars etc makes it an incomplete initiative"".
Srinivasan also asserted that ""changing to batteries running on thermal power will not reduce one iota of pollution.""
Right now, he said,""the two-wheeler contribute to 20 per cent of automotive pollution. Automotive contributes to 20% (of overall) pollution, so we are dealing with 4 per cent pollution"".
Srinivasan said Indian automotive industry has attracted huge foreign investments based on stability of policies and ""one has to treat with greater care and diligence than what is being proposed"".
""We are dealing with the most competitive and the only industry to have really grown to that scale and competitiveness in the engineering industry,"" he said.

Joining its Indian counterparts Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Co in opposing the Niti Aayog's proposal to completely ban two-wheelers that are powered by internal combustion engines (ICEs) of up to 150cc from 2025, the company called for a plan jointly prepared by all concerned stakeholders before taking such a step.
Honda, which is present in the country through a wholly-owned subsidiary Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI), said despite its 25 years of experience of developing and selling electric two-wheeler adoption of such vehicles has remained a challenge due to various factors.
""The industry needs more time to stabilise after BS-VI changeover before we take the next step of moving from IC engine technology, especially considering Indian customer requirement of higher daily commuting distance and price consciousness,"" HMSI said in a statement.
From April 2020, India will implement strict BS-VI emission norms across the country for all categories of new vehicles.
The company further said, ""Honda requests a well-laid-out plan jointly prepared by government, industry and all concerned stakeholders looking at the aspects of air pollution, energy security, cost of technology, availability of raw materials and Infrastructure while addressing employment impact to increase stepwise penetration of EVs (electric vehicles).""
Globally, Honda has an experience of developing and selling electric two-wheelers for over 25 years.
""Due to multiple factors, including vehicle cost, riding performance, range and infrastructure, customers' adoption of EV is still a major challenge,"" it said.
On Monday, India's big three two-wheeler makers -- Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Co -- hit out at the Niti Aayog's plan to push for 100 per cent electric vehicle for up to 150 cc engine capacity, saying such a transition was completely uncalled for and could jeopardise the industry.

NEW DELHI :
India's big three two-wheeler makers - Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Co - Monday hit out at Niti Aayog's plan to push for 100 per cent electric vehicle, saying such a transition is completely uncalled for and could jeopardise the industry.
Arguing that changing from conventional two-wheelers to 100 per cent electric is ""not like Aadhaar, not a software and print cards"", the companies said concerns of all stakeholders must be taken into consideration instead of imposing adoption of EVs.
""This is not like Aadhaar, not a software and print cards. You have to set up a whole supply chain, and migrate from the current supply chain,"" TVS Motor Co Chairman & Managing Director Venu Srinivasan told PTI.
Expressing similar sentiments, Hero MotoCorp said it was ""deeply concerned by the potential repercussions of Niti Aayog's approach of completely banning two-wheelers up to 150cc that are powered by Internal Combustion Engines (ICE)"".
Last week, Niti Aayog had asked auto industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) along with conventional two-and three-wheeler makers to suggest within two weeks, concrete steps towards transition to electric mobility keeping in mind the 2025 deadline.
Hero MotoCorp said the move by Niti Aayog is being at a time ""when two-wheelers manufactured in India will have the world's cleanest emissions, along with the world's highest fuel-efficiencies, effective April 1, 2020"".
""Instead of imposing the adoption of EVs (electric vehicles), it would be ideal to have a healthy mix of policy, market dynamics, and customer acceptability,"" the country's largest two-wheeleler maker said.
Bajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj also said ""we believe 100 per cent transition is completely uncalled for"".
Earlier, he had also asserted that the move was impractical and ill-timed, considering the scale involved when stakeholders do not have ""any meaningful experience with any of the pieces of the EV puzzle"" and that too a date so close to BS VI implementation.
Besides, he had argued that ""to target two and three wheelers but not cars etc makes it an incomplete initiative"".
Asserting that a ""black or white, zero-one change"" is not possible ""with 20 million vehicles, USD 15 billion in sales, one million employees"", Srinivasan added that ""the whole thing is not thought through. I hope saner thoughts will prevail and people will think through the real implications of all this"".
Hero MotoCorp also said mandating a new technology by banning the existing one is likely to jeopardise the industry.
Considering the significance of the automotive industry that provides employment to millions and is a significant contributor to the country's GDP, the proposed ban could also have massive consequences on the economy, the company added.
""An abrupt and sudden changeover will disrupt the entire eco-system of vendors, OEMs, dealers, spare parts manufacturers, and mechanics, as well as other stakeholders, thereby impacting the livelihoods of millions of people dependent on the industry,"" it said.
Appealing to the government and relevant authorities ""to be cautious in their approach and take into consideration the concerns of all the stakeholders"", Hero MotoCorp said. ""A phase-wise introduction will not only allow for a smooth transition but also enable all involved parties to understand, accept and if required, make course-corrections in their approach towards EVs""."
34,2019-06-29,Bajaj Auto,"Bajaj Auto said the domestic market will get more competitive across the various segmentsBajaj Auto said while its motorcycles, three-wheelers and quadricycles will be 'fully BS-VI compliant not just on April 1, 2020 but some months earlier'

New Delhi: Terming the transition to Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) emission norms from April next year as ""joker in the pack"", Bajaj Auto Ltd has cautioned that there could be dumping of old BS-IV stock in the domestic market, triggering an ""unwarranted price war"" in the second half of the ongoing fiscal.
In its Annual Report for 2018-19, the Pune-based firm said while its motorcycles, three-wheelers and quadricycles will be ""fully BS-VI compliant not just on April 1, 2020 but some months earlier, it is difficult to anticipate the state of BS VI readiness of our competitors"".
""For the industry as a whole, we believe that the joker in the pack will be the tough Bharat Stage VI, or BS VI, emission norms that will come into play from 1 April 2020,"" the company wrote to its shareholders.
""However, it is difficult to anticipate the state of BS VI readiness of our competitors. If some, or most, of them have a large stock of unsold BS-IV vehicles in the second half of FY2020, they will perforce have to dump these in the market before the advent of April 1, 2020.
""That could trigger an unwarranted price war, to the detriment of all. We cannot claim that such a scenario will definitely play out; equally we cannot ignore a distinct risk overhang on that account,"" it added.
Bajaj Auto further said the domestic market will get more competitive across the various segments and ""the days when a manufacturer could claim quasi-monopolistic presence in one or more segment is rapidly coming to an end"".
It, however, said ""armed with a surplus of over  ₹16,000 crore, we at Bajaj Auto have the strength to deal with such competition"".
The company told its shareholders that a large part of its strength lies in its success in exports, where the markets are not only diverse but also less prone to acute competitive pressures as the domestic market.
""Our strength also lies in the primacy that we have in the three-wheelers and commercial vehicles segment. Therefore, so long as we have new and exciting models on offer, we can meet the competition and succeed,"" it said, adding the near-term outlook, therefore, should be healthy for Bajaj Auto.
""So long as there are not too many major market disruptions on account of BS VI. Time will tell which way things move,"" it added.

New Delhi: Bajaj Auto on Monday launched an all-new version of its entry-level motorcycle model CT110. Priced in the range of  ₹37,997 and  ₹44,480 (ex-Showroom Delhi), the new CT110 comes with raised ground clearance, stronger and bigger crash guards and a suspension that can take on rough road conditions, Bajaj Auto said in a statement.
It comes in two variants with the kick start version priced at  ₹37,997 while the electric start option is tagged at  ₹44,480 (ex-showroom Delhi), the company said.
The bike is powered by a 115cc DTSi engine that delivers power of 8.6 PS and 9.81 Nm of torque. This is paired with a 4-speed gearbox. It comes with semi-knobby tread pattern tyres with drum brakes at the front and rear.
The CT110 gets rubber rubber tank pads and thick rexine padded seats for comfortable seating. Also, there are bellows on the front suspension and an unswept exhaust at the rear. 
Commenting on the launch, Bajaj Auto President - Motorcycle Business Sarang Kanade said,""the CT range was conceptualised for those customers who demand a robust bike at a reasonable price.
""We believe that the tough new CT 110 provides an even better value with superior performance - a great combination of mileage and power - all at an attractive price.""
He said till date the company has sold more than 50 lakh units of the CT range. 
The Bajaj CT110 goes up against the Hero HF and TVS Sport. Bajaj claims the CT110 has a higher-capacity engine, higher ground clearance and better stability compared to the rest of the competition."

Indian markets are expected to be wobbly today, bogged down by weak corporate earnings by key companies like Tata Motors. Asian shares opened a tad lower today on mixed US earnings reports and the euro held above two-year lows struck overnight after the European Central Bank held interest rates steady, though officials said a cut was certain in September.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.15% while Japan's Nikkei dipped 0.3%.
Wall Street shares fell from record highs on Thursday, with the S&P 500 losing 0.53%, following a flurry of downbeat quarterly results from Ford Motor and other companies.
Back home, shares of Tata Motors Ltd are likely to be in focus on Friday as it has nearly doubled its consolidated net loss in the June quarter, weighed down by woes at its Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) unit and a slowdown in the automobile industry in India. It posted a net loss of  ₹3,680 crore in the three months ended 30 June, compared with a year-earlier loss of  ₹1,863 crore. Consolidated revenue from operations fell 8% year-on-year (y-o-y) and 29% sequentially to  ₹60,830 crore.
TPG Capital’s Indian private equity arm and buyout firm Advent International Corp. are among institutional investors that will infuse fresh capital into Yes Bank Ltd, according to a Mint report.
Key companies which are going to announce June quarter earnings today are Maruti Suzuki India, Bajaj Auto, Punjab National Bank, Vedanta, JSW Steel, ABB India, Vodafone Idea, Bajaj Holdings and Mahindra Lifespace Developers.
Meanwhile, a rally in global bonds ran out of steam after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi cautioned about pulling the trigger too quickly even though he signaled another round of monetary easing.
The 10-year German government bond yield initially hit a record low of minus 0.463% but ended the day up slightly at minus 0.407 percent.
The U.S. 10-year Treasuries yield also rose 3 basis points to 2.079% on Thursday and traded at 2.107% in the following Asian session. Also helping to stem falls in bond yields, new orders for key US-made capital goods surged in June, suggesting some improvement in business investment.
In the currency market, the euro bounced back to at $1.11465 in Asian trade, after sinking to $1.1101 on Thursday, its lowest since May 2017. The yen was little changed against the dollar at 108.67 yen per dollar.
Oil prices held firm on rising tensions between the West and Iran and a big decline in US crude stockpiles, though gains were held in check by worries about slowing growth in major economies.

31,2019-07-28,Bajaj Auto,"Margin pressure was also fuelled by an increase in staff and other costs that rose faster than the 4% revenue growthMargin pressure was also fuelled by increase in employee costs and other expenses that rose at a faster pace than the muted 4% growth in the company’s revenues

Bajaj Auto Ltd has bucked the slowdown in two-wheeler sales for several quarters, but margin pressure continues as the product mix is beginning to hurt the company.
True, June quarter Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin of 15.4% is broadly in line with estimates. This may be a relief for investors. However, it has declined by 250 basis points from the year-ago period. According to Bharat Gianani, analyst at Sharekhan Ltd: “Aggressive pricing strategy in domestic market, high cost pressures and adverse product mix resulted in the margins declining."" A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Margin pressure was also fuelled by increase in employee costs and other expenses that rose at a faster pace than the muted 4% growth in the company’s revenues.
That said, the 1.7% increase in sales volumes along with improved realizations were key positives that hold promise in times of an extreme slowdown. Average selling price increased by 2.4% year-on-year.
Note that dealer feedback in June indicated highest stress and inventory pile-up in the two-wheeler and commercial vehicles segment. Therefore, Bajaj Auto’s revenue expansion of 4% is respectable.
Overall, the company’s net profit remained flattish over the same period last year to  ₹1,125 crore, slightly higher than Bloomberg’s consensus estimate of  ₹1,081 crore. Strong other income growth also helped profitability.
To be sure, it is not as if June quarter results are going to materially change the outlook for the company. For one, the slowdown seen in the auto industry is expected to continue. Analysts expect the road to recovery to be slow.
“We see multiple headwinds to Bajaj due to deceleration in volume growth, continued margin pressure, dilution of domestic 2 wheeler brands, and electric vehicle disruption in 3 wheelers,"" says Arya Sen, analyst at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 15 July.
Little wonder then that Bajaj Auto’s shares have declined as much as 10% since April. Echoing the same sentiment, Mitul Shah, vice president (research) at Reliance Securities Ltd, said: “We expect Bajaj Auto to face similar margin pressure on account of slump in domestic as well as exports three wheeler segments, intensifying competitive environment in domestic two wheeler space and lower exports growth."" Importantly, he adds that exports would not be sufficient cushion for margin expansion.
At the current market price of  ₹2,618.65, the Bajaj Auto stock trades at about 15 times estimated earnings for FY20. However, given the expected stress on margins and sombre demand outlook, expansion in valuations is unlikely to occur in a hurry."
30,2019-07-29,Bajaj Auto,"Nifty Auto index fell 2-3% dragged by most of the OE stocksAuto OE stocks have fallen 10-20% in the last couple of months

Mumbai: Weak sales and subdued quarterly results by most auto original equipment manufacturers (OEM) had set the stage for a fall in auto stocks. A 24 July notification proposing higher vehicle registration fees for new and old vehicles, has fuelled the fall.
Nifty Auto index fell 2-3%, dragged down largely by OEM stocks. OEM stocks have declined 10-20% in the last couple of months, with most of them trading below or close to their 52-week lows.
A report by Nomura Research on the proposed vehicle registration fees said “if the notification goes through, it will hurt sales of the already struggling auto sector. Two-wheelers will be hit harder due to higher cost increase for them of about 2.5% followed by cars and medium and heavy commercial vehicles of around 1%.""
This would further dent demand for automobiles.
Higher insurance cost, road tax, and registration fees are all ex-showroom costs which are not financed. Hence, they have a direct impact on the buyer’s cost. All this comes in the backdrop of June quarter being one of the worst in terms of auto sales across segments.
Meanwhile, April-June results reflect the stress in auto industry. Revenue was flat or lower for most companies, while weak sales volumes and the resultant poor capacity utilisation with production cuts, led to pressure on margins. Cost of raw material as a percentage to sales rose, in spite of softer commodity prices. Passenger car leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd may have weathered the headwinds, but its profitability was hit.
Tata Motors Ltd margins slipped into single digit as weak luxury car sales globally along with falling commercial vehicle sales in domestic markets hit performance. Two-wheeler firms such as Bajaj Auto Ltd and TVS Motor Company Ltd also reported a fall in their respective margins, but were largely in line with market forecast.
As the market and industry incessantly hanker for sops from the government to boost near-term demand, the government’s thrust is clearly on encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles. If anything, all depends on how the monsoon pans out, and hope that the festival season will boost demand in the short term."
29,2019-07-30,Bajaj Auto,"Almost every established two-wheeler maker has voiced unease over the way the electric conversion plan is being pushed

Rahul Bajaj rarely minces words. Few are surprised that, amid all the gloom in the Indian automobile market, the chairman of Bajaj Auto has apportioned a chunk of the blame to government policies. Speaking at the company’s annual general meeting (AGM), he called the government out for being in denial over the economic slowdown. “There is no demand and no private investment,"" he reportedly said. “So where will growth come from? It doesn’t fall from the heavens.""
A particularly sore point was the current policy uncertainty over electric vehicles. The NITI Aayog wants all two-wheelers being sold in India with engine capacities below 150cc to go fully electric by 2025. This would amount to a forced shift in technology. Bajaj is not alone. Almost every established two-wheeler maker has voiced unease over the way the electric conversion plan is being pushed. Ideally, such a switch should be achieved not through government fiat, but market processes. This way, the transition is determined by market offerings, user preferences, and competition among mobike makers. With millions of jobs in this vast industry at stake, the market needs greater agency."

India Inc, it appears, is growing impatient with the government’s economic management. Days after Bajaj Auto Chairman Rahul Bajaj slammed the government for not doing enough to boost demand and private investment in the economy, engineering major Larsen & Toubro’s chairman A.M. Naik has warned that India would be lucky to achieve even 6.5% growth in the current fiscal year; tardy project clearances and lack of reforms have dimmed hopes. He also joined a long list of experts who have raised doubts about the credibility of the Centre’s macro data on the economy. Such plainspeak is welcome. It is a corporate chief’s duty to be frank about a company’s business prospects, especially while addressing shareholders; for a conglomerate like L&T, much depends on the state of the economy.
Many analysts believe that the Indian economy took a turn for the worse in late 2016, after the government demonetized high-value currency notes overnight, crimping demand and paralyzing much economic activity, especially in the cash-dependent informal sector. The disruption stalled a recovery from the pre-2017 phase of growth constraints imposed by a combination of over-indebtedness and sluggish investment, among other factors. The central bank’s relatively tight money policy may have also added to the woes.
While low inflation of the past few years has been attributed to sound monetary policy, it is also a reflection of a demand slump that isn’t much of a surprise, given that India’s savings rate has stayed far below its peak, private investment has failed to pick up, and public spending has been unable to stir up sufficient commercial activity. Today, it is clear that the government needs to think beyond the usual toolbox. Neither an interest rate cut nor a fiscal expansion is likely to do what’s needed. Structural drags have kept higher growth out of reach, and it is these that need to be addressed."

Siblings Susanne Klatten and Stefan Quandt own almost half of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG.
The billionaires are descendants of Guenther Quandt, who built a German industrial empire by, among other things, supplying weapons to the Nazis during World War II. In the years since, the family has established stakes in both Daimler-Benz AG and BMW.
Today, Klatten is Germany’s second-richest person, worth $18.6 billion, with interests in chemicals and carbon production, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Quandt, who owns part of a logistics company and a homeopathic medicine company, has a net worth of $15.5 billion. Both are members of BMW’s supervisory board, making them the richest related pair deriving wealth from the automotive industry.
All told, the 25 richest families in the world now control almost $1.4 trillion in wealth, up 24% from last year. Our list of the 20 wealthiest people who have made fortunes in the automotive sector includes some household names: Tesla’s Elon Musk is worth $23.1 billion; Larry Ellison, with $58.5 billion in total wealth, owns a stake in Tesla that’s worth more than $730 million.
Others are less prominent but no less successful: Pallonji Mistry, chairman of Shapoorji Pallonji Group, owns much of Tata Sons and is worth $20.3 billion; Li Shu Fu, the chairman of Volvo and Geely, is worth $10.6 billion.
The Method
The methodology behind wealth analysis can be challenging. In fortunes backed by decades of accumulated assets and dividends, the true extent of an individual’s or family’s holdings is often obscured. Most in this tax bracket are not thrilled to have their names, assets, shares, and interests published by a global news organization. Automotive wealth also tends to be a family affair. While individual members of these dynasties may not make the list, a clan’s overall wealth may be vast. (See: the Ford, Porsche, and Pieech families.) So we followed the same criteria applied to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index.
In order to keep it (relatively) simple, we have omitted those whose wealth comes from oil. Take the House of Saud, for instance. The family is worth an estimated $100 billion, a figure based on the cumulative payouts the country’s royals have received over the past five decades from the executive office of the king. That number doesn’t even include the planned initial public offering of its crown jewel, oil giant Saudi Aramco. It will be offered with an anticipated valuation of $2 trillion.
Maybe we’ll come up with a special list for members of the House of Saud. In the meantime, here are the year’s richest people in cars.*

22,2019-10-16,Bajaj Auto,"The new Chetak will be available with two variants which will offer range of 85 kilometre and 95 kilometre, respectivelyBajaj stopped manufacturing traditional scooters around 2009, in order to focus more on motorcycles segment

Bajaj Auto Ltd, India's second largest motorcycle manufacturer, on Wednesday announced its second innings in the scooter segment, almost after a decade's gap, with the launch of its electric scooter — Chetak. The Pune-based company did not reveal the price of the product and will announce it before beginning dispatches.
Bajaj stopped manufacturing traditional scooters around 2009 in order to focus on motorcycles.
The new Chetak will be available in two variants and offer a range of 85 kilometre and 95 kilometre.
According to Rajiv Bajaj, managing director Bajaj Auto, there is immense potential for scooters and three-wheelers in the electric space. 
“When we do something it’s better to come first and there is virtually no point coming second or third. It’s very important to be first to market. Scooters and step-through are a very important segment and we have not made the electric Chetak to be in the volume space. We are trying build meaningful niches with three wheelers, super bikes and electric scooters,"" said Bajaj.
The company will start selling the electric scooter in January in Pune and later expand to Bangalore. Subsequent expansion will depend on the demand in these two cities. The vehicle will be sold from the Pro Biking dealerships of the company from which it also sells the KTM super bike.
“Biggest hurdle (for adoption of electric mobility) is the conflicting idea in minds of manufacturers since they are making money from petrol and diesel vehicles. The fact that Bajaj doesn’t sell scooters is our bigger strength. We are starting from here because there is not conflict of interest. When you enter into a new market you don’t make money from day one. The price will not be viable from day one,"" added Bajaj.
The reduction in corporate tax will give the company an additional room of  ₹450-500 crore, which it will use to absorb some of the cost of developing and manufacturing the electric scooter."
21,2019-10-17,Bajaj Auto,"Bajaj Auto unveiled its Chetak e-scooter in New Delhi todayPune and Bengaluru will be the first two cities where the scooter will be sold

NEW DELHI :
Marking its comeback in the scooter market, Bajaj Auto today launched its electric scooter (e-scooter) under the iconic Chetak brand.
Pune will be the first city where the bike would be sold in January while Bengaluru would be the second one. Bajaj Auto said subsequent sales will be based on demand coming from these two cities. Bajaj Chetak e-scooter will be sold from the Pro Biking dealerships of the company from which it also sells the KTM super bikes.
Bajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj said it wanted to be the first mover in the electric segment as an established player in the two-wheeler industry. ""With this attitude, we have decided to move into electric vehicles,"" he said.
Features, specs of Bajaj Chetak electric scooter:
Bajaj's new Chetak e-scooter comes with range of 85 km on sports mode and 95 km on eco mode on a single charge of around 5 hours.
The Bajaj Chetak scooter will also have features to protect it from theft and the owner will get notifications in case of an accident or unauthorized access.
Bajaj Chetak electric scooter price:
Bajaj Auto has not yet disclosed the price of its new Chetak scooter. Prices will be announced before it starts dispatching vehicles to showrooms. Bajaj Auto has, however, said the price would not be more than  ₹1.5 lakh.
Export plans:
To be rolled out from the company's Chakan plant, Bajaj Auto also plans to export the model to various relevant markets in Europe from next year itself.
Bajaj said that the launch of the e-scooter doesn't mean that the company is making a comeback into the traditional scooter segment. He said the company's focus would remain on bikes for volumes, while the e-scooter along with other other brands like KTM and Triumph would act as niche segments."

The announcement of a new Brexit deal agreed between the UK and European Union (EU) came in just before the Indian equity markets closed on Thursday. Global and domestic investors cheered the news of Britain’s departure from the EU, with benchmark Indian indices rallying to end near one-month high.
While the Sensex surged 453 points to close above the 39,000 mark at the fag end of today’s session, Nifty 50 settled 1% higher at 11,586, the highest levels for both the indices since 24 September.
Shares of Indian companies that have business exposure to the UK and Europe--Tata Motors Ltd, Eicher Motors Ltd, Bajaj Auto Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd, Bharat Forge, Mastek Ltd, Tata Elxsi Ltd and Motherson Sumi Systems Ltd--boomed in the last 30 minutes of today’s trade.
Here is a list of five major Indian stocks impacted by the Brexit deal:

Bajaj Auto: The auto company had announced a partnership with UK-based Triumph Motorcycles in August 2017 to capture the mid-weight motorcycles market in India. Bajaj Auto also exports two and three wheelers to the Europe and a no-deal Brexit would have likely caused disruptions in the supply chain. The stock of the two-wheeler manufacturer settled 3% higher."

Bajaj Auto today reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter ended September 30, pushing its shares 2% higher in afternoon trade. Bajaj Auto shares were up 2% at  ₹3,186 as compared to a 0.44% rise in Sensex. The automaker's profit rose 22% to  ₹1,402 crore, aided by a tax expense reversal of  ₹182 crore due to the recent lowering of corporate tax rate. 
Revenue from operations dipped 4% year on year to  ₹7,707 crore.  Operating margin also dipped to 16.9% from 17.9% a year earlier. 
Total volumes during the quarter dipped 12% to 1,173,591 units as compared to 1,339,444 units in the same quarter of the previous quarter. 
""Q2 was a difficult quarter for the domestic motorcycle industry. In retail terms, the decline was 14% ( in billing terms, the decline was 21%). Performance of Bajaj Auto was in line with the industry; retail market share at about 20%,"" Bajaj Auto said in a statement. 
In August 2019, Bajaj Auto had launched an all new Pulsar 125 and has sold over 40,000 units.

14,2019-10-24,Bajaj Auto,"Management says that it had raised product prices in July, September. Besides, export realizations have also been betterBajaj Auto improved its operations in what can be seen as a lacklustre quarter

Bajaj Auto Ltd appears to be cruising despite the winds of change in the auto sector. The second quarter performance was much ahead of the Street’s estimates. Immediately after the results, the company’s stock perked up 3.7% on Wednesday, eventually ending about 1.3% higher at close of the day’s trade.
As it turns out, Bajaj Auto improved its operations in what can be seen as a lacklustre quarter. Besides, a benign cost environment and lower tax rates resulted in an improvement in its profit. Net profit surged 21.7% to  ₹1,402 crore in Q2 FY20, compared to the year-ago quarter, on a stand-alone basis.
This came in sharply higher than Bloomberg’s consensus expectations of about  ₹1,153 crore, which is what the Street liked. One reason for this spike was the company’s decision to opt for the lower corporate tax rate, which the management clarified during a conference call after the results.
Overall revenue, though, was lower, which mirrors the slowdown in the two- and three-wheeler space. Revenue dipped about 4% in Q2 year-on-year. However, it was ahead of the Street’s expectations by about  ₹300 crore. This was so because Bajaj Auto has managed to improve realizations even on lower volumes.
The product mix has been marginally in favour of three-wheelers. Additionally, the management said that it had raised product prices in July and September. Besides, export realizations have also been better. However, overall sales volumes dipped from 1.24 million vehicles in the year-ago quarter to about 1.17 million vehicles in the September quarter.
Additionally, lower raw material prices meant the company could control its operating expenses. As a result, Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) stood at 16.6%, an improvement of about 120 basis points quarter-on-quarter. However, this was lower than the year-ago’s 17.1% .
One test for Bajaj Auto in the slowing two-wheeler sales environment would be to find out whether it could gain market share. The auto market is also transitioning to BS-VI emission norms. On that front, the company has lined up some new launches to aid its market share growth. Besides, the ongoing transition to BS-VI emission norms is not seeing any aggressive pricing by competitors so far, which is a good sign.
It seems like the market is expecting the company to continue to clock improved performances on the back of benign raw material prices and a better realizations environment. However, much depends on the trajectory of sales after the festive season. If it shows signs of improving, investor interest may continue to remain high for Bajaj Auto."

12,2019-11-07,Bajaj Auto,"The company aims to export 1 million units a yearIt was originally planned for a 2016-17 deadline

For Hero MotoCorp Ltd (HMCL), India’s largest two-wheeler manufacturer, achieving its lofty aim of exporting 1 million units a year will take some more time. Originally planned for a 2016-17 deadline, the company now aims to achieve this aim in another four years.
“We continue to aspire for crossing the (said) milestone. Our annual export volumes stood less than 210,000 units last fiscal. Our revised export target involves a five-fold growth thereby crossing one million units in another 3-4 years,"" Rajat Bhargava, head, strategy and performance transformation, global business and emerging mobility at Hero MotoCorp told Mint in an interview. In line with that, the company plans to increase contribution of exports to annual turnover from the current 3% to 10% by FY2023–FY24, Bhargava said.
Bhargava was talking on the sidelines of the ongoing EICMA Motorcycle Show in Milan, Italy.
Hero MotoCorp had first announced its 1-million unit export ambition in 2011, just after separating from its Japanese partner Honda Motor Company Ltd. The joint venture with Honda had prevented the Indian company from entering foreign markets.
While export volumes were less than 3% of Hero MotoCorp’s total annual production in FY2019, its domestic rivals such as Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Company exported 40% and 16.5% respectively of their total production last fiscal.
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Nigeria and Colombia are the top five export markets that are expected to drive the five-fold growth, the company said.
Hero MotoCorp currently exports two-wheelers to 40 countries, with Bangladesh as its biggest market, accounting for about 45% of total exports.
Bhargava said while Hero was present mostly in developing markets similar to India, with typically high demand for motorcycles, the export strategy is to expand its existing footprints, rather than adding newer territories, in the near future.
The company entered the Africa markets in FY2016-17, with primary focus on Nigeria, which also is one the biggest export markets for the maker of Pulsar bikes — Bajaj Auto Ltd.
Even as Africa accounts for about 6% of total annual exports for Hero MotoCorp as of now, it is a far bigger export market for both Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Company.
“This is why we see a lot of headroom for future growth. Other Indian two-wheeler makers have been present in Africa for more than a decade whereas we have reached those markets only after separating from Honda,"" said Bhargava.
Besides Nigeria, Hero MotoCorp exports to about 10 African countries currently, including Uganda, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Madagascar.
“We are in a phase where it’s time to roll and penetrate further into these specific markets. Until two years ago, even the African countries were not growing due to oil price crash, which impacted their economies. We are now progressively introducing new products in these markets,"" he added.
The company has also taken a conscious decision of not venturing into south East Asian markets such as Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia and others, primarily to avoid stiff competition from its Japanese counterparts. Brazil is another similar country, which is not on the export radar of Hero MotoCorp.
“We are not looking at the South East Asian markets for many reasons. These are mature two-wheeler markets where Honda and Yamaha together command a market share of 90%. Also, these markets have declined in the recent past. These are entry barriers,"" the company said."
11,2019-11-11,Bajaj Auto,"In August 2017, the two companies had announced a partnership to develop and manufacture midsized motorcyclesBajaj it is understood has given critical inputs to Triumph on engine specifications and motorcycle categories and once the prototypes are finalized for India

The alliance between Bajaj Auto Ltd and Triumph Motorcycles Ltd will sell mid-capacity bikes only under the Triumph brand in India, top executives of the British bike maker said in an interview. Apart from providing key inputs pertaining to the design, Bajaj will also be responsible for sales and marketing initiatives across the Indian market, they added.
“It will be a Triumph-branded motorcycle all through and, therefore, it will be part of the Triumph range in India. They will be sold through Triumph dealerships in India,"" said Paul Stroud, chief commercial officer, Triumph Motorcycles.
In August 2017, the two companies had announced a partnership to develop and manufacture mid-sized (250cc to 800cc) motorcycles to cater to the aspirations of young riders in India and other emerging markets. However, the two companies are yet to sign a formal agreement.
Bajaj is contributing with critical inputs on engine specifications and motorcycle categories, and once the prototypes are finalized for India, the models will be streamlined into Bajaj’s production system. The homegrown company is also planning to set up an assembly line to manufacture the motorcycles. Stroud said Triumph has worked on a few early prototypes.
“We are very pleased with how the bikes are looking,"" said Steve Sargent, chief product officer, Triumph, suggesting that the formal agreement may be signed by the end of December.
Even Bajaj Auto managing director Rajiv Bajaj, who had travelled to Triumph’s UK facility last month, liked and approved the prototypes,"" Sargent added.
Apart from sharing revenue and consolidating its portfolio in India and overseas, it is not clear what more Bajaj Auto expects to gain from the joint venture. For the proposed JV, Triumph has developed an all-new engine platform, which will power several variants with different displacements within the 250-750cc categories.
As of FY19, the mid-capacity motorcycle market in India witnessed sales of 833,300 units, with Royal Enfield commanding a market share of around 97%. The growth of mid-sized motorcycles in India is indicative of the aspirations of the youth, who wish to upgrade from smaller variants (100cc-150cc). “The motorcycles will be manufactured by Bajaj even for markets where Triumph sells them,"" Sargent said.
Betting on Bajaj Auto’s economies of large-scale manufacturing, Triumph officials aim to pitch the motorcycles against category majors such as Royal Enfield, Harley-Davidson, KTM, BMW Motorrad and TVS Motor Co.
“Bajaj have the economies of scale to manufacture the products at a price that can compete in India and the subcontinent. That also means the product can be competitive in other emerging markets,"" Sargent added.
Bajaj, which is India’s largest exporter of motorcycles, has a similar JV with Austrian partner KTM AG, wherein the Indian company manufactures the Duke and RC motorcycles (up to 400cc) at its Chakan facility, while KTM sells the products under its brand."

Bajaj Auto Ltd plans to share the platform of its debut Chetak brand of electric scooter with KTM and Husqvarna to develop new products in line with the ethos of the two brands.
“The best way to be a global company is to produce platforms, which are modular and flexible, and can be leveraged by different brands. Going forward, we can use this platform for both KTM and Husqvarna scooters. My counterpart Stefan Pierer (KTM CEO) has already spoken on this and the product development is underway,"" said Rajiv Bajaj, managing director, Bajaj Auto.
Bajaj Auto owns about a 48% stake in KTM, which in turn, owns the Husqvarna brand of motorcycles.
“You can imagine if this has to be a KTM scooter, it has to be ready to race and, if it has to be a Husqvarna model, then it has to live up to this cool image. So, we will have different brands to carve this EV space into small niches,"" Bajaj said on the sidelines of an event to showcase the Chetak at the company’s Akurdi factory on the outskirts of Pune.
The electric Chetak, which has been developed and designed in-house by Bajaj, marks the revival of the company’s scooter business after about a decade. However, taking a prudent approach, Bajaj plans to launch the scooter in January first in Pune, and then in Bengaluru.
“We will take one step at a time because this is a new product, it is new technology and entire network has to be made ready. We have to train people both on the selling side and also on the servicing side. All this takes time,"" said Eric Vas, president, urbanite business, Bajaj Auto.
Vas estimates the average market size of high-speed electric scooters at about 3,000 units per month.
The company said it can make up to 2,000 electric Chetak scooters, but will raise capacity based on demand. Bajaj Auto will roll out the new Chetak scooters from its Chakan plant. It also has plans to make electric three-wheelers and quadricycles.
“What I can tell you is that we have not invested in the setup, put so many people at work, designed a product, made riders ride electric scooters across the country because I want to sell 100 units a month. We don’t want to do that. If we have put so much effort, certainly this would translate into big numbers. We have said in the past that the pricing would be in the range  ₹1-1.5 lakhs,"" said Bajaj declining to disclose the investments in the project."

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Friday:
Bharti Airtel: The telecom operator reported a massive net loss in the September quarter due to an unfavourable Supreme Court verdict on the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR). The company posted a loss of  ₹23,045 crore in July-September against a profit of  ₹118 crore due to provisions made for payment of dues in the AGR case. Its net loss exceeded revenue from operations, which grew 4.9% year-on-year to  ₹21,131 crore in the quarter.
RIL: Moody's Investors Service on Thursday affirmed Baa2 domestic long-term issuer rating and foreign currency senior unsecured rating. Moody's also affirmed the Baa2-backed domestic currency senior unsecured debt ratings on dollar-denominated bonds issued by Reliance Holding USA, Inc., with a guarantee from RIL. The outlook on the ratings is stable.
Vedanta: The company, after market hours on Thursday, reported a 44% year-on-year jump in its consolidated net profit to  ₹2,731 crore in the September quarter following a deferred tax writeback of  ₹1,891 crore. However, revenue in the second quarter of the current fiscal slipped 3% to  ₹21,739 crore primarily due to lower international prices of zinc and aluminium.
Operating profit for the said quarter was at  ₹4,497 crore, down 15% year-on-year.
Vodafone Idea: The company reported a whopping net loss of  ₹50,922 crore in the quarter-ended September compared with a net loss of  ₹4,874 crore a year ago, as the Supreme Court’s verdict in favour of the department of telecommunications led to provisions made for dues and penalties to be paid to the government. The telecom industry, which is already burdened with falling tariffs and mounting debt, will have to a repay a massive  ₹92,000 crore.
IOC: The government is planning to reduce its stake in the fuel retailer below 51% while ensuring that the Centre and state-run companies retain control of the the company, according to a Bloomberg report. A cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi will look at selling shares in some state-owned companies, including Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.
Dr Reddy’s: The pharmaceutical major entered the nutrition segment in India with the launch of ‘Celevida’ drink, targeted at diabetics to help them manage blood sugar levels. Made from soy, ragi and gram flours, Celevida is formulated to have high protein and fibre, and slow-digesting carbohydrates, which will help managing postprandial blood glucose response and satiety of patients.
Bajaj Auto: The auto company plans to share the platform of its all-new electric scooter ‘Chetak’ with KTM and Husqvarna, according to a Mint report. With its new electric scooter, Bajaj Auto Ltd brings back Chetak brand after almost 15 years. The company said it plans to launch the e-scooter in January starting from Pune, followed by Bengaluru next year.
PNB: India's federal police will soon file fresh charges in the $2 billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case and detail how the alleged wrongdoing was carried out, according to a Bloomberg report. In the police's initial charges, billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi, 21 other people, including PNB officials, and three Modi companies were accused of being involved in fraudulent transactions that led to losses of roughly  ₹6,500 crore ($911 million) for PNB.
Fortis: The Supreme Court on Thursday quashed the proceedings for eviction of Fortis Healthcare Ltd’s subsidiary Escort Heart Institute & Research Centre from its premises at Okhla in Delhi. The case pertained to the 25% quota for economically weaker sections that hospitals have to provide for getting land for the premises.
Union Bank: The public-sector bank on Thursday said its September quarter net loss stood at  ₹1,194 crore on account of higher provisioning for bad loans. The bank had posted a net profit of  ₹139 crore for the same period last year. The loss was higher than a Bloomberg poll of 7 analysts’ estimate of  ₹293.5 crore."
8,2019-11-24,Bajaj Auto,"Rajiv Bajaj of Bajaj Auto said nobody is going to put up an infrastructure for anything unless they actually see demand (for EVs) on the roadsThe Bajaj Auto MD recalled that demand for alternate-fuel driven auto-rickshaws picked up despite the absence of the CNG fuel stations in Delhi in the past

As the auto industry continues to debate the dependence of electric vehicle (EV) adoption on the availability of charging network across India, the top executive at Bajaj Auto said that creation of demand for EVs and its adoption is squarely the job of the vehicle manufacturers.
Cautioning the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) from blaming the unavailability of charging infrastructure for EVs, Rajiv Bajaj, managing director, Bajaj Auto Ltd said, “We should not get caught in this vicious cycle of chicken-and-egg where we say whether EVs should come first or whether EV charging stations should come first because nobody is going to put up an infrastructure for anything unless they actually see demand (for EVs) on the roads. So it is squarely the job of the manufacturer, not of the government, not of the Niti Aayog, not of the FM or the PM.""
“This is our job that we have to put out the EVs, which are such that people buy it despite the absence of infrastructure and all the other known issues,"" he added referring to the notions around range anxiety, safety and reliability of the battery powered vehicles.
He was responding to a query from Mint on the sidelines of a presentation on the electric scooter Chetak recently.
Earlier, top bosses from the other homegrown vehicle manufacturers including Guenter Butschek, MD and CEO, Tata Motors Ltd and Pawan Goenka, MD, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) had voiced out similar opinion wherein they suggested that the OEMs must take the responsibility to create demand for EVs, especially after the several steps taken by the Modi administration to boost the adoption of eco-friendly vehicles.
The central government has taken a bevy of steps such as lowering of corporate taxes on new manufacturing units, customs duty exemption on lithium-ion cells, tax rebates on interest payments on loans for EVs, besides other incentives.
Meanwhile, drawing parallel with the CNG three-wheelers, Bajaj recalled that the demand for alternate-fuel driven auto-rickshaws picked up despite the absence of the CNG fuel stations in Delhi in the past. “The auto-rickshaw drivers used to queue up for six hours as there were no CNG stations. But the demand (for CNG three-wheelers) was there because they loved the CNG vehicles, as they were clean and economical. Despite all those hardships, people bought it because of the strong product USP,"" he said.
With its all-new electric Chetak, Bajaj Auto returns to the scooter segment after almost a decade. The company had stopped manufacturing scooters in 2009 as it prioritized focus on the motorcycle segment, which offered better margins.
The electric Bajaj Chetak would be commercially launched in January 2020 when its price would be revealed. However, the top company executive has already hinted at a price range of  ₹100,000 –  ₹150,000 for Bajaj Auto’s first electric scooter."
7,2019-11-27,Bajaj Auto,"This comes in the backdrop of India’s changing mobility landscapeThe urban mobility startup has been gaining traction from traditional tech venture capitalists and venture debt investors

New Delhi: Bajaj Auto Ltd, India’s second largest motorcycle manufacturer, will invest in Bengaluru-based cycle sharing platform Yulu, which offers electric cycles and bicycles on hire for last-mile commute.
This comes in the backdrop of India’s changing mobility landscape. The interest from Rajiv Bajaj-helmed Bajaj Auto in a ride hailing firm also comes at a time of cab-hailing giant Uber’s interest in the space.
“Bajaj Auto Ltd is investing $8 million in Yulu, to compliment this strategic relationship. Yulu will source from Bajaj electric two-wheelers which have been co-designed and manufactured exclusively for shared micro-mobility. Bajaj will also consider facilitating the vehicle finance needs of Yulu for a large scale deployment of its micro-mobility electric vehicles,"" the companies said in a joint statement.
The urban mobility startup, co-founded by ex-InMobi founder Amit Gupta and entrepreneur R.K. Misra, has been gaining traction from traditional tech venture capitalists and venture debt investors. The service was launched in Bengaluru and has since expanded to Mumbai, Pune, Bhubaneswar and Delhi.
“At BAL (Bajaj Auto Ltd), we believe that the two factors of congestion reduction and pollution control will drive the segment of shared micro-mobility in the future. That coupled with the expansion of Mass Rapid Transport System like Metro in large cities will further boost the demand for flexible last-mile connectivity. In Yulu we find an experienced and committed partner with robust achievement of success metrics in a very short time. And this is why we decided to partner with them in their journey of bringing Yulu service to every neighborhood of Urban India,"" said Rajiv Bajaj, managing director Bajaj Auto in the statement.
In response to Mint’s queries on Friday, an external spokesperson for Bajaj Auto Ltd in an emailed response said, “Have asked the concerned team, waiting for their response.""
Yulu’ investors include Blume Ventures, Japan’s Akatsuki Entertainment Technology Fund, 3One4 Capital, as well as from individual investors such as Anand Chandrasekaran, Binny Bansal, InMobi co-founder Naveen Tewari, Freshworks co-founder Gireesh Mathrubootham and SlideShare founder Amit Ranjan. In May, Uber announced a pilot with electric scooter sharing platform Yulu in Bengaluru.
“Yulu plans to increase its fleet size to 100,000 electric two-wheelers by Dec 2020 with an extensive network of its battery-swapping stations across the cities where it operates,"" the statement added
There has been growing traction in the space. Mint reported on 22 November about cab-hailing giant Uber beginning talks with bike rental startup Bounce to list its two-wheelers on the Uber India app.
Amit Gupta, co-founder and CEO, Yulu, said in the statement, “Bajaj Auto Ltd is the leading automaker of India and is respected globally for it’s quality and manufacturing capabilities at scale. Yulu is the leading electric micro-mobility service provider that requires reliable, durable and comfortable electric vehicles to serve its customers, hence a committed manufacturing partner is crucial to our success.""
After protesting along with TVS Motor Co. Ltd chairman Venu Srinivasan against the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s plans to convert a part of its internal combustion engine (ICE)-driven two-wheelers and all three-wheelers into electric, Bajaj Auto Ltd last month announced its second innings in the scooter segment, almost after a decade’s gap, with the launch of its electric scooter — Chetak.
Federal policy think tank NITI Aayog, which is spearheading the government’s EV initiatives, and the ministry of road transport and highways, among others, was earlier considering a policy proposal to ban all ICE-driven two-wheelers under 150cc by 2025, and three-wheelers by 2023. Nearly 80% of all vehicles sold in India are two- and three-wheelers.
India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, has taken several steps in the past few months in its push to combat widespread pollution in its major cities. The government also aims to trim its hefty fuel import bill through the shift to electric vehicles.
The Narendra Modi government is making an aggressive push for a cleaner and cost-effective mode of transport. As part of the strategy, India is putting the final shape on a plan to build at least four Tesla-style giga factories to manufacture batteries with an investment of around $4 billion, as reported by Mint on 25 July. In March, the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles or FAME 2 scheme—to expand commercial vehicle fleet—was also announced with an outlay of  ₹10,000 crore.
The government has been trying to incentivize the adoption of EVs through several steps in the past few months, similar to those taken by governments in China and Europe. The Goods and Services Tax Council headed by finance minister Nirmala Sithraman reduced tax on EVs and chargers to 5% from 12% and 18%, respectively. India also announced customs duty exemption on lithium-ion cells, which will help lower the cost of lithium-ion batteries in India, as they are not produced locally.
As part of the strategy to encourage private sector investment in the strategically important sector, the government is also looking at a raft of tax incentives for manufacturers and a suitable basic customs duty safeguard from 2021-2030 for making advanced chemistry cells and battery in India."

Hero Electric, the country’s largest electric two-wheeler manufacturer, plans to double its capacity to 75,000-80,000 units per year over the next three years, despite rising competition in the segment following the entry of traditional motorcycle and scooter manufacturers, a senior company executive said.
The company also plans to increase its dealerships to 1000 from the current count of around 600.
Naveen Munjal, chairman of Hero Electric, told Mint the company is targeting raising more funds next year to not only expand its manufacturing capacity, but also to increase the number of dealerships and marketing initiatives.
In December 2018, Hero Electric had raised  ₹160 crore from Mumbai-based Alpha Capital to build its second factory, develop new products, and expand dealer network on hopes that local demand for its eco-friendly products will nearly double in the next few years.
Since then, competition in the segment has heated up.
Bajaj Auto Ltd showcased its first electric scooter named Chetak in October, while TVS Motor is expected to launch their product in 2020. “The entry of Bajaj and TVS is a good thing since that will open up the landscape. Our market share will shrink but the market will expand. So, there will be opportunities,"" added Munjal.
The Munjal-led company’s sales in the first six months of the this fiscal fell following the introduction of new government regulations, effective April, under the second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles (FAME) programme, which required retooling of its products. Munjal did not disclose the sales of his company for the period.
“The government needs to provide demand incentives and should look at a three year window,"" said Munjal. “Till date some of the critical components for the internal combustion engine driven vehicles are imported and it took so many years to localise. Same will be for electric vehicles as well.""
The union government has sanctioned Rs10,000 crore for the FAME scheme to incentivise sales of electric vehicles across the country. The incentives, though, will be given only if manufacturers start using locally-made parts for their vehicles."
5,2019-12-03,Bajaj Auto,"It’s important to create a relationship between the government and India Inc that is mutually beneficial. Always. To critique is not to criticize; to reach out is to participate.

India Inc. has a new whistle-blower, and his name is Rahul Bajaj. In this age of corporate best practices, timely disclosures and transparency, a new breed of whistle-blowers has emerged to alert investors and regulators when companies play fast and loose with standards of governance. The chairman of Bajaj Auto Ltd, though, is a different kind of a whistle-blower. Bajaj is the living antithesis of discreet revelations: He has built a formidable reputation for candour and forthrightness, and his current outpourings are true to past form. By pointing out to home minister Amit Shah that an atmosphere of fear has stifled freedom to criticize the government, he articulated what businessmen have only dared say in private. The book World Class In India, written by the late management guru Sumantra Ghoshal and co-authored by Gita Piramal and Sudeep Budhiraja, describes Rahul Bajaj as “…an outspoken iconoclast who was regularly in the news not only as a spokesman for the Indian industry in general, but also for his often forward thinking and blunt views on a variety of social and economic issues that affected the country"". This was evident even in November 1993, when he decided to go public with submissions of the Bombay Club—a group of eight prominent Indian industrialists, including Bajaj—to the finance minister of the time, Manmohan Singh, seeking for domestic industry a level playing field with foreign companies entering India.
There is another reason why Bajaj is different. He nominated himself as an industry spokesperson who must speak truth to power. Or, to paraphrase what he said in Hindi, he has sacrificed himself for the greater good. The “sacrifice"", though, puts two issues in sharp relief. One, Bajaj’s peer group and industry colleagues are diminishing his sacrifice with their silence and refusal to support his cause. They do not need to form a chorus, but can at least follow up with suggestions to the government on what can be done to empower industry and improve the economy. Corporate India often cites examples of the freedom afforded to companies in the US, especially their flexible labour policies, but studiously ignores their ability to freely criticize the US government or president. Bill Gates has openly criticized Donald Trump, and so have many other business leaders, without causing a flutter. India Inc. should realize that keeping quiet further curdles an existing conspiracy of silence. It is all the more ironic because all this is happening at a time when India’s government is reaching out to industry for cooperation in ending the economic slowdown.
Unfortunately, some have failed to properly appreciate Bajaj’s observations, though Amit Shah was rather empathetic and restrained in his response. Party faithfuls and some ministers have jumped in to vilify the industrialist without realizing that this only reinforces his plaint. What this defensive word-cloud seems to highlight is a sense of victimhood. It’s important to create a relationship between the government and India Inc that is mutually beneficial. Always. To critique is not to criticize; to reach out is to participate. India Inc needs to understand this too. If so, it is time to recalibrate the relationship. India’s ruling party has a decisive electoral mandate, which should give its government the resolve to listen, consult and execute without fear or favour. But it’s a process that feeds on continuous feedback."
4,2019-12-06,Bajaj Auto,"The Husqvarna motorcycles will be sold alongside the KTM rangeWith Swedish roots, Husqvarna was acquired by KTM AG from its previous owner, BMW Group

India’s second largest motorcycle manufacturer, Bajaj Auto Ltd (BAL) has introduced the Husqvarna brand of bikes for the domestic market today in Goa. The Pune-based company has unveiled two motorcycle models – Svartpilen 250 and Vitpilen 250 – that are to be launched by January – February 2020.
The Husqvarna motorcycles will be sold alongside the KTM range through Bajaj Auto’s existing network of probiking stores across the country, Sumeet Narang, president, probiking, Bajaj Auto told Mint.
With Swedish roots, Husqvarna was acquired by KTM AG from its previous owner, BMW Group, in 2013 as the Austrian bikemaker attempted to consolidate its presence in Europe and emerging markets globally.
The Husqvarna motorcycles would be manufactured at Bajaj Auto’s Chakan plant and will share several components, besides the 249cc, single-cylinder engine, with the KTM’s 250cc models (KTM 250 Duke).
While analysts see KTM’s synergies with Husqvarna bikes as a positive for Bajaj Auto’s margins, it was earlier expected that the company would roll out the brand in the more premium 375cc engine displacement range.
“We have learnt from our experience that 250cc is a sweet spot in the domestic motorcycle market. This category offers the best of performance that can help you ride anywhere as well a good combination of fuel economy and affordability. So it is a conscious decision by the management to get the brand in the quarter-liter segment as certain degree of scale is important,"" Narang said justifying the company’s move to expand its offering in the said category.
Narang said while KTM inspires fast riding, Husqvarna is meant for more mature (urban) riders without any compromise on the motorcycles’ performance. “You can assume that KTM caters to young riders aging between 18-25 year old, Husqvarna would appeal to the riders aged between 25-35 years of age,"" he added.
The Husqvarna bikes would be made available across 30 cities in its first month of retail sales, said Narang, who estimates that in the mid-term the Swedish brand would generate similar demand as that of the KTM’s 200-250cc range.
Bajaj Auto also unveiled its much awaited KTM 390 Adventure motorcycle today. While pricing is not disclosed as of now, the model would be available from end-January 2020. It would directly compete with Royal Enfield’s Himalayan and would cater to customers looking for on-and-off road riding applications."

1,2019-12-20,Bajaj Auto,"Changes imminent in over 214 firms as chairpersons can’t be related to MD or CEOOf the top 500 firms, 162 have the same person as the chairperson, MD and CEO

MUMBAI :
Anand Mahindra’s decision to be non-executive chairman of Mahindra and Mahindra, effective 1 April 2020, is also a culmination of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) regulations, which mandate that the chairperson of the top 500 companies need to be non-executive.
To comply with Sebi norms, such changes are imminent in over 214 companies, including banks, public sector enterprises and large corporates, including Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Bharti Airtel Ltd, Wipro Ltd, Bajaj Auto Ltd and Adani Ports Ltd.
The likes of Mukesh Ambani of RIL, Sunil Bharti Mittal of Bharti Airtel, Sanjiv Mehta of Hindustan Unilever and Sanjiv Puri of ITC will have to either become a non-executive chairperson, or take the executive role of managing director and chief executive officer.
According to data compiled by nseinfobase.com (run by Prime Database) of the top 500 companies, 162 have the same person as the chairperson, MD and CEO. In another 52 companies, the chairperson and MD/CEO are related.
Sebi norms under the Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirement (LODR) also mandate that chairperson cannot be related to the MD or CEO. Sebi relies on the definition of a relative as per the Companies Act, 2013.
“Promoter assuming a non-executive chairperson role is and would be rare. In my view, in most cases, you would find the promoter shall continue with the role of MD/CEO while appointing an existing independent director as the non-executive chairperson. There is still a long way to go. As with other regulations, especially relating to the composition of board, the true test will lie in its implementation -- would there be simple checkbox compliance as we have seen in the past or would the implementation be in spirit as well,"" said Pranav Haldea, managing director, Prime Database, a primary market tracker.
Most of India Inc. is currently consulting lawyers and family office specialists on restructuring their management and board chairmanship.
“Corporates do not want a situation where they are saddled with someone, either at the board level or management level, who does not understand the thinking of promoters. Many Indian companies for years have been promoter-driven with control over management and board. So, the restriction that MD/CEO and chairman cannot be related is another big concern. The succession planning is acutely being relooked at,"" said a senior lawyer, who is consulting with some of the Nifty 50 companies on navigating the new Sebi requirements.
But, there are also some corporates who are resisting the change and urging Sebi to revisit the norms. So far, Sebi has refused to consider representations from India Inc. on this issue.
According to a joint report published by International Finance Corp. (IFC), the BSE and Institutional Investor Advisory Services India (IiAS) on corporate governance practice in Indian boardrooms, there is a pushback on Sebi regulations seeking separation of chairperson and CEO roles.
“We find that 57 companies in the BSE 100 and 23 of the 50 IPO companies have separated the roles of the chairperson and CEO, with the chairperson being non-executive. However, some companies have a chairperson and CEO from the same promoter group,"" said the report."
2,2019-12-22,Bajaj Auto,"Nearly 70% of Hero’s 2-wheelers are in entry-level segment, where cost of transition is reportedly the highestThe pressure of BS-VI transition is likely to pose risks to all two-wheeler players, albeit in varying degrees

Hero Motocorp Ltd is the country’s largest two-wheeler maker, enjoying about half the market share with a dominance in motorcycles. Yet, its stock has been the worst performer among peers in the past year.
Hero Motocorp’s stock trades at 14 times its one-year forward estimated earnings, while peers Bajaj Auto Ltd and TVS Motor Company Ltd trade at 18 and 25 times, respectively.
What gives?
Analysts say Hero’s profitability may be hit the hardest in FY20 and FY21 among two-wheeler firms due to the transition to BS-VI compliant vehicles, starting April. This is because nearly 70% of the company’s two-wheelers are in the entry-level segment, where the cost of transition is reportedly the highest. “Entry-level motorcycles cost increase is likely to be 12-13% double that for premium motorcycles,"" says Bharat Gianani, analyst, Sharekhan. TVS and Bajaj have 13% and 29% entry-level two-wheelers respectively in their overall volumes.
Furthermore, unlike its peers, Hero cannot find relief in exports where the BS-VI emission rules are not applicable. Only 3% of its total sales accrues from exports. In this respect, Bajaj and TVS export 46% and 20% respectively of their two-wheeler sales. Thus, they can hedge the downturn in domestic demand and impact on profit margins during the transition with exports that have been robust in the last few quarters.
That’s not all. Hero has already underperformed the industry in the last two months as it resorted to inventory correction to transition into new norms.
The pertinent question from an investor standpoint is: Will Hero pass on cost increase to customers? “Given the weak demand, Hero may not do so. This, along with poor operating leverage would impact profit margins,"" says Gianani.
On top of this, the discounts to liquidate the 30-40 days inventory of BS-IV vehicles will impinge profitability in the near term. As such Ebitda margin fell from 16% levels in FY18 to about 14% in recent quarters. This is unlikely to turn favourable in the near term. Besides, marketing costs for all auto firms in the run up to BS-VI new launches is expected to be high.
“BS-VI would not just impact overall demand but also pose a risk of value migration and change in competitive positioning,“ says a report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.
Indeed, the pressure of BS-VI transition is likely to pose risks to all two-wheeler players, albeit in varying degrees. Still, for now it looks like the odds are against Hero due to some inherent weakness in its product mix. The street has also been discerning. Hence, while Hero shares tumbled 30% in the past year, Bajaj gained 12% and TVS lost about 12%. “We have reduced our FY20 and FY21 estimates by 7% and 10% respectively for Hero,"" says Gianani.
While Hero shares tumbled 29%, TVS fell 22% while Bajaj Auto gained 12%"
0,2019-12-23,Bajaj Auto,"To tackle vehicular pollution, the government had asked automobile companies to upgrade to (BS-VI) emission norms April 2020 onwardsBajaj Auto Ltd’s Qute, the first locally produced quadricycle, had initially hit regulatory hurdles due to safety concerns

The road transport and highways ministry has proposed Bharat Stage VI (BS VI) emission norms for quadricycles, with effect from April, 1 2020, according to a draft note seen by Mint. A quadricycle is a four wheeler, which is smaller and lighter than passenger car.
The ministry has sought comments regarding the same.
To tackle vehicular pollution, the government had asked automobile companies to upgrade to (BS-VI) emission norms April 2020 onwards. Currently, quadricycles adhere to BS IV emission norms.
In June, 2018, the Union transport ministry had approved quadricycle as a new category of vehicle to be allowed to run on Indian roads, with the larger idea of giving another mobility option, primarily to the middle class that want to upgrade from two-wheelers.
Bajaj Auto Ltd’s Qute, the first locally produced quadricycle, had initially hit regulatory hurdles due to safety concerns. Others such as Tata Motors Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd are also expected to launch similar products over the next couple of years.
According to Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), as many as 921 quadricyles were sole during April-November in India, as compared to a production of 4,594 units. Such vehicles are primarily exported. As many as 4,074 quadricycles were exported in April-November, 18.9% on year, data showed."
