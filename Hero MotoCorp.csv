New Delhi: Hero MotoCorp Ltd on Tuesday announced its re-entry into the premium motorcycle segment with Xtreme 200R, a 200cc motorcycle that will go head-to-head with the Bajaj Pulsar that dominates the category.
The company, India’s largest two-wheeler company, said it will launch the new motorcycle in about a month. The company did not disclose the price, but the Xtreme 200R is expected to be priced less than Rs1 lakh, a company executive said.
“With every new, indigenously developed Hero two-wheeler, our commitment to the ‘Make in India’ initiative is growing stronger and we will continue to innovate in India, for the world,"" Pawan Munjal, chairman and managing director, Hero MotoCorp Ltd, said in a statement.
“We have begun this year on a positive note, and as we move ahead, we will keep our customers excited with many new products, some of which will be showcased next week at the Auto Expo,"" he added.
Hero now has a fully functional research and development centre near Jaipur where it has invested about Rs850 crore. The same R&D facility has developed the Xtreme 200R, Munjal said.
According to Malo Le Masson, head of global product planning, Hero MotoCorp, there will be more products in the premium segment. 
“From 2018 onwards, the focus for Hero MotoCorp in motorcycles is the premium segment, and we will continue to bring more products in this category.

In spite of its high base, the country’s largest motorcycle maker Hero MotoCorp Ltd has been steadily clocking strong sales, aiding profit growth in spite of rising costs and competitive pressures. 
In spite of its high base, the country’s largest motorcycle maker Hero MotoCorp Ltd has been steadily clocking strong sales, aiding profit growth in spite of rising costs and competitive pressures.
The December quarter’s 15% revenue growth at Rs7,305 crore compared to the year-ago period matched the Street’s expectation. Driving this was the 16% growth in domestic two-wheeler sales, but without an expansion in realizations, which indicates competitive pressures in the two-wheeler market.
Moreover, the auto industry has been faced with rising raw material costs. Hero’s raw material costs rose in absolute terms steeply when compared to a year back. They rose by 250 basis points as a percentage to sales in spite of higher volumes clocked and the benefits of operating leverage.
This dragged the operating margin down by 100 basis points year-on-year to 15.9%, although it was what the Street had expected. The quarter’s operating profit grew by 7.3% to Rs1,158 crore. Mark-to-market losses on the investment portfolio, however, translated into lower other income, which in turn impacted net profit growth. The Rs805 crore net profit therefore was a tad lower than forecasts and 4.3% higher year-on-year."

Hero MotoSports Team Rally—the rally-racing division of the world’s largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp Ltd—will participate in the Desert Storm with its star India rider and three-time winner C.S. Santosh leading the charge.
This will be Hero MotoSports’ third domestic rally, following the Desert Storm and BAJA India in 2017.
The Desert Storm 2018 will mark the debut of the Hero 450 RR bike on the national racing scene. The bike has already delivered an impressive performance at the Dakar earlier this year. The Hero MotoSports team’s sole rider, C.S. Santosh will start as the favourite and look to add to his tally of victories here.

The Desert Storm 2018 will be conducted from 17-23 March. Following the ceremonial flag-off in Noida, the rally will move to Bikaner for its first stage on 19 March and then travel to Jaisalmer, where it will spend four days before concluding on 23 March.

Santosh made good of the new Hero 450 RR bike to fight off competition from the international and domestic riders.
“Today was the first day of the Desert Storm with two short stages, the second one being a night stage. It was really fast from the word go and I tried to give it my best,"" said the former champion at the rally and the first Indian to participate in the Dakar Rally. “Overall I had a pretty good first day today with everything working well for me. Looking forward to some good racing in the next few days.
The second leg will task the riders with 496km run stage comprising 136km of special stages, all in desert riding conditions, from Bikaner to Jaisalmer. And although the rally is often unpredictable, looking at the performance on Day 1, Santosh seems to be a favourite to win.
In 2015, Santosh became the first Indian to participate in the Dakar Rally, arguably the most dangerous in the world, and even managed to complete it in his first attempt. This year he finished 35th overall."

112,2018-04-09,Hero MotoCorp,"Costlier inputs, scooter price cuts and lower tax sops at its Haridwar factory take toll on  Hero MotoCorp

Mumbai: Hero MotoCorp Ltd is expected to clock 2017-18 Ebitda margin just above its long-term forecast of 14-16%, as costlier inputs, scooter price cuts and lower tax sops at its Haridwar factory take a toll on India’s largest two-wheeler maker. 
Mumbai: Hero MotoCorp Ltd is expected to clock 2017-18 Ebitda margin just above its long-term forecast of 14-16%, as costlier inputs, scooter price cuts and lower tax sops at its Haridwar factory take a toll on India’s largest two-wheeler maker.
During the December quarter, Hero’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin—a measure of operating profitability—stood at 15.9%, down 100 basis points (bps) from a year ago. 
During the quarters ended September and June, the corresponding figures were 17.4% and 16.3% respectively.
For the nine months ended 31 December, Ebitda margin stood at 16.5%, the company said in an email response to Mint queries.
In 2016-17, margins stood at 15.03%. To be sure, the figure would have been higher had it not been for heavy discounting in March 2017 quarter to liquidate inventory compliant with Bharat Stage (BS) III emission norms, as the BS-IV norms kicked in from 1 April 2017. During an analyst call after the December quarter earnings, the company reiterated that it expects to maintain its margin within the 14-16% band over the long term, a good 50 to 250 bps lower than the 16.5% figure for the fiscal so far. Analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd expect Hero’s margin for the 2018 fiscal at 16.5% and narrow to 16.1% in fiscal 2019 as the Haridwar incentives expire. 
The narrowing of margin is estimated to the extent of 100bps but would be offset by incentives at Hero’s Halol plant, wrote Kapil Singh and Siddhartha Bera in a 28 February note. One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. Another factor affecting margins is the rise in raw material costs.
“Aluminum and steel prices have risen this year, reversing a downward trend prevalent in the past three to four years. The complete impact of this rise on margins will be felt even further in the March quarter,"" said Ashutosh Tiwari, head of research at Equirus Securities. The maker of the Pleasure scooter cut prices of its Maestro and Duet scooters in January to expand market share.
 “These price cuts, in addition to discounts given during the festive season (September-December) to regain scooter market share Hero has been losing over the past four to five years, will drag margins as well,"" Tiwari added.
To be sure, even Hero’s strong pricing power in its entry-level motorcycle portfolio, which allowed for price hikes to offset commodity pressures, may not aid the average selling price much.
“We continue to drive savings and take judicious pricing decisions in order to drive both the topline and the bottomline,"" a Hero spokesperson said in an email response to a query. The Delhi-based company is also seeking to sell higher-value models with the launch of a 200cc motorcycle and a 125cc scooter in the near term, according to a 6 February note by Mahesh Bendre, an analyst at Karvy Stock Broking Ltd.
However, improvement of market share in the premium segment is a “distant possibility because Hero is not considered a premium motorcycle maker,"" according to Tiwari of Equirius.
“Margins over 17% are not expected to come back for at least the next two to three years. Earnings growth will not happen despite volume growth, which may drive the stock price down,"" he added.
Losing out on high-growth segments may well be Hero’s Achilles heel.
“We remain concerned about medium-term growth prospects given continued underperformance in scooters, premium motorcycles and exports, the three high growth opportunities for Indian two-wheeler companies,"" Arya Sen and Ranjeet Jaiswal, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd, wrote in a 7 February note."

Mumbai: Automobile companies are set to report strong revenue and operating profit growth in the March quarter because of a revival in rural demand and a low-base effect following the negative impact of demonetisation that lasted well into the fourth quarter of the previous financial year.  
Mumbai: Automobile companies are set to report strong revenue and operating profit growth in the March quarter because of a revival in rural demand and a low-base effect following the negative impact of demonetisation that lasted well into the fourth quarter of the previous financial year. 
Most auto makers are also expected to report expansion in margins from a year earlier as they raised prices, according to estimates of four brokerages—HDFC Securities, Emkay Securities, Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities, IIFL institutional equities.
Sales of two-wheelers have increased 25% in the quarter ended 31 March, driven by higher demand for commuter motorcycles. Sales of commercial vehicles rose 29% because of increased spending on infrastructure development by the government and easier availability of finance options for small and light commercial vehicles. 
Input prices continued to rise during the quarter—prices of steel sheets, used to make vehicles, increased by 12.5%.
Operating margins of vehicle makers, except Tata Motors Ltd, are expected to widen for the third straight quarter, according to analyst estimates. Among two-wheeler makers, Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp may report operating margin expanded in the fourth quarter.
The revival in sales of commercial vehicle, motorcycle and tractor sales during the quarter will boost earnings of companies including Mahindra and Mahindra, Ashok Leyland, Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto. 
With strong volume growth and operating leverage benefits coming in the fourth quarter, companies are expected to report improvement in margins correspondingly, according to Gaurant Dadwal and Vivek Sarin, analysts at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities.
“Ashok Leyland’s topline is expected to increase by 33% driven by 23% jump in volumes and 10% increase in average selling price. Ebitda (operating) margin to expand by 120 bps sequentially led by operating leverage benefit and favourable mix,"" HDFC Securities analysts said in a research note. Most brokerages expect substantial improvement in the standalone earnings of Tata Motors, driven by the recovery in commercial and passenger vehicle sales during the quarter."

New Delhi: Hero MotoCorp Ltd, India’s largest two-wheeler maker, said fiscal-fourth quarter profit rose 34.7%, led by a jump in sales of cheaper motorcycles as rural demand revived after two consecutive years of near-normal monsoon. 
New Delhi: Hero MotoCorp Ltd, India’s largest two-wheeler maker, said fiscal-fourth quarter profit rose 34.7%, led by a jump in sales of cheaper motorcycles as rural demand revived after two consecutive years of near-normal monsoon.
Net profit rose to Rs967.4 crore for the quarter ended 31 March from Rs717.75 crore in the year earlier, the company said on Wednesday. 
A survey of analysts by Bloomberg expected net profit of Rs958.3 crore.
The surge in sales was also because of a low base in the year-earlier quarter because of the lingering effects of the ban on high-value currency. 
At least 50% of Hero MotoCorp’s total motorcycle sales come from the rural and semi urban market. Its total motorcycle sales grew 23.4% to 2 million units in the quarter from 1.62 million units a year earlier. Net sales jumped by 23.7% to Rs8,564.04 crore. 
Operating margin expanded by 321 basis points to 16% during the period though this is not comparable since the company had to give huge discounts to clear its stock of vehicles with BS-III emission engines after the Supreme Court imposed a ban on sales on 28 March 2017, which hurt operating margin.
The Pawan Munjal-led company though saw a significant jump in overall cost due to a substantial increase in raw material cost and other expenses due to new product launches and Auto Expo expenses.
“The fiscal year 2018 proved to be yet another year of record performances and landmark achievements—be it domestic sales, global expansion or in the field of research & development, manufacturing excellence and technological innovations at Hero MotoCorp and its alliances. We are clearly focused on sustaining our leadership in the market and consistently keep increasing wealth for our investors,"" said Pawan Munjal, chairman and managing director, Hero MotoCorp Ltd, in a press statement.
During the fiscal, the company announced its investment in Ather Energy, a start-up which develops electric-two-wheelers. According to Pawan Munjal, the Bengaluru based start-up will soon start selling its electric two wheelers.
For FY18, the Delhi-based company reported a 13.8% increase in total vehicles sold while net sales increased by 13.1% to Rs32,230.49 crore. Net profit of the company during the period increased by 9.48% to Rs3,697.36 crore.
During the financial year the company announced its re-entry into the premium motorcycle segment with the Extreme 200R motorcycle.
“Strong traction in rural areas and low base helped the company to post strong volume growth. Low margin base in Q4FY2017 (due to higher discounting on back of BS-IV emission norm transition and operating leverage due to volume drop) resulted in strong margin improvement,"" said Bharat Gianani, research analyst, Sharekhan."

“With the forecast of a normal monsoon this year and a strong pipeline of new products coming up, the company is confident of sustaining its growth momentum in the coming months,"" Hero MotoCorp said in a statement.
The company on Wednesday reported 34.7% profit rise in fourth quarter led by a jump in sales of cheaper motorcycles as rural demand revived after two consecutive years of near-normal monsoon."
107,2018-05-15,Hero MotoCorp,"Honda led the scooter surge over motorcycles with the Honda Activa, but these gains might be nullified by Hero MotoCorp, which sees 50% of its sales come from rural areas

Mumbai: Motorcycles sales in India have risen at a much faster clip than scooter sales for the third consecutive month, indicating a recovery in the country’s rural markets after the twin disruptions of demonetisation and the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST). 
Mumbai: Motorcycles sales in India have risen at a much faster clip than scooter sales for the third consecutive month, indicating a recovery in the country’s rural markets after the twin disruptions of demonetisation and the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST).
India is the world’s largest two-wheeler market in terms of sales. Among motorcycles, growth was led by the entry-level segment (engine capacity between 75cc and 110cc) and the commuter segment (engine capacity between 110cc and 125cc), the mainstay of the rural markets, where customers prefer no-frills motorcycles to gearless scooters in urban India.
Both segments have either outpaced or levelled with the broader motorcycle segment since November 2017, when motorcycle sales growth came back in the black.
India’s largest motorcycle maker, Hero MotoCorp Ltd, Pune-based Bajaj Auto Ltd and the maker of Activa, Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) Pvt. Ltd, will benefit the most from growth in these two segments.
While motorcycle sales were subdued for the past three years, HMSI was able to post gains in market share in India’s two-wheeler market with its Activa scooter. But these gains might now be nullified by erstwhile partner Hero, which sees 50% of its sales come from rural areas.
This development has snapped the trend of galloping scooter sales since demonetisation in November 2016. Scooter sales grew faster (or contracted less) than motorcycle sales in 13 out of the 16 months till February this year, when motorcycle sales began to pick up pace over scooters.
Purchasing power in the heavily cash-dependent rural markets came under severe pressure when high-value currency notes were scrapped by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 8 November 2016. These markets, apart from the rest of the economy, also saw a major slowdown in adjusting to GST, implemented on 1 July last year.
Increased infrastructure building, in addition to expectations of another good monsoon and higher minimum support prices (MSP), will buttress rural demand in future, say analysts.
“Higher farm incomes, led by higher MSPs announced for the kharif crop, in addition to better road connectivity, loan waivers announced by various state governments and the 7th Pay Commission will support demand for two-wheelers from rural areas,"" said Darshini Kansara, research analyst, Care Ratings Ltd.
Kansara expects rural demand to outpace urban demand for motorcycles over the next three to five years.
However, analysts also expect scooters to grow at a faster pace on the back of rising rural penetration, among other factors.
“We expect scooters to grow by 14-16%, followed by motorcycles and mopeds at 8-10% and 6-8%, respectively,"" said Binaifer Jehani, director, Crisil Research. Scooters are expected to grow at a faster pace on the back of improved affordability, stronger product launches, multiple ownership, and rising rural penetration, he added.
Crisil Research projects the two-wheeler industry to grow by 10-12% in fiscal 2019, supported by a normal monsoon, improved affordability and positive rural sentiment."
106,2018-05-22,Hero MotoCorp,"Ather Energy, backed by India's largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp Ltd and Tiger Global Management, said its charging points will be installed at cafs, malls, gyms and tech parks

Bengaluru:Ather Energy Pvt. Ltd, a start-up electric scooter maker, launched its electric vehicle (EV) charging network called AtherGrid in Bengaluru on Monday. The firm expects to have 60 charging points in the city by year-end, ahead of launching its S340 electric scooter. Roughly $1 million will go into setting up the charging network. 
Bengaluru:Ather Energy Pvt. Ltd, a start-up electric scooter maker, launched its electric vehicle (EV) charging network called AtherGrid in Bengaluru on Monday. The firm expects to have 60 charging points in the city by year-end, ahead of launching its S340 electric scooter. Roughly $1 million will go into setting up the charging network.
Ather Energy, backed by India’s largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp Ltd and Tiger Global Management, said its charging points will be installed at cafés, malls, gyms and tech parks. The first 30 charging points will be set up by the end of this month, the company added. “Infrastructure is where a lot of our time has been going, and the charging network is the biggest piece there. If you want to get your vehicles out, you need the infrastructure, the charging network, to precede it and that’s why the charging infrastructure is going live first, followed by the vehicle,"" the firm’s co-founder and chief executive officer Tarun Mehta said.
Ather Energy’s charging points were designed for two-wheelers but can be used to charge all EVs, including four-wheelers. For non-Ather Energy customers, charging from any of the AtherGrid points will be free for first six months to encourage EV adoption. The firm will double that benefit to 12 months of free charging for its own customers, i.e. those who buy its S340 scooter. Its own customers will get the option of installing an AtherGrid charging point at their homes, too.
Customers can find the nearest charging point and navigate to it using the company’s mobile app. The app will also help users track charging status and payment options will be integrated into it. By the end of the year, the goal is to ensure that an EV customer is not more than 4km away from an AtherGrid charging point in Bengaluru, co-founder and chief technology officer Swapnil Jain said.
Ather Energy had to deal with some regulatory hurdles that prohibit the installing of electric metres and re-sale of electricity, before it could launch its EV charging infrastructure. Last year, Mint reported that the company had raised the issue with the government. About a month ago, the government issued a clarification on this, Mehta said on Monday.
Setting up adequate charging infrastructure is part of the company’s multi-fold strategy for the roll-out of its S340 scooter. Other pieces of the strategy include focusing on a limited number of cities (starting with Bengaluru, followed by Chennai and Pune) and opening experience/testing centres.
It currently has one experience centre—AtherSpace—in Bengaluru and expects it to be enough to cater to demand in the first year of S340 sales. The firm expects to sell about 5,000 units in the first year.
Ather Energy is very close to the launch of its S340 scooter and will announce developments on that front over the next few weeks, Mehta said. The company is well capitalised for the moment and has enough to see through its Bengaluru launch, he added."

New Delhi: Two-wheeler major Hero MotoCorp on Friday reported a 11% increase in sales to 7,06,365 units in May.
The company had sold 6,33,884 units in the corresponding month last year, Hero MotoCorp said in a statement.
“With the forecast of a good monsoon this year, there is expectation of an uptick in market demand in the later part of the year, leading to a sustained momentum across the country,"" the company said.
The company is well placed to leverage that with the upcoming introduction of its new motorcycles and scooters during the year, it added."
104,2018-06-22,Hero MotoCorp,"Hero MotoCorp's market share was at 35.98% in the first two months of FY18, an increase of 40 basis points from the year-ago period, says Siam

Mumbai: India’s largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp Ltd has increased its market share during April and May, according to lobby group Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). 
Mumbai: India’s largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp Ltd has increased its market share during April and May, according to lobby group Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).
Buoyed by a recovery in rural purchasing power and onset of the wedding season, Hero’s market share was at 35.98% in the first two months of the current fiscal year, an increase of 40 basis points from the year-ago period. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The New Delhi-based auto maker had been consistently losing market share since 2011-12 to close at 36.56% in FY18, down 30 basis points from a year ago. 
The recent rise in market share followed aggressive product positioning in terms of pricing and feature upgrades, analysts said.
The maker of the Splendor and Passion motorcycles is the leader in the entry-level and commuter motorcycle segment (with engine capacity under 125cc), selling one of every two models in the category.
Monthly scooter sales, which had been outpaced by motorcycle sales in the first four months of the calendar year, declined in May for the first time since January 2017, according to SIAM. 
Hero’s market share for scooters fell by one percentage point during April and May to 13.15%, compared to the year-ago period. 
The company’s market share is at the lowest levels in over two decades with competitors, including Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India (HMSI) Pvt. Ltd, eating into its share. Its market share stood at 44.69% in 2010-11, the year that saw the Pawan Munjal-led automaker severing ties with the local unit of Japanese automaker Honda, which has more than doubled its market share to 30.33% in FY18 from 13.15%.
Analysts said the automaker will be able to maintain its market share this fiscal year, but the prospects of growing substantially are dim. “Hero has an aggressive strategy for this year, which we expect to continue with the launch of two premium motorcycles (200cc) in July. If motorcycles continue to pick up versus scooters, Hero’s market share will rise or remain at current levels for this fiscal,"" said Richa Bulani, a senior analyst at India Ratings and Research.
Factors such as aggressive pricing from Bajaj may not significantly impact Hero’s market share given an overall growth in motorcycle volumes and new product launches from Hero with a high focus on the domestic market"", Bulani added.
However, the divergence in growth between scooter and motorcycle sales is expected to normalize from the July quarter with scooter sales in urban areas expected to recover during the monsoon, a cyclical trend that is seen every fiscal year, said Ashutosh Tiwari, head of research at Equirus Securities Pvt. Ltd.
“A revival in rural demand this time around has especially boosted motorcycles. If this continues, Hero will maintain its share, but it will be difficult for it to grow on a high base,"" Tiwari added. Analysts expect India’s two-wheeler industry to post low double-digit growth this financial year."

New Delhi: Hero Cycles Ltd, a unit of Hero Motors Co., will develop an entire ecosystem to manufacture bicycles in Punjab with an investment of  ₹  250 crore. 
In an interview, Pankaj M. Munjal, chairman and managing director of Hero Cycles, said the company’s ‘cycle valley’ project will shift focus of the bicycles industry from China to India.
“There will be around 10 joint ventures from Japan, Germany, Taiwan and China. This will help us get into the market, which is valued at  ₹  3 trillion. From our Sri Lankan base we can export to the European Union (EU) nations and, to the rest, we can export from India."" 
The revenue of the cycles business increased by 30% year-on-year in the April-June quarter. The funds required for the development of the manufacturing base in Punjab will be generated internally and the company would not look for any external fund raising. The company will also focus on developing e-bicycles and premium bicycles in India.
“The premium segment is on 25% growth in India though the base is very low, but it has been consistently growing for the last three to four years. We were not present there, so we bought Firefox and, now, we are going to launch our English brands, including InSync. For e-bicycles the market will take some time to develop in India, but we will export to Europe. I think we will do 8,000 units a month from September,"" said Munjal.
In the current fiscal year, parent Hero Motors has an order book of  ₹  2,000 crore for its automotive component manufacturing business, besides recently unveiling a new manufacturing facility in Gujarat. Hero Motors is also looking to sell its stake in some of the joint ventures to gain technological know-how about the new technologies in the automotive space. It is also betting big on its transmission business and are supplying to premium manufacturers, including BMW, Ducati and Harley-Davidson, outside India.
Two of the company’s joint ventures, including Munjal Kiriu Ltd and ZF Hero Chassis Systems Pvt. Ltd, are focused on the India market. 
“For the automotive business, we had a top-line growth of 35% last (fiscal) year. Now, we have the Automotive Manual Transmission (AMT) technology and, I think, that will be the next big leap for the Indian automotive segment,"" Munjal said."
102,2018-07-05,Hero MotoCorp,"One-year forward valuations of market leaders Maruti Suzuki and Hero MotoCorp have come off from the highs scaled a year ago

Auto sales have been booming for three consecutive months ended June in fiscal year 2019. Reports from industry and analysts give a sense of underlying confidence that the year will be one of bumper auto sales across most segments. 
Auto sales have been booming for three consecutive months ended June in fiscal year 2019. Reports from industry and analysts give a sense of underlying confidence that the year will be one of bumper auto sales across most segments.
Yet, barring random spurts, the shares of auto firms have been southbound. Some explain this in the context of an overall weak sentiment on the Street over the last few weeks. In any case, the Nifty Auto index has fallen by 10.3% since January, underperforming the benchmark Nifty 50 that has risen during the period. 
What gives? 
The macroeconomic headwinds in the road ahead pose a risk to earnings growth. Foremost among all is the incessant rise in fuel cost. Both petrol and diesel prices that account for a significant part of vehicle maintenance costs have jumped 7% and 13%, respectively, in the current calendar year.
That’s not all. The interest rate spike after four long years will increase the cost of finance for vehicle owners. Both these factors are unlikely to change course in the near term. These will affect the cost of ownership and may lead to demand moderation after a few quarters. 
The Street is unsure whether higher sales are translating into higher profitability. Commodity prices that ruled high throughout FY17 and FY18 are likely to impact Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margins in the quarters ahead. 
This was partly mirrored even in the quarter ended March 2018. In its report, brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd while analysing the sector’s performance stated, “With commodity prices being around 15% higher year-on-year and 2% higher quarter-on-quarter, operating margins for most companies failed to meet our expectations despite significant operating leverage, given the strong volume growth."" 
A similar situation in the coming quarters may limit earnings expansion. 
Besides, June sales were on a low base of the year-ago period, when the new goods and services tax roll-out led to cutback in despatches.
These imponderables are currently weighing on valuations. Note that one-year forward valuations of passenger vehicles market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and two-wheeler firms Hero MotoCorp Ltd and TVS Motor Co. Ltd have come off from the highs scaled a year ago. 
That said, demand for vehicles remains robust and is likely to continue into the forthcoming festive season. If auto firms have pricing power and can increase vehicle prices to match cost pressures, perhaps valuations will catch up again."

Vinod Nair, head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said, “As expected, Q1 results started positively in line with expectation which helped the market to stay float despite trade tensions, rising bond yields and weak rupee.

He further said, “We will gradually build on our premium portfolio with a range of new products. One such differentiated product will be the Xpulse 200."" 
Commenting on the company performance, Munjal said, “We have had a robust start to the year so far, with our all-time high quarterly sales coming in the first quarter.""

New Delhi: India’s largest two wheeler manufacturer Hero Moto Corp Ltd is expected to witness double-digit increase in its revenue and net profit in the April-June quarter (Q1), riding on surging demand for its entry-level motorcycles on the back of revival in rural demand and the low base in the corresponding period as demand dipped before the implementation of goods and services tax (GST). 
New Delhi: India’s largest two wheeler manufacturer Hero Moto Corp Ltd is expected to witness double-digit increase in its revenue and net profit in the April-June quarter (Q1), riding on surging demand for its entry-level motorcycles on the back of revival in rural demand and the low base in the corresponding period as demand dipped before the implementation of goods and services tax (GST).
According to automobile sector analysts, Hero MotoCorp will be the biggest gainer as the rural market recovers since the company’s reach cannot be matched by any of its rivals. Rural markets contribute almost 50-55% of the total volumes of the company.
Also, this is the first time in five years the volume growth in the motorcycle segment has outpaced that of the scooters which has been growing in double digits.
“The low base and surging rural sales will help the company report strong top line but increasing cost especially raw materials may have an adverse impact on the Ebitda margins. Also, tax exemption in the Haridwar capacity has exhausted which may also impact a bit. Overall it should be a strong quarter for Hero MotoCorp,"" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage firm.
Analysts at brokerage HDFC Securities Ltd expect the company to report revenue growth of 13% year-on-year driven by a sales growth of 13% while operating margins are expected to contract by 52 basis points y-o-y to 15.7% led by input cost pressure.
One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
“Demand outlook for FY19 is positive across segments, driven by healthy rural sales momentum, expectation of normal monsoon for the third year in a row, and a pick-up in economic activities,"" said Abhishek Jain, analyst at HDFC Securities.
Hero Moto Corp sold a record 2,104,949 units in the April-June period, surpassing the earlier record of 2,022,805 units set in the second quarter of FY18.

The net profit in the corresponding period was  ₹ 914 crore.
In volume terms, the Delhi-based company fared well in the first quarter as the sales of products increased by 13.6% to more than 2.1 million units – the highest-ever on the back of increased demand for entry-level motorcycles amid recovery in rural demand.
Net sales grew 11% on-year to  ₹ 8809.8 crore.

Hero will launch its premium motorcycle and two new scooters in the current fiscal year which may help reduce its dependence of entry segment motorcycles. Almost 50-55% of the total sales of the company come from rural markets. 
“EBITDA margin was impacted by commodity costs, although offset to a large extent by pricing and continuing cost management. The impact on the PAT in the Quarter has been on account of the tax benefits coming to an end in Q4 FY’18 at the company’s manufacturing facility at Haridwar,"" the company said in a press release."
97,2018-07-26,Hero MotoCorp,"Analysts reckon Hero MotoCorp may indulge in selective offers as far as pricing is concerned

Hero MotoCorp Ltd’s June quarter (Q1) net profit of  ₹  909 crore is a bit disappointing. Many analysts were expecting the company to report a profit of about  ₹  1,000 crore. Tax benefits at the two-wheeler maker’s manufacturing facility at Haridwar came to an end in the March quarter and that adversely impacted net profit growth last quarter. Also, “other income"" declined.

Tax benefits at the two-wheeler maker’s manufacturing facility at Haridwar came to an end in the March quarter and that adversely impacted net profit growth last quarter. Also, “other income"" declined.
Analysts reckon reported price realizations have declined on a year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter basis. One reason for the decline is that spare part revenues were muted. Revenue growth of 10.5% was driven by volumes.
What offers some comfort is that Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin was at 15.6%, broadly in keeping with Street estimates. This is also commendable in the backdrop of higher commodity costs.
Shares of leading two-wheeler makers declined after Bajaj Auto Ltd’s management said in a call on Monday that it has charted out an aggressive pricing strategy in the entry-level motorcycle segment. The Hero MotoCorp stock was no exception, declining by about 8% so far since Friday. 
Currently, the stock trades at about 16 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year, based on Bloomberg data. Even as valuations don’t appear demanding at these levels, the company’s strategy on pricing will be crucial. Company officials in a conference call with analysts after the Q1 results said that aggressive pricing didn’t work. They added pricing differential has been there for more than a year and despite that, Hero MotoCorp has managed to increase its market share. 
Analysts reckon the company may indulge in selective offers as far as pricing is concerned."

The normal monsoon in most parts of the country, and the consequent agricultural harvest will keep the sentiments buoyant and help maintain the momentum, he added.

New Delhi: Hero MotoCorp Ltd plans to play the pricing strategy for its upcoming 200cc motorcycle, as India’s largest two-wheeler maker seeks to challenge Bajaj Auto Ltd’s dominance in the market for premium bikes in the country. Details of the pricing are not available immediately but the Xtreme 200R, to be introduced nationwide in about two months, is expected to cost slightly more than a 160cc motorcycle. 
New Delhi: Hero MotoCorp Ltd plans to play the pricing strategy for its upcoming 200cc motorcycle, as India’s largest two-wheeler maker seeks to challenge Bajaj Auto Ltd’s dominance in the market for premium bikes in the country. Details of the pricing are not available immediately but the Xtreme 200R, to be introduced nationwide in about two months, is expected to cost slightly more than a 160cc motorcycle.
This may allow Hero—the market leader in entry-level motorcycles —to lure customers from Bajaj Auto, which has been dominating the premium motorcycle market for over two decades. The new product will compete with Bajaj Pulsar NS 200 and TVS Apache RTR 200 models, among others.
Senior executives of Hero said in an analysts’ call on Friday that the Xtreme 200R, which will mark Hero’s re-entry into the premium segment, will be priced competitively.
“The management indicated that it will price the new product in the 200cc segment aggressively, which means that they will adopt the same strategy that Bajaj has adopted in the entry-level motorcycle segment to gain market share,"" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage who didn’t wish to be named. “Also, Hero has nothing to lose in the premium end and they are trying to hit Bajaj where it will hurt the most, that is, the premium segment. So, I think this strategy makes sense, though realizations will be subdued initially.""
A spokesman for Hero didn’t respond to emailed queries until the time of filing this report.
Hero has said that the Xtreme 200R will cost  ₹  88,000 in the North-East and West Bengal, where it has been introduced initially. Hero will also introduce by September two 125cc scooter models to regain market share. The company lost 3 percentage points market share in scooters in the last financial year mostly because it only had 100cc and 110cc scooters.
Hero “aims to position Xtreme 200R by providing customers with higher cc with ABS technology at a slightly premium price to 160cc"", said Jay Kale and Vijay Gyanchandani of Elara Capital in a note."

New Delhi: Vogo, a scooter sharing start-up, has raised $6-7 million in a Series A funding round led by ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd and Hero MotoCorp chairman Pawan Munjal, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
New Delhi: Vogo, a scooter sharing start-up, has raised $6-7 million in a Series A funding round led by ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd and Hero MotoCorp chairman Pawan Munjal, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Matrix Partners India, Stellaris Venture and angel investors also participated in the funding round, Vogo said in a statement, without disclosing the size of the funding.
Founded in 2016, Vogo lets customers rent scooters for short one-way trips at various locations in Bengaluru and Hyderabad. An average trip is about 5km. 
The app enables customers to locate and pick-up their bikes at one point and drop them off at a different point without the need for a docking station.
This year, there has been growing investor interest in the estimated $4.5 billion two-wheeler rental market in India.
Last week, Metro Bikes raised $12.2 million from Sequoia Capital India and Accel Partners, one of the largest Series A funding rounds raised by a local start-up.
“The rise in urban congestion requires a transformation in the way India commutes,"" said Tarun Davda, managing director at Matrix Partners India, in a statement. “Vogo’s localized approach of creating a scooter-sharing network through an automated, convenient and cost effective model represents one such transformation.""
Mint reported on 18 April that Vogo was in advanced talks to raise  ₹ 40-45 crore from Ola, Stellaris and Matrix Partners.
More than 27,000 users have commuted a distance of six million km using the Vogo mobile app, according to a statement released by the firm.
The start-up does not offer long-distance rides and plans to add more than 1,000 pickup points in Bengaluru and Hyderabad.
“Our goal is to make a Vogo scooter available in every nook and corner of the country that’s plagued with issues like traffic congestion, pollution and growing population,"" said Anand Ayyadurai, founder and chief executive officer of Vogo.
Ayyadurai was an associate director at Flipkart and co-founded Vogo with Padmanabhan Balakrishnan and Sanchit Mittal.
Last September, Vogo raised an undisclosed amount in a seed round from AV Thomas Group chairman Ajit Thomas, former Formula One driver Karun Chandhok and other individual investors.
Ola’s investment in Vogo indicates the company’s growing interest in expanding beyond cabs and becoming a one-stop platform for urban transportation. 
Earlier this year, Ola bought transportation information provider Ridlr (Birds Eye Systems Pvt. Ltd) to expand its fledgling public transportation business that has become an important front in its fight against rival Uber. 
In December, Ola started testing a bicycle sharing service in IIT Kanpur campus called Ola Pedal. 
The company then said it was working on expanding the service.
Over the past 12-18 months, Ola has adopted an aggressive investment and acquisition strategy. 
In December, it spent $40-50 million to buy food ordering app Foodpanda from its German parent Delivery Hero AG to re-enter the food delivery business."

Mumbai: Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd (HMSI), the maker of Activa scooters, has been outselling erstwhile joint venture partner Hero MotoCorp Ltd in the popular executive motorcycle segment since FY15, according to data compiled by the automobile industry lobby group. Honda sold more than 980,00 units in the year ended March 2018 in the executive segment (motorcycles with engine capacities between 110cc and 125cc) compared with Hero’s 870,000 units. 
Mumbai: Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd (HMSI), the maker of Activa scooters, has been outselling erstwhile joint venture partner Hero MotoCorp Ltd in the popular executive motorcycle segment since FY15, according to data compiled by the automobile industry lobby group. Honda sold more than 980,00 units in the year ended March 2018 in the executive segment (motorcycles with engine capacities between 110cc and 125cc) compared with Hero’s 870,000 units.
That’s because Honda CB Shine is finding greater traction among buyers than Hero Glamour. For the fiscal to date, Honda sold more than 495,000 units of Shine compared to Hero’s 354,000 units of Glamour. This trend has been continuing since the year ended March 2015, when Honda sold more than 840,000 units compared with Hero’s 580,000 in this segment.
The difference could be explained by the absence of the popular Super Splendor’s sales in the category, which Hero has been reporting under Splendor’s sales in the entry-level segment (75-110cc) since FY16. The most recent sales data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) for the Super Splendor states that 149,060 units were sold in FY15, down by almost half from 298,670 units in FY14.
However, in the largest segment of the market, Hero is still the dominant player. A Hero MotoCorp spokesperson said in an emailed response to Mint’s queries that the firm has a “clear leadership"" in the 110-125cc segment, with 1.59 million units (including Super Splendor) in sales and a 55% share of the segment.
Honda has also been making inroads, with the exception of the fiscal so far, in the entry-level segment, which has traditionally been Hero’s stronghold with its best-selling Splendor and Passion models.
In four of the past six entire fiscal years, Honda has beaten the segment’s growth with its Livo, Dream and CB Twister models to gain share, albeit off a low base. Of course, Hero has also grown faster than the market in three of these years, and that on a very high base of more than 4 million units.
Hero nearly outsells Honda 10 to 1 in the segment, though the gap has narrowed from a factor of 33.8 in FY12 to 9.9 in FY18.
A recovery in rural sentiment and demand over the last one year has benefited Hero to a larger extent, with the maker of the Splendor posting a 16.39% rise in sales to more than 2.7 million units for the fiscal so far, compared to an 8.6% decline to 226,800 units for Honda.
The lack of a model priced under  ₹  40,000 explains the decline, according to Y.S. Guleria, senior vice president of sales and marketing at Honda. A “majority"" of the growth has taken place in this segment on the back of rural recovery and cutting of prices by a competitor (Bajaj Auto Ltd), he said.
While Hero has been able to recoup the drop in sales in FY16 and FY17, Honda has not been able to do so for the same reason, Guleria said. Honda will not develop a model at this price point for the time being, he said.
Guleria admitted that the contribution of the entry-level segment to total volumes has been falling and conceded that the segment is “too large to ignore"". “We will continue to expand our network in rural areas and expect motorcycle volumes to rise in rural areas,"" he said.
India’s rural areas account for nearly 40% of the country’s overall two-wheeler sales, which stood at over 20 million units in FY18.
Honda has been aggressively increasing its rural dealerships in the past two-three years. During this fiscal, it is set to spend more than  ₹  800 crore to increase its dealership count by 300 to about 6,000, Guleria said. About 70-80% of this expansion will be in rural areas, he said.
Since ending their 26-year-old partnership on 22 March 2011, Honda has posed a formidable challenge to Hero in the broader two-wheeler market, with overall market share nearly doubling from 14.9% in FY12 to 28.6% in FY18. Meanwhile, Hero’s overall market share has declined nearly 10 percentage points from 45.1% to 36.6% in the same period.
In terms of the broader motorcycles category, Honda’s market share stood at 15.49% in FY18, a sharp decline from the 7.66% in FY12. In the same period, Hero’s share declined more than four percentage points to 51.5%.
However, analysts are confident Hero will maintain its lead in the segment on the back of a higher resale value and a stronger brand. “We are impressed by Hero’s market share resiliency in the 75-110cc motorcycle segment and are confident that the company will be able to maintain its dominant position in the medium-to-long term, as we have seen that consumers stick to brands with a better resale value in this segment,"" wrote analysts Saksham Kaushal and Poorvi Banka of Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd in a 10 September note.
However, an increasing shift in consumer preference towards scooters and more premium and powerful bikes could be a threat to sales in this segment, according to Ashutosh Tiwari, head of research at Equirus Securities Pvt. Ltd.
“Hero MotoCorp remains the most preferred brand for customers in the 100-125cc motorcycles category. We have had robust growth in the first quarter of this fiscal and are confident of carrying this trajectory forward and expect to grow at double digits in the upcoming festive season, with four new launches,"" the spokesperson said."

Almost 90% of brands have renewed their sponsorship deal with the broadcaster, including title sponsor Hero MotoCorp, and associate sponsors Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and DHL Express India. There are others such as fantasy sports firm Dream 11, homegrown sports equipment manufacturer Nivia and sports footwear and apparel brand Zeven, which have come on board as partners. The broadcaster has sold more than 50% of its ad inventory at the rate of  ₹ 1 -1.5 lakh for a 10 second slot.

I would say while the advertiser response is good for ISL 5 , it’s not great. But most of the brands associations are repeat sponsors which shows that the property has delivered in the past,"" said Jigar Rambhia, national director, sports and entertainment partnerships, Wavemaker India.
Apart from broadcasting ISL matches on its network in six languages, the tournament will also see the debut of Star Sports 3 channel where matches will be broadcast in Hindi. Along with video streaming platform Hotstar, ISL matches will also be available on JioTV under the partnership Star has signed with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. Star has also brought a total of 30 commentators in English, Hindi and regional languages, including FIFA commentators John Helm and Mark Tompkins. Meanwhile, all 10 teams are expected to collectively earn  ₹ 100 crore worth of sponsorship money. Teams from Kerala, Chennai and Mumbai are expected to bring in higher revenue, between  ₹ 10 crore and  ₹ 12 crore each, compared to Delhi, Goa and the North East which will earn  ₹ 4 to  ₹  5 crore due to differences in spectator interest and size of the market, said media buyers.
According to Indranil Das Blah, chief executive of Mumbai City FC, the response has been really good over the last two seasons for ISL. “We are the only football club in Mumbai which helps. Besides, the combination of sports and Bollywood (with actor Ranbir Kapoor as the owner of the team) appeals to a lot of brands,"" he said.

Most of the brands that sponsor ISL teams tend to target a younger group of those between 16 and 30 years of age. However, heritage brands such as Muthoot Group also stay relevant by associating with a team like Kerala. 
The fifth edition of the game is expected to bring an additional  ₹ 30 crore from gate receipts taking the overall value of the tournament to  ₹ 330 crore. Though football offers limited ad inventory compared to cricket matches, media buyers feel that football is yet to hit a significant viewership to demand a premium. 
“Almost 90% of advertising money currently goes into cricket while the rest of the sports collectively make up for 10% of media spends in India.

New Delhi: Hero MotoCorp Ltd, India’s largest two-wheeler maker, has reported a 3.38% year-on-year decline in net profit to  ₹ 976.28 crore during the September quarter (Q2) due to higher raw material costs and other expenses amid subdued demand in key markets of Kerala and West Bengal. 
New Delhi: Hero MotoCorp Ltd, India’s largest two-wheeler maker, has reported a 3.38% year-on-year decline in net profit to  ₹ 976.28 crore during the September quarter (Q2) due to higher raw material costs and other expenses amid subdued demand in key markets of Kerala and West Bengal.
The company, though, beat the Bloomberg analyst estimates of net profit of  ₹  941 crore, thanks to sustained demand for its motorcycles in rural markets. In the corresponding period last fiscal, the company reported a net profit if  ₹  1,010.49 crore.
Hero MotoCorp witnessed 5.4% y-o-y increase in two-wheeler sales to 2,134,051 units during Q2 due to reduced sales in West Bengal after that state’s government made it mandatory to have a driving licence to buy a two-wheeler. Sales in Kerala took a hit due to the floods. Recovery in rural markets in the rest of the country offset the sales slump, thanks to yet another year of normal monsoon.
Revenue, or net sales, during Q2 increased by 8.5% y-o-y to  ₹ 9,090.94 crore.
As a consequence of increasing oil and other commodity prices like steel, Hero MotoCorp’s raw material expenses for the September quarter rose 13.6% to  ₹ 6,403.8 crore. Other expenses went up 18.6% to  ₹ 978.4 crore due to higher advertisement costs. A depreciating rupee that made imports of certain materials expensive did not help either.
Consequently, Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (Ebitda), a measure of operating profit of a company, declined 5.2% y-o-y to  ₹ 1,378.7 crore while operating margins contracted 220 basis points to 15.2%. One hundred basis points make up one percentage point.
“I’m pleased to share that Hero MotoCorp, backed by sustained demand for its popular range of motorcycles and scooters, continued its sales growth in Q2FY19 compared to the corresponding quarter in the previous fiscal. Marking the company’s re-entry into the premium motorcycle segment, we launched the Xtreme 200R in the second quarter. With the upcoming festive season, the new offering will help us consolidate our market leadership,"" said Pawan Munjal, chairman and managing director of Hero MotoCorp, in a statement.

87,2018-10-17,Hero MotoCorp,"For valuations to expand, Hero MotoCorp investors will want to see if demand growth can compensate for cost pressures and lead to healthier profit margins

Mounting cost pressures are showing up in slipping profitability at Hero MotoCorp Ltd, explaining why investors are pessimistic. Shares of the two-wheeler maker have declined by almost 18% in this fiscal year so far, underperforming both the BSE Auto and the BSE 100 indices. 
Mounting cost pressures are showing up in slipping profitability at Hero MotoCorp Ltd, explaining why investors are pessimistic. Shares of the two-wheeler maker have declined by almost 18% in this fiscal year so far, underperforming both the BSE Auto and the BSE 100 indices.
Not without reason.
Cost pressures are building up for the sector. Firstly, higher commodity costs—prices of rubber and metals such as steel, aluminium and copper, made worse by a depreciation rupee. Secondly, the Supreme Court’s mandate to increase third-party insurance cover for new motorcycles and scooters to five years increases the purchase price for a consumer. Further, the mandatory implementation of a combined braking system and anti-locking braking system from April 2019 will also mean incremental costs.
What can still work in favour of Hero MotoCorp is if demand growth sustains or even improves, compensating for the impact of rising costs. Its September quarter (Q2) results are not a disappointment but they are not impressive either. Net profit at  ₹ 976 crore was slightly better than  ₹ 941 crore that a poll of Bloomberg analysts had estimated, and declined by 3.4% from a year ago. But, it’s worth noting that beating estimates was possible chiefly because of a significant increase in other income, which rose by 90% to  ₹ 224 crore. Otherwise, net profit would have fallen by much more.
Sales grew by 5.5% in volume terms. That is good considering that the festival season is later in FY19, compared to last year, and some sales will spill over into the December quarter. Hero MotoCorp’s per unit price realization increased about 3% year-on-year, which analysts reckon is in line with expectations. As a result, revenue rose 8.6% to  ₹ 9,091 crore. However, higher costs meant Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) fell by 5% to  ₹ 1,379 crore. Ebitda margin declined 220 basis points over the same period last year to 15.2%. In the June quarter, Ebitda margin was 15.6%. 
One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The company launched the Xtreme 200R during the September quarter, which is expected to improve Hero MotoCorp’s positioning in the premium motorcycle category. Further, the roll-out of a 125cc scooter in the near term is expected to add to volumes.
Even as the cost environment is challenging, better prospects for demand from rural India, which accounts for a decent share of the company’s volumes, are expected to help. Factors such as a normal monsoon, hike in minimum support prices and farm loan waiver are expected to contribute positively from the demand side.
Nonetheless, the sharp underperformance of the Hero MotoCorp stock means that valuations are baking in a good share of the pessimism. The stock trades at 13.5 times estimated earnings for FY20, based on Bloomberg data. For valuations to expand, investors will want to see if demand growth can compensate for cost pressures and lead to healthier profit margins."

Mumbai: Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India’s (HMSI) flagship Activa brand of automatic scooters has crossed 2 crore-customer-mark, the second largest two-wheeler maker said Wednesday.
Activa, which pushed Hero Motorcop’s flagship Splendor to second position in May 2017, has retained top spot as largest selling two-wheeler brand in the country. It is also the largest selling two-wheeler globally.
“We’ve booked our 20 millionth (2 crore) Activa customer today (Wednesday). While it has taken us 15 years to get the first 10 millionth customer, we have achieved the second 10 millionth customer in just three years,"" the company said in a statement.
HMSI, which runs the world’s largest scooter-only plant at Vithalapur in Gujarat with a 1.2 million annual capacity recently announced an additional 0.6 million capacity expansion there to meet the growing demand for automatic scooters.
Contributing over 33% of global volume for the parent Honda, HMSI is the largest volume contributor for the Japanese company.
Minoru Kato, president and chief executive at HMSI, attributed this to constant value addition over 18 years, and five generations of Activas.
Elaborating on the reason of success of the Activa, Yadvinder Singh Guleria, senior vice-president for sales and marketing said, “since its launch in 2001 as our first two- wheeler here, Activa has successfully re-activated the automatic scooter market."" Offering a perspective of Activa’s historical journey, Guleria said from selling 55,000 units on the debut year in 2001, the volume crossed 5 lakh-mark in 2003 and in the next two years the volume doubled to cross the 1-million mark.
In 2012, the volume had breached the 5 million mark and in 2015 it grew to 10 million, and has doubled this number in 3 years to reach 20 million.

In an interview, Kartik Sharma, chief executive – South Asia, Wavemaker, talks about 2018 being their best year so far, focus on content and the challenges that media agencies face today. Edited excerpts.
How has been the year in terms of client wins and new business?
We have added close to  ₹ 1,000 crore worth of business so far, the largest win being the Mondelez account which we won globally and locally. We also won Eureka Forbes, Bisleri, direct selling firm Amway and Mother Dairy. Apart from this, the agency has also retained couple of big clients such as confectionery conglomerate Perfetti Van Melle, insurance comparison website Policybazaar and direct-to-home (DTH) service provider Tata Sky.
Any new category of brands that you have started working on?
We have started working with Dreams11 which is a fantasy gaming firm. It’s an emerging but a high growth category. Dreams11 was launched during the Indian Premier League (IPL) and they have been doing well. We have recently won another business in the health category which we will announce soon. I believe that these firms are set to become big players probably redefining the category in the future.
What are you doing in content?
I believe everything can be made into content. A good content piece could be a static image on Instagram or five to ten-minute video on Facebook or YouTube. Content can also be a good website created for a brand. In India, the content partnerships have been for relatively smaller period (one year) or are often campaign led. We have signed a four-year long partnership with e-commerce website Myntra and entertainment channel Zoom where viewers will get a chance to buy clothes that celebrities are seen wearing in Zoom’s shows on Myntra. Apart from this we do video led content for clients.
A lot is being said about ad fatigue especially among young consumers, what kind of ad formats they are consuming especially on digital?
Video, as a format, continues to dominate the consumption pattern of millennials. The larger question to ask is why people experience fatigue because the time spent on a digital screen has increased significantly. Therefore, a brand must find interesting ways to narrate a story. Young consumers, especially under 25 years of age, are constantly demanding novelty from brands so any kind of repetition will be ignored by them. Advertising must be informative as well as entertaining to be impactful. Vodafone does powerful storytelling and all its ads brings smile to your face while integrating product. Netflix marketing promotions are also intriguing enough to draw viewers to watch their show.
2019 is the crucial year for media agencies with elections dominating advertising spends. What kind of media platforms will be leveraged by the political parties?
I think political parties might leverage chat platform WhatsApp in the upcoming elections because of its large userbase and penetration across the country. Apart from that, digital platforms such as YouTube and Facebook will also play a crucial role.
I believe in General Elections radio will be an impactful medium as it reaches tier II and III towns as well as media dark rural areas. The use of multimedia will happen including outdoor and cinema, but it is difficult to pin point the proportion of different mediums because it would depend on whether a political party or a state is promoting. A national campaign would see mass media promotion such as television and print while a state level campaign can heavily rely on outdoor and radio.
What are the key challenges that media agencies face?
There has been a squeeze on expected compensation from clients’ side. Rise of self-served platforms such as Facebook and Google has led to this school of thought that media agencies are not required any more. It could be an opportunity for agencies to prove their worth or can also be a threat for those who are not ready to take this challenge. Today our competition is not another media agency alone but other software companies, media platform owners even clients who are investing in these platforms."
82,2018-12-13,Hero MotoCorp,"A boost in rural demandcourtesy Congress's election wins Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarhhelps Hero MotoCorp but also its competition in Honda and Bajaj

On Wednesday, shares of Hero MotoCorp Ltd rallied nearly 7%, much higher than other two-wheeler firms, which rose about 2-3%. Speculation that the new governments in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan will focus on agricultural and rural spends to fulfil electoral promises, was the trigger. Besides, populist measures in the run-up to 2019 Lok Sabha elections may also help, the markets concluded. 
On Wednesday, shares of Hero MotoCorp Ltd rallied nearly 7%, much higher than other two-wheeler firms, which rose about 2-3%. Speculation that the new governments in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan will focus on agricultural and rural spends to fulfil electoral promises, was the trigger. Besides, populist measures in the run-up to 2019 Lok Sabha elections may also help, the markets concluded.
True, Hero MotoCorp’s rural exposure is the highest among two-wheeler firms and the three Hindi heartland states have a high rural and farm population. Yet, it is naive to expect fundamentals to change suddenly, more so, considering other concerns have led to the stock’s underperformance in the last several months.
According to brokerage firms, which cut earnings estimates for the company after its September quarter results, Hero MotoCorp’s growth has been stymied by competition, through aggressive pricing and product launches. This was mirrored in the flat year-on-year sales growth in November, as well as in the September quarter, when sales stagnated from the year-before levels. Rising insurance and fuel costs, and an aggressive pricing strategy by Bajaj Auto Ltd also took a toll on Hero MotoCorp sales.
A report by Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd shows a steady drop in Hero MotoCorp’s market share across two-wheeler categories—from 40% in FY15 to 36% so far this fiscal year. No doubt, the company has been riding in top gear in the entry-level segment in domestic markets, where it gobbles up two-thirds of the market share. But, it is the premium motorcycle and scooter segments that has been a tricky ride. The company has lost ground over the last few years, in spite of new launches.
True, the name of the game for Hero MotoCorp is entry-level motorcycles, and a boost in rural demand can help. However, given the stiff competition and pricing pressures, realizations and profitability may be under pressure in the coming quarters, too. Analysts Arya Sen and Ranjeet Jaiswal of Jefferies India trimmed earnings estimates for FY19/20 on account of near-term cost headwinds and structural growth concerns for the company.
The only silver lining that could give a leg-up to profitability is the softening in commodity and crude oil prices from its highs earlier this year. Even so, Hero MotoCorp’s current share price of  ₹ 3,248 discounts the FY19 estimated earnings by about 16 times. That is a rich valuation considering the near-term challenges to growth."
81,2018-12-27,Hero MotoCorp,"Ather Energy's plan to raise 200-300 crore in fresh funding over the next one year is noteworthy as investor Hero MotoCorp is yet to develop its own electric scooters and motorcycles

New Delhi: Electric scooter startup Ather Energy, which is owned a third by Hero MotoCorp Ltd, is gearing up to raise between  ₹ 200 crore and  ₹ 300 crore over the next 10 months to a year to expand into newer markets such as Chennai and Pune, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The next round of funding would support Ather’s needs for a year, and the Bengaluru-based company would need to do another round in the coming years for its future expansion and product development plans including foraying into Delhi, said the person, requesting anonymity. 
New Delhi: Electric scooter startup Ather Energy, which is owned a third by Hero MotoCorp Ltd, is gearing up to raise between  ₹ 200 crore and  ₹ 300 crore over the next 10 months to a year to expand into newer markets such as Chennai and Pune, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The next round of funding would support Ather’s needs for a year, and the Bengaluru-based company would need to do another round in the coming years for its future expansion and product development plans including foraying into Delhi, said the person, requesting anonymity.
“Ather will need to raise funds within a year since operations will be expanded to Chennai and Pune within the next three months,"" the person said, adding the expansion will include setting up an experience centre each in Chennai and Pune where potential buyers can check the product and also place an order.
The company, which was co-founded in 2013 by IIT graduates Tarun Mehta and Swapnil Jain, has so far received funding of around $66 million from Hero MotoCorp, American hedge fund Tiger Global and Flipkart founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal.
Ather’s plans are noteworthy as Hero MotoCorp, India’s largest two-wheeler maker, has yet to develop its own electric scooters and motorcycles. Hero MotoCorp has instead invested about  ₹ 335 crore—in two tranches—in Ather Energy, to enter the domain of electric two-wheelers.
Micro mobility is extremely important in India and other Asian countries as 70% of the vehicles are two and three-wheelers. Hence, converting them to electric is crucial, said Suvranil Majumder, head, electric mobility project, International Finance Corp. “Two-wheelers play a crucial role in last mile connectivity but also contribute in a big way to air pollution,"" said Majumder.
Ather Energy is developing a new range of electric scooters using a new platform that is scheduled to hit the markets by 2020-2021. It also plans to enter the electric motorcycle segment in the next few years, said the person cited above.
Besides, the startup will also need funds in the next two years to invest in setting up a manufacturing capacity since the existing plant located in the outskirts of Bengaluru can produce only up to 20,000 scooters each year. The new plant is likely to be built in any of the five states in South India.
Currently, none of the leading two-wheeler makers in India have launched any product in the electric two-wheeler space. Ather’s plans will therefore give an advantage to Hero MotoCorp as electric scooters are expected to become popular in the future.
The person said Ather may look to raise the funds from its existing stakeholders before tapping outside resources. The company is also planning a separate revenue stream from setting up charging stations known as Ather Grid. It has already started establishing these stations in Bengaluru, which can also be used by owners of other two-wheeler brands. The startup will invest in creating similar infrastructure in Chennai and Pune, the person said.

“Creating charging infrastructure will help in attracting customers and it also has a psychological impact since range anxiety is always there in a customer’s mind while buying an electric vehicle. In the next few years, charging stations will also generate revenue once EVs become popular. Ather will also launch its operations in Delhi within the next year,"" said the person mentioned above.

Unlike most of its peers like Twenty Two Motors, Ather is not looking to tie up with some of the Chinese or Taiwanese companies for developing the requisite technology for its electric two-wheelers. Instead the startup is looking to hire engineers from some big tech firms to develop the new age electronics for its electric two-wheelers, the person said.

“Ather has developed a couple of products but this won’t suffice since the number of products should be more to attract customers. Also, there will be competition in the electric two-wheeler space so we have to offer more products to the customers and we would need a bigger manufacturing facility as well,"" said the person mentioned above."

 New Delhi: The country’s largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp Wednesday called for reduction in GST rate on bikes and scooters to 18 per cent from the current rate of 28 per cent.
The company, which ended last year with record sales of over eighty (rpt) eighty lakh units, said the reduction in tax would provide much-needed relief to two-wheeler customers across the country.
“Given that two-wheelers provide basic mobility to the masses, there is an urgent need to reduce the GST rate on two-wheelers from the 28 per cent bracket of ‘luxury goods’ to that of 18 per cent for mass usage items,"" Hero MotoCorp Chairman Pawan Munjal said in a statement.
The reduction in tax rate would not only help millions of two-wheeler customers, but also the entire value chain dependent on the sector, he added.
“It is absolutely imperative to ensure growth in the auto sector to create and sustain inclusive economic growth,"" Munjal said.
He added that with transition to BS VI emission norms, cost of two-wheelers will further go up.
“All these will put severe stress on the extremely cost-sensitive commuters, for whom the two-wheeler is a lifeline,"" Munjal said.
Terming 2018 as a challenging year, he added that while the continuing volatility in currency and commodities slowed down the pace of growth, the global geopolitical and trade conflicts also affected sentiments in markets and industries across the world.
Commenting on domestic market, Munjal said the increased cost of two-wheeler insurance ahead of the festive season and the prevailing liquidity crunch in the market impacted the overall of growth in the industry during the entire third quarter.
On sales outlook for the remaining part of the fiscal, he said that with an improved liquidity in the market, and the upcoming festive season in many parts of the country, the industry is expecting a positive turnaround in the fourth quarter. In the calender year 2018, Hero MotoCorp sold 80,39,472 units of bikes and scooters, registering a growth of 11 per cent over 2017.
In the April-December period of the current fiscal, the company has sold a total of 60,37,901 units, the two wheeler major said.
In December 2018, Hero MotoCorp sold 4,53,985 units, as compared with 4,72,731 units in the year ago period.

His comment comes a week after Hero MotoCorp chairman Pawan Munjal batted for a reduction in GST rate for two-wheelers to 18% from 28%.
“Given the importance of the two-wheeler segment as an item for mass mobility, GST rates for two-wheelers undoubtedly needs to be reconsidered,"" Srinivasan said in a statement.
Rising urbanisation, increasing purchasing power and the enhanced need for connectivity—particularly in smaller cities across India—has fuelled the two-wheeler revolution for personal mobility.
“It (two-wheeler) certainly cannot be benchmarked against the prevalent GST rates for luxury goods at 28%, especially given the current state of inconsistencies with the integrated multimodal public transport systems across India,"" he added.
According to Srinivasan, since mandatory implementation of new safety norms and Bharat Stage VI emission norms in the near future will increase two-wheeler prices, “it has become even more imperative to re-look at GST rates for two-wheelers to ensure social inclusion that is sustainable in the longer run"".
Hero’s Munjal had last week said that a GST rate cut on two-wheelers will not only help millions of two-wheeler customers but also the entire value chain dependent on the sector. Such a step was absolutely imperative to ensure growth in the auto sector to create and sustain inclusive economic growth, he had said. 
Bajaj Auto Ltd’s managing director Rajiv Bajaj also reportedly supported the GST rate cut demand, stating that such a step would help mitigate increase in costs that would come with the implementation of new safety and emission norms."

Also, trend in crude oil prices, rupee movement and investment pattern by overseas investors would influence trading sentiment, they added. (PTI)

75,2019-01-31,Hero MotoCorp,"Raw material costs rose by 140 basis points as a percentage of sales. Other expenses were higher too

In challenging times, sales growth alone is inadequate to sustain profits. December quarter (Q3 FY19) results of India’s largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp Ltd reflected the same. In spite of clocking decent sales growth with better volumes and realizations, profits dropped from the year-ago and sequentially preceding quarters.
Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) slipped by 4.6% year-on-year to  ₹1,104.8 crore. This was notwithstanding the 7.5% net sales growth. In case of arch-rival Bajaj Auto Ltd, whose Ebitda too fell in the quarter, it was a steep drop in realizations that dragged profits down. But for Hero, average realizations grew 2.2% even as it sold 5.3% more bikes and scooters during the quarter.
Clearly, costs took a toll on the company’s profits. Foremost was raw material costs that rose by 140 basis points as a percentage of sales when compared to the year-ago period. Other expenses were higher too, while employee costs rose a bit. In its media release, the management said, “There have been temporary setbacks in the third quarter of the current fiscal on account of multiple factors, leading to higher than normal inventory levels at dealerships.""
Normally discounts and marketing costs are mirrored in “other expenses"". Obviously, promotional expenses may have been warranted due to low demand and stiff competition with Bajaj Auto, which has been offering price cuts in some segments. In this context, Hero’s ability to hold out with market share in motorcycles at around 51.5% (December quarter), with only a marginal dip from the FY18 level, is commendable.
Without doubt, higher costs weighed on profit margins. Hero’s Q3 Ebitda margin was 180 basis points lower than a year ago.
The key question for investors is whether rural demand will gain traction in the coming quarters. After all, Hero’s sales are skewed in favour of rural markets. Much depends on the fate of the monsoon and the rural benefits doled out by the government.
Meanwhile, there is good news for Hero and all other auto firms on input costs, since commodity prices have softened in the last few months. Hopefully, this should support Ebitda margins ahead.
This is not to say that investor confidence would return soon. Hero MotoCorp’s stock, although an outperformer in the two-wheeler pack over a longer time frame, has met with the same fate as its peers in the recent past. Weak demand along with stiff competition could entail higher marketing costs to sustain its leadership position in the industry. At  ₹2,612, it trades at 15 times one-year forward earnings, which is reasonable compared to peers. However, whether investors have a cushy ride would hinge on strong Q4 sales accompanied with margin expansion."

NEW DELHI :
Two-wheeler major Hero MotoCorp on Saturday reported a decline of 9.15% in its sales for January 2019.
According to the company, sales during last month declined to 582,756 units from 641,501 units reported for the corresponding month of last year.
""The weak market sentiment from the previous quarter spilled over to January and continued to dampen sales. The industry has been witnessing lower retail off-take in the past few months due to multiple factors, like the credit crunch and higher two-wheeler insurance costs,"" the company said in a statement.
""However, the customer sentiment has begun to improve in the past two weeks, and the company expects sales to pick-up in this quarter, which has traditionally been a phase of positive sales.""
As per the company's statement the Interim Budget— with the direct benefit scheme for the farmers and the income tax exemptions for a portion of the middle class — will drive consumption and help the rural economy, thereby giving a boost to the two-wheeler industry."

New Delhi: Hero Motors Co., the parent of cycle maker Hero Cycles Ltd, is looking for acquisitions in the US and Germany to expand its e-bicycle business across developed economies, said Pankaj Munjal, managing director at Hero Motors Co.
“We are looking for acquisitions in US and Germany and have kept aside  ₹300 crore for the future. The rest of the funding will be down through debt and equity. We will continue to invest in e-bicycles and technology related to the clean energy in the future,"" Munjal said in an interview.
In the auto component sector, the Delhi-based company is looking for an acquisition to secure technology for developing electric powertrains which can be supplied to electric vehicle makers in developed markets like Europe, Munjal said.
As of now, the company is focused on setting up a cycle manufacturing base in Punjab known as the ‘Cycle Valley’ where manufacturing will start from October 2020. Hero Cycles had invested around  ₹250-300 crore in the project.
In order to tap into the growing market for e-bicycles and premium bicycles across the globe, Hero Cycles will also focus on making high-end components for such bicycles through joint ventures with some foreign companies. 
Munjal said the company will try to cater to the global markets from its manufacturing base in Punjab. He said US-China trade war has opened up new opportunities for Indian companies and Hero will try to take advantage of that in the future.
This fiscal year, the company is expected to cross the 5 million sales mark for the second consecutive year despite demand in the domestic markets being weak since September. In the next few years, Hero Motors expects its bicycles and automotive component manufacturing business to generate annual revenues of up to  ₹2,000 crore, each.
“Our bicycles business has grown by almost 20% this fiscal year. In the component manufacturing business, we are looking for an acquisition in the electric technology space since that is the future. We are taking to a company in Europe and if this comes through, then the whole growth trajectory of the company will take a new shape,"" said Munjal. 
Hero Cycles currently exports a significant chunk of its bicycles from its manufacturing base in Sri Lanka. The company exports around 16,000 units to 18,000 units each month from the island nation and is looking to invest in another facility in the near future as the current one is running at optimum capacity utilization rate."
72,2019-02-28,Hero MotoCorp,"For two-wheeler firms, inventory levels continue to remain high at 40-45 days, with no respite seen in the near termDiscounts and incentives are failing to power two-wheeler sales at Hero, Honda, TVS and Bajaj in a seasonally strong quarter

It looks like the pressure on two-wheeler companies is mounting. February data on two-wheeler retail sales paints a weak picture for March quarter sales, analysts at some leading brokerage firms have pointed out.
Even though dispatches from companies to dealers were lowered, inventory continues to pile up. Discounts and incentives are failing to power sales. Inventory levels continue to remain high at 40-45 days, with no respite seen in the near term. Normally, with January and February being the season for weddings, demand for two-wheelers tends to rev up. For instance, sales grew 25-35% year-on-year in these two months.
The slowdown in two-wheeler sales was triggered by a hike in insurance premium about six months ago. The payment schedule for mandatory third-party insurance was changed from an annual fee to a five-year term, payable upfront at the time of purchase of a new bike. This led to a sharp increase in the purchase price of motorcycles.
Meanwhile, Bajaj Auto Ltd’s aggressive pricing strategy to regain lost market share in motorcycles increased competition. According to Bharat Gianani, analyst at Sharekhan Ltd, “Bajaj Auto’s market share in domestic motorcycles inched up sharply by 280 bps (basis points) to 18.4% in the nine months of FY2019 and it is targeting 24% market share. So, the strategy will continue for some time, implying high competitive intensity in two-wheelers.""
Analysts and dealers say even Hero MotoCorp Ltd has enhanced incentives at the retail level, which are about  ₹3,500 per bike. Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd too has been battling in the marketplace, as it had ceded share to some incumbents in the recent past.
To sum up, falling sales and high discounts are the order of the day. This does not augur well for two-wheeler manufacturers. A report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd says, “We expect Bajaj Auto and TVS wholesales to grow 2.4%/15.3% yoy (year-on-year), while Hero MotoCorp dispatches are seen declining 13%"".
Also read: Budget proposals can put two-wheeler segment in the fast lane
That’s not all. Profit margins are bound to be impacted too. “Persistent weakness in retail volumes and higher discounting could trigger further earnings downgrades,"" says Gianani of Sharekhan. Note that brokerage firms had flagged these concerns almost two quarters before, and stock prices have corrected already.
Share prices of Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motor Co. Ltd are down 25% and 32%, respectively, in the past year. Bajaj Auto has been better off, as it gained market share, besides which exports and its three-wheeler segment supported revenue and profit growth."
71,2019-04-03,Hero MotoCorp,"The sharp drop in two-wheeler sales in March signals production and dispatch cuts in order to rationalize inventory levelsA quick rebound in two-wheeler sales is unlikely as well due to ABS and BS-VI emission norms kicking in from 1 April 2020

Hopes of demand recovery in two-wheelers crashed after manufacturers put up a dismal show in March. Worse, this warrants an earnings cut for FY19. It also paints a gloomy sales growth picture for FY20.
Aggregate domestic sales for March of five leading auto manufacturers plunged 19% year-on-year. This was more than three times the drop in the January-February period. It also weighed on the quarter’s performance, with sales retracing by 11%.
Hero MotoCorp. Ltd’s March sales dropped 20%. Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd’s (HMSI) sales halved from the year-ago period. Even TVS Motor Co. Ltd and Royal Enfield saw sales fall 7% and 20%, respectively.
The outlier in the pack, Bajaj Auto Ltd, however, posted 39% year-on-year increase in domestic sales during March, ending the quarter on an optimistic note with 22% growth.
What’s worrying is that the green shoots of recovery are not visible. “Reports suggest that unemployment is at an all-time high, with the services sector severely hit. More than 60% of farm produce has been sold below the minimum support price, reprising rural distress,"" said Yadvinder Singh Guleria, senior vice-president (sales and marketing), HMSI.
As witnessed in the last decade, whenever two-wheeler demand stuttered, it soon gathered pace. This time around, manufacturers say that the first signs of a slowdown came with the Kerala floods. Later, higher insurance costs pushed up two-wheeler prices by 7-10%, hurting demand. Add to this, fuel price increases, lack of liquidity due to the debacle in non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), clipped sales even during peak seasons of Navaratri and Diwali.
These headwinds kept sales at bay in the second half of FY19. Inventory levels by January-February soared to levels of 70-80 days. The sharp drop in March sales, therefore, signals production and dispatch cuts in order to rationalize inventory levels.
Bleak prospects still stare at auto companies. According to an IIFL Holdings Ltd report, “Our checks with dealers and OEMs suggest that industry-level end-demand, which weakened in mid-FY19, persists. Discounts and promotional schemes are not helping improve volumes."" OEM stands for original equipment manufacturer.
Even if demand picks up following positive triggers such as a good monsoon and the festival season, other challenges exist. Mandatory anti-lock braking system (ABS) and a combi-brake system (CBS) will lead to further price increases. Dealers are cautious regarding sales prospects, given customers have already seen price hikes of 10-15% between 2017 and 2018.
The industry also has to face new BS-VI emission norms, effective April 2021. This will again see the need for clearing inventory of BS-IV vehicles.
The consensus on the Street points to an earnings cut of 4-8% for both FY19 and FY20 across listed two-wheeler firms. “High inventory levels will keep discounts and promotional expenses elevated, which, along with negative operating leverage, will weigh on profit margins,"" adds IIFL Holdings.
No wonder shares of Hero MotoCorp., Eicher Motors Ltd, manufacturer of Royal Enfield motorcycles, and TVS Motor are down around 25% from a year ago. Shares of Bajaj Auto, too, were flat over a year, in spite of clocking an impressive sales growth due to its aggressive marketing strategy."

New Delhi: Hero MotoCorp stretched its lead to around 20 lakh units over rival and erstwhile partner Honda in two-wheeler sales in 2018-19 amid a slowdown in the domestic market.
In the fiscal year ended 31 March, the homegrown two-wheeler major sold 78,20,745 units as compared to 59,00,840 units sold by Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI), according to the latest sales figures issued by the companies.
In the fiscal 2017-18, Hero MotoCorp sold 75,87,130 lakh units, while HMSI sold 61,23,877 units. Thus, Hero's lead over HMSI increased by 19,19,905 lakh units in FY19 as compared to 14,63,253 units in FY18.
Hero said it has been able to keep sales higher during FY19 through forays into premium motorcycle segment with the launch of the 'Xtreme 200R' and the fast growing 125cc scooter segment with Destini 125, besides existing models.
On the other hand, HMSI, which had declared its ambition to be the number one two-wheeler maker in India by 2020 overtaking Hero, said challenging and disruptive second half of 2018-19 significantly wiped off the two-wheeler industry growth of first half.
HMSI cited issue such as increased insurance premium in September 2018 dampened festival sentiments, and pre-festival stock buildup was converted into high inventories for the two-wheeler industry.
The company said it had re-aligned supplies with domestic demand to correct inventories and support its dealer partners.
In FY19, Pune-based Bajaj Auto maintained its position as the third biggest two-wheeler maker in India with sales of 42,36,873 units as against 33,69,334 units in the previous fiscal, a growth of 26%.
TVS Motor Co said it sold 37.57 lakh units in 2018-19 as compared to 33.67 lakh units in the previous year, a growth of 12%."
69,2019-04-08,Hero MotoCorp,"Siam is seeking GST rate cut for cars and bikes to ease incoming pricing pressure due to BS VI emission norms and new safety regulationsAutomobiles, cars and two-wheelers alike, are expected to cost 10-15% due to the new regulations expected to kick in from 1 April 2020

New Delhi: Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), on Monday appealed to the government to cut goods and services tax (GST) on cars and scooters and bikes from 28% to 18% to ease the incoming pricing pressure on the automobile industry. 
Automobiles, cars and two-wheelers alike, are expected to cost 10-15% more from 1 April 2020, when Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) emission norms and new safety regulations are expected to kick in. The industry fears that with the increase in prices, the demand for their products would be impacted. 
Cars, bikes and scooters at present attract peak GST rate of 28% with additional cess ranging from 1% to 15%, depending on the length, engine size and type.
""We want the government to be sensitive to the fact that BS-VI emission introduction (from 1 Apri1 2020) and other safety regulations will add to the cost. If it adds to the cost it is likely to lead to slowdown in the demand,"" Siam president Rajan Wadhera said. 
If the demand goes down, government collection of taxes would also go down, he said.
""Therefore, for a win-win situation, we are seeking a 18% GST on automobiles.""
A price hike of even 10% would impact the sales of two-wheeler segment, which currently witnesses offtake of over 22 million units annually, Wadhera said.
""On passenger vehicles also, the prices are going to go up in the range of 10-15% due to technology and safety enhancements. There also we need serious considerations by government so that it is a win-win situation for all,"" Wadhera said.
Earlier this year, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd's managing director and chief executive officer, Kenichi Ayukawa, had sought GST cut on cars in order to create demand and develop the industry.
Major two-wheeler companies like TVS Motor Co., Hero MotoCorp Ltd and Bajaj Auto had also demanded a GST rate cut on two-wheelers."
68,2019-04-09,Hero MotoCorp,"The two-wheeler industry has seen more than a dozen top level changes in the last nine monthsThe churn comes as two-wheeler firms struggle to handle the tight liquidity situation

Mumbai: India’s two-wheeler industry has witnessed more than a dozen top-level and senior management changes in the past nine months, shows data compiled by Mint. The most recent departure is Arun Siddharth, vice president (marketing) - premium vehicles and international business, TVS Motor Company.
Yogesh Phogat, who has served Ducati India for more than five years as director of commercial operations, is also on his way out, two industry executives aware of the development told Mint. Phogat has put down his papers and is currently serving his notice period. Ducati India declined to comment on the matter.
Other recent departures include Ashok Bhasin, who headed the sales and marketing vertical of Hero MotoCorp; Amit Nandi, who headed KTM in India and in other South Asian markets such as Indonesia and Malaysia; Rudratej Singh, former president, Royal Enfield; Vimal Sumbly, ex-managing director, Triumph Motorcycles India; Sajeev Rajasekharan, ex-EVP, Suzuki Motorcycle India; and Roy Kurian, former senior vice president, sales and marketing, Yamaha Motor India Sales.
Bhasin, Hero MotoCorp said, has superannuated at the age of 58.
Industry experts suggest that tough market conditions, including low demand, absence of liquidity, and incoming emission and safety mandates are key contributors to the moves. Data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers earlier on Monday showed domestic dispatches in the two-wheeler industry grew by 4.86% year-on-year in fiscal year 2019.
Speaking to Mint, an industry veteran, who currently occupies a senior leadership position in one of the largest two-wheeler companies in India, requesting anonymity, said: “The two-wheeler market is clearly not doing well, thanks to the tight liquidity. Companies are already having a tough time handling the current headwinds. We have emission and safety norms that are coming up. This shakes up the value chain across R&D and production.""
“We are no leaders in technology. Instead, we lack risk-taking appetite and are driven by paybacks on investments in shorter terms. Indian two-wheeler industry has, for several years, lacked any long-term technology-driven vision, and it has never been at par with the fast changing tech trends globally. Many in their leadership roles don’t know how to handle this transition smoothly and balance out sales at the same time,"" he added.
Siddharth, who has worked with Chennai-based TVS Motor for more than 16 years and was closely involved in building the Apache motorcycle brand, has already served his notice period.
Nandi, on the other hand, has worked with the Pune-based motorcycle manufacturer for more than 12 years across two stints. The primary reasons behind their respective departures are unknown at the moment.
Meanwhile, Sarang Kanade has taken up his new role as head of the motorcycle business unit at Bajaj Auto, the company confirmed.
Last July, Rajiv Bajaj, MD, Bajaj Auto, in a letter to his employees, had announced a major management reshuffle attributing it to “a complex future combining unyielding competitive forces, intensifying regulatory requirements, and escalating disruptive technologies"".
The top boss at Bajaj Auto had, in July 2018, created the position of chief commercial officer (CCO) to bring together all business units in the pursuit of four key issues: Product harmonization, marketing synergies, customer focus and corporate alignment. Rakesh Sharma, who prior to this announcement headed the international business, was promoted to take up the new role. As a result, K.S. Grihapathy was given the role to lead the export business unit.
Explaining her outlook on the prospects of the two-wheeler industry in FY20, Anupama Arora, vice president, sector head – corporate ratings, ICRA, said: “We expect Indian two-wheeler industry to report modest volume growth during FY20 with subdued consumer sentiments continuing to weigh on demand in H1. While easing liquidity issues for NBFC financiers, as well as moderation in commodity inflation, are positives, the tightened safety norms (effective FY20) as well as transition to BS VI norms from April 2020 with significant cost implications, would have significant bearing on vehicle costs, thus dampening demand prospects."""
67,2019-04-10,Hero MotoCorp,"Auto production in FY19 grew by 6.3%, not even half the growth rate clocked in FY18Soft commodity prices will not aid margins due to weak sales and a negative operating leverage

Mumbai: Automobile sales are decelerating, and incentives and discounts are not helping shore up demand. The uncertain outlook and mounting unsold inventory have compelled companies to cut production in the March quarter. The auto sector is thus faced with earnings downgrades for the next two years.
Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, a leading brokerage firm, in its March quarter preview, has cut earnings estimates for FY20 and FY21 for all 8 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that it covers. In contrast to the expectations of a turnaround in fortunes during the March quarter, which typically registers strong numbers for the sector, the net profit of almost all auto companies may witness double-digit declines for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Recent data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) shows that vehicle production in FY19 grew 6.3% year-on-year. This was not even half the growth witnessed in FY18.
The headwinds are strengthening. A truant 2019 monsoon, rampant rural distress led by weak farm income, increasing influence of shared mobility in urban areas, a rise in unemployment and the liquidity crunch are roadblocks to improved consumer sentiment. Pre-election sales of vehicles have also dipped in the past. 
All these point to a weak demand until after the elections.
Therefore, any improvement in sales can be expected only in the second half of FY20, beginning from the festival season, say analysts. There is hope of pre-buying in the March quarter of FY20, just before the BS-VI emission norms kick in. This is likely to substantially increase vehicle costs. Unfortunately, such regulatory changes have coincided with a cyclical downturn that would weigh on demand.
One would have expected some relief in margins on account of softer commodity prices. However, the forthcoming results are not expected to factor much gains. Low sales will translate to low operating leverage, which will weigh on profitability. “Weak demand is bringing in margin pressure from higher customer acquisition costs (marketing), as well as negative operating leverage,"" says IIFL Research.

In the auto sector, two-wheeler makers will feel more pain than commercial and passenger vehicle firms. Also, demand for two-wheelers may take longer to revive because of prolonged weakness in rural demand.
Siam’s outlook for FY20 is not encouraging with single-digit growth estimates in sales across most sub-sectors, except commercial vehicles.
No wonder auto stocks have been hammered on the Street since August, when the first signs of weakening sales were visible.
The Nifty Auto index has shed 33% in a year, widely under-pacing the Nifty 500 index for the first time in a decade. The only silver lining is that the valuations have come off."
66,2019-04-11,Hero MotoCorp,"Two-wheeler inventories have fallen to 45-50 days from 90-100 days in January and FebruaryThe inventory for cars is still in the range of 45-50 days, higher than usual inventory of 30 days

Retail sales of automobiles in India increased 8% sequentially in March to 1.68 million vehicles as companies offered discounts and other incentives to lure buyers and reduce dealer stocks, showed data issued by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) on Wednesday.
Retail sales however fell compared with March last year because of the high base and prevailing weak market sentiments.
Retail sales of two-wheelers rose 10% month-on-month (m-o-m) in March to 1.32 million units, while those for passenger vehicles grew 5% to 242,708 units.
Sales of commercial vehicles grew at a modest 2% m-o-m to 61,896 units amid the prevailing liquidity crunch at non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), which has squeezed financing options for fleet owners.
Retail sales of automobiles started to decline since last September when customer sentiments turned negative as crude oil prices started moving north, and the rupee depreciated against the dollar to an all-time high which impacted returns in the stock markets.
The bankruptcy of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd, meanwhile, led to a liquidity crunch as NBFCs became over cautious in lending. As a result, vehicle sales fell to a six-year low during Diwali and Navratri last year.
With dealer inventories touching record high, companies had to cut production and offer increased benefits or discounts on vehicles to clear stocks.
The average inventory for passenger vehicles is, however, still in the range of 45-50 days, much higher than the inventory of 30 days typically maintained by most manufacturers, according to FADA. Two-wheeler makers managed to halve their inventories to 45-50 days from almost 90-100 days in January and February by enforcing production cuts at factories.
Showroom sales of passenger vehicles dropped 10% from the year-earlier in March, while sales in the two-wheeler segment fell 7%. Retail sales of commercial vehicles fell around 12% from the year earlier in March.
However, FADA, a lobby group for automobile dealers, said it expects customers to resume automobile purchases after the Lok Sabha elections, which conclude on 23 May.
“We at FADA believe that the worst for the automobile industry is now behind us and expect demand to stay at the current level in the months to come. We believe inquiry to conversion ratio to improve with a stable government at the centre and improvement in the liquidity situation,"" said Ashish Harsharaj Kale, president of FADA.
The subdued demand condition prevailing in the market was reflected in the wholesales data issued by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) on Monday.
Factory dispatches of passenger vehicles grew by just 2.7% to 3.37 million units in fiscal year 2019 (FY19)—the slowest since FY14 when sales fell 6%.
Anticipating continued pressure of sales volumes, Siam has projected a growth of around 3-5% in passenger vehicle sales for this fiscal year."
65,2019-04-16,Hero MotoCorp,"Since commuter bikes account for nearly one-fifth of Bajaj Auto’s overall sales, its pricing strategy will result in lower realizationsHowever, performance of exports and commercial vehicles (three-wheelers) may partially alleviate margin pressures for Bajaj Auto

Mumbai: Bajaj Auto Ltd is an outlier among two-wheeler stocks. It has risen 9% in the past year, at a time when shares of peers, such as Hero MotoCorp Ltd and TVS Motor Co. Ltd, have fallen by 27% and 24%, respectively. The benchmark Nifty Auto Index has also corrected 22% in the same period.
Surely, Bajaj Auto’s much-touted aggressive pricing strategy has worked well for it. The company has clawed back market share losses of the previous year. But the million-dollar question is, if this will translate into higher earnings, which is key to sustaining valuations.
The margin forecast for the March quarter is far from optimistic. Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd expects a 340 basis point Ebitda margin contraction year-on-year due to the competitive pricing strategy. On a similar note, Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd has factored in a 320 basis point drop in margins.
Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Hundred basis points equal one percentage point.
Note that the company’s FY19 domestic motorcycle sales surged by 29%. This was primarily due to an increase in commuter bike sales, where the pricing strategy helped increase its market share by nearly 500 basis points. Meanwhile, peers such as Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd and Hero MotoCorp, suffered market share losses.
Since the entry-level motorcycle segment accounts for nearly one-fifth of Bajaj Auto’s overall sales, the pricing strategy will result in lower realizations. Analysts have estimated 6-8% year-on-year fall in average blended realizations for the March quarter. Obviously, this would weigh on revenue and profit growth for Q4 and the full year.
That said, there could be some positives in the March quarter earnings. The performance of exports and commercial vehicles (three-wheelers) may partially alleviate margin pressures. Besides, management commentary on the road ahead for the entry-level and premium two-wheeler market, wherein intense competition is taking a toll on profitability, will be key to the stock’s valuation."

RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM), or the amount a refiner earns by refining one barrel of crude oil, narrowed to a 17-quarter low at $8.2 per barrel. On a sequential basis, GRM declined 7%.
“Management is constructive about refining margins as diesel spreads are likely to get a boost from implementation of IMO 2020, as 3.5mbpd marine fuel Sulphur standards are likely to come down. RIL is well positioned to benefit given their high complexity.

NEW DELHI :
Hero Motocorp Ltd— India’s largest maker of two-wheelers—reported a significant 25.5% fall in net profit to  ₹730 crore for the quarter ending 31 March, indicating tepid rural demand and an overall slowdown in the economy in the run-up to the April-May general elections.
Net profit in the corresponding period a year ago stood at  ₹967 crore.
Retail sales of two wheelers came under severe pressure in the second half of fiscal year 2019 (FY19) due to factors like increase in third party insurance cost, lack of credit finance and falling income in the agriculture sector due to decreasing commodity prices and inadequate rainfall in certain parts of the country.
As a result, most two-wheeler manufacturers had to enforce production cuts.
Total vehicle sales of the company decreased 11% y-o-y to 1,781,160 units as unsold stocks at dealerships soared across the country, prompting the company to offer increased discounts.
In turn, net sales or the revenue during the period decreased by 7.9% to  ₹7,885 crore from  ₹8,564 crore in the year-ago quarter.
The Delhi-based manufacturer could not beat the Bloomberg estimate of its net profit pegged at  ₹746 crore and but managed to beat net sales estimates pegged at  ₹7,764.2 crore.
As the company had offered huge discounts and cut production during the quarter, its operating profit—or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda)—declined by 21.9% to  ₹1,069 crore from  ₹1370.5 crore a year ago.
Operating margins during the quarter contracted by 240 basis points to 13.6% from 16% in the year ago period.
According to Pawan Munjal, chairman, Hero MotoCorp, while the near-term prospect of the domestic two-wheeler market is likely to remain challenging, the festive season however is expected to brighten sentiment and revive growth in the second half of FY20.
“We remain committed to creating sustained value for our stakeholders. It is a testimony to our grit and resilience that we registered record sales of 7.8 million units during the fiscal year, amidst a sluggish market scenario in several geographies and maintained our leadership amid challenging market environments,"" said Munjal. We also gave shape to our vision of creating multiple hubs of research and development excellence by setting-up our first international technology center in Germany,"" he added.
As sales during the quarter continued to decline, stocks at the dealerships stood around 90 days to 100 days. Rural markets have been under pressure in the second half of the FY 19 as result of the distress in the agriculture sector. Sales from the rural market comprise around 55% to 60% of the total sales of the company.
For the fiscal year ending March 31, the net profit of the company decreased by 6.8% to  ₹3,466.35 crore while revenue increased by 2.36% to  ₹33,650.5 crore."
61,2019-04-28,Hero MotoCorp,"Hero’s operating margins in Q4 came as a negative surprise; they were lower even compared to Q3A drop in sales and higher promotional expenses led to the drop in margins

Hero MotoCorp Ltd’s March quarter profit margins hit the skids as the two-wheeler manufacturer pushed sales to correct a high inventory pile. Ebitda margins in the March quarter dropped by 240 basis points to 13.6% from the year-ago period. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
It was lower than the already-low expectations of 14.1% margin on the Street.
Margins were punctured primarily because of weak operating leverage, as two-wheeler sales dropped by 11% year-on-year. While motorcycle sales fell by about 9%, scooter sales plunged 32% during the quarter. Therefore, raw material and inventory costs together, as a percentage of sales, rose by 140 basis points, while employee costs increased by 130 basis points compared to the year-ago period. Besides, the company pushed sales, especially in March, through promotional schemes, which also impacted profit margins. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Note that the margins dipped compared to the December quarter (14.1%) as well. On the whole, Hero MotoCorp’s operating performance was disappointing. The 8% drop in net revenue, along with weak profitability, led to a 22% year-on-year drop in Ebitda to  ₹1,069 crore.
Worse, the management has already voiced concerns on the outlook for the year ahead. In a post-results call with analysts, it forecast a mid-single digit growth in revenue for FY20. Of course, much depends on a pickup in sales during the festive season and the ability of the consumer to adjust to higher product prices. After all, the price hike on account of new insurance regulations has hurt two-wheeler consumer sentiment since August 2018, following which growth has steadily slowed.
Since January, Hero MotoCorp’s shares have lost 16%—double the rate at which the Nifty Auto index has declined. Indeed, valuations have hit new lows. At its current market price, the stock trades at 9.3 times FY20 earnings estimates, about half the five-year average.
Brokerage firms are still cautious about the company’s prospects, although some are beginning to point to the low valuations to buy the company’s shares. “The sequential dip in Hero’s margin is a negative surprise to us, although we remain enthused about the counter on account of it being a superior risk-reward play in the auto original equipment sector,"" said a note by ICICI Securities Ltd.
The management’s indication that Hero MotoCorp had gained market share in some segments during the March quarter, is a positive. It remains to be seen whether this will be sustained, and at what cost. After all, the two-wheeler sector is rife with stiff competition, rising costs and falling demand. This would keep both sales and profit margins under pressure for a few more quarters."

New Delhi: Hero MotoCorp, India’s largest two-wheeler manufacturer, on Wednesday expanded its offering in the premium 200cc segment by launching three new motorcycles — Xtreme 200S, XPulse 200, and Xpulse 200T.
The company last year re-entered the premium segment with the Xtreme 200R.
The new motorcycles will compete with products, including the Pulsar range of motorcycles from Bajaj Auto and the Apache range motorcycles from TVS Motor Company.
According to Malo Le Masson, head, global product planning, Hero MotoCorp, these three new products showcase the company’s focused product portfolio approach for the premium segment. The company has now successfully developed and appointed a horizontal strategy for the premium motorcycles.
The new vehicles will be dispatched to the company’s dealerships by the end of May. The new products have been developed at the company’s new research and development centre in Jaipur.
“These new motorcycles are the outcome of years of concerted and determined product development efforts at the Hero Centre of Innovation and Technology. Now our 200cc line up comprises four powerful and performance-oriented and contemporary motorcycles,"" said Marcus Braunsperger, chief technology officer, Hero MotoCorp.
The Xpluse 200 will be launched at a price of  ₹97,000, while the fuel injection variant will be priced at  ₹1,05,000. The XPulse 200T will be available at a price of  ₹94,000. The Xtreme 200S will be offered at a price of  ₹98,500.
According to the senior management of the company, most premium motorcycles sold in India are under  ₹1 lakh, hence the company has decided to launch all the three products within the price range."

Hero MotoCorp Ltd, the largest two-wheeler maker in India, is betting big on 125cc scooters and premium motorcycles to try and cut its reliance on entry-level motorcycles amid tepid sales in domestic markets.
Sales of two-wheelers especially in urban centres have remained damp as a reflection of overall market sentiments and an absence of jobs, coupled with an increase in vehicle insurance premiums.
On 20 September, the government raised compulsory personal accident cover for two wheelers to  ₹15 lakh from  ₹1 lakh. At the same time, the Supreme Court directed an increase in third-party premium for vehicles to five years, to be collected upfront from buyers. Hero has been trying to get a foothold in the overall scooter market for quite some time now. In FY19, the company also re-entered the premium motorcycle segment.
Though overall scooter sales were flat in FY19, those in the 125cc segment grew by 50%. This segment now makes up 25% of the wider scooter market, which is expected to grow to 50% in the years to come, according to a senior executive at Hero MotoCorp.
“After the launch of our 125cc scooter Destiny, Hero has managed to capture 20% of this segment and the company plans to deepen its focus by launching its second product Maestro Edge in the near future. The 125cc products also attract higher margins compared to the entry-level ones,"" added the executive requesting not to be identified.
In the entry-level segment, typically with a 90-100cc engine size, Hero has only a 10% market share and the company will continue to offer products in this sub-segment since as the volumes are much higher. The 125cc segment, however, is more profitable for manufacturers compared to the entry-level segment.
Apart from 125cc scooters, which is the premium segment in scooters, Hero will also increase its offerings in the premium motorcycle segment and, at some point, will also cater to the middleweight category, which is dominated by Royal Enfield.
The company has hired 800 consultants at its dealerships to promote its premium products and is also revamping its dealerships.
Traditionally, Hero has been a leader by a distance in entry-level motorcycles with a market share of more than 60% with products like Splendor, Passion and HF Deluxe. Almost 50-55% of the total motorcycle sales of the company come from the rural areas. “We are now in the process of building a product portfolio in the premium segment and by launching four products in a span of just six months we have made our intent known. Once we have a range of products in our portfolio, market share will increase as well. We either wanted to be number one or should be in the position to challenge the number one in the long run,"" said the person mentioned above."

India’s auto stocks have lost $42 billion in value in the last 16 months, and some analysts say the rout may not be over.
A gauge of automobile companies has fallen 30 percent since reaching a record in December 2017, and is the worst-performer among 19 sector indexes in the nation’s equity market this year. That’s as the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index rallied to a fresh peak last month.
A slowdown in consumption amid a cash crunch in the banking system has left carmakers with a pile of unsold vehicles in what was one of the world’s fastest-growing auto market until last year. Little surprise then that Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., Hero MotoCorp Ltd. and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. are among the biggest decliners on the Sensex this year, notching losses of up to 20 percent.
“Initial trends are looking weaker than expected,"" Nomura Holdings Inc. analysts Kapil Singh and Siddhartha Bera wrote in a May 2 note. “Most companies in the sector have further earnings risks due to weaker-than-expected demand.""
Passenger vehicle growth in the financial year ended March was the slowest since 2014, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. Maruti Suzuki, the nation’s largest by market share, slid for seven days through Tuesday after saying April revenue declined 17 percent from the year-ago month.
Only two of the 16 companies on the S&P BSE Auto Index have held their heads above water this year: Tata Motors Ltd., the maker of Jaguar Land Rover, rebounded last month after declining to its lowest level since 2011 in February. Bajaj Auto Ltd. is up 11 percent amid an increase in its sales of two-and-three wheelers for the year ended March by a quarter to 5 million units.
Auto companies that have attractive products, are disciplined in managing their inventories and invest in research and development should still outperform during the slowdown, Pramod Kumar and Anubhav Bajpai, analysts from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. wrote in a report.

57,2019-05-03,Hero MotoCorp,"Maruti Suzuki and Hero MotoCorp reported substantial contraction in operating margins in the quarter ended March 31, indicating a tough FY20The increase in commodity costs and discounts also led to reduced profitability 

New Delhi: As a result of significant decline in sales and increase in commodity costs and discounts, the profitability of automobile manufacturers have come under significant pressure in the last quarter of FY19, as most of them are looking to cut costs in several areas of their operations in FY20.
The country’s largest two-wheeler and passenger vehicle manufacturer, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hero MotoCorp, have reported substantial contraction in operating margins in the quarter ended March 31, indicating a tough FY20.
Maruti Suzuki’s net sales or revenues were down 0.7% to  ₹20,737.5 crore in Q4, while net profit was down 4.6% year-on-year to  ₹1,795 crore. The operating or earning before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margins contracted substantially by 350 basis points to 10.5% during the period.
Ajay Seth, executive director, finance, Maruti Suzuki, said the company will try to cut costs in different aspects of its operations such as sourcing of materials or parts from vendors, employee cost and other overheads to improve profitability.
“When it comes to margins, this quarter is not comparable to the corresponding quarter, given the headwinds we have witnessed due to decline in sales and increase in commodity costs,"" according to Seth.
“We believe that Maruti’s cost-control measures and overall inventory reduction at the industry level would result in lower discounts and bring back pricing power for passenger vehicle makers, going forward. This would help MSIL reach closer to its average EBIDTA margins of around 14% going forward,"" analysts of Reliance Securities said in a report dated 2 May.
For the country’s largest two-wheeler manufacturer Hero Moto Corp, the last quarter of FY19 was tough considering that the company had to undergo production cuts to reduce inventory with dealers.
As the revenue during the period decreased 7.9% y-o-y to  ₹7,885 crore and net profit fell 25.5% to  ₹730 crore, operating margins of the company contracted by 240 basis points to 13.6% from 16% in the year-ago period.
“When you sell less vehicles and your costs are fixed, margins will be under pressure. This financial year we are expecting some pre-buying that will help in the second half of the financial year,"" a senior executive of Hero MotoCorp said.
Bangalore-based TVS Motor Company also reported a 19.2% y-o-y decline in net profit to  ₹133.8 crore, while net sales increased 9.2% y-o-y to  ₹4,387.6 crore on account of a meagre 2% increase in total sales.
“We believe that the constant fall in market share and higher inventory would force HMCL to take pricing action. We believe that this situation would encourage the management to take pricing action on select models and also restrict it to pass on full cost escalation of BS-VI in future. Moreover, inventory correction would impact wholesale volumes for FY20. We expect negative impact of competition to continue on HMCL’s margin and profitability,"" the analysts of Reliance Securities said in the report."

""We have earmarked a capex of  ₹1,500 crore this fiscal. It will be utilised for Andhra plant, BS-VI upgradation and usual things like new product development,"" Hero MotoCorp CFO Niranjan Gupta told reporters here.
The country's largest two-wheeler maker had earmarked  ₹700 capex in 2018-19.
The company, which is trying consolidate its position in the premium segment, Monday launched two new scooters to cater to both, domestic as well as international markets.
It introduced Maestro Edge 125 with fuel injection technology priced at  ₹62,700. The company claimed it is India's first scooter with fuel injection technology.
The variants of Maestro Edge 125 with non-fuel injection technology are tagged at  ₹58,500 and  ₹60,000 (ex-showroom Delhi).
Hero MotoCorp also introduced 110 cc Pleasure priced at  ₹47,300.
Gupta said the company's share in the scooter segment remained 'under indexed' and there was enormous opportunity for growth.
""Premium segment (125 cc) in scooters is growing and we are also bringing in new products. It will also have a positive impact on our entry level scooters, which continue to bring in maximum customers,"" Gupta said.
When asked about the outlook in the current fiscal, Gupta said: ""We expect second half of the fiscal to be better with expectations of a good monsoon and easing of liquidity in the market.""
He said the inventory levels at the company's dealerships remained at 45-50 days and it has also eased credit days for dealers depending upon their category.
Commenting on the new launches, Hero MotoCorp Head of Sales, Aftersales, and Parts Sanjay Bhan said that the company has already made a strong and successful foray in the 125 cc scooter segment with the launch of Destini 125 recently.
""Together with Maestro Edge 125 and Pleasure 110, we are confident that our portfolio will appeal to a varied customer set and subsequently, contribute towards growing our presence in the scooter segment,"" he noted.
The launch of new scooters comes closely after the introduction of all-new X range of motorcycles -- XPulse 200, XPulse 200T and Xtreme 200S.

54,2019-05-19,Hero MotoCorp,"India’s second-largest motorcycle maker by sales volume hopes that the new products would help to augment its portfolioThe company says that it sold more than 742,000 units of its 100cc CT model in FY19

MUMBAI :
Bajaj Auto Ltd plans to offer entry-level and mid-segment motorcycles in the next three to four months to intensify its rivalry with Hero MotoCorp Ltd and Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India Pvt. Ltd (HMSI).
India’s second-largest motorcycle maker by sales volume hopes that the new products would help to augment its portfolio and also boost marketshare, said Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto.
“We plan to launch new products based on innovative features. We will target the entry and the middle-level segments with the new launches,"" Sharma said. He, however, declined to elaborate on the products the company plans to launch this fiscal year.
Motorcycles with 100cc-110cc engines comprise the entry-level category, while 125cc models are termed as executive. Hero and Honda commanded market shares of 72% and 51% each in the 75-110cc and 111cc-125cc motorcycle categories, respectively, in FY19, according to Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers data.
Bajaj Auto, which took aggressive pricing and product positioning strategies in the 100cc category with its CT and Platina brands, grew its market share from 12.77% in FY18 to 17.13% in FY19.
“The segment that is driving the growth for us is the entry level. We are represented in this category with brands like CT and Platina. Here, we have increased our market share by about six percentage points,"" said Sharma.
The company says that it sold more than 742,000 units of its 100cc CT model in FY19, posting a 59% rise. Sales of the Platina rose 44% last fiscal to 626,000 units, the company said in it’s official statement.
The entry-level motorcycle category is the most competitive. Smaller players such as Yamaha, Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra have exited the category in the recent past, and it currently has only the four top companies: Hero, Honda, TVS Motor and Bajaj Auto.
Bajaj Auto’s market share more than halved in the 125cc category to 2.71% in FY19 from 5.31% in FY18, which the company aims to address with the new products.
“Due to sensitivity of the matter, I won’t be able to divulge specific details. But I can say that we plan to launch meaningful products with value-for-money features to complete our portfolio,"" Sharma said.
Bajaj Auto recorded a jump of 25% in its total FY19 volumes to about 5.01 million units, its best-ever. It comprised sales of about 4.24 million motorcycles (up 26% YoY) and 782,630 commercial vehicles (up 23% YoY).
“Bajaj Auto is looking to complete its portfolio by filling in the current gaps, which primarily exist in the 100cc-125cc sub-segment. It will do so by launching new bikes this year. The competition in the entry-level bikes will remain heightened between Bajaj Auto and other players. The company is relatively better placed in the two-wheeler market, which is expected to remain subdued this year,"" said Jinesh Gandhi, auto analyst at Motilal Oswal Securities."
53,2019-05-19,Hero MotoCorp,"Bajaj Auto beat competitors hands down in fiscal year 2019 with volume growth of 28.7%Meanwhile, valuations are rich at 19 times trailing earnings, despite dull earnings growth

It’s a well-known fact that Bajaj Auto Ltd has beaten competitors hands down in FY19. While the company reported growth of 28.7% in the domestic two-wheeler market in FY19, all other competitors put together grew volumes by just 2.3%. As this column has pointed out, Bajaj Auto’s aggressive pricing strategy in the entry-level commuter category did the trick for it.
But aggressive pricing also means lower profit margins, and this has been a concern for some investors. So, how has Bajaj Auto done on this front in the March quarter? To cut a long story short, the message on the margins front is not very encouraging. Despite meaningful tailwinds, Ebitda margin widened by only 10 basis points sequentially. What’s more, they are down 370 basis points compared to a year ago. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
The tailwinds were in the form of better-than-expected price realizations in the last quarter. Even though volumes fell 5.3% compared to the seasonally better December quarter, revenues were more or less flat at  ₹7,225 crore. Average price realization rose 5.3% sequentially, thanks to a better product mix.
In addition, the company had the benefit of softer commodity prices. Some analysts were expecting margins to rise 40-50 basis points sequentially with much lower revenue assumptions. The fact that Bajaj Auto reported a mere 10 basis point improvement in margins, despite reporting higher-than-expected revenues, is clearly a negative.
So, for all the excitement about the company’s strong volume growth, the fact remains that Ebitda fell 12.6% year-on-year in the March quarter. For the year as a whole, Ebitda rose just 3%, despite an 18% rise in operating revenue.
Of course, the majority of investors are cheering Bajaj Auto’s strategy of aggressively pursuing market share in the domestic market, even if profit growth is sluggish. Its stock is up about 8% in the past one year, compared to the 27% drop in the stock of Hero MotoCorp Ltd and a 17% fall in TVS Motor Co. Ltd’s stock.
“We expect to continue outpacing industry growth rates; we are driving with our feet hard on the accelerator, and are pursuing growth through new product launches and branding and marketing initiatives,"" the company management said on a call with analysts.
Apart from the pressure on margins, Bajaj Auto has also reported a large rise in receivables. The company said that debtor days have risen by four-five days, which is understandable in the backdrop of an unusually tough year for the automobile sector, where inventories were rising.
In this backdrop, Bajaj Auto’s trailing price-earnings multiple of around 19 times looks rich, especially since earnings are expected to grow only about 10% annually in the next two fiscal years."

Mumbai: Sachin Bansal, co-founder of e-commerce platform Flipkart, Tuesday announced investment of $32 million in electric vehicle manufacturer Ather Energy, which has raised $51 million in its latest round of funding.
Ather Energy was one of the earliest startup investments of Bansal, when he invested $0.5 million in the firm as an angel investor in 2014.
Since 2014, Bansal has made 18 investments in local, early-stage startups where the deal size was $1-2 million. In 2019, Bansal invested $100 million in Ola Cabs.
Bansal also had investments in Grey Orange, SigTuple, Inshorts, Unacademy and TeamIndus.
Hero MotoCorp has converted its convertible debt of $19 million as a part of this round. In addition to this, InnoVen Capital has extended an $8 million venture debt, Ather Energy said in a statement. Hero MotoCorp said its shareholding in Ather increased to 35.1% from 32.31%. 
It is now entering an aggressive expansion phase with the opening of pre-orders in Chennai in the coming weeks and, eventually scaling to 30 cities by 2023.
The company is planning a new manufacturing facility, which will be designed to produce 1 million vehicles per year.
Ather Energy will also set up 6,500 Ather Grid fast charging points across the country over the next five years with a projected investment of  ₹130 crore.
""Post the successful launch in Bengaluru, we are eager to reach out to consumers in other cities and to build more products that will excite consumers to switch to electric vehicles. The changing landscape of personal transport has also offered us more opportunities and you will hear about the new business models that we are investing in very soon,"" Ather Energy Co-founder and CEO Tarun Mehta said.

New Delhi: Ather Energy, an electric scooter manufacturing startup, on Monday raised funds to the tune of $51 million, which would be used for setting up a new manufacturing capacity, research and development for a range of upcoming products and setting up of charging stations. Former Flipkart founder Sachin Bansal made an investment of $32 million in the current round of fundraising while Hero MotoCorp Ltd, country’s largest manufacturer of two-wheelers, has converted its convertible debt of $19 million.
Singapore-based InnoVen Capital – one of Asia’s largest venture debt provider to startups - has extended an $8-million venture debt to the scooter manufacturing startup.
Pawan Munjal-led Hero MotoCorp has already invested more than  ₹330 crore in the Bangalore-based startup in two separate rounds of funds raising. Ather has also previously raised funds from American hedge fund and venture capital investor Tiger global and former Flipkart founders Sachin and Binny Bansal.
Ather is now entering an aggressive expansion phase, with the opening of pre-orders in Chennai in the coming weeks, and eventually scaling to 30 cities by the end of 2023. To meet the projected demand in the coming years, the company is planning a new manufacturing facility that will be designed to produce one million vehicles a year, said the company in a press statement issued.
“Electric vehicles are here to stay and Ather is playing a leading role in driving this change. Sachin has been part of our growth journey and this investment is a strong endorsement of the momentum we’ve built over these years. Post the successful launch in Bengaluru, we are eager to reach out to consumers in other cities and to build more products that will excite consumers to switch to electric vehicles,"" said Tarun Mehta, founder, Ather Energy.
According to Sachin Bansal, the traditional auto industry is up for a redefinition and the ecosystem that Ather is building with their products is the future of urban mobility. Their focus on end-to-end customer experience will open up new revenue opportunities and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles in India, he said.
Ather Energy will also set up 6,500 Ather Grid fast charging points across the country over the next five years with a projected investment of  ₹130 crore."

New Delhi: The country's largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp Sunday reported 13.5 per cent rise in sales to over 6.5 lakh units in May over the previous month.
The company had sold about 5.7 lakh units in April 2019, it said in a BSE filing.
""Hero MotoCorp reported sales of 652,028 units of motorcycles and scooters in the month of May 2019. The company recorded a sequential increase in sales compared to the previous month (April 2019) when it sold 574,366 units of two-wheelers,"" the filing said.
It added that the company had surpassed the six-lakh units mark in monthly sales for the first time since February 2019, when it had sold 617,215 units of motorcycles and scooters.
Last month, Hero MotoCorp launched three new motorcycles — XPulse 200, XPulse 200T and Xtreme 200S. Apart from these, it had also launched two scooters — Maestro Edge 125 and Pleasure 110.
""The bookings for most of these new products have already commenced at Hero MotoCorp dealerships across the country,"" the statement said.

49,2019-06-04,Hero MotoCorp,"TVS Motor Company Ltd registered sales of 3.07 lakh units in May 2019 as against 3.09 lakh units in May 2018Hero Motocorp Ltd reported sales of 6.52 lakh units of motorcycles and scooters in May 2019

Despite decelerating sales volumes reported by most auto companies, their shares have been trading higher. Down more than 23% in the last one year, the Nifty Auto index rose 1.9% on Monday, making it the biggest gainers among NSE’s sectoral indices.
A bulk of the index is being lifted by two-wheeler stocks. Most of these two-wheeler stocks had lost significantly over the latter half of last year. Shares of the three listed two-wheeler companies rose between 3.6% to 5.8% on the NSE.
TVS Motor Company Ltd registered sales of 3.07 lakh units in May 2019 as against 3.09 lakh units in May 2018. Hero Motocorp Ltd reported sales of 6.52 lakh units of motorcycles and scooters in May 2019, down from 7.06 lakh in May 2018. Bajaj Auto seemed to have bucked the trend showing an increase of 3% in sales volumes to 4.19 lakh units in May 2019 over the same period last year. Still, a low single-digit growth is nothing to get excited about.
What then explains the excitement? The reason probably why these shares are once again coming back into focus is because of the improving month-on-month volumes, according to analysts. For instance, Hero MotoCorp saw a sequential increase in sales volumes from April 2019 when it sold 5.74 lakh units. This seems to suggest that the auto sector may be slowly moving on to the higher gears.
Investors are also pinning their hopes on the upcoming monetary policy, and the buzz is that interest rates are expected to be cut by around 25 basis points at least. Analysts see this as spurring further auto sales and boosting sentiments in the credit market. Investors are also expecting sops to revive the auto sector.
“There is a hope that the new government will provide some stimulus either through incentives or a lower Goods and Services Tax,"" said Jigar Shah, managing director, MayBank Kim Eng Securities Private Ltd. “The market is also banking on the cut in interest rates to spur demand.""
Heavily dependent on the finance sector, most passenger vehicles are still showing sluggish growth. For instance, Maruti Suzuki Ltd saw its sales volumes decline nearly 22% in May over the same period last year.
While Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd was not hit too much by the slowdown, its volumes still dipped 3% in May 2019. Ashok Leyland Ltd’s too faced a similar decline of 3.6% in May 2019 over the same period last year.
Analysts also reckon that much of the slowdown is now factored in the stock prices. As the auto sector underperformed the broader market, analysts say that some auto stocks are at low valuations. But still the sector is not out of the woods yet, and investors may well consider how the volume growth sustains over the coming months. And last but not the least, the fact that the liquidity crisis is still taking its toll on the sector cannot be ignored."

Maxxis Rubber India, a wholly owned subsidiary of Taiwan-based Cheng Shin Rubber Industry Company Ltd., announced that it has bagged an order to supply front and rear tyre sets to India’s largest two-wheeler manufacturer Hero MotoCorp for its scooter models.
The company, which claims to be the second largest two-wheeler tyre manufacturer globally, will supply 90/100-10 M6000 53J front and rear tyres, wherein, it says, the M6000 range is specifically designed for the scooters to provide safe grip. The first consignment has already been rolled out of the manufacturing facility in Sanand, Gujarat, the company said in a statement.
The company is already a supplier to the domestic market’s second largest two-wheeler manufacturer, Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India (HMSI). It has been supplying tyres to Honda for its largest selling scooter – Activa since 2016.
Commenting on the new order, Chun-Hsuan Liu, plant head, Maxxis Rubber India, said, “This association will be pivotal to our overall growth and help us achieve our target to triple our production volume in FY19.""
Maxxis has earmarked total investment of  ₹2,640 crore for India operations. Of that, it has already invested close to  ₹1,800 crore in setting up a production plant in Sanand and the remaining amount will be invested in next 3 years. Dedicated to the production of two-wheeler tyres and tubes, the Gujarat plant, which was inaugurated in May last year, has a capacity to produce 20,000 tyres and 40,000 tubes a day.
The company said it has plans to aggressively ramp up its market share to 15% of India’s total two-wheeler tyre market by 2023. It also said that India will play a vital role in powering Maxxis Group’s global plan to become one of the top 5 tyre manufacturers by 2026.
Apart from serving the domestic market, Maxxis’ product portfolio from the Gujarat facility will be exported to South Asia, and will further expand to Africa and Middle East countries in the coming years, the company said in its official statement. It also has plans to set up 5 more production plants in India which will cater to the four-wheeler tyre market. Besides, Hero and Honda, it currently supplies tyre sets to Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), Tata Motors and Jeep India among others."

The automobile slowdown has not dampened hopes at Eicher Motors Ltd. Although the company, too, has been hit by sluggish sales of its flagship brand Royal Enfield (RE), the management has rolled out plans to grow twice as fast as the motorcycle industry over the next decade. But that has hardly stirred up the stock, though after a sharp correction of about 32% in the last one year, its price seems to have stabilized lately.
The management has chalked out a strategy to introduce small-format stores to expand its distributor footprint. The company wants to target under-penetrated states where its brand has lesser market share compared to its national average. The management also indicated that it will open a larger number of small-format stores and raise the store count from about 1,100 to 1,350 by FY20. Besides, it also plans to raise dealer profitability by increasing spare and accessory sales.
While all this sounds good, investors are still reeling from the disappointing news of a 16.5% year-on-year decline in volumes in May 2019. That was the highest among motorcycle manufacturers. Hero MotoCorp Ltd, Bajaj Auto Ltd and TVS Motor Co. Ltd reported growth ranging between -7.99% and +2.99%. Note further that Eicher Motors has taken price hikes in the premium bike segment, which seems to have hampered volume offtake lately.
Analysts though see the management’s strategy to counter the urban slowdown with a deeper rural push as a positive in the long run. But that may not be enough to rev up growth in the short run. “We do believe the 15% increase in the price of RE bikes, coupled with the economic slowdown, has impacted sales. We concur that the RE brand is very strong and going deeper into rural India with smaller store formats could offset the urban slowdown,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities in a note to clients.
That said, transitioning to the new BS-VI norms is not expected to come cheap and will add to the company’s cost structure. Hence, lower sales and rising costs could be a double whammy this year. In fact, analysts expect an earnings downgrades in the near term. “Operating margins are too high, which are likely to come down. We see earnings downgrades from the street due to the decline in EBITDA margin from current levels,"" said Kotak in the same note. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
The earnings downgrade may also lead to further erosion in the stock’s valuations. Already, its one-year forward price-earnings multiple, as per Bloomberg consensus estimates, has crimped lower from about 28 times a year ago to 21.6 times at present. From the looks of it, that valuation may not be comforting just yet, with investors preferring to wait for volumes to rev up."

NEW DELHI :
The country's largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp Monday said it has received BS-VI certification for Splendor iSmart motorcycle from International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT).
The BS-VI emission norms compliant motorcycle has been designed and developed in-house at the company's R&D hub, the Centre of Innovation and Technology, in Jaipur, Rajasthan, Hero MotoCorp said in a statement.
The company claimed it is the first vehicle manufacturer in the country to receive BS-VI certification for a two-wheeler. Having received the certification, it is now eligible to start manufacturing the certified model, it added.
""With this, Hero MotoCorp has reaffirmed its commitment to be ready for the BS-VI transition much ahead of the April 1, 2020 deadline,"" it added.
The two-wheeler major has the technological prowess for meeting BS-VI norms and will now be gearing up to make its large portfolio of motorcycles and scooters BS-VI compliant, it said.

45,2019-06-20,Hero MotoCorp,"Harley-Davidson’s growing focus on India and similar markets comes amid tough conditions in its home marketBoth firms are keen to explore a potential alliance that would make Harley-Davidson bikes cheaper in India

Mumbai: US-based Harley-Davidson Motor Co. is in talks with India’s largest two-wheeler maker, Hero MotoCorp Ltd, to outsource the production of 250-500cc motorcycles that the iconic motorbike maker plans to develop for emerging markets, four people aware of the matter said. The talks are still at a preliminary stage and both sides are keen to explore a potential alliance that would make Harley-Davidson motorbikes more affordable in India, these people said on condition of anonymity. Fully-built imported Harley-Davidson motorbikes attract customs duty of 50%. Building them in India will help bring down the price.
For Hero MotoCorp, which plans to build a full portfolio of premium products over the next three to five years, a potential tie-up will help it enter the premium segment.
“Harley-Davidson had approached Hero MotoCorp and has had preliminary talks with the Indian company for a possible partnership. Hero’s proven capability in sustainable and frugal manufacturing would make them an appropriate partner for Harley, which is looking for developing products in the lower engine capacity segments,"" said the first of the four people cited above.
In July 2018, Harley-Davidson had announced that it plans to develop more affordable, small-displacement motorcycles for emerging markets in Asia, and is scouting for a strategic partner in the region.
The strategy, called “More roads to Harley-Davidson"", is part of its attempt to penetrate high-growth emerging markets.
A Harley-Davidson spokesperson from Milwaukee, replying to a Mint query, said, “When we are ready to announce something, we will certainly do that.""
A Hero MotoCorp spokesperson said: “We do not comment on market speculation.""
In the past year, Harley-Davidson has become a rallying point for the US government to push for reduction of import duty on American motorcycles. US President Donald Trump has on several occasions pointed to what he has described as high import tariff on Harley-Davidson bikes. In July, Trump once again expressed his displeasure on the matter, saying that even after India’s February 2018 tariff cut from 75% to 50% on completely built units (CBUs), the rate was still too high and not acceptable.
Meanwhile, a completely-knocked down (CKD) unit attracts 15% duty. Harley Davidson builds two models in India, imports 11 as CKDs, and four as CBUs.
Harley-Davidson’s growing focus on India and similar markets comes amid tough conditions in its home market where sales dropped from 173,994 units in 2014 to 132,868 units in 2018. Meanwhile, international sales fell from 96,920 units in 2014 to 95,183 units in 2018. Harley’s India sales dropped from 4,708 units in FY 2015-16 to 2,676 units in FY19.
“Harley’s lookout for a partner has led it to Hero MotoCorp, which, besides being the dominant player in India, is also looking at tapping into the growing trend of premium products and aims to build a full portfolio over next three to five years. The Pawan Munjal-led company sits on a well-established production capacity of 10 million units per year across six plants and also brings to the table a wide network of suppliers who are willing to climb up the value chain,"" the second person added.
As part of a heavy operational restructuring process, Harley recently shut one production unit each in the US and Australia, and opened a new assembly unit in Thailand. In India, it has a production facility at Bawal in Haryana, where it builds 750cc bikes and assembles models up to 1750cc engines.
A potential deal will benefit Hero MotoCorp, the first person said. “Having maintained its market leadership after separating from erstwhile partner Honda, and after rapidly expanding its global footprint and R&D capabilities, Hero MotoCorp has emerged as a prized target for global manufacturers to partner with in having a foothold in the highly competitive Indian market. In return, the partnership with the global player gives Hero access to regions where it is looking to expand its presence. This includes mature and evolved markets. It is, therefore, a win-win situation for both the companies. However, the talks are currently at a very preliminary stage."""
44,2019-06-22,Hero MotoCorp,"Niti Aayog officials met with executives from companies including Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp and TVS late on FridayThe think-tank had recommended that only electric models of scooters and motorbikes with engine capacity of more than 150cc must be sold from 2025

India's federal think-tank has asked scooter and motorbike manufacturers to draw up a plan to switch to electric vehicles, days after they publicly opposed the government's proposals saying they would disrupt the sector, two sources told Reuters.
Niti Aayog officials met with executives from companies including Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp and TVS late on Friday, giving them two weeks to come up with the plan, according to one of the executives.
The think-tank, which is chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and plays a key role in policymaking, had recommended that only electric models of scooters and motorbikes with engine capacity of more than 150cc must be sold from 2025, sources have told Reuters.
Automakers opposed the proposal and warned that a sudden transition, at a time when auto sales have slumped to a two-decade low, would cause market disruption and job losses.
India is one of the world’s largest two wheeler markets with sales of more than 20 million scooters and motorbikes last year.
During Friday's meeting government officials argued that switching to EVs is of national importance so India does not miss out on the global drive towards environmentally cleaner vehicles, one of sources said.
But industry executives responded that a premature switch with no established supply chain, charging infrastructure or skilled labour in India, could result in India losing its leadership position in scooters and motorbikes, the second source said.
“There were clearly drawn out positions,"" said the source, adding there were ""strong opinions"" at the meeting.
Bajaj, Hero and Niti Aayog did not respond to a request for comment, while TVS declined to comment.
ELECTRIFICATION
Niti Aayog is working with several other ministries on the recommendations, which are part of an electrification effort to help India reduce its fuel import bill and curb pollution.
The proposal also includes incentives for local production of batteries, an increase ownership cost of gasoline cars and forming a policy to scrap old vehicles, according to records of government meetings seen by Reuters.
The panel has also suggested measures such as directing taxi aggregators like Uber and Ola to convert 40% of their fleets to electric by April 2026, Reuters has reported.
Executives from EV start-up Ather Energy, ride-sharing firm Ola and officials from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), an industry trade body, also attended the meeting, the sources said.
The proposals are India's second attempt for a switch to EVs. In 2017 it proposed an ambitious plan mainly for electric cars but rowed back after facing resistance from car makers.
The current push could disrupt the market order for two-wheelers and open up avenues for local start-ups, analysts say.
Scooter and bike start-ups like Ather, 22Motors and Okinawa are already making in-roads in India.
“It is extremely critical that we make the transition to electric quickly lest we get wiped out by another global wave,"" Tarun Mehta, CEO and co-founder at Ather said.

India has been at the forefront of aligning its policies with its commitment to the Paris accord on climate change, signed in 2016. The accord aims to pursue efforts to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels. Mint looks at the government’s effort towards rapid adoption of electric mobility as a way to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions.
Why is the central government promoting the adoption of electric mobility?
The central government wants to reduce the import of crude oil significantly and thus help curb increasing levels of pollution. India has 22 of the world’s 30 most polluted cities. NITI Aayog, the government think tank tasked with devising a mass electric energy-based transport system in India, has devised a plan to stop the registration of internal combustion engine (ICE)-driven three-wheelers by 2023 and two- wheelers under 150cc by 2025. The central government has approved an outlay of  ₹10,000 crore for three years till 2022 to subsidize electric vehicles and drive the adoption of electric mobility in the country. The central government initially wanted to stop the registration of electric vehicles by 2030, but later decided to put it on the back burner. Similarly, the central government didn’t want to offer subsidies to hybrid vehicles, but then changed its stand following intense lobbying by Japanese vehicle manufacturers.
What happened at the last meeting?
NITI Aayog members invited two- and three-wheeler manufacturers, along with startups that make electric scooters, for a meeting on Friday to understand the apprehensions of the automobile industry. The think tank gave the industry two weeks to draw up a plan on increasing the number of electric two- and three-wheelers and how corporate entities can help the government in this effort. Two-wheeler manufacturers have urged the central government to consider not banning the registration of ICE-based vehicles and find other ways to take off the roads BS-III compliant and other lower-graded vehicles, considered more polluting than BS-IV vehicles. Industry representatives also informed the government about a possible loss of employment if a sudden shift to electric vehicles took place.
What does phase II of FAME 2 envisage?
The centre has announced an outlay of  ₹10,000 crore for phase II of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME 2) scheme to increase the number of electric vehicles in the commercial fleet. The outlay has been made for three years till 2022. The centre has sanctioned  ₹8,596 crore for incentives, of which  ₹1,000 crore has been earmarked for setting up charging stations. The centre may incentivize the purchase of 7,090 electric buses with an outlay of  ₹3,545 crore, 20,000 hybrids with  ₹26 crore, 35,000 four-wheelers with  ₹525 crore and 500,000 three-wheelers with  ₹2,500 crore. Apart from FAME, the government, through its different arms such as the ministry of road transport and highways, power, urban development and science, has been working on different aspects of electric mobility.
Which are the firms in the EV space?
The electric scooter segment is dominated by startups such as Ather Energy, 22 Motors, Okinawa and Torque. Traditional firms such as HeroMoto Corp, TVS Motor, Honda Motorcycles and Scooters, and Bajaj Auto are yet to launch a product in this segment. Over the years, such manufacturers have been focused on upgrading their products to BS-VI norms. The shift to EVs will raise the cost of vehicles by around 10% and may hamper sales. India’s two-wheeler market is the world’s largest and crossed 20 million units in sales in FY18.
What are the main impediments to adopting electric mobility?
A battery, depending on its capacity, will keep a vehicle running at a certain speed for a certain duration. Lack of charging infrastructure around the country is holding back mass EV adoption. High cost difference between ICE-based vehicles and EVs is another reason. None of the vehicle makers or other firms have invested in making lithium-ion cells for batteries—most of the EV makers assemble the battery packs. India also lacks the important minerals, lithium and cobalt, that go into making lithium batteries, which are imported from China."
42,2019-06-25,Hero MotoCorp,"Automakers say concerns of all stakeholders must be taken into consideration instead of imposing adoption of EVsBajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj said the transition is completely uncalled for

NEW DELHI :
India's big three two-wheeler makers - Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Co - Monday hit out at Niti Aayog's plan to push for 100 per cent electric vehicle, saying such a transition is completely uncalled for and could jeopardise the industry.
Arguing that changing from conventional two-wheelers to 100 per cent electric is ""not like Aadhaar, not a software and print cards"", the companies said concerns of all stakeholders must be taken into consideration instead of imposing adoption of EVs.
""This is not like Aadhaar, not a software and print cards. You have to set up a whole supply chain, and migrate from the current supply chain,"" TVS Motor Co Chairman & Managing Director Venu Srinivasan told PTI.
Expressing similar sentiments, Hero MotoCorp said it was ""deeply concerned by the potential repercussions of Niti Aayog's approach of completely banning two-wheelers up to 150cc that are powered by Internal Combustion Engines (ICE)"".
Last week, Niti Aayog had asked auto industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) along with conventional two-and three-wheeler makers to suggest within two weeks, concrete steps towards transition to electric mobility keeping in mind the 2025 deadline.
Hero MotoCorp said the move by Niti Aayog is being at a time ""when two-wheelers manufactured in India will have the world's cleanest emissions, along with the world's highest fuel-efficiencies, effective April 1, 2020"".
""Instead of imposing the adoption of EVs (electric vehicles), it would be ideal to have a healthy mix of policy, market dynamics, and customer acceptability,"" the country's largest two-wheeleler maker said.
Bajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj also said ""we believe 100 per cent transition is completely uncalled for"".
Earlier, he had also asserted that the move was impractical and ill-timed, considering the scale involved when stakeholders do not have ""any meaningful experience with any of the pieces of the EV puzzle"" and that too a date so close to BS VI implementation.
Besides, he had argued that ""to target two and three wheelers but not cars etc makes it an incomplete initiative"".
Asserting that a ""black or white, zero-one change"" is not possible ""with 20 million vehicles, USD 15 billion in sales, one million employees"", Srinivasan added that ""the whole thing is not thought through. I hope saner thoughts will prevail and people will think through the real implications of all this"".
Hero MotoCorp also said mandating a new technology by banning the existing one is likely to jeopardise the industry.
Considering the significance of the automotive industry that provides employment to millions and is a significant contributor to the country's GDP, the proposed ban could also have massive consequences on the economy, the company added.
""An abrupt and sudden changeover will disrupt the entire eco-system of vendors, OEMs, dealers, spare parts manufacturers, and mechanics, as well as other stakeholders, thereby impacting the livelihoods of millions of people dependent on the industry,"" it said.
Appealing to the government and relevant authorities ""to be cautious in their approach and take into consideration the concerns of all the stakeholders"", Hero MotoCorp said. ""A phase-wise introduction will not only allow for a smooth transition but also enable all involved parties to understand, accept and if required, make course-corrections in their approach towards EVs""."
41,2019-06-25,Hero MotoCorp,"Honda joined its Indian counterparts Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Co in opposing the Niti Aayog's proposal to completely ban two-wheelersFrom April 2020, India will implement strict BS-VI emission norms across the country for all categories of new vehicles

NEW DELHI :
Japanese automobile major Honda Tuesday said the two-wheeler industry in India needs more time to stabilise after BS-VI changeover before moving to full electric vehicles (EVs).
Joining its Indian counterparts Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Co in opposing the Niti Aayog's proposal to completely ban two-wheelers that are powered by internal combustion engines (ICEs) of up to 150cc from 2025, the company called for a plan jointly prepared by all concerned stakeholders before taking such a step.
Honda, which is present in the country through a wholly-owned subsidiary Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI), said despite its 25 years of experience of developing and selling electric two-wheeler adoption of such vehicles has remained a challenge due to various factors.
""The industry needs more time to stabilise after BS-VI changeover before we take the next step of moving from IC engine technology, especially considering Indian customer requirement of higher daily commuting distance and price consciousness,"" HMSI said in a statement.
From April 2020, India will implement strict BS-VI emission norms across the country for all categories of new vehicles.
The company further said, ""Honda requests a well-laid-out plan jointly prepared by government, industry and all concerned stakeholders looking at the aspects of air pollution, energy security, cost of technology, availability of raw materials and Infrastructure while addressing employment impact to increase stepwise penetration of EVs (electric vehicles).""
Globally, Honda has an experience of developing and selling electric two-wheelers for over 25 years.
""Due to multiple factors, including vehicle cost, riding performance, range and infrastructure, customers' adoption of EV is still a major challenge,"" it said.
On Monday, India's big three two-wheeler makers -- Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Co -- hit out at the Niti Aayog's plan to push for 100 per cent electric vehicle for up to 150 cc engine capacity, saying such a transition was completely uncalled for and could jeopardise the industry.

40,2019-07-02,Hero MotoCorp,"Automakers make a strong case for phased transition to electric mobility, but will the government take note?

New Delhi/Mumbai: At the sidelines of a recent industry dinner, two doyens of India’s automobile industry were heard making an impassioned counter to the government’s roadmap to develop and manufacture products with electric powertrains. When another industrialist piped in that this resistance would have to factor in a global push by governments to develop electric vehicles (EVs), one of the auto men replied, “We shall see, we shall see.""
Citing its intent to curb rising pollution in cities and over dependence on crude imports, the Narendra Modi government—through NITI Aayog—has set a deadline for two-wheeler manufacturers to shift to electric powertrains. This plan, which seeks a complete ban on internal combustion engines (ICE) for two-wheelers up to 150cc by 2025 and three-wheelers by 2023, has been completely rejected by the key players: Hero MotoCorp Ltd, Bajaj Auto Ltd, TVS Motor Co. and Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India Pvt. Ltd.
In fact, after a heated meeting with NITI Aayog on 21 June, Honda Motor Co. Ltd—parent of Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India—is contemplating getting its president Takahiro Hachigo and other senior executives from Japan to call on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to present its case against what it terms a stiff deadline. In the past, Japanese automakers have managed convince the Indian government to offer incentives for hybrid vehicles. Most Japanese automakers consider hybrid the intermediate level before shifting completely to EVs.
This strong reaction probably draws sustenance from fact that in 2017 NITI Aayog took a step back from its original proposal to ban ICE vehicles by 2030. But now things appear to be different: over the past year, policymakers’ perception of two- and three-wheelers as major pollutants has only strengthened. This has come on the back for four reports—from The World Bank, The Energy and Resources Institute, Indian Institute of Technology (Chennai) and Centre for Science and Environment—which showed two-wheelers are a major source of pollution across the country.
This propelled the secretary, ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) to make a presentation in the third meeting of the inter-ministerial Steering committee of the National Mission for Transformative Mobility and Battery Storage on 15 May, barely a week before the 2019 election results, to set the agenda for the new government in the space of electric mobility. Mint has reviewed the minutes of the meeting.
The officials from eight ministries and Bureau of Indian Standards decided to adopt MoRTH’s proposal, and narrowed down on a timeline for the ban. Though, NITI Aayog has taken the lead when it comes to negotiating with the auto industry, the idea was proposed by MoRTH which is in charge of implementing the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
The industry viewpoint
Amitabh Kant, chief executive officer (CEO) of NITI Aayog, is of the opinion that India should not lose out in the race to develop a manufacturing hub for EVs just like it did for mobile handsets and solar equipment manufacturing. But that is not going down well with the traditional two- and three-wheeler manufacturers, who have recently invested heavily in upgrading their products to Bharat Stage-VI (BS-VI) norms. Of course, given the global shift to electric mobility after the dieselgate, India’s automakers cannot hold the investment made on BS-VI as a pretext for not investing in EVs.
The top executives of a leading two-wheeler maker have been urging the government for a phased transition rather than a blanket ban. According to Vikram S. Kasbekar, executive director operations (plants) of Hero MotoCorp, a phased introduction (of EVs) will not only allow for a smooth transition but also enable all involved parties to understand, accept and if required, make course corrections. “Hero MotoCorp supports the government’s vision of a more sustainable and environment-friendly future. In keeping with this vision, Hero MotoCorp—and indeed the entire two-wheeler industry—is making considerable investments in migrating to the next generation of emission norms and alternative mobility solutions,"" added Kasbekar. Hero MotoCorp has already invested more than  ₹300 crore into Ather Energy Pvt. Ltd—an electric scooter manufacturing startup, while other manufacturers have been relying mostly on in-house technologies.
Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India, TVS Motor did not respond to email queries sent on 26 June and 2 July.
To encourage EV manufacturers, the government sanctioned an outlay of  ₹10,000 crore for the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric (FAME) vehicles scheme for a period of three years. However, the significant costs involved in building the entire ecosystem are not covered under the scheme. Also for setting up charging infrastructure, a meager sum of  ₹1,000 crore has been earmarked. Clearly, incentives will not be able to convince customers to adopt a new and expensive technology, and manufacturers—both original equipment manufacturers and component manufacturers—need to embrace financial viability.
Hence, the traditional automobile industry is demanding that the government finalize a long-term roadmap via a National Automotive Policy.
“Most of these automakers have been pampered for a very long time. They need to invest in electric or other eco-friendly technologies going forward. Some of the startups have already started to invest in manufacturing electric scooters,"" said a senior bureaucrat in one of the ministries associated with formulating policies related to EVs. According to a person who attended the meeting, NITI Aayog officials made it quite clear to the traditional manufacturers that the startups will take their space in EV segment if they didn’t invest.
The electric challenge
There is indeed the risk of a disruption by startups. According to Suvranil Majumdar, project lead, electric mobility, International Finance Corporation, startups will now have an advantage as they have already set up their supply chain for EVs, giving them a two- to three-year advantage over mainstream automakers. Moreover, these firms have a low dependence on retail customers as e-commerce firms and food and other service delivery chains are buying such products in bulk (Flipkart being the latest example).
“The traditional manufacturers though have the huge delivery network across the country and that will be the key to success once they get hold of a good product. It may be difficult for them to disrupt an established supply chain and invest in a completely new technology. Ultimately companies with a good product and economies of scale and delivery networks in non-metro places will emerge successful,"" added Majumdar.
According to Tarun Mehta, co-founder, Ather Energy, electric scooters will get a lot of traction in the near future and the change has to be done quickly, otherwise both Indian companies and startups will stand to lose because companies from other countries will take control of the market. “Startups can change the business model very quickly. So if the transition takes around 10 or 20 years, then it is comfortable for everyone but if the transition is quick then the startups can take the lead,"" says Mehta.
Ather is in the process of raising funds to set up a new manufacturing capacity to spread its operations beyond Bengaluru.
According to the founder of a startup in the electric scooter space, the real gap was in the two-wheeler category where most of the popular products are decades old with incremental improvements in efficiency. Here, there is scope for disruption.
Another EV manufacturer Twenty-Two Motors Pvt. Ltd is also gearing up to launch its electric scooter in India through its own dealerships in the next few months. Taiwanese two-wheeler manufacturer Kwang Yang Motor Co. Ltd (KYMCO) has also invested in the startup and may export some of the products. According to Parveen Kharb, CEO and co-founder, Twenty-Two Motors, the first product of the company can run for 80 kilometre (KM) and the space is available for another battery which essentially means that the product can run for 160km.
“We want to sell a product that can be used for daily need as well as for long distances, should be of good quality and must address the customers’ cost concerns. Before we tied-up with KYMCO, the product was fully ready and we were at the last leg of meeting all the formalities for the regulations. The partnership with KYMCO has helped us getting access to a lot of new technologies,"" added Kharb.
The next steps
The top two-wheeler makers are in a tight spot as the government wants them to move as fast as possible. Significant investments in upgrading the products need to be recovered and at the same time the companies need to maintain a healthy cash flow so that they can invest further in futuristic eco-friendly technologies.
“If we are trying to solve the air pollution problem then there are several sources of it. The government should come with a mandate to take the polluting BS-II and III vehicles off the roads. Also, I agree that we are trying to reduce the dependency on crude oil imports. But should we do this at the cost of creating a new dependency on other raw materials such as lithium and cobalt,"" asked Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto.
Besides raising these questions, Sharma also calls EV charging infrastructure another key concern. “There are execution issues around the charging ecosystem,"" he adds, highlighting the challenges in setting up these charging stations, their utilization, impact of fast charging on lithium-ion batteries, customers’ willingness to stick to charging process, which can last up to a few hours, among other problems.
Prashanth Doreswamy, managing director of Continental India Ltd, one of the biggest manufacturers of powertrains across segments, thinks that such a quick shift will leave the companies in losses, and a healthy balance sheet with good cash flow is needed to invest in research and development of other technologies.
According to an industry veteran, who currently works in a senior capacity at one of the top four two-wheeler makers, if the government passes a mandate of banning the ICE-powered vehicles up to 150cc category, then the manufacturers may work around the specific engine displacements and roll out re-engineered 151cc or 155cc models to breach the ban.
A similar trend was seen in 2016 when Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd had launched 1998cc Scorpio to breach the ban on registration of diesel cars with 2 liter and bigger engines in Delhi. He also pointed out that, of course, such a ban will demand a lot of re-engineering of products that are sold under the well-established commuter brands such as Splendor, Passion and others from Hero’s stable; Activa, Dio, Shine from Honda; and Jupiter from TVS Motor.
In conclusion
The auto industry is not in the pink of health at the moment. Going by the government’s track record, industry is betting that it is unlikely that such a disruptive policy framework will get cabinet approval given the potential of an adverse impact on employment generation. After all, the automobile industry has been the poster boy of the manufacturing sector in India, and the existing players feel government needs to ensure that a shift to electric mobility should not push the companies into red and damage an efficient supply chain.
In all probability, the NITI Aayog’s deadline is the initial gambit in the government’s drive to electrify automobile movement in the country. But given the fact that two- and three-wheelers account for a bulk of pollution, and the disruption that appears to be around the corner, it is high time India’s legacy automakers propel a quick shift towards electric powertrains."

In the previous two sessions, the market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms plummeted  ₹5,61,772.64 crore. The index had dropped 394.67 points on Friday. Monday was Sensex's biggest single-day loss this year so far.
Union budget overhang: In her maiden Budget Speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said it was the right time to consider an increase in minimum public shareholding from 25% to 35%.
According to traders, the Union Budget proposal on higher tax incidence for foreign portfolio investors and high networth individuals also continued to spook domestic investors.
""Today's market fall has been due to a combination of global and domestic factors. Globally, a positive payroll expansion ahead of estimations has led to a fear of anticipated Fed rate cut not coming through. Domestically, proposals in the Budget to increase the minimum public shareholding levels to 35% was a dampener along with a 20% tax on share buybacks,"" Pradeep Kesavan, senior vice-president, equity strategy, institutional equities, Elara Capital told PTI.

35,2019-07-23,Hero MotoCorp,"Moody’s ‘Baa3’ rating to Hero FinCorp suggests that the Pawan Munjal-led NBFC may raise debt funds through bondsThe ratings agency says Hero FinCorp’s profitability, although modest when compared with the other NBFCs, is gradually improving as it grows in scale

Moody’s Investors Service has assigned a ‘Baa3’ local and foreign currency issuer rating to Hero FinCorp Limited with a stable outlook suggesting that the Pawan Munjal-led non-banking financial company may raise debt funds through bonds.
Moody’s ‘Baa3’ rating rationale for Hero FinCorp, which has a standalone assessment of ‘Ba3’, a speculative grade, assumes a high likelihood of support from Hero MotoCorp, India’s largest two-wheeler company, which also has a direct stake of 41% in the NBFC.
The ratings agency, in an official release, said that Hero FinCorp’s profitability, although modest when compared with the other Indian NBFCs, is gradually improving as it grows in scale. “Return on average managed assets reached 1.6% in the fiscal year ending March 2019 (fiscal 2019), up from 1.2% in fiscal 2018,"" the Moody’s report pointed out.
It said that while Hero FinCorp has made significant investments in building its pan-India footprint, its capitalization remains strong. “Tangible common equity to total managed assets stood at 17.7% at the end of March 2019, and was supported by frequent capital infusions from key shareholders,"" the report quoted underlining Hero FinCorp’s plan to raise Rs21 billion in new capital this fiscal from new and existing shareholders.
Hero FinCorp’s promoter group, which includes Hero MotoCorp, other Hero Group entities and individuals linked to the Munjal family, owned 79.9% stake at the end of March 2019. The promoter group, Moody’s report stressed, has consistently infused equity capital in Hero FinCorp along with purchasing shares from the non-promoter shareholders. Notably, Otter Limited and Credit Suisse own a 13% stake in the company.
The NBFC, however, continues to operate with a modest scale and has a limited track record in lending to retail and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in India. Moody’s reports points out that lending to Hero FinCorp’s target customer segment, which is retail and SMEs in rural India, is fundamentally risky and cyclical and ‘asset performance will reflect this.’
As a result, it says, the company’s asset quality has weakened since it started expanding its business in 2013, with its gross non-performing loans (NPL) ratio rising to 4.5% in end FY19 from 1.6% in end FY16. Moody's estimates that Hero FinCorp’s entry into a number of new lending segments could be one of the several factors behind the weakening of asset quality.
Meanwhile, its ba3 standalone credit profile is built on its stable funding and liquidity duly supported by its strong parent and stable solvency metrics, including profitability and capitalization.
Hero FinCorp has presence across retail segments including financing of two-wheelers, personal loans, loans against property to SME operators, and loans to mid-sized Indian corporates. Within the two-wheeler segment, it only finances vehicles manufactured by Hero MotoCorp."
34,2019-07-26,Hero MotoCorp,"Naveen Munjal, MD of Hero Electric Vehicles, has the rights to sell EVs under the Hero brand, as per family pactAnalysts say the family pact offers Hero MotoCorp a chance to create a new range and grow its customer base

New Delhi: A family pact may force Hero MotoCorp Ltd to drop the Hero brand name and coin a new tag if it chooses to introduce electric two-wheelers and exploit a government push towards eco-friendly vehicles.
Pawan Munjal, promoter and chairman of India’s largest two-wheeler company, is currently prohibited from using the Hero brand to sell any electric scooter or motorcycle under a Family Settlement Agreement of the New Delhi-based Munjal family finalized in 2010, said three people aware of the development. The agreement was to split the multibillion-dollar Hero empire comprising business verticals including automotive among various family members.
As per the agreement, Naveen Munjal, a cousin of Pawan Munjal and promoter and managing director of Hero Electric Vehicles Pvt. Ltd, was vested with the rights to use the Hero brand for selling electric vehicles in the domestic market.
The agreement also states that any other member of the Munjal family cannot use the Hero brand for any new venture that might compete with the existing businesses of the other family members, said the people cited earlier, who declined to be named as the matter is sensitive.
Hero MotoCorp, the flagship business of the Munjal family, has been developing two electric scooters, but the company is yet to announce plans for their commercial launch.
A spokesperson for Hero MotoCorp said it has a range of popular two-wheeler brands such as Splendor and Passion and also showcased an electric scooter, the Hero Duet E, at the Delhi Auto Expo in 2016.
“Similarly, going forward, we will continue to bring new products—also on new technology platforms—which we may choose to give different names—but all under the umbrella Hero brand. Accordingly, we will continue to sell our products—irrespective of their respective brand names—from our own dealerships,"" the spokesperson said in response to emailed queries. The spokesperson did not comment on the 2010 pact and whether the company can sell electric two-wheelers under the Hero brand.
A spokesperson for Hero Electric did not respond to emailed queries.
Hero Electric has been facing tough times in recent months as sales nosedived since the implementation of strict localization norms by the Union government for producers of eco-friendly vehicles to avail subsidies under the second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme.
The first person cited earlier said that as per the 2010 agreement, “members can use the Hero brand only for existing businesses, which means Hero MotoCorp doesn’t have the right to the Hero brand when it comes to electric vehicles"".
The person said, however, the family pact is unlikely to dampen the prospects of Hero MotoCorp as it might create a new brand for its electric two-wheelers or the issues might be resolved “within the family"". Also “some of the auto companies have already stopped using the mother brand on their products. So, there will be some way out of this"", the person added.
The second person cited earlier said Hero Electric may not have come out with convincing products in the electric vehicle space and has already struggled to comply with the localization norms under the FAME scheme but has the right to use the Hero brand for eco-friendly ventures, which includes electric vehicles.
“Both the companies will either find a solution to coexist or Hero MotoCorp might have to remove the brand from its products. It remains to be seen if they can sell those electric two-wheelers from their existing outlets, which are branded as Hero,"" the person said. “Also, Hero MotoCorp has been working on a couple of projects in the electric space but they have never made any announcements regarding them. This may be one of the reasons why they don’t want to rush into electric.""
The development assumes significance as policy think tank NITI Aayog is considering a proposal to ban all internal combustion engine-driven two-wheelers under 150cc by 2025 and three-wheelers by 2023. Hero MotoCorp, the biggest maker of two-wheelers below 150cc, along with Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd, will be hit the most, if such a blanket ban or a partial shift to electric wheelers comes into effect.
Analysts said the family agreement offers Hero MotoCorp a chance to create a new range of products and grow its customer base.
“It is a terrific opportunity for Hero MotoCorp to create a fresh new brand, with the core idea, promise and values very different from Hero. That will help them reach out to an individual who does not appreciate or aspire for what Hero stands for,"" said Avik Chattopadhyay, founder of Expereal. “It is not a roadblock or a problem at all. And this new brand need not be sold from a traditional showroom at all. It will belong to the Hero group, but will not have anything to do with the Hero brand.""
According to a 2017 study by the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India and German consulting firm Roland Berger, almost 34.5% of total two-wheeler sales volume in India has the potential to be converted into electric."

Mumbai: Indian stock markets may be sluggish on Tuesday weighed down by widespread weak sentiment.
Meanwhile, Asian stocks edged higher in early deals on Tuesday as investors prepared for an expected US interest rate cut this week, while heightened concern in currency markets about a no-deal Brexit sent the pound to a 28-month low.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.15%. South Korea's KOSPI advanced 0.2% and Japan's Nikkei added 0.7%. Australian stocks climbed as much as 0.7% to touch a record high, supported by buoyant mining shares and adding to previous day's tech-driven gains.
The US Federal Reserve begins its two-day policy review meeting later on Tuesday, at which it is widely expected to lower interest rates by 25 basis points. If implemented, it would be the central bank’s first rate cut in a decade.
Prospective monetary easing by the Fed has been a key factor behind the recent bull run in global equities, particularly US stocks, which have notched up record highs over the past month.
Back home, Axis Bank, Hero MotoCorp, Tech Mahindra, Bank of India, PNB Housing Finance, Piramal Enterprises and Dish TV will announce thier June quarter earnings on Tuesday.
In related developments, the Rajya Sabha on Monday approved amendments to India’s bankruptcy law, restoring secured creditors’ priority claims on payouts from the sale or liquidation of insolvent companies.
In the currency market, the pound sterling extended an overnight slump and fell to $1.2210 - its lowest level since March 2017. Sterling has suffered as investors scrambled to price in the possibility that a last-minute agreement to avert a no-deal Brexit may not be realised under British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has said the Brexit divorce was dead.
The British government said on Monday it assumed there will be a no-deal Brexit because a “stubborn"" European Union has refused to renegotiate their departure.
The dollar index against at basket of six major currencies was a shade higher at 98.084 and not too far from 98.165, a two-month top scaled on Monday on the back of better-than-expected US GDP data. The greenback was 0.1% higher at 108.900 yen after brushing a three-week high of 108.950.
Immediate focus for the yen was on the Bank of Japan’s two-day policy meeting due to end later on Tuesday. The BOJ is widely expected to stand pat on policy, although some expect it to tweak its forward guidance -a pledge central banks make on future monetary policy moves- with the central bank under increasing pressure to keep up with its dovish peers.
The euro was unchanged at $1.1142 after edging up 0.15% the previous day.
Crude oil prices added to previous gains, when the stronger-than-expected US GDP strengthened the outlook for oil consumption by the world’s largest economy. US crude futures were up 0.6% at $57.22 per barrel and Brent crude added 0.5% to $64.03.

32,2019-07-30,Hero MotoCorp,"The company had reported a net profit of  ₹924.74 crore during the same period of previous fiscalA reduction in GST will lower the cost of two-wheelers and spur demand, with the consequent growth in volumes

NEW DELHI :
The country's largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp on Tuesday posted a 35.89 per cent increase in consolidated net profit at  ₹1,256.69 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, 2019 on the back of a one-off exceptional gain of  ₹737.48 crore.
The company had reported a net profit of  ₹924.74 crore during the same period of previous fiscal.
Revenue from operations, however, declined to  ₹8,185.97 crore for April-June period as compared with  ₹8,913.27 crore in the same period of 2018-19, Hero Moto Corp said in a regulatory filing.
The company had deposited and created provision for ""National Calamity Contingent Duty"" (NCCD) including applicable cess in its Haridwar plant during prior years, while contesting the same on the ground that NCCD is in nature of excise duty and should be covered by area-based exemption.
Pursuant to favourable order from the Supreme Court, the provision has been reversed as exceptional item in the current quarter and necessary refund applications already filed with the department, the company said.
""The overall economic and customer sentiments continued to be soft during the first quarter of this fiscal and their impact is clearly visible in the performance of the auto sector,"" Hero MotoCorp Chief Financial Officer Niranjan Gupta said.
The outlook for the rest of the year will be dependent on multiple factors, including the progress of monsoon and festive season offtake, as well as improvement in liquidity, he added.
Given the dependence of multiple sectors and millions of jobs on auto industry, it is imperative for the government to take urgent steps to boost consumption, Gupta said.
""We would, therefore, reiterate our appeal to the government to bring down GST on two-wheelers to 18%  from the current level of 28%, in order to provide the much-needed relief to the sector,"" he added.
A reduction in GST will lower the cost of two-wheelers and spur demand, with the consequent growth in volumes offsetting any impact on the government revenue, Gupta said.
Shares of Hero MotoCorp on Tuesday ended 6.01% lower at  ₹2,259.35 a piece on the BSE."
31,2019-07-31,Hero MotoCorp,"The net profit of  ₹1,257 cr included an exceptional item of  ₹737.5 cr, adjusted for which it was down 16% year-on-yearIn a nutshell, Hero MotoCorp’s results did not spring any negative surprises

Even before Hero MotoCorp Ltd announced its June quarter (Q1 FY20) results, the stock tanked 6.1% to  ₹2,258.80, close to its 52-week low on the National Stock Exchange. As expected, the results were weak, in line with the 12.5% year-on-year drop in sales volume, announced earlier this month.
Margin pressures along with the 9% drop in net sales led to a steep 16% fall in Ebitda to  ₹1,158 crore. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Two-wheeler demand has borne the brunt of the economic slowdown and cost pressures due to regulatory changes. According to Prayesh Jain, executive vice president at Yes Securities Ltd, “Increase in cost of ownership is likely to delay demand recovery. From the time insurance was hiked for vehicles till BS-VI emission norms come into force, the cost of owning a two-wheeler will increase substantially, which is bound to hurt demand.""
This is what has taken the Hero MotoCorp stock downhill. On the back of falling sales and profit margins, consensus earnings per share estimate on the Street has fallen from  ₹227 for FY21 to  ₹181 in the past year. So, the 30% drop in share price over the period is not surprising.
On top of it, weak operating leverage dented margins, even though realizations rose by 4% year-on-year. Ebitda margin at 14.4% was about 120 basis points lower year-on-year. A basis point is 0.01%.
However, according to ICICI Securities Ltd, “The margin was better than forecast and was up 80 bps (basis points) sequentially. The beat was due to savings in other expenses as a percentage to sales, although higher employee costs and contraction in gross margins limited the benefit.""
Having said that, investors must note that the reported net profit of  ₹1,257.3 crore included an exceptional item of  ₹737.5 crore, adjusted for which, it was around 16% lower year-on-year.
In a nutshell, Hero MotoCorp’s results did not spring any negative surprises. However, the volley of negative news for the auto sector in the recent past has only added to the headwinds of weak demand and stiff competition that may dent margins further in the coming quarters. A report by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations stated that liquidity continues to be a worry, both at the retail and dealer levels. A delayed monsoon may fail to improve festive season demand in two-wheelers that have a significant exposure to rural markets.
With so many odds to battle along with cautious inventory and production management ahead of the BS VI emission norms, earnings upsides for Hero MotoCorp seem capped in the near term."

29,2019-08-08,Hero MotoCorp,"Around 40,000-50,000 workers in the Gurugram-Manesar auto belt have been retrenchedThe downtrend has trickled down to the logistics sector as lower vehicle production has drastically hit the utilization of trucks

New Delhi/Mumbai: A prolonged sales slowdown has plunged India, the world’s fourth-largest automobile market, into a labour crisis with tens of thousands of workers losing their jobs in the past few months across automakers and their parts suppliers.
Almost 40,000-50,000 workers have been retrenched at Gurugram and Manesar in Haryana, the country’s biggest automotive hub, as original equipment manufacturers and vendors have reduced their contract labour force, said several people aware of the developments. The situation is also severe in the automotive hubs of Chakan in Pune and Chennai, the people said.
With the slowdown showing little or no signs of bottoming out, hiring from local engineering colleges in the region has also taken a beating.
The Gurugram-Manesar hub houses two factories of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest carmaker, and one each of Honda Motorcycle and Scooters India Pvt. Ltd (HMSI) and Hero MotoCorp. Ltd (HMC).
The downtrend has also trickled down to the logistics sector as lower vehicle production has drastically hit the utilization of trucks, leading to an increase in non-performing loans in the sector.
The domestic passenger vehicle industry has recorded its worst performance in the past two decades in July, continuing the downward trend for nearly a year. Sales of commercial vehicles and two-wheelers have also been hit. A series of factors including higher insurance costs, volatile stock markets and a liquidity squeeze in a slowing economy have slammed demand for new vehicles.
Maruti’s base of more than 300 tier I vendors have laid off 100-150 people on an average. Prominent vendors, who have multiple facilities such as Lumax Technologies and JBM group, have laid off around 500 or more employees. HMSI, India’s largest scooter maker, has asked 1,200-1,400 of its level I or technical contract workers to proceed on leave, while a third of the total contractual workforce with the vendors has been made redundant, said the people cited earlier.
None of the automakers disclosed the number of level II or non-technical workers who have been asked to go on leave.
“HMSI has removed 1,200-1,400 jobs since November last year as daily production has been reduced to 3,500 vehicles from 5,500 vehicles. Also, a third of our tier I suppliers have removed a third of their contractual workers in the last six months,"" said a worker at the Manesar plant of HMSI. “Post October, job losses are expected to rise even more as introduction of Bharat Stage VI norms would lead to a slowdown for a couple of quarters.""
Pawan Goenka, managing director of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M), said job losses are taking place at the level of automakers, dealers, suppliers and other unorganized levels. “Given the current challenging global and domestic growth environment, a concerted policy effort will be required to prop up sentiment, put a floor under consumption and revive growth,"" he said.
Level I contract workers in the companies work on the shop floor, while level II work in places such as employee canteens and stockyards. Maruti has asked 300-400 of its contractual workers at its Gurugram facility to proceed on “rest"". The figure is almost double at its factory in Manesar.
Kuldeep Janghu, general secretary of Maruti Udyog Kamgar Union, said 10-15% of the total workforce in the Gurugram and Manesar region have been shown the door as sales have fallen drastically in the past year.
“Maruti has stopped hiring in the Manesar plant and recruitment of students from colleges has also been significantly low. Hiring is not expected to improve next year. Maruti is still better than other automobile manufacturers when it comes to balancing its workforces in such trying times,"" said Janghu.
Dilip Pawar, a union leader who represents Vishwa Kalyan Kamgar Sanghatana in Pune, said the ongoing slowdown has “directly resulted in massive production cuts at the manufacturing units in and around Pune"".
“While we don’t have accurate number of job losses at the moment, I estimate that more than 10,000 daily wage workers have become unemployed over the past months as plants that were running three shifts a day are now operating only a single shift,"" he said.
Pawar said most of the job cuts were made by vehicle manufacturers such as Tata Motors Ltd, M&M and Volkswagen India.
He said all the retrenched workers were temporary and full-time employees have not been fired so far.
A person from SIPCOT Irungattukottai Manufacturers Association near Chennai, who did not want to be named, echoed a similar sentiment. He, however, did not disclose the number of job losses in that region.
Although most automakers have decided to reduce workers, Bajaj Auto Ltd and HMC have been the outliers.
“Though production of vehicles has declined a bit, we haven’t seen many job losses as yet. Hero has not reduced production to the extent of Maruti and HMSI. We use to manufacture around 6,000 units daily, but now it has been reduced to 5,500 units,"" said a worker at the Manesar factory of HMC.
Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra said, “The most obvious and welcome first aid would be some temporary relief on the GST front, either by modifying the slabs, or, if that is not possible, by removing the cess""."
28,2019-08-16,Hero MotoCorp,"Hero MotoCorp has been reducing its production due to decline in salesThe two-wheeler manufacturer said the shutting down of production is also related to demand

NEW DELHI :
Hero MotoCorp, India's largest two-wheeler maker, has closed all its factories for four days till August 18. In a regulatory filing, Hero MotoCorp said its manufacturing facilities will be closed from August 15 to 18, 2019. ""While this has been part of the annual holiday calendar on account of Independence Day, Raksha Bandhan and the weekend, it also partly reflects the prevailing market demand scenario,"" the company said.
The shutting down of production facilities is part of an annual routine and also to adjust production in line with current market demand. Hero MotoCorp further said production planning is a matter of advance monitoring of the market dynamics and prudent demand forecasting.
""This helps us to plan our production well in advance, thereby enabling us to stay flexible both in terms of volumes and production schedules,"" it said.
Hero MotoCorp has been reducing its production due to decline in sales. In the April-July period this year, the two-wheeler market leader's production was at 24,66,802 units, down 12.03 per cent from the year-ago period. In July alone, Hero's sales dropped by 21.18% to 5,35,810, as compared with 6,79,862 units in the year-ago period.
Other two-wheeler manufacturers have also reported a double-digit drop in sales due to sluggish demand. Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India (HMSI)'s July sales dropped by 10.77%, Bajaj Auto reported a dip of 13%, TVS Motor Company 15.72% and niche bike maker Royal Enfield 22%.
Hero MotoCorp had earlier said that the sluggish market environment prevalent in the first quarter has continued in the beginning of the second quarter as well and its impact is visible in the dispatch volumes. On outlook for the rest of the year, it had said that things would be dependent on multiple factors, including the progress of monsoon and festive season offtake, as well as improvement in the liquidity situation."
27,2019-08-16,Hero MotoCorp,"Hero MotoCorp has shut a manufacturing facility for few daysEmami witnessing slowdown in demand for hair care products

Indians are cutting back on spending from hair oils to motorcycles in a fresh sign that the slowdown in Asia’s third-largest economy is becoming more entrenched.
That is likely to add pressure on policymakers to ease both fiscal and monetary policy in the coming months at a time when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tours the country to meet various stakeholders and lobby groups. The Reserve Bank of India has lowered interest rates to a nine-year low, but that impact is yet to be felt due to tardy monetary policy transmission and subdued demand for loans.
On Friday, Hero MotoCorp Ltd., the country’s largest two-wheeler maker, said it had shut its manufacturing facility for three days until 18 August in response partly to “the market demand scenario"" and inventory management. The same day, Sundaram-Clayton Ltd., an auto parts supplier, said it will shut its factory in Padi in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu for two days until 17 August, citing “business slowdown across sectors.""
Mirroring the sentiment about weak consumption, Emami Ltd., a cosmetics to healthcare conglomerate, said that the company was witnessing lower demand for its hair care products.
“We are doing some cost optimization,"" Priti A. Sureka, a director at Emami said in an interview in Kolkata.
Earlier this month, the company reported earnings that missed estimates as revenues took a hit, highlighting similar struggles among consumer good makers including Hindustan Unilever Ltd. and Britannia Industries Ltd. This does not bode well for India’s overall growth rate, which has been hit by slowing public spending and a cutback in private consumption.
Official gross domestic numbers for the June quarter are due Aug. 30 and analysts forecast the economy to have expanded 6.1% from a year ago, which is higher than the five-year low of 5.8% seen in the January to March quarter, but well below the 7-8% pace seen in the past few years.
A shadow-banking crisis for the past one year has weighed on private consumption which contributes nearly 60% to the GDP. The latest consumer sentiment survey from the central bank highlighted worries about job losses with a subdued economy keeping many from spending.

26,2019-08-20,Hero MotoCorp,"The Nifty Auto index has risen 1.57% this month, with Maruti and Hero MotoCorp reaping healthy gainsThe rise in auto stocks contrasts with the weak sales performance by the sector for about a year

MUMBAI :
Automobile stocks made robust gains in August, partly recouping their losses this year, on hopes that a monsoon revival, drop in dealer stocks and an expected stimulus package from the government would boost demand.
The Nifty Auto index has risen 1.57% so far this month, with some companies such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest carmaker, and Hero MotoCorp Ltd, the largest motorcycle producer, reaping healthy gains.
The rise in auto stocks contrasts with the weak sales performance by the sector for about a year. A bevy of factors such as economic uncertainty, rise in ownership costs and volatile stock markets contributed to the tepid show.
The paradox is witnessed in other sectors too. For instance, despite a depreciating Indian currency, IT stocks have not performed well in August.
The rupee has weakened 3.7% so far, but the Nifty IT Index has shed 1.31% in August. A depreciating rupee translates into higher revenue in rupee terms for the export-focused software companies. Despite this, major IT stocks such as Infosys Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Wipro Ltd have declined 2-5% this month.
Analysts said the April-June period was a weak quarter for domestic software companies in terms of earnings and the outlook also appears bleak.
Still, Hero MotoCorp surged 11.7% so far this month, while Bajaj Auto Ltd gained 8.31%. Maruti Suzuki rose 9.38% during the same period.
Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki and Bajaj Auto together constitute 43% of the total weightage of the Nifty Auto Index. The Nifty Auto index dropped 13.6% in July and has declined 24.7% year to date. In comparison, the benchmark Nifty is up 1.76% so far this year.
Analysts said the reasons behind the gains in auto stocks include healthy rainfall ahead of the crucial festive season, substantial production cuts to arrest the mounting vehicle inventory and positive outcomes of the recent meetings between the auto industry and finance ministry representatives, along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s assurance that internal combustion engine vehicles can coexist with electric vehicles.
The auto industry, which is witnessing one of its longest demand slumps, reported its worst performance in the past two decades in July when the passenger car segment recorded a 31% decline in wholesales from a year earlier. That apart, as the industry is bracing for the transition to Bharat Stage VI emission norms from 1 April 2020 that will result in a substantial price rise across vehicle categories, the proposed mandate to ban all internal combustion engine-driven three-wheelers from 2023 and all petrol two-wheelers below 150cc from 2025 has caused uncertainty, further impacting consumer sentiments.
“Monsoons were scant in June. Later in July-August, rainfall has been better than earlier expectations. Auto companies such as Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto have high rural exposure. Secondly, hopes of government stimulus and the statements made by PM Modi have impacted positively,"" said Chirag Jain, an analyst at SBICAP Securities.
Citing similar reasons, Mitul Shah, an analyst at Reliance Securities, said: “Auto stocks were highly beaten down in anticipation of poor Q1 results and negative sentiments. However, they turned out to be relatively better. There are positive ongoing discussions between the industry and the government lately and the monsoon deficit is narrowing, which will clearly improve consumption in the rural economy.""
Investors are also hoping for a recovery in volumes, with Maruti Suzuki set to launch two new passenger cars, while Bajaj Auto has recently launched its most affordable Pulsar 125cc motorcycle."
25,2019-08-22,Hero MotoCorp,"An investment in Ola Electric will be made by Munjal in his personal capacity and not linked to Hero MotoCorpAn investment in Ola Electric would be a major endorsement of the potential of electric mobility in India

New Delhi/Mumbai: Pawan Munjal might be the next big investor after Ratan Tata to invest in Ola Electric.
Billionaire Pawan Munjal, chairman of Hero MotoCorp Ltd—India’s largest two-wheeler maker by sales—is in advanced talks to invest in the electric mobility arm of ride-hailing company Ola, said four people directly aware of the development.
An investment in Ola Electric Mobility Pvt. Ltd would be a major endorsement of the future potential of electric mobility in India at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration is pushing automakers and cab aggregators to shift to electric vehicles. Munjal will follow Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of Tata group, as an investor in Ola Electric.
Munjal has been discussing the potential investment over the last few months with Arun Sarin as well as the senior management of Ola Electric, one of the four people cited earlier said on condition of anonymity.
Sarin, a former chief executive of Vodafone Group Plc, was appointed an independent director of Ola Electric in May. Sarin, an investor in Ola and Ola Electric, is also a mentor and adviser to Ola Electric.
“This deal has been in the works over the last few months and people close to Mr Munjal were aware of the ongoing negotiations. He intends to invest in different startups going forward and this is also one among them,"" the person said.
The quantum of the investment could not be immediately ascertained.
An investment by Munjal will be significant for Bhavish Agarwal-led Ola since it will be the second fundraise from the promoter of an automobile company, the first being Tata.
The people cited earlier said Munjal, who has also invested in electric scooter manufacturing startup Ather Energy, is looking at investment opportunities in a range of startups in the future mobility ecosystem.
Besides Tata, Ola Electric, incorporated in February 2017, counts venture capital funds SoftBank Group Corp., Tiger Global and Matrix Partners India as its investors.
Earlier in July, the startup joined the unicorn club, after receiving funds worth $250 million from Japanese investment bank and venture capital fund SoftBank.
In March, Ola said Ola Electric had raised  ₹400 crore from US-based hedge fund Tiger Global and Matrix India. This was Ola’s first external fundraise for its electric mobility business. This was followed by an undisclosed investment by Ratan Tata in May.
“This investment will also give Bhavish Agarwal a different avenue for raising funds and he would not have to rely on SoftBank for future funding,"" said the first person cited earier.
An investment in Ola Electric will be made by Munjal in his personal capacity and would not be linked to Hero MotoCorp at this moment.
“Ola and Munjal’s family office have already invested together in dockless scooter-sharing startup Vogo,"" said a banker aware of the development, the second of the four cited earlier.
“We do not comment on market speculation,"" said a spokesperson of Hero MotoCorp in response to emailed queries. Ola did not respond to emailed queries.
Ola Electric has been on a fundraising spree in 2019 to achieve its target of deploying one million electric vehicles by 2021.
“Mr Munjal now plans to become a venture capitalist and the investment in Ola will probably be another step towards that direction,"" said the second person. “Also, in the long term, this makes sense since Hero can supply its electric two-wheelers in the coming years to Ola. Also, at a time when the Union government is trying to promote electric mobility, such investment from a promoter of a two-wheeler manufacturer makes sense.""
Automakers are investing in various startups in the electric as well as future mobility space either to develop new technologies or to learn ways to adjust their existing businesses in line with fast changes in the mobility landscape.
In March, South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Group announced an investment of $300 million in Ola Cabs, as part of a strategic partnership between the two companies. With this deal, both Hyundai and Kia Motors will work with the Bengaluru based startup to develop customized electric vehicles and charging stations appropriate for ride-hailing applications. In the future Hyundai will also deploy its low-cost electric vehicles in Ola’s fleet as part of the arrangement.
“This investment in Ola Electric, though in a personal capacity, will give Pawan Munjal a ready customer for his electric two-wheelers without having to think about a new brand and new chain of dealerships,"" said Avik Chattopadhayay, founder of Expereal, a brand consulting firm.
“Ola also has a plan to deploy one million electric vehicles in India and in the long term might use Hero’s electric two-wheelers in its fleet. It is both interesting and intriguing to see an eight-month old venture already valued at $1 billion, with big names like Tiger Global, SoftBank, Ratan Tata and Arun Sarin involved."""

NEW DELHI :
Hero MotoCorp has started dispatching the first batch of BS-VI compliant Splendor iSmart 110 motorcycles to its dealers for product familiarisation and training purposes, according to sources.
The motorcycle is likely to be commercially launched soon, a source said.
The dispatches were made earlier this week, and the bikes are expected to reach some of the dealerships in a day or two.
""The company has already dispatched an initial lot of the BS-VI ready Splendor iSmart 110 motorcycles to its dealers across the country in preparation for its upcoming market introduction. The objective is to impart training on the new vehicle to the staff at its dealerships and make them familiar with the new product,"" the source added.
When contacted, a Hero MotoCorp spokesperson said :“We do not want to comment on market speculations. As we have stated earlier, our preparation towards migration to BS-VI is well on track and we will bring our range of BS-VI motorcycles and scooters well before the stipulated timeline. We will make the announcements on specific launch dates at an appropriate time.""
Industry sources said the model is likely to be competitively positioned and priced at only around 12-15% higher than the current Splendor iSmart.
In June 2019, Hero MotoCorp became the first two-wheeler manufacturer in the country to receive the BS-VI certification from the International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT).
The company, India's largest two-wheeler maker, had received the certification for its Splendor iSmart 110 motorcycle.
The BS-VI compliant motorcycle has been designed and developed completely in-house, at the company’s R&D hub, the Center of Innovation and Technology in Jaipur, Rajasthan."

The premium product is the first outcome of the three-way strategic partnership initiated last year between Hero Cycles Ltd, Yamaha Motor Co and Mitsui & Co Ltd. The alliance, brought together by Mitsui is aimed at creating technologically superior high performance products through collaboration, a joint statement said on Tuesday.
Hero Cycles will manufacture the Lectro electric cycles at its Ghaziabad manufacturing unit which will also act as an export base for these products.
“We are proud to unveil Lectro EHX20 powered by Yamaha, the first collaborative product between Hero Cycles and Yamaha Motor. It is the first branded E-Cycle which is driven by a Center Motor and resultantly delivers a high performance experience suitable forextreme adventure sports. With promising days ahead for the E-cycle market, we hope to deliver more such path-breaking products for different sections of the Indian audience in the future,"" said Pankaj M Munjal, chairman and managing director, Hero Motors.
“Lectro EHX20 powered by Yamaha is a first of its kind product to be introduced in India. The electric vehicle segment or e-cycle in India has received a major push from the government in recent times and the market seems poised for unprecedented growth. It is imperative therefore that manufacturers offer a wide range of products in the e-cycle segment suitable for the needs of different sections of the audience,"" said Hiroyuki Ota, executive officer, Yamaha Motor Co Ltd."
22,2019-09-17,Hero MotoCorp,"Hero launched Lectro e-cycles in collaboration with Japan’s Yamaha Motor and Mitsui, priced at  ₹130,000Hero Cycles has also been urging the union government to include such electric cycles in the second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles scheme

New Delhi: As the government pushes for electric mobility, food delivery firms such as Swiggy and fast food restaurants like Pizza Hut and Domino’s are looking at electric bicycles as an alternative to motorcycles and scooters.
Electric cycles are yet to make an inroad into the Indian market compared to electric scooters which have attracted investments from vehicle manufacturers and startups.
According to Pankaj Munjal, chairman, Hero Motors Co., India should also try to learn from the West, where e-bicycles have led the electric revolution.
“Entities like Dominos, PizzaHut, Swiggy and others are all switching over to this (e-bicycles). They have realized that to ride this you don’t need a licence and a rider can’t be issued a fine, compared to electric scooter,"" Munjal said in an interview on the sidelines of the launch event of the Lectro brand of electric bicycles.
Restaurants, food delivery applications and ride hailing applications were asked by the Union government to convert a significant part of their fleets of two-wheelers to electric, in order to reduce pollution and imports of crude oil.
Hero Cycles has also been urging the government to include electric cycles in the second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles or FAME-2 scheme, so that these vehicles become affordable and help accelerate the adoption of electric mobility in India.
“I think FAME-2 has been launched to promote the electric vehicle sector. Shift to an electric car seems highly unlikely due to range anxiety and maintenance. World over e-cycles have led the trend (shift to electric vehicles). With more e-bicycles we will be closer to the shift to electric mobility,"" added Munjal.
According to a person aware of the developments, Jubilant FoodWorks Ltd that operates the Domino’s Pizza in India, too, is in talks with companies to experiment with delivery via different kinds of electric vehicles in its fleet.
Food delivery service provider Swiggy is also working on a plan to use EVs for delivery service.
“Over 20% of Swiggy’s delivery partners in tier two and three cities like Surat, Belgaum, Guwahati and Lucknow use cycles for delivery. The food delivery giant is piloting Electric Vehicles to encourage adoption among its delivery partners which will reduce running cost by up to 40% and result in higher effective pay-outs,"" the company said in a statement on 17 September.
Hero Motors on Tuesday launched Lectro e-cycles in collaboration with Japan’s Yamaha Motor Co. Ltd and Mitsui and Co. Ltd, priced at  ₹130,000. The premium product is the first outcome of the three-way strategic partnership initiated last year between Hero Cycles, Yamaha and Mitsui."

20,2019-09-20,Hero MotoCorp,"Automobile companies exploring opportunities to manufacture in India will have to pay an even lower income tax rate of 15%, provided they start their production by 31 March, 2023According to Rajan Wadhera, president, SIAM, welcomed the bold announcements made by the Finance Minister

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s big tax break announcements today might have brought the Diwali and year-end celebrations a bit too early for customers looking to purchase their car. Car buyers usually fish for discounts that time as companies clear their inventory before the next year’s models roll in. If automakers are quick to, and they may be very tempted to do so, pass on some of the benefits of lower taxes, customers may not have wait that long.
In order to boost consumption demand and increase spending from private companies, the Union government today cut corporate tax rate to 22% from the 25% and 30%. The effective tax to be paid by the companies including surcharge is going to be 25.17%.
The reduction in taxes will also help companies to spend more in research and development of products and other aspects of the business.
The move is sure to boost the sentiment among automobile companies facing their worst slump in more than a decade. Of the top five gainers on the benchmark NSE Nifty50, three were automobile companies. Eicher Motors was the Nifty gainer with gains of 13.76% while Hero MotoCorp ended the day 12.3% higher.
Automobile companies exploring opportunities to manufacture in India will have to pay an even lower income tax rate of 15%, provided they start their production by 31 March, 2023. According to experts, this move will also help companies who plan to invest in India to develop and manufacture electric vehicles. The effective tax rates on these companies will be 17.5%.
To boost research and development initiatives of the companies in India, the Minimum Alternate Tax has been also reduced from existing 18.5% to 15% for companies who want to continue availing incentives.
""The union government has sent two very important messages through today's announcements. The first message is to resolve the immediate issues of getting out of the downturn and the second one is this tax cut has essentially put a lot of money with the companies. That extra money enables them to take various kind of options actions to pump demand for their products in the market,"" said RC Bhargava, chairman Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.
According to Rajan Wadhera, president, Society of Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), welcomed the bold announcements made by the Finance Minister.
“These are indeed landmark announcements and would certainly help in reviving growth in the Indian Economy. These set of major tax reforms are a clear indicator of the government of India’s commitment to improving business environment to give a definite boost to economic growth,"" he said.
He also added that expansion of scope of CSR expenditure to include incubation centers and R&D activities will also help with R&D expenditures in automobile sector."

A surprise corporate tax cut will lay groundwork for “second order benefits"" for India’s economy over the next several months or even years, while providing a favorable backdrop for broader stock selection, according to BNP Paribas Securities India Pvt.
The brokerage has re-balanced its “quality list"" of stocks again after having made adjustments a day before the Indian government reduced corporate tax rates on Sept. 20. This time around it added companies ranging from large-cap stocks such as Britannia Industries Ltd. to smaller names including Manappuram Finance Ltd., Abhiram Eleswarapu, head of equity research at BNP Paribas Securities, wrote in a note published on Sept. 24.
“The rally in stocks after the tax reduction has provided immediate money in the hands of investors,"" he said by phone. “It provides confidence that the government is willing to do whatever it takes and will provide equity investors a chance to broaden the basket of stocks.""
India’s surprise tax cut came after economic growth in the April-June quarter slumped to its lowest level in six years, hitting the nation’s smaller stocks the hardest. While the implied valuations of 10-15 Nifty stocks are still at a premium to historical averages, the medium and smallcap indexes are still below their means, according to the BNP report.
Since the tax cut, mid cap stocks have jumped 9% while small cap names gained 7%. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has climbed 8.3% in the last three sessions.
The gains show that the “first round impact"" of the tax cut on company earnings has been factored in, according to Eleswarapu.
Here are the key insights from the report
-Overweight India; retain Sensex target of 40,500 by December which is 3.6% above Tuesday’s close
-Tax cut to widen fiscal deficit by about 0.75% of GDP though it could be partly recovered through higher collections, divestment

NEW DELHI :
On a day when Bajaj Auto announced the return of its iconic Chetak brand in an electric avatar, the company's MD Rajiv Bajaj on Wednesday took a dig at rivals with different backgrounds for trying to create electric vehicles ""out of thin air"" with click of fingers.
Terming his own company as ""engineers who do our own work"", he said Bajaj Auto's credibility of a rich past that gives it a solid foundation for the future in the EV space unlike others who have adopted a different approach.
Without taking names of the rivals, Bajaj directed his remarks to rivals, including Hero MotoCorp, Revolt Intellicorp and Kinetic Green.
""It seems like in our country there is a new electric vehicle launched everyday,"" Bajaj remarked here while unveiling Chetak e-scooter.
He further said, ""It is to our amazement how people who have spent their whole life making batteries or motors or just plain steel, suddenly want to put a coat on their stuff and manufacture electric vehicles as if it happens just with the click of your fingers, but at least they are manufacturers"".
The outspoken industry leader also had some harsh words for entrants who had not been related to the auto industry at all.
""And you will be more amazed to see how sometimes people, who have done nothing but imported air conditioners, mobiles and refrigerators from China suddenly want to revolutionise our roads by making EVs out of thin air.
""I have been in meetings where manufacturers who have failed in IC (internal combustion) engines want to change the world with electric vehicles. And then there are existing two-wheeler makers who when it comes to making EVs invest in South based companies as if it is the job of someone else to make EVs for them,"" Bajaj said.
So, when all these people talk about future, he said, ""I prefer to start with our past that we are not a battery or steel maker, we are not a failed two-wheeler company and we are not a venture capitalist company who fund someone else to manufacture for us, we are engineers who do our own work"".
Bajaj further said, ""We are a company with a very rich past, rich legacy. I think it is the credibility of this rich past that gives us a solid foundation for the future"".
The company is bringing back its iconic brand Chetak in an electric avatar and will start selling the model from next year in Pune followed by Bengaluru."

NEW DELHI :
India’s largest two-wheeler manufacturer, Hero MotoCorp Ltd has reported a year-on-year (YoY) decline of 10% in its consolidated net profit after tax (PAT) for Q2FY2020. The company’s consolidated net PAT stood at  ₹884 crore for Q2 against  ₹982 crore from the year-ago period.
Hero MotoCorp’s total consolidated income reported a decline of 17% YoY at  ₹7,825 crore during Q2 on subdued demand for two-wheelers in the domestic market. The company’s total income stood at  ₹7,380 crore during Q2FY2019. Hero said its EBIDTA margin for Q2 stood at 14.5%.
On the standalone front, the two-wheeler manufacturer has reported PAT of  ₹875 crore for the quarter ending September 2019 as against  ₹976 crore for the year-ago period. Hero’s financial statements indicate that the company’s tax expenses (current tax) in Q2FY20 saved it from posting a sharper YoY decline in its PAT. Its total standalone income for Q2 stood at  ₹7,779 crore, down 16.5% YoY.
Meanwhile, for H1 FY20, Hero MotoCorp has reported a YoY growth in its standalone PAT despite recording a substantial drop in its total income, thanks to the exceptional income from reversal of the national calamity contingent duty (NCCD) in Q1FY20.
While the company’s standalone PAT for H1 stood at  ₹2,132 crore, up 13% YoY, its total income was  ₹16,028 crore, down 12% YoY.

In the same note, Sanjay Bhan, head — sales, aftersales and parts, Hero MotoCorp said that the company is gearing up to launch its first BS VI compliant motorcycle soon after the festive season.
“It will mark the commencement of sequential transition to our BS-VI range over the next few months,"" he said."
14,2019-10-24,Hero MotoCorp,"In July-September, revenue fell 16.7% to  ₹7,571 crore, but was still ahead of consensus estimate of  ₹7,390 croreHero MotoCorp continued to lose market share in the domestic two-wheeler market, which declined to 35.5% in H1FY20 from 35.8% in H1FY19

Hero MotoCorp Ltd’s second-quarter results beat analysts’ estimates, but the loss of market share is disconcerting for investors.
In July-September, Hero MotoCorp’s revenue declined 16.7% to  ₹7,571 crore, but was still ahead of consensus estimate of  ₹7,390 crore. Revenue was higher than estimates due to spares and other operating income.
Volume growth has been a key concern for Hero MotoCorp as it continues to grapple with the increase in competitive intensity. Volumes declined 21% year-on-year to 1.7 million units. Higher realisations per unit due to a better product mix saved the day as it grew 5% year-on-year.
Hero MotoCorp continued to lose market share in the domestic two-wheeler market, which declined to 35.5% in H1FY20 from 35.8% in H1FY19. New products in the two-wheeler market failed to have the desired effect. “Although HMCL will benefit from a recovery in the domestic 2W sales cycle, we expect market share losses to continue, with a further decline to 34.5% by FY22E,"" said analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services in a note to clients.
Hero MotoCorp’s operating income fell 20.2% y-o-y to  ₹1,101 crore in Q2FY20. However, this was also above the consensus estimates of about  ₹1,025 crore. Operating margins contracted 70 basis points to 14.5% in the second quarter compared with 15.2% in the year-ago quarter.
The company has benefited from the cut in corporate tax rates announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman last month. The company’s tax expense fell to  ₹162.9 crore from  ₹472.17 crore for the same period last year.
This reduction in the effective tax rate for the company boosted net profits. Net profit stood at  ₹919 crore against consensus expectation of  ₹770 crore.
All this is good, and the stock price-earnings multiple of 17 times FY21 forward earnings seems to be fairly priced. Steady, sustainable growth in demand post the festival season holds the key to future performance."

12,2019-11-07,Hero MotoCorp,"The company aims to export 1 million units a yearIt was originally planned for a 2016-17 deadline

For Hero MotoCorp Ltd (HMCL), India’s largest two-wheeler manufacturer, achieving its lofty aim of exporting 1 million units a year will take some more time. Originally planned for a 2016-17 deadline, the company now aims to achieve this aim in another four years.
“We continue to aspire for crossing the (said) milestone. Our annual export volumes stood less than 210,000 units last fiscal. Our revised export target involves a five-fold growth thereby crossing one million units in another 3-4 years,"" Rajat Bhargava, head, strategy and performance transformation, global business and emerging mobility at Hero MotoCorp told Mint in an interview. In line with that, the company plans to increase contribution of exports to annual turnover from the current 3% to 10% by FY2023–FY24, Bhargava said.
Bhargava was talking on the sidelines of the ongoing EICMA Motorcycle Show in Milan, Italy.
Hero MotoCorp had first announced its 1-million unit export ambition in 2011, just after separating from its Japanese partner Honda Motor Company Ltd. The joint venture with Honda had prevented the Indian company from entering foreign markets.
While export volumes were less than 3% of Hero MotoCorp’s total annual production in FY2019, its domestic rivals such as Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Company exported 40% and 16.5% respectively of their total production last fiscal.
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Nigeria and Colombia are the top five export markets that are expected to drive the five-fold growth, the company said.
Hero MotoCorp currently exports two-wheelers to 40 countries, with Bangladesh as its biggest market, accounting for about 45% of total exports.
Bhargava said while Hero was present mostly in developing markets similar to India, with typically high demand for motorcycles, the export strategy is to expand its existing footprints, rather than adding newer territories, in the near future.
The company entered the Africa markets in FY2016-17, with primary focus on Nigeria, which also is one the biggest export markets for the maker of Pulsar bikes — Bajaj Auto Ltd.
Even as Africa accounts for about 6% of total annual exports for Hero MotoCorp as of now, it is a far bigger export market for both Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Company.
“This is why we see a lot of headroom for future growth. Other Indian two-wheeler makers have been present in Africa for more than a decade whereas we have reached those markets only after separating from Honda,"" said Bhargava.
Besides Nigeria, Hero MotoCorp exports to about 10 African countries currently, including Uganda, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Madagascar.
“We are in a phase where it’s time to roll and penetrate further into these specific markets. Until two years ago, even the African countries were not growing due to oil price crash, which impacted their economies. We are now progressively introducing new products in these markets,"" he added.

Hero Motocorp Ltd is the country’s largest two-wheeler maker, enjoying about half the market share with a dominance in motorcycles. Yet, its stock has been the worst performer among peers in the past year.
Hero Motocorp’s stock trades at 14 times its one-year forward estimated earnings, while peers Bajaj Auto Ltd and TVS Motor Company Ltd trade at 18 and 25 times, respectively.
What gives?
Analysts say Hero’s profitability may be hit the hardest in FY20 and FY21 among two-wheeler firms due to the transition to BS-VI compliant vehicles, starting April. This is because nearly 70% of the company’s two-wheelers are in the entry-level segment, where the cost of transition is reportedly the highest. “Entry-level motorcycles cost increase is likely to be 12-13% double that for premium motorcycles,"" says Bharat Gianani, analyst, Sharekhan. TVS and Bajaj have 13% and 29% entry-level two-wheelers respectively in their overall volumes.
Furthermore, unlike its peers, Hero cannot find relief in exports where the BS-VI emission rules are not applicable. Only 3% of its total sales accrues from exports. In this respect, Bajaj and TVS export 46% and 20% respectively of their two-wheeler sales. Thus, they can hedge the downturn in domestic demand and impact on profit margins during the transition with exports that have been robust in the last few quarters.
That’s not all. Hero has already underperformed the industry in the last two months as it resorted to inventory correction to transition into new norms.
The pertinent question from an investor standpoint is: Will Hero pass on cost increase to customers? “Given the weak demand, Hero may not do so. This, along with poor operating leverage would impact profit margins,"" says Gianani.
On top of this, the discounts to liquidate the 30-40 days inventory of BS-IV vehicles will impinge profitability in the near term. As such Ebitda margin fell from 16% levels in FY18 to about 14% in recent quarters. This is unlikely to turn favourable in the near term. Besides, marketing costs for all auto firms in the run up to BS-VI new launches is expected to be high.
“BS-VI would not just impact overall demand but also pose a risk of value migration and change in competitive positioning,“ says a report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.
Indeed, the pressure of BS-VI transition is likely to pose risks to all two-wheeler players, albeit in varying degrees. Still, for now it looks like the odds are against Hero due to some inherent weakness in its product mix. The street has also been discerning. Hence, while Hero shares tumbled 30% in the past year, Bajaj gained 12% and TVS lost about 12%. “We have reduced our FY20 and FY21 estimates by 7% and 10% respectively for Hero,"" says Gianani.
While Hero shares tumbled 29%, TVS fell 22% while Bajaj Auto gained 12%"
