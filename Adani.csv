34,2018-01-08,Adani,"Adani Ports adds two giant dredgers
Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ), the country’s largest port developer and part of Adani Group, on Monday, announced the addition of two new 8000m3 Trailing Suction Hopper Dredgers (TSHDs).
These dredgers are amongst the largest in the Indian fleet of TSHDs, the company said here in a statement.
The Royal IHC, world leader in dredger building, designed and engineered these TSHDs as per APSEZ specifications and delivered it to the Adani team at Holland last month.
Both the dredgers have arrived at Adani’s Hazira Port in Gujarat after their maiden voyage through the Suez Canal route.
The dredgers have been registered under the Indian flag and classified under the Indian Register of Shipping, said Karan Adani, CEO, APSEZ.


Fleet strength up


With the two new dredgers, the company’s fleet strength has gone up to 19 dredgers, making it the largest dredging fleet in the country.
“This will substantially increase our capacity for dredging in APSEZ. These TSHDs are a big asset, as they will also support dredging efforts in other Indian ports and facilitate in port-led initiatives of the government.”
The Adani Hazira Port Pvt Ltd (AHPPL) is located close to the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) along the west coast of India which accounts for a major part of the Indian trade.
The port handles all types of cargo, including bulk, break-bulk, bulk liquid chemicals, petroleum products and edible oil, containers, automotive and crude."

Decks have been cleared for Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) to formally acquire Kattupalli port near Chennai from L&T Shipbuilding Ltd (LTSB) after a government agency cleared the bifurcation of the environment and coastal regulation zone (CRZ) clearances granted to the shipyard-cum-port complex.
On October 13, the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), functioning under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, approved an application filed by LTSB to amend the green clearance — issued earlier to LTSB — and to split it between LTSB and Marine Infrastructure Developer Pvt Ltd (MIDPL), a separate company formed by LTSB to vest the port business at Kattupalli, an official briefed on the EAC decision said.
This was the last of the statutory and regulatory clearances required to formalise the deal which was first announced in November 2015. Pending approvals, APSEZ has started running the de-merged Kattupalli port as an “official operator”.
In March 2016, the Tamil Nadu government approved the de-merger of the port from the shipyard to facilitate the deal between APSEZ and L&T Shipbuilding,
L&T Shipbuilding is 97 per cent owned by Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T), with Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO) holding the balance stake. The Kattupalli shipyard and port was awarded to L&T in 2008 for development and operations for 30 years by the Tamil Nadu government as a so-called captive port — a facility developed by an entity for handling its own (captive) cargo.
To facilitate optimum utilisation of port infrastructure, the Tamil Nadu government later permitted L&T to handle other commercial cargo such as containers and cars at the captive facility, in line with its port development policy.The port policy of Tamil Nadu under which the original deal was awarded to L&T does not permit the sale of the port alone because it was structured as a single entity – L&T Shipbuilding Ltd. Hence, the sale, needed clearance from the State government to hive-off the port from the shipyard.
In March this year, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved a scheme of arrangement for de-merger of the port business of LTSB into a separate company- MIDPL.
Formalities for the acquisition of Kattupalli port, is in the final stages. APSEZ has paid ₹1,450 crore till March 2017 for the acquisition which will be completed soon, according to the company. The firm achieved over 500 per cent growth as the official operator of Kattupalli, with container volumes rising from 7,900 TEUs a month in November 2015 (when the deal was announced) to over 35,000 TEUs per month in FY17.
APSEZ plans to transform Kattupalli into a multi-commodity port with a capacity to handle 24.65 million tonnes (mt) of cargo including 1.8 million TEUs, 149,899 automobiles, 0.44 mt of project cargo, 1.82 mt of break bulk/general cargo and 0.57 mt of edible oil, base oil, lube oil and non-hazardous liquid cargo."

Chabahar port is of great strategic importance for the development of regional maritime transit traffic to Afghanistan and Central Asia




Chabahar port is of great strategic importance for the development of regional maritime transit traffic to Afghanistan and Central Asia


Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ), JM Baxi Group and JSW Infrastructure Ltd have been short-listed on a tender floated by India Ports Global Ltd to manage, operate and maintain (MOM) the container and multi-purpose terminals at Chabahar port in Iran, which was partly opened a few days ago.
India Ports Global, a 60:40 joint venture between Jawaharlal Port Trust and Deendayal Port Trust (previously Kandla Port Trust), was set up by the government to make strategic investments in overseas ports.
India Ports Global and Aria Banader Iranian Port signed a deal in May 2016 to equip and operate the container and multi-purpose terminals at Shahid Beheshti – Chabahar Port Phase I – at a capital investment of $85.21 million and an annual revenue expenditure of $22.95 million on a 10-year lease.
Accordingly, India Ports Global will select a strategic private partner to manage, operate and maintain the container and multi-purpose terminals for 10 years.


Fees






The MOM contract will have a fixed management fee and a variable management fee. The bidder quoting the lowest variable management fee from IGPL will win the deal.
The MOM partner will be finalised by March 31, 2018, a Shipping Ministry official said.
The successful MOM partner will have to incorporate a special purpose vehicle (SPV) in Iran with a local private partner. This SPV will take a 10 per cent stake in a separate SPV floated by IGPL in Iran to run Chabahar port.
Chabahar port, located in the Sistan-Baluchistan Province on Iran’s South-eastern coast (outside Persian Gulf), is of great strategic importance for the development of regional maritime transit traffic to Afghanistan and Central Asia. The first phase development of the port will have a container terminal with two berths of 640-metres quay length and a depth of 16 metres, and a multi-purpose terminal with a quay length of 600 metres and draft of 14 metres.
The port has a total back-up area of 70 hectares. The construction of both the terminals is nearing completion, and the process of procuring equipment for the two terminals by IPGL is currently under way.


Orders placed


IGPL has already placed orders with China’s Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Co Ltd (ZPMC) for four new post-Panamax-size rail-mounted quay cranes (RMQCs) for the container terminal. Order for buying 14 rubber-tyred gantry cranes (RTGs) will be placed within a month, the Ministry official said.
IGPL has also called bids for buying two mobile harbour cranes (MHC) of 140 tonnes and four MHC of 100 tonnes and 32 tractor trailers.
Chabahar port project will be the first overseas venture for Indian state-owned ports such as JNPT and Deendayal."

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited (APSEZ), India’s largest port developer and the logistics arm of Adani Group, today saw a 13.65 per cent fall in net profit at Rs 710.25 crore for the first quarter ended June on account of higher tax.
The company had clocked a net profit of Rs 822.57 crore in the corresponding period of last fiscal, it said in a BSE filing.
Its total income rose to Rs 2,959.63 crore during the quarter under review as against Rs 2,085.14 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago.
The total expenses of the company rose to Rs 1,867.43 crore in the April-June quarter of the current fiscal as against Rs 1,206.40 crore in the year-ago quarter.
The Profit after Tax is lower due to higher tax incidence at Mundra which is now out of tax holiday period, the company said adding, however, from a tax cash flow angle, there is no change (impact) as MAT credit of earlier years is available to the tune of Rs 2,700 crore, the company said in a statement.
APSEZ Chief Executive Officer and Whole-Time Director Karan Adani said, “Operations in our port and logistic business continues to be robust. With our string of ports across India providing multi point access to India’s hinterland.”
He said, “We expect our cargo volumes to grow as per our earlier guidance in FY18. Mundra port is on the verge of becoming the largest container handling port in India. We would continue to pursue our plans to expand our Logistic foot prints by adopting Asset light model. Our aim is to provide seamless hinterland connectivity for our customers across our ports.”
Adani added that higher capacity utilisation, focus on operational efficiencies by automation and technology upgrades and focus on cost reduction will ensure higher Cash flows and the company will continue moving forward and setting benchmarks in this industry in line with the aims and goals of the nation.
The company said in the first quarter of FY18, APSEZ handled cargo of 50 million tonne (MT), which includes 6 MT of cargo handled by Abbot Point Operations Pty Ltd, Australia.
It said in line with strategy to diversify cargo mix, container volumes grew by 21 per cent and other bulk cargo grew by 12 per cent while container volumes at Mundra grew by 20 per cent, Hazira by 25 per cent and Kattupalli port grew by 31 per cent.
“Larger ports viz, Mundra, Hazira, Kattupalli and Dahej registered significant growth in overall cargo volumes. While Mundra, our mother port grew by 5 per cent, Hazira grew by 19 per cent and Kattupalli grew by 30 per cent,” the statement said.
The Adani Group is one of India’s leading business houses with revenue of over $ 12 billion.
Adani owns and operates nine ports and terminals in India. These are at Mundra, Dahej, Kandla and Hazira in Gujarat, Dhamra in Odissa, Mormugao in Goa, Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh and Kattupalli and Ennore in Chennai."

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) is on course to overtake Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust as India’s biggest container port in the fiscal year ending March.
Mundra Port located in Gujarat and the flagship port of APSEZ, is already India’s biggest port by volumes handled. It was the first Indian port to handle 100 million tonnes (mt) or more of cargo in a year, a feat it achieved in FY14.
In fact, Mundra has already surpassed JNPT as India’s biggest container port by installed capacity.
APSEZ which operates 10 ports on the country’s eastern and western coasts ended FY17 with a container throughput of 4.24 million twenty-foot equivalent units or TEUs, crossing the 4 million TEU-mark for the first time on the back of a robust 27 per cent year-on-year growth in container volumes. It helped APSEZ raise its market share in container handling to 31 per cent. from 27 per cent on an all-India level.
In FY17, containers accounted for 37 per cent of APSEZ’s total cargo, compared to 32 per cent in FY16.
In comparison, JNPT handled 4.5 million TEUs with a flattish growth in FY17.
Karan Adani, APSEZ’s CEO and the elder son of its billionaire-promoter Gautam Adani, has bigger plans for the port.
“Our container volumes are expected to grow 20 per cent and overall cargo volumes between 12 and 14 per cent in FY18,” Karan said. If that becomes a reality, APSEZ would end FY18 with over 5 million TEUs. “We expect our EBITDA margins to increase from 69 % to 70/72 % in the next three years through enhanced use of technology, diversified cargo mix and higher capacity utilization”. India’s ports handled 1,138 mt of cargo in 2016-17, of which the ports run by APSEZ loaded 168.72 mt or about 15 per cent of India’s total port volumes, whereas the 12 ports owned by the Central government handled 647.63 mt.
Mundra ended FY17 with 113.72 mt, continuing its run as India’s biggest commercial port for the fourth year in a row. It handled 3.48 million TEUs.
Karan is focussing on boosting container volumes, handle high value cargo, liquids, LNG and LPG in some of these ten ports/facilities as part of a de-risking strategy. These ten ports comprise 45 berths with a cargo handling capacity of 335 mmt.
“In line with our goal to reduce dependence on individual commodities and to offset the decline in coal imports following the government’s revised policy, we ramped-up efforts to diversify our cargo mix and increase in container volumes. The growth was made possible by the commissioning of CT-4 at Mundra, higher container volumes at Kattupalli and Hazira ports, and the addition of services at Mundra, Hazira and Kattupalli, which resulted from our strategic partnerships with global lines such as MSC, CMA CGM, and Maersk,” Karan said.
The extension of CT-3 at Mundra will also be completed in FY18. The deep-water port at Vizhinjam in Kerala is expected to start operations in 2019 as a “competitive global container transhipment hub”, targeting the 2 million TEUs plus of Indian containers transshipped annually through the Indian Ocean.
APSEZ has also started coastal shipment from its Dhamra port to the southern ports.
Formalities for the acquisition of Kattupalli port near Chennai from L&T Shipbuilding Ltd, is in the final stages. APSEZ has paid ₹1,450 crore till March 2017 for the acquisition which will be completed in H1 of FY18. The firm achieved over 500% growth as the official operator of Kattupalli, with container volumes rising from 7,900 TEUs a month in November 2015 to over 35,000 TEUs per month in FY17.
APSEZ plans to transform Kattupalli into a multi-commodity port, Karan added."

By December, when an Adani Group company inducts two large dredgers to its fleet, it will not only make the firm India’s biggest dredging contractor alongside state-run Dredging Corporation of India Ltd (DCI), but also intensify competition in a market that has seen contractors quoting very low rates to win work.
Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ), which runs a fleet of 17 dredgers against DCI’s 19, has been steadily increasing its maintenance dredging capability over the past few years, both for in-house requirements and also for third party work.Indian ports accumulate silt quickly and require maintenance dredging throughout the year. The Shipping Ministry estimates the dredging market at about ₹20,000 crore by 2020. The market was dominated by DCI until firms such as Mercator Ltd, the Essar Group, Marg Ltd, Navayuga Group and Adani Group entered the sector.
“Competition is tough in maintenance dredging. As a result, rates have come down substantially,” said Amedeo Peyron, area manager, south asia at Dredging, Environmental & Marine Engineering (DEME), a Belgium-based Group that runs Dredging International NV.
In July, Dutch dredging firm Van Oord Dredging and Marine Contracting Co. won a three-year maintenance dredging contract at the Kandla Port Trust bidding ₹347 crore against the governmnet’s estimate of ₹514 crore. In August, DCI clinched a three-year maintenance deal at Mumbai Port Trust quoting ₹83.99 crore against the Port Trust’s budget of ₹141 crore.
“When Adani gets two more dredgers by December, more capacity will come into the market and the competition will get tougher,” Peyron said."

The stock price of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) has run up by 78 per cent in the last year. However, at the current market price of ₹359, its valuation is still reasonable. Its price to earnings ratio of 19 times is lower than the three year average of 23 times.
The company has shown consistent growth in revenue and profit in the last five years, aided by 20 per cent annualised growth in cargo volumes. Regular expansion coupled with diversification of product handling capabilities at its existing ports have aided volumes growth over the years. When coal volumes took a beating, it successfully changed gear to concentrate on the container segment to prop up volumes. Moreover, healthy operational metrics have translated into its market share improving over the years. Investors with a long-term perspective can buy the stock,as the company seems poised to benefit from the government initiatives to prop up waterways.
APSEZ is into the business of ports, SEZ (Special Economic Zone) and logistics. About 83 per cent of its revenue comes from ports, while logistics and SEZ contribute another 5 and 9 per cent respectively. The company is the largest private port player operating 10 ports in the country with an annual cargo handling capacity of 300 mmt (million metric tonne). It accounts for 14 per cent of India’s overall cargo volumes and has footprint in the East, West and South of India. Mundra port (Gujarat) is its largest port, contributing to 53 per cent of overall company revenue. It also operates ports in Gujarat (Dahej, Hazira), Odisha (Dhamra) and Tamil Nadu (Kattupalli). Ennore Container Terminal (Tamil Nadu) and Vizinjam port (Kerala) is currently under construction. Moreover, it is also developing port-linked SEZ contiguous to Mundra port and managing logistic business connecting its ports to hinterland.
In the last five years, the company’s volumes have grown at an annual average of 20 per cent . In 2016-17, the company managed to grow cargo volumes by 11.2 per cent to 169 mmt as against the industry’s 8 per cent growth.
While volumes at Mundra (114 mmt) were up by 5 per cent in 2016-17, it was up by 24 per cent, 40 per cent and 600 per cent for Hazira (15 mmt), Dhamra (21 mmt) and Kattupalli (6 mmt) respectively.
While coal volumes fell 4 per cent during the year due to poor demand from power producers, container volumes were up by 27 per cent on a y-o-y basis to 4.24 million TEUs (Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit). Container volume growth for the industry was relatively lower at 10 per cent. During the year, crude and other cargo for APSEZ were up 11 per cent and 20 per cent respectively.
At Kattupalli, container volumes were strong with the port attracting a portion of the cargo from the busy Chennai port. Moreover, it also gets dry bulk cargo from steel manufacturers, which along with liquids, agri products, iron and steel, minerals and chemicals have been major volume drivers.
During 2016-17, the share of container cargo in overall volumes of the company improved from 32 per cent to 37 per cent. While that of crude remained constant at 13 per cent, that of coal fell from 42 per cent to 36 per cent.
The company expects the cargo mix to move in favour of containers in 2017-18 with its volume share increasing to 39 per cent, while that of coal falling to 34 per cent.
To drive growth, the company is increasingly looking at expansion and diversification of port handling capabilities. At Vizhinjam, it is tapping the one million-plus TEUs of Indian cargo transhipped through foreign ports such as Colombo. Moreover, the proximity of the company’s ports to coastal economic zones proposed under the Sagarmala project is expected to boost its cargo volumes. Last year, it bought Abbot Point Bulkcoal (Australia) with plans to ship coal to power plants in India, including to its group company Adani Power.
By 2021, the management plans to achieve 330 mmt in volumes — with target volume growth 50 per cent more than that of the industry. In 2017-18, the management expects to keep the momentum going by growing its cargo volumes by 12-14 per cent, largely led by Hazira, Dhamra and Kattupalli.
The company is looking for expansion into the States of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka. It is also seeking strategic opportunities in South East Asia, East Africa, West Asia and Bangladesh. As part of its diversification plans, it plans to add LPG and LNG terminals at Mundra (in 2017-18) and at Dhamra (in 2018-19).
APSEZ bought Dhamra port in 2014 and managed to turnaround its operations in 2015-16. Some of its ports have best-in class operational metrics. For instance, the average turnaround time in Mundra port is 1.4 days as against four days for major ports in Western India. Also, the average pre-berthing time was 0.3 days for Mundra as against 1.6 days for major ports in Western India.
The company’s revenue was up 19 per cent to ₹8,439 crore in 2016-17 as compared to the previous year. . The company’s profit was up 37 per cent to ₹3,901 crore in 2016-17, and the annual average growth was 28 per cent over the last five years.
During 2016-17, operating margin increased from about 64 per cent to about 68 per cent, aided by forex gains and containerisation of cargo. The debt-to-equity ratio was 1.2 times as of March 2017. With increasing cash flows, the management plans to reduce debt in the coming years.

44,2018-01-12,Adani,"APSEZ: Investors make merry on ratings upgrade from Moody’s
Investors reacted positively to the news of global rating agency Moody’s upgradation of Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone (APSEZ), to ‘stable’ from ‘negative’. On Monday, the shares of Adani Ports & SEZ closed 3.05 per cent higher at ₹373.70, on the BSE. Intraday, the stock hit the 52-week high of ₹375.70.
APSEZ informed that Moody’s reaffirmed its investment grade rating of ‘BAA 3’ for APSEZ, thereby upgrading the outlook about the port operator to ‘stable’.
Last week, another global ratings agency Standard and Poor’s had revised the outlook on APSEZ from ‘negative’ to ‘stable’ on expectations of improved operating performance supported by healthy revenue growth. The company’s credit profile was earlier clouded by the related-party loan burden, the agencies noted.
Going forward, in the next 12-18 months, Moody’s expects APSEZ to continue focusing on re-balancing of volume mix towards higher container shipments, and maintaining a financial leverage that supports its Baa3 rating, including funds from operations (FFO)/debt staying above 15 per cent.
“The change in APSEZ’s ratings outlook to ‘stable’ reflects the stabilisation in the company’s operating performance and a decline in its financial leverage,” says Abhishek Tyagi, a Moody’s Vice President and Senior Analyst.
“The weakened operating performance and financial metrics were key drivers behind the previous negative outlook,” Tyagi said, adding that APSEZ undertook several initiatives to address the challenges.
On the stock movement, Sacchitanand Uttekar - AVP - Technical (Equity), Tradebulls, said, “Adani Ports has finally managed to sustain above its March 2015 levels. The stock was one of the favourites during the upmove which commenced in September 2013, followed by the correction in the benchmark index. On the weekly scale, it has maintained its series of bullish structures well since the recovery period of February 2016 and is yet to enter the overbought territory.”
“We expect the stock to maintain its bullish sequence and a sustained monthly close above ₹356 would activate and validate the ‘V’ pattern breakout, which could unfold long-term targets beyond ₹520,” said Uttekar.
Adani owns and operates eight ports and terminal locations in Gujarat, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. Its Mundra Port in Gujarat is the largest port in India."
45,2018-01-12,Adani,"Fitch rates Adani Ports’ proposed US dollar notes as BBB-(EXP)


adani_2839573f




adani_2839573f


Fitch Ratings has assigned Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone’s proposed senior unsecured US dollar notes an expected rating of ‘BBB-(EXP)’.
The agency expects the proceeds to be primarily used for refinancing the company’s outstanding debt and capital expenditure. “The notes are rated at the same level as APSEZ’s senior unsecured debt rating as they will constitute direct, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of APSEZ. The final rating is contingent on the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received,” Fitch Ratings said in a statement.
The rating of ‘BBB’ denotes capacity for repayment as adequate, but adverse conditions are more likely to affect the same. The agency said it continues to see APSEZ as being well-positioned to benefit from India’s growth and related cargo opportunities.
The company has significantly better flexibility in infrastructure renewal and expansion capex than some other rated peers in the region, which gives it the ability to generate strong free cash flows. “The main risk to the rating is the management’s commitment to contain outflows in terms of capex, M&A and advances,” the statement said.
The management recovered all of the Rs 35 billion of related-party loans, advances and deposits outstanding in 2016-17, it said, adding that the terms of the proposed US dollar notes also limit any related-party transactions to the company’s normal course of business. “The stable outlook on the rating reflects the management’s commitment to contain outflows. Failure to maintain investment discipline may lead to negative rating action,” it cautioned.
APSEZ owns and operates 10 ports across the Indian coast line. Its largest port, Mundra, accounted for around 58 per cent of revenue and 62 per cent of cash operating profits in 2016-17 and is the largest port in India by cargo volumes handled.
Fitch expects consolidated cargo volumes to increase at a CAGR of 14 per cent over FY17-20. “This will follow growth of 11 per cent in 2016-17, up from 5 per cent in 2015-16, when growth was reined in by the 8 per cent decline in coal volumes,” it said."
33,2018-01-18,Adani,"Adani Ports Q3 consolidated net up 19.5% at Rs 1,001 cr
Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) today reported a 19.51 per cent jump in its consolidated profit at Rs 1,001 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2017.
The logistics arm of Adani Group had clocked a consolidated profit of Rs 837.58 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal, it said in a BSE filing.
“Consolidated income from operations increased by 22 per cent to Rs 2,689 crore in Q3 FY18 from Rs 2,209 crore in Q3 FY17. Consolidated operating EBITDA increased by 46 per cent to Rs 1,967 crore in Q3 FY18 from Rs 1,344 crore in Q3 FY17,” the company said in a statement.
Its consolidated expenses decreased to Rs 1,330.86 crore in the October-December quarter as against Rs 1,460.67 crore in the year-ago period.
Karan Adani, chief executive and whole-time director of APSEZ, said, “Cargo Volumes growth in Q3 FY18 rebounded after a tepid Q2 FY18. This growth was led by an all-round double digit growth in all major cargo that we handle. We foresee continued uptick in cargo volumes in India.”
Adani said while western ports in India will continue to grow, the company is confident of exponential cargo volume growth in eastern and southern coasts of India.
“We would continue to increase our footprints in the logistics space. This will further improve our port to hinterland connectivity. We would thus aim to become a truly fully integrated player providing end-to-end service to our customers. We are progressing towards achieving an operating income of Rs 10,000 crore in FY18 which will be another milestone in the history of APSEZ ltd,” he said.
About the operational highlights during the quarter, the company said, APSEZ handled Cargo of 47.61 MT with a growth of 16 per cent.
While container volumes grew by 29 per cent, coal volumes rose by 13 per cent and crude volumes by 10 per cent, it said.
""The Larger ports continue to register growth in overall cargo volumes. Mundra, the largest port of APSEZ grew by 17 per cent, Hazira grew by 9 per cent and Kattupalli grew by 45 per cent. Cargo growth in Q3 FY18 was 11 per cent higher than Q2FY18,” the company said.
Shares of the company closed at Rs 414.35, down 4.32 per cent from the previous close on BSE."
31,2018-04-07,Adani,"Adani’s Dhamra port and Olive Ridley turtles - growing together 


Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone opened the second phase of Dhamra port, which it acquired from Larsen & Toubro Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd in 2014, raising the capacity four-fold to over 100 mt from the existing 25 mt.




Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone opened the second phase of Dhamra port, which it acquired from Larsen & Toubro Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd in 2014, raising the capacity four-fold to over 100 mt from the existing 25 mt.


 Gautam Adani, owner of the Ahmedabad-based energy, logistics and resources conglomerate Adani Group, is priming up Dhamra port in Orissa’s Bhadrak district to handle 315 million tonnes (mt) of cargo a year and convert it into India’s biggest port by capacity as part of a new vision to build 500 mt of port capacity by 2025.
On Saturday, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) opened the second phase of Dhamra port, which it acquired from Larsen & Toubro Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd in 2014, raising the capacity four-fold to over 100 mt from the existing 25 mt.
The capacity expansion at Dhamra, located between Haldia and Paradip ports, will hasten the Group’s earlier vision to build 200-mt of port capacity by 2020 and put it on course to reach the 500-mt new plan.
Rise in Olive Ridley turtles
Dhamra’s expansion coincided with the rise in the number of Olive Ridley turtles that swim to the shores near the port every year to nest and lay eggs, demonstrating that a modern port can co-exist without destroying the habitat of a species whose population is rapidly depleting due to fewer nesting sites around the globe.
So, what turned the tide for both Dhamra and the endangered turtles?
APSEZ, India’s biggest private port operator with ten ports/terminals, used new technology to drive up the number of turtles, making drastic changes to the port such as reducing the intensity of lights and changing their angle to prevent baby turtles from getting disoriented, installed deflectors on dredgers to ensure turtles don’t get stuck in pipes, changing the ship’s passage to avoid obstructing turtle nesting route and round-the-clock monitoring to detect turtles in advance.
Safe nesting of Olive Ridley turtles
Dhamra Port Co Ltd also partnered with the International Union for Conservation of Nature to guarantee safe nesting of Olive Ridley turtles. In March this year, the turtle nesting figures was estimated at an all-time high of 6,84,000.
“It just goes to show that instead of conflict, we can co-exist,” said an environment expert.
After buying Dhamra, APSEZ re-worked the port’s master plan that now seeks to construct 35 berths with a capacity to handle a mammoth 315 mt of cargo compared with 13 berths and 100 mt as per the initial plan.
“This will transform Dhamra port to not just the largest port and port-based industrial cluster in India but also an anchor port and gateway for Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar and the entire geopolitical region, including the ASEAN region, thereby stimulating the growth of trade and industry of Odisha and India,” Gautam Adani said at the opening of the expanded port on Saturday.
""Mundra port is our jewel in the crown and now we wish to make Dhamra the most shining diamond in this crown,"" APSEZ CEO Karan Adani said.
APSEZ turned around the operations of Dhamra and made the port profitable within the first 12 months of taking over and subsequently built two new berths to add 20 mt capacity. 
“Our expertise in operations has been proved in our ability to increase cargo handling at Dhamra by more than 50 per cent in less than three years,” Gautam Adani said.
APSEZ has constructed a barge berth complex at Dhamra to help movement of coal through National Waterway 1 and 5. 
""Given Dhamra’s strategic location, this will be a game changer in transportation of coal across the Brahamani river from the Talcher region to Dhamra and also to thermal power plants at Farakka and Kahalgaon. It will facilitate coastal movement of coal along the entire Indian shore line. This will be the best showcase for the Government’s plan on national waterways and Sagarmala for decongesting rail and road traffic,” he added.
APSEZ has also started work on constructing a 5-mt LNG terminal and a 2.5-mt LPG terminal at Dhamra with an investment of Rs 7,500 crore."
32,2018-04-08,Adani,"Adani Ports inaugurates Dhamra Port 2nd phase expansion 


The Phase II expansion will not only make Dhamra the country’s largest port but also serve as India’s major gateway for trade with the South East Asian nations,




The Phase II expansion will not only make Dhamra the country’s largest port but also serve as India’s major gateway for trade with the South East Asian nations,


 Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ), India’s largest port developer and a part of the $12-billion Adani Group, on Saturday inaugurated the Phase II expansion of Dhamra Port in Odisha.
The inauguration ceremony took place in the presence of Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani, among others, a company official said here.
The Phase II expansion will not only make Dhamra the country’s largest port but also serve as India’s major gateway for trade with the South East Asian nations, Adani said, while addressing the gathering.
Karan Adani, CEO, APSEZ, said the Phase II expansion was completed way before schedule. It will help achieve the company’s Vision 2020 of handling 200 million tonnes (mt), well ahead of time. “We now aim to touch 500 mt by the year 2025.”
The Phase II expansion of Dhamra Port will increase the cargo handling capacity of the port to over 100 mtpa, up from 25 mtpa at present. The company deployed more than 3,000 manpower with around 88 per cent locals employed for the Phase II expansion.
The port is located at 215 km from Bhubaneswar and is situated between Haldia in West Bengal and Paradip in Odisha. It serves as a gateway to Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar and the entire geopolitical region, including the ASEAN region.
The Adani Foundation has also set up an Adani-DAV Public School at Kumamara in Bhadrak district in Odisha, providing free education to over 340 students up to Class IX at present. It will also set up Adani Skill Development Centre (ASDC) at Dhamra to impart skills to the youth.
APSEZ operates ports in Mundra, Hazira, Tuna-Tekra (Kandla) and Dahej in Gujarat, Dhamra in Odisha, and Katupalli and Ennore in Tamil Nadu. It also operates specialised coal-handling facilities at Mormugao in Goa andVisakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. Besides, it is also setting up a container transhipment hub at Vizinjham in Kerala."
30,2018-04-17,Adani,"Adani inks pact with IOC to offer LNG re-gasification services at Dhamra 


Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone has signed a long-term agreement with Indian Oil Corporation for LNG re-gasification at Dharma.




Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone has signed a long-term agreement with Indian Oil Corporation for LNG re-gasification at Dharma.


 Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) has signed a long-term agreement with Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC) to provide liquefied natural gas (LNG) re-gasification services on a use-or-pay basis to the state-run refiner, at its upcoming LNG import terminal at Dhamra in Odisha.
As per the contract, IOC has booked 3 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) re-gasification capacity spread over 20 years. IOC plans to supply the gas to its refineries at Paradip in Odisha and Haldia in West Bengal. In fact, the terminal will play a strategic role in supplying gas to Bangladesh and Myanmar as well, said Karan Adani, CEO, APSEZ.
Foundation stone of the project was laid in July 2017 and L&T has commenced the construction. L&T has won the contract to set up tankages for gas storage. The terminal is expected to be commissioned during the second half of 2021.
The proposed Dhamra LNG import terminal is designed for an initial capacity of 5 MTPA, expandable up to 10 MTPA. Initially, it will have two full containment type tanks of 180,000 cubic meters capacity each. It will be the first of its kind in India and second LNG terminal on the east coast after IOC’s Ennore terminal in Tamil Nadu.
It will have a jetty capable of handling a wide range of LNG supply vessels, including the largest Q-max fleet fromQatar. The terminal will be capable of reloading LNG to service proximate markets via the marine route and will also have truck loading gantries to help grow the nascent LNG-by-truck market."

“Growth with sustainability is our mantra,” says Karan Adani, CEO of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ), India’s biggest private port operator. In his first interview after taking over as the CEO in December 2015, Karan spoke on various aspects of the ports and logistics business of the Ahmedabad-based conglomerate. Excerpts:
It’s been two-and-half years since you took over as CEO of APSEZ. How is it going?
We were focussed on coal 3-4 years ago. But over time, we have shifted focus to containers. Coal has been significant, but containers have been the growth drivers. When you consider the last three investments we’ve made at Kattupalli, Kamarajar and Vizhinjam, they have been on the basis of containers. Five years from now, containers will form the most significant component of our business. To mitigate risks, we are also focussing a lot on gas now. With global awareness about climate change and pollution, India and the world will rely on gas for clean energy. I’m certain that LNG and LPG will be the future. Although India is committed to international agreements, our country lacks the right infrastructure at the moment. So, at APSEZ, we are creating an enabling infrastructure in anticipation of this future growth driver.
What are the specific initiatives in that direction?
We are taking a position on LPG and LNG terminals both at Mundra and Dhamra ports. Our LPG terminal in Mundra will be ready by December and once commissioned, it will be the largest terminal in the country. Phase-I will be 1.8 MT which can be expanded to 3.2 MT. It will be the largest not only in terms of capacity, but also in terms of tank size. Historically, LPG terminals have been of 16,000 cubic metres. We are the first to come out with 24,000 cubic metres. So, our terminals can accommodate large vessels. Very Large Gas Carriers (VLGCs) can unload completely instead of discharging partially.
For the ports business, gas will be our focus. Our second focus will be on inland logistics. Our goal is to leverage the strategic advantage of our ten ports along the entire coastline of India to create a vast network of inland logistics in the country. The idea is to give an end to end logistics solution to customers using our ports. Right now, we are predominantly focussed on North India to Mundra. Now that we have increased our footprint in ports over the last four years, we want to increase that in logistics also.
So, we will be operating in ports, rail, private freight terminals and then the last mile delivery. Moreover, we will stitch all these with the right technology so that everything is seamless both operationally and commercially.
Are there any targets on these plans?
We have very ambitious targets to go from three Inland Container Depots (ICDs) to almost 20 Private Freight Terminals (PFTs) in the next four years. At the same time, we want to go from 22 trains to almost 100 trains, and from 200,000 sq. meters of warehousing to almost 5 million sq. metres.
What is the progress at Vizhinjam?
I must say it’s a tough project. We will be ready with the terminal – berths, equipment et al. But the biggest challenge we are facing now is rock supply. The state government has been very supportive. They have taken measures in the last six months to ease up rock supply and to open and auction new mines. But because of cyclone Oki, the project suffered some damages and losses. So, it has been delayed by about a year. But we are confident of pulling through. This is another project that we are very bullish about.
Sustainability has become a strong pillar of your overall port development? How did that come about?
Growth with sustainability is our mantra. We believe that if a site has to grow, you have to take the stakeholders along with you, whether they are fishermen, local villagers or farmers. And you can’t take them along by simply compensating them.
You have to make the effort to spend time, energy and resources in training them, improving their livelihood, creating infrastructure which is relevant and actually enhances their livelihood and enriches their future generations. 
I’m talking about establishing schools, hospitals, medical systems just for them. Or, creating water treatment plants, electrifying villages. Sometimes, they already have all of that, as in the case of Dhamra. So, you create better fishing harbours where they can dry their fishes. You build cold warehouses so they can export fish out of there. Whenever we look at any new project, we actually identify the local requirement.
We focus on three aspects — training, rural infrastructure and infrastructure that enables communities to improve their livelihood. Apart from these, we are focussing a lot on the ecology. 
Today, APSEZ is the country’s largest afforestation mangrove company. We have done more afforestation of mangroves than any other company in India. After we came to Mundra, the mangrove cover has increased by 250 hectares. We are also taking conscious steps to reduce our carbon footprint. A big part of that is clean energy. So, we have converted almost 6.5 MW out of 35 MW into renewable energy and by 2025, our target is to convert all electricity consumed at all our ports into renewable energy. That way, we will neutralise our carbon footprint.
We are also working on a zero-waste management policy for all the waste that is generated by the ports, whether it is human waste, industrial waste, or waste from handling. For example, in the case of waste water, we aim to treat it and reuse it for horticulture or on an industrial scale. In the case of plastics, we are looking into how we can convert that to manure. Our strategy to introduce the zero-waste initiative and renewable energy, and to create a bio-diversity eco-system at each of our ports will enable our local stakeholders to flourish. Our goal is to operate successfully by respecting the ecology around us. For us, sustainability is part of our culture and not just a project.
Is funding a concern for APSEZ?
No. APSEZ has zero lending from Indian banks. Everything has moved to either US dollar bonds or into foreign banks. So, for us, funding is never an issue because we are an investment grade rated company by S&P, Fitch and Moody’s. For us to go into the market and raise another $1-2 billion worth of bonds is not a problem. We can do it at any time. APSEZ has free cash flows – we have almost Rs.1,700 crore of free cash flow now. So, we actually don’t need money from the banks to fund our projects.
So, local banks have no exposure to APSEZ?
Whenever our rupee loans expired, we just repaid them; we have not refinanced them. We have consciously taken a decision not to go to Indian banks because we find that there are cheaper alternatives of raising money and dollar bonds are one of the cheapest. Our cost of borrowings today is 5-5.5 per cent. That’s one of our strengths. There is a rupee debt, but it is not from Indian banks. Everything is from foreign banks or from dollar bonds.
How is Dhamra shaping up?
When we took over Dhamra in 2014, the capacity was 25 MT. Since then, we have expanded to almost 40 MT. We have just commissioned two berths and one more is pending. By the end of this financial year, we should have almost 50 MT of capacity commissioned. Besides, we are also setting up a 5 MT LNG terminal and a 1.2 MT LPG terminal.
Apart from expanding capacity, we are also diversifying the cargo – when we took over the port, it had predominantly coking coal imports and iron ore exports. But today, we also handle agri, fertilisers and steel products. We expect to handle containers at Dhamra very soon. Diversifying cargo will further boost our growth at the port.
Anything specific on containers at Dhamra?
As part of Phase-I, we’ll do a trial from August to understand the market and assess its potential. This is likely to take 6-7 months. In the meantime, we will handle containers from existing berths. At the end of the trial period, if we find that we are likely to have sufficient container volumes, we will build a full-fledged container terminal.
Your Vizag facility was one of the rare ventures that didn’t click. What happened there?
It was a learning curve for us. We realised that we should not focus on capacity that is restricted to one commodity. Contracts are signed for 30 years, assets are built for 30 years. But a single commodity can change cycle for a number of reasons – it could be policy, environment, or simply a business cycle. So, that was our big learning from that asset – don’t get into single commodity projects.
We have two other projects at major ports – Tuna and Goa. In Goa, it’s a single commodity but it is not restricted to thermal coal. We can handle coking coal and pet coke as well. Tuna is open for all bulk commodities. In contrast, Vizag had only thermal coal. So, we couldn’t even do coking coal or pet coke.
What does this reveal?
One of the things which we need to include in our concessions at major ports is the ability for a player and the port to have some flexibility. Even if you are doing one commodity, how do you create a mechanism to make it flexible? At the end of the day, a terminal that doesn’t work is a loss for us as APSEZ, but a bigger loss for Vizag port and the government because you have built capacity which cannot be used productively. We must remember, these are national assets. I believe there should be a mechanism that allows flexibility in the concession so that if there is any external factor that impacts the commodity, the national asset will not be made to suffer.
With a cascading effect on banks, bad loans etc…
Exactly. If you look at all the stressed assets in major ports owned by private players which are under PPP, 90 per cent are under stress because of the inflexibility in the concession agreements. I’m not saying that you should have flexible pricing. Markets can correct themselves there. But you should have flexibility in terms of operations.
Will Bhavanapadu be able to meet your aspirations of running a port in AP?
It’s still very early to say. Yes, we have been given the LoI, but there are still many steps that the state government needs to take before they can award the concession. And even after awarding the concession, there are again a number of steps that the state government needs to take before any construction can start. For example, the state government needs to buy the land and hand it over to us, get the connectivity into the port through both rail and road and get the environment clearance. It’s too early to say when the project will start. But, I can only say that once the project is handed over to us, we will get it up and running in record time. We are bullish on that port.
The port industry is puzzled by your acquisition of Kattupalli and Kamarajar facilities that are separated by a boundary wall, but have vastly different operating conditions? How do you look at it?
Our reasons for acquiring Kattupalli and Kamarajar were very different. Although L&T had already built a container terminal at Kattupalli, we saw the potential for a large multi-purpose port there. We can’t do that at Kamarajar because there is only a container terminal. So, you shouldn’t evaluate the rationale of our acquisition from just a container point of view. Through Kattupalli, we will drive not only container volumes but also coal, fertilizer and agri among others. Chennai port is unable to handle large volumes so the cargo has moved to Tuticorin or Krishnapatnam, which are in the hinterland. This was our rationale for acquiring Kattupalli.
Similarly, we took a long-term view before acquiring Kamarajar. Chennai port used to handle 1.7 million TEUs and we believe that ports within cities will lose their significance once a new port is built outside the city. A satellite port of similar capacity will have better efficiency, better infrastructure and faster turnaround time because you avoid the congestion of the city. Besides, the city itself would prefer to focus on other types of infrastructure and not just the port. 
So, when we were considering Kamarajar, we expected that the volumes from Chennai would gradually move into Kamarajar. We have taken a position for the next 10-12 years. We are not worried about 1-2 years. Historically, we have seen this play out at Mumbai and JNPT, and at Kolkata and Haldia. Even globally, we have seen that once a sister port or capacity is developed, volumes from the city port move out. So, I’m confident that Kamarajar will be equally successful. Moreover, Kamarajar has some inherent advantages that Kattupalli does not – railway line and scrap permission, for instance. So, our acquisition of both facilities had very different and equally compelling reasons.
Will the recent cabotage relaxation help Vizhinjam become a truly transhipment hub in India?
The cabotage relaxation was already announced for Vizhinjam at the time of the ground-breaking ceremony in December 2015. That was not an issue for Vizhinjam.
Do you plan to separate the logistics business from APSEZ and list it?
Not for the next ten years because it will be a build-out stage for Adani Logistics. We will be aggressively building, expanding, and creating new infrastructure and assets. Our goal is to create value for the customers of the ports – provide end-to-end logistics solutions including last mile connectivity. And this is not only for containers but also for bulk, break bulk and all commodities. So, we aren’t considering any separation for the next ten years but then again, you can never say no in business.
What is the traction in inland waterways? You recently won a dredging contract, the first for the company, in that segment.
There are three parts to inland waterways. One is dredging. We are aggressively looking at getting into every single tender of IWAI on dredging. Apart from this, we have also bid on two tenders for the India-Bangladesh protocol route. There is a huge opportunity in dredging and as a credible player with the largest fleet of dredgers in the country, we see ourselves playing a significant role as a partner to the government to make sure that their vision of seeing traffic movement on inland waterways becomes a reality.
The second part of inland waterways is setting up terminals and then doing the barge movement from the port into these terminals. That will take a little longer because we have assessed that there are two profitable routes – NW1 and 5.
For actual barge and cargo movement, there is still some infrastructure that needs to be created along the way. So, apart from setting up a terminal and dredging, you also have to increase the height of the bridges and make sure that some of the dams can accommodate the barges that need to ply. That will take time, but we are confident about NW1 and 5 stretches.
Will you be interested in bidding for DCI which is put up for privatisation?
We look at all opportunities. As and when it comes up, we will definitely look at DCI. If we find it attractive with the kind of returns that we look for and if we believe that we can turn it around, then we will consider it. For us, it’s the value of the contracts that the company can bring to the table. We already have the equipment, so we will not look at it from an equipment point of view.
Do you also give employment to locals at your project sites?
As a company, we train our communities and give them the opportunity. Then it’s up to the local people to decide if they want to work with us. If they want to work in the port, power plant or the edible oil refinery, we create the ecosystem for them. At Vizhinjam, the locals do not wish to work in construction, no matter how much training we give them. So, the most important step is to identify the aspirations of the people and create a training program to suit their needs. Moreover, we are not the only employer at our ports. A hundred other companies have created their own ecosystems there. So, we consider the complete picture and train the communities in such a way that they are empowered to join us or any of these other companies or even start their own business to create an ecosystem of their own.
How different is Adani Foundation from other such foundations set up by corporates?
The scope of Adani Foundation is defined on our three verticals of sustainability.
One is education across schools from KG to standard 12, plus running medical schools and tying up with some of the other foundations, which may not be related to our projects but would still benefit communities. One of the new tie-ups that we have done is with the KISS Foundation, based in Bhubaneshwar. The Foundation focuses on providing free education exclusively to tribal students. Nearly 1 lakh students benefit from this initiative. Recognizing the demand, KISS Foundation wanted to create one more institute at another location in Orissa. We have teamed up for this new institute even though it is not related to our Dhamra port or the mining activity. We still believe that it is a great initiative.
Apart from this, we run schools that provide free education to communities. Adani Vidya Mandir educates students whose families earn less than Rs. 1 lakh a year. Here, we not only waive tuition fee but also provide free conveyance to and from the school, free uniform, books and extra-curricular activities. It is free education end-to-end, in the truest sense because we believe that education is one of the best ways to empower society and to give back to our communities.
The second vertical that our Foundation focuses on is healthcare. We run mobile healthcare units and a hospital in Bhuj. More importantly, our strategy is to identify the predominant illnesses in a region and conduct targeted programs so that it is of maximum use to the communities. For instance, people in the Kutch region suffer from kidney stones because of the salty water. So, we ran a targeted program to treat kidney stone patients from all over the region free of cost. Irrespective of the age of the patient, we covered all costs including surgeries and medicines. These are the kinds of unique healthcare programs that we run, apart from regular clinics and hospitals.
The third vertical is rural infrastructure. We identify the needs of the people and provide the right kind of infrastructure to suit their requirements. For instance, we aim to empower farmers through technology such as drip irrigation technology. For fisherman, our focus is to train them and provide them the right ports and equipment so that they catch more fish with more efficiency. Recently, we started a new initiative for water conservation. To begin with, we will be creating a program to identify ways of raising the water table in the Kutch region."
26,2018-07-27,Adani,"Adani Ports inks pact with GAIL
 Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ), leading port infrastructure developer and part of the Adani Group, on Thursday, said it has signed a long-term agreement with state-run GAIL (India) Ltd to provide Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) regasification services on a use-or-pay basis, at its upcoming LNG import terminal at Dhamra in Odisha.
As per the contract, GAIL India has booked 1.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) regasification capacity for a period of 20 years. GAIL plans to supply gas to its customers in the eastern region and along the Jagdishpur–Haldia gas grid, which is under-development.
This project is now close to being fully subscribed and will play a pioneering role in powering eastern India towards a economical gas-based future. It will also become a hub for supply to Bangladesh and Myanmar, said Karan Adani, CEO, APSEZ, in a statement.
The 5 MTPA Dhamra LNG terminal now has a capacity subscription of 4.5 MTPA. It will be commissioned in 2021. The foundation stone of the project was laid in July 2017 and construction was commenced by Larsen & Toubro, which won the contract to set up the tankages for gas storage, and by CTCI Corporation, a Taiwanese firm, that has won the contract for the regasification package.
The proposed Dhamra LNG import terminal is designed for an initial capacity of 5 MTPA, expandable up to 10 MTPA. Initially, it will have two full containment type tanks of 180,000 cubic metres capacity each. It will be first of its kind in India and second LNG terminal on the east coast after IOC’s Ennore terminal in Tamil Nadu.
It will have a jetty capable of handling a wide range of LNG supply vessels, including the largest Q-max fleet from Qatar. The terminal will be capable of reloading LNG to service proximate markets via the marine route and will also have truck loading gantries to help grow the nascent but exciting LNG by the truck market.
APSEZ has 10 ports and terminals on both the western and eastern coastline of India at Mundra, Dahej, Kandla and Hazira in Gujarat, Dhamra in Odisha, Mormugao in Goa, Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh and Kattupalli and Ennore in Chennai, representing 24 per cent of India’s total port capacity. The company is currently developing a tran-shipment port at Vizhinjam, Kerala."

The partnership has set a target of developing various regasification terminals, including Dhamra LNG, on the east coast of India.




The partnership has set a target of developing various regasification terminals, including Dhamra LNG, on the east coast of India.


French energy giant Total S A and Adani Group will jointly develop liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification terminals at Dhamra in Odisha and fuel the retail network of 1,500 service stations over 10 years.
Both the companies have signed an agreement, but terms of the deal were not disclosed. Total is the world’s second largest LNG private player.
The partnership has set a target of developing various regasification terminals, including Dhamra LNG, on the east coast of India. Most essentially it would be a big stride towards India’s vision of achieving a healthier energy mix through promotion of LNG.
Total and Adani will create a joint venture to build a retail network of 1,500 service stations over a period of 10 years, on the main roads of the country, such as highways and intercity connections. The joint venture will strive to take advantage of a market growing at 4 per cent per year driven by the development of road infrastructure and the emergence of middle class. 
The planned service stations, in line with international standards, will offer Indian customers Total’s full line-up of fuels, lubricants, as well as a broad range of other products and services.
Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO, Total, said: “India’s energy consumption will grow fastest among all major economies in the world over the next decade. The partnership between Total and the Adani Group illustrates our joint commitment to assisting India to diversify its energy mix and to ensure a supply of reliable, affordable and clean energy to consumers. We are thrilled to build this broad partnership with the Adani Group, benefiting from its in-depth knowledge of the Indian infrastructure and energy market, as well as its access to infrastructure through a significant footprint in several of the country’s key ports.”"

Adani Ports' total income declined marginally to Rs 2,922.32 crore (including other income of Rs 314.31 crore) from Rs 2,962.12 crore a year earlier.


Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd’s (APSEZ) net profit fell 38.10 per cent to Rs 614.23 crore in the July-September quarter of this fiscal against Rs 992.37 crore in the second quarter of FY18 as the company booked a higher mark to market loss on its foreign currency loans owing to weak rupee.
The country’s biggest private port operating firm’s total income declined marginally to Rs 2,922.32 crore (including other income of Rs 314.31 crore) from Rs 2,962.12 crore a year earlier. 
“Rupee depreciated 5 per cent in Q1FY19 and 6 per cent in Q2FY19. Thus, we have provided a mark to market loss of Rs 953 crore in H1FY19 compared to a mark to market loss of Rs 47 crore in H1FY18 on our foreign currency loans. This has resulted in lower profit before tax and profit after tax,’’ the company said in a statement.
The financial performance overshadowed a strong operational performance in which APSEZ had handled over 100 million tonnes (mt) of cargo – first since it started operations - across ten ports/terminals during the first half of FY19. Cargo volumes grew 22 per cent in the second quarter and 15 per cent in the first half of this fiscal.
Mundra – the flagship port of APSEZ - posted 12 per cent growth in H1FY19, Hazira 23 per cent, Dahej 36 per cent, Tuna 68 per cent and Kattupalli 22 per cent.
APSEZ did not earn any revenue from SEZ port-led development in H1FY19 compared with Rs 1,165 crore in H1FY18. “If we exclude SEZ port-led development revenue earned in H1FY18, consolidated revenue has grown by 17 per cent in H1FY19 to Rs 5,019 crore from Rs 4,286 crore in H1FY18.
“Amid fears of trade war and its impact on Indian cargo, we have been able to achieve a record cargo throughput of 100 mt in H1FY19. Our string of ports across the coastline of India, strategy to diversify cargo and ensure that all our ports handle all types of cargo have helped us achieve this milestone,” Karan Adani, Chief Executive Officer of APSEZ, said.
“By its sheer nature, Indian economy will continue to grow in spite of the recent rupee depreciation and oil price hike shocks to the economy. We do not foresee any impact on Indian imports and exports. We are truly on course towards achieving 200 mt of cargo volume in FY19,” he added."
21,2018-10-26,Adani,"Adani eyes investments in Bangladesh ports
 Adani Group, India's largest private port operator, is eyeing investments in Bangladesh ports through private-partnership, according to senior executives.
It is exploring possibilities to invest in Chittagong Port's proposed Bay Terminal, a deep terminal proposed to be developed near the port. Asian Development Bank is considering funding the terminal, which is expected to handle coal. This terminal is also on the top priority of Bangladesh government's infrastructure roadmap.
Bangladesh is expanding its congested Chittagong Port. It is inviting private investment through public-private-partnership to further develop the port infrastructure. On Thursday, an Adani Group executive expressed interest in making an investment in the concerned terminal before visiting Bangladesh shipping and trade delegation. The delegation was here for a Secretary level talks between India and Bangladesh. However, questions sent to the company remained unanswered.
Adani Group's port arm – APSEZ – has invested in several terminals in India along east coast including Dhamra, Ennore and Katupalli. It has investments in ports, power, energy and real estate and is also present in Haldia, West Bengal. It also has an edible oil refining facility through Adani Wilmar. Incidentally, APSEZ is also coming up with an LNG import terminal at Dhamra port in Odisha, for which has signed a long-term agreement with Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC).
The proposed LNG terminal will play a strategic role in supplying gas to Bangladesh and Myanmar as well, Karan Adani,CEO, Adani Port SEZ has earlier stated. As per the contract, IOC has booked 3 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) re-gasification capacity spread over 20 years. IOC plans to supply the gas to its refineries at Paradip in Odisha and Haldia in West Bengal."

 Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone said it has concluded the import and delivery of fifty US-made General Electric (GE) locomotives to Indian Railways.
All 50 locomotives were manufactured by GE Electromotive Division in the US and imported to Mundra port.
“Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) successfully concluded the import and dispatch of 50 GE Transportation locomotives from Mundra port for the Indian Railways with full customer satisfaction and ‘zero’ incident. All 50 locomotives were manufactured by GE Electromotive Division in the US and imported at Mundra port for the Indian Railways, a first for Indian shopping and logistics,” the company said in a statement.
The final locomotive was handed over to the Indian Railways at the Roza Loco Shed (UP) on November 23, 2018.
The commissioning of the locomotives was completed in the period between October 2017 and November 2018, which is a landmark record for the logistics and ports sector.
The statement said that the Mundra port has the unique distinction of handling consignments critical for development and defence of the nation.
In a short span of time, the port has played an instrumental role in logistics of wagons for various Metro projects pan-India, mining dump truck of 240 metric tonnes (MT) capacity and heavy duty air-crane (helicopter), it said.
The port is also set to receive the first batch of Boeing Chinook helicopters, which is purported to give a decisive edge to India’s defence forces in war like scenario and also during times of humanitarian crisis, as per sources.
APSEZ is India’s largest private multi-port operator and a part of the Adani Group, an integrated infrastructure corporation.
Since 1962, after the import of WDM2 ALCO locomotives for the Indian Railways, the current import of GE locomotives is the biggest import consignment in India.
The first GE locomotive was imported to Mundra and handled by Adani Port in October 2017.
“Efficiency in logistical operations is given an utmost priority at Adani Ports. Therefore, while handling the logistical operations for the Indian Railways and GE, we made sure the transportation of cargo from the vessel to its destination is seamless and without any incident,” APSEZ Chief Operating Officer Avinash Rai said 
Mundra Port is the second largest port in India in handling container cargo. In 2014 — 15, Mundra port handled 1.75 million TEUs and has the installed terminal capacity to handle 2.3 Million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) per annunm.
Adani Ports operates two terminals at Mundra - Adani Mundra Container Terminal (AMCT), which started operations in 2007, and Adani International Container Terminal (AICTPL), which was operationalised in 2013. Jointly both terminals handle 26 services, connecting India to destinations across the world.
APSEZ’s 10 strategically located ports and terminals — Mundra, Dahej, Kandla and Hazira in Gujarat, Dhamra in Odisha, Mormugao in Goa, Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, and Kattupalli and Ennore in Chennai — represent 24 per cent of the country’s total port capacity, handling vast amounts of cargo from both coastal areas and the vast hinterland. 
The company is also developing a transhipment port at Vizhinjam, Kerala."

18,2019-02-23,Adani,"Adani Logistics to buy Adani Agri Logistics for Rs 1,662 Cr


Adani Logistics Ltd, a wholly-owned unit of Mumbai-listed Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd, will buy Adani Agri Logistics Ltd in an all cash deal at an enterprise value of Rs 1,662 crore.
Adani Agri Logistics Ltd is the agri-logistics unit of Adani Enterprises Ltd and the transaction is expected to be closed by March. The acquisition is a strategic move by India’s top private port operating firm to lead the integrated logistics services market with focus on hinterland logistics, a company statement said.
Adani Agri Logistics runs storage silos and rail transportation of food grains by rail with 1.58 million metric tonnes (MMT) of fully contracted capacity comprising seven trains and 28 storage / handling infrastructure facilities across 10 states. It has long term (20-30 years) guaranteed offtake contracts on use or pay basis with 70 per cent plus EBITDA margins.
Adani Agri Logistics plans to double infrastructure capacity in the next 3 years and tap the new 12.5 MMT infrastructure market as well as opportunities such as conventional storage conversion, among others. The combined business would also benefit from leveraging significant opportunity for handling multiple commodities and transportation.
“Adani Agri Logistics is the largest agri-products logistics player with long term contracts and strong margins. This acquisition of AALL brings us one step closer towards our vision to be the leader in providing integrated logistics services in India and focus on developing hinterland logistics. It enables us to expand our total addressable market, enhance our network and create a value chain to handle all types of cargo in India,” said Karan Adani, Chief Executive Officer and Whole Time Director of APSEZ."
17,2019-02-25,Adani,"Adani Ports and SEZ falls; Adani Agri deal appears ‘expensive’, says Citi 
Shares of port infrastructure company Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Limited plunge as much 9.1 per cent in its biggest intraday per cent drop since January 28.
The company’s unit Adani Logistics approved a proposal for the acquisition of Adani Agri Logistics, Adani Agri Logistics (Dahod), Adani Agri Logistics (Darbhanga) and Adani Agri Logistics (Samastipur) from Adani Enterprises for Rs 946 crores, the company said on Saturday.
Citi has downgraded Adani Port stock to ‘neutral’ from ‘buy’, saying that the acquisition appears expensive and raised questions on capital allocation of the company. It believed that the acquisition might lead to a resurgence of investor concern around related-party transactions. Citi cut the PT to Rs 385 from Rs 500.
Jefferies said that this deal could be viewed with suspicion as Adani Ports’ intention to reward minority shareholders versus its group companies with its cash flows could likely be questioned, especially given market sentiment. However, Jefferies expects the deal to have a positive impact in three to five years, especially on refinancing, keeps PT of Rs 425 and “buy” rating.
Nearly 45 lakh shares change hands compared with the 30-day average of more than 52 lakh shares.

Gautam Adani’s infrastructure conglomerate Adani Group has entered the airports business by emerging the highest bidder for five of the six non-metro airports being privatised by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government.
Adani Enterprises Ltd bid aggressively to claim the top slot for the five airports, quoting a per-passenger (domestic) fee of ₹177 for the Ahmedabad airport, where the Group is based, ₹174 for Jaipur, ₹171 for Lucknow, ₹168 for Thiruvananthapuram and ₹115 for Mangaluru.
The bids for all the five airports — currently run by the Airports Authority of India — were opened on Monday. The AAI did not open the bid for the Guwahati airport in view of a stay granted by the Guwahati High Court against the privatisation process, at least two people briefed on the bid said, asking not to be named.
AAI had sought bids for the operation and management of existing airport assets as well as their upgradation and development of additional air-side terminals, city-side and land-side infrastructure for 50 years for Ahmedabad, Guwahati, Jaipur, Lucknow, Mangaluru and Thiruvananthapuram airports.
The winning bid is decided on the basis of the highest per-passenger fee that the concessionaire will pay to the AAI monthly on a 50-year contract.
Notwithstanding the aggressive bidding by Adani it was a “closely contested” auction as the price difference between the highest and the second highest bidders in four of the five airports was “only between 10 per cent and 15 per cent”, said Jagannarayan Padmanabhan, director and practice leader, transport and logistics, at Crisil Infrastructure Advisory.
AAI will earn 525-575 crore per year based on the rate quoted by Adani Enterprises, which will escalate based on the traffic growth. Besides, the rate for international passengers will be twice the rate quoted for domestic passengers.
All the five airports where Adani Enterprises has emerged the highest bidder have seen a jump in domestic and international passenger movements in the last nine months. For instance, Thiruvananthapuram airport reported 4.7 per cent growth in international passenger movements between April-December 2018 compared to the previous year. The airport also registered a 6.2 per cent jump in domestic traffic movement in April December 2018 from a year ago.
Asked whether the aggressive bids by Adani would lead to an increase in fares and charges at these five airports, AAI officials said this is something airport watchdog  Airports Economic Regulatory Authority will have to look at. AAI, however, claimed that the per-passenger fee being charged for the five airports is more transparent than the gross revenue-share model followed at other airports as “the footprint of each passenger to be charged can be mapped”.
“This will ensure fair play,” a top AAI official told BusinessLine.
He said that the issue of monopoly arising by one entity winning the bid for the five airports was not part of the tender documents."
15,2019-03-04,Adani,"Adani Ports to pump ₹53,000 cr to expand capacity of Kattupalli port 
 
Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ), India’s biggest private port operator, plans to invest as much as ₹53,031 crore to ramp up capacity of Kattupalli port located in Tamil Nadu’s Tiruvallur district to 320 million tonnes (mt).
The port currently has a capacity to handle 24.65 mt of cargo.
In June 2018, APSEZ acquired Kattupalli port from Larsen & Toubro Ltd for Rs 1,950 crore.
Kattupalli currently has approval for constructing five berths with total quay length of 1,900 metres, according to the original master plan. Of this, two berths are operational while the third is under construction.
APSEZ plans to build 9,567 metres of additional quay length besides another 1,250 metres of quay for barge berths and 12 port craft facilities in phases. It has filed a revised master plan with the Ministry of environment, forest and climate change to begin the approval process. BusinessLine has reviewed a copy.
The total quay length of berth proposed as a part of the revised master plan development will be 11,467 metres in addition to 1250 m long barge berths and two single point moorings or SPM’s.
This is the second revised master plan to be filed by Marine Infrastructure Developer Private Limited (MIDPL), 97 per cent owned by Adani Kattupalli Port Pvt Ltd, in less than a year to start the environment and coastal regulation zone (CRZ) approval process for the expansion of Kattupalli.
In July 2018, MIDPL had filed papers to seek approval for expansion of Kattupalli’s capacity to 259 mt.
The expansion will help APSEZ transform into a multi-commodity port for handling cargo such as liquid, bulk, break-bulk, project cargo, dry cargo, general cargo, containers, ro-ro, automobile and other non-hazardous cargoes such as liquid, gas and cryogenic cargo. Depending on the business requirements, LNG will also be handled through FSRU and LPG will be handed through FSO, in addition to land-based terminal, according to the revised master plan development.
APSEZ also plan to develop port back-up industries and industrial development area and its associated infrastructure, based on business requirement.
The revised master plan development of Kattupalli Port will be carried out in total area of 2,472.85 ha which includes 133.50 ha of existing area, 761.8 Ha of government land, 781.4 ha of private land and proposed sea reclamation of 796.15 ha.
The planned expansion will also make Kattupalli India’s deepest port with an average berth depth of as much as 25 metres.
Apart from existing breakwater, two new breakwaters of about total 12.10 km length is proposed, of which the new Northern breakwaters will be about 9.02 and 1.22 kms and the new Southern breakwater will be about 1.86 kms.
 For easy evacuation of cargo, a new rail, road and utility corridor is also proposed within the existing port boundary. This rail line will connect Kattupalli port with nearby southern rail link at Ennore Rail-yard and proposed Northern Rail Link at L&T spur location. Parallel to the revised master plan development to cater to immediate cargo evacuation requirement, connection to southern rail link is being taken up and separate CRZ clearances are in progress.
When fully operational, Kattupalli will provide direct employment to about 1,500 persons, thereby opening up employment opportunities for the youth in the catchment region. Additionally, the induced development due to port expansion will generate indirect employment for about 4,500 people.
Currently, Kattupalli handles only containers from two berths with quay length of 710 meters, 6 quay cranes, 15 rubber-tyred gantry cranes, 5120 ground slots with the capacity to handle 1.2 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) per annum."

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) said its portfolio of eight ports/terminals across India handled a combined 200 million tonnes (mt) of cargo during the current fiscal. The private port operator said in a statement it has set a target of doubling the cargo handling to 400 mt by 2025.
In comparison, the 12 ports run by the Central government handled a combined 634 mt of cargo between April 2018 and February 2019.
Karan Adani, Chief Executive Office (CEO), APSEZ, said, ""Our projections were to reach this milestone by 2020 but we could achieve it ahead of schedule courtesy the tech-driven operational efficiency and enhanced asset utilisation. Robust capacity addition at our leading ports such as Dhamra and Mundra as well as deepening presence closer the hinterland with new facilities such as Ennore and Kattupalli played a critical role in this journey.""
He further added that the focus on adding value as an integrated logistics player and coastal shipping of coal further bolstered the process. 
Collectively the company has generated over 100,000 jobs, educated over 25,000 students and touched over 200,000 lives, a statement said here.
Fleet and fuel management, asset monitoring, digitalisation of processes, mobility, operational intelligence and performance monitoring of the applications - the journey that began around a year ago has begun reaping benefits, it added.
""The focus for the immediate future is to reduce the turnaround time, drive up volumes without adding resources and increase in-transit visibility utilisation by eliminating unproductive trips among other benefits. The sweetest part of the deal is for our customers who get real-time status of operations from the comfort of their locations,"" added Adani.
Starting with the Mundra Port in Kutch, Adani Ports and SEZ made several key additions to the portfolio. Non-major ports were also developed at Hazira, Dhamra, Dahej and the latest at Kattupalli.
Terminals were developed within major ports of the country at Ennore, Kandla, Goa and Vizag from 2005 to 2018. 
The Mundra Port remains the crown jewel, but the feat of handling 200 MMT cargo has not been achieved by one port alone, the company added.
Proximity and rail/road connectivity to the vast and rich north-western hinterland, state-of-the-art modern port infrastructure and equipment, zero waiting time for ships, faster turn-around time and competitive rates contributed to this phenomenal growth of Adani Ports, it said, adding that APSEZ introduced initiatives like development of eRTGs which were unheard of till now in India.

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) plans to invest as much as Rs 57,594 crore to expand the capacity of India’s biggest commercial port it runs at Mundra in Gujarat.
APSEZ has applied for environment and coastal regulation zone (CRZ) clearances for raising the capacity of Mundra by 385 million tons (mt). Mundra currently has approval for handling 225 mt.
The proposed expansion of Mundra’s waterfront development plan (WFDP) includes extending the quay length by another 14,470 metres, augmenting back-up facilities for handling multi-purpose, liquid, gas and cryogenic cargo.
It also involves extending the eastern and western breakwater by 500 metres each in the south port and constructing a 5,000 metre-long breakwater on the eastern side of west port.It necessitates dredging of some 350 million cubic metres of sand and other materials from the sea bed.
The expansion will be undertaken within the approved area of 5,170 hectares of water front development plan, APSEZ wrote in an application filed with the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change.
“For the expansion of WFDP plan, it is important to utilize the maximum marine development potential,” APSEZ said in the application.
“Based on the future cargo projections and business requirement of the hinterland, it is proposed to develop the port with the flexibility to handle various cargoes. Type of berth and type of cargo is a commercial and business requirement. Hence, expansion plan will be developed with those flexibilities to accommodate berths and storage facilities as multi-purpose. The expansion plan will consist of berths at various locations, material handling area, cargo storage area, operational and utility area, internal connectivity, drainage, greenbelt and various utilities, amenities and bunkering facilities,” the company said.
Mundra is the flagship port of APSEZ, which runs nine ports and terminals on India’s eastern and western coasts accounting for 24 per cent of the country’s port capacity. APSEZ ports handled a combined cargo of more than 200 mt in the year to March 2019."

Moody’s expects Adani’s performance to be driven by capacity addition relating to its recently commissioned ports and terminals


 Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone (SEZ) is tapping the international debt market to raise up to $1 billion to fund its capex plans and also to retire some of its debt, according to merchant banking sources.
The proposed issue has a ‘Baa3’ rating from the global ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service.
“Adani Ports is doing a United States (US) dollar issue soon and will be raising $ 750 million to $ 1 billion,” merchant banking sources said but refused to share more details like the tenure of the debt or the likely pricing.
The Gautam Adani-run company and is the flagship entity of the Adani group, will use the proceeds for capital expenditure, refinancing a part of the existing debt and other permissible uses under the external commercial borrowings guidelines, the source said.
The rating reflects the company’s market position as the country’s largest port developer and operator by volume, and the strength of its Mundra Port concession, Moody’s said in the rating note.
The Baa3 rating is also predicated on the company continuing to execute its various projects within time and cost budgets, while adhering to regulatory approval processes to minimize the risk of future difficulties. The agency also given a stable outlook on the rating.
“The bonds will represent a senior unsecured obligation and will rank equally with all of Adani Ports’ existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness,” the agency said.
The agency said given the ranking of the bonds is pari pasu to all of the company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt, while the rating of these bonds follow that of its existing senior unsecured bonds issued in 2015 and 2017, respectively.
Adani Ports reported a 13 per cent growth in container traffic in FY19 and this traffic contributed 41 per cent of the total cargo handled by it during the fiscal year.
Moody’s expects Adani’s performance to be driven by capacity addition relating to its recently commissioned ports and terminals, and further increase in the share of containers, with the addition of new terminals.
The agency said it is unlikely to upgrade the ratings in the near term, given the business profile and financial strategy."

8,2019-07-05,Adani,"NCLT allows APSEZ and other bidders to submit revised offers for Dighi Port


 The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law tribunal (NCLT) has allowed Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) and Gannon Dunkerley & Co Ltd to submit revised bids for debt-laden Dighi Port Ltd after state-run Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) said it was not agreeable to the modifications suggested by the insolvency court to its lenders approved resolution plan.
On May 8, NCLT approved the resolution plan submitted by JNPT with certain conditions and had asked JNPT to file an affidavit conveying its acceptance or rejection of the modifications.
During a hearing on July 2, JNPT told NCLT that the modifications suggested by the Tribunal were not agreeable to it.
The changes suggested by NCLT pertained to sub-lease deeds and sub-concession agreement signed between Dighi Port Ltd and the Veritas Group for setting up a PVC plant and to finance, develop, operate and maintain a cargo berth at the port.
In its resolution plan, JNPT has sought to terminate the sub-lease deeds and sub-concession agreement signed with the Veritas Group citing that the terms and conditions were onerous and not in the long-term interests of the company. The sub-lease, according to JNPT, was “under-valued” compared to lease rentals of other similarly situated land, thereby causing loss to the corporate debtor (Dighi Port).
“ The unilateral termination of the contracts as mentioned in Chapter VII point 7, or at any other place in the resolution plan, is allowed only as per the due process of law applicable on termination of such contracts except as provided under Explanation to section 30(2) of I&B Code. This Tribunal would not allow any unilateral termination of legally binding contracts that were entered into by the Corporate Debtor before the CIRP initiation without adhering to the law applicable for termination of any such contract. The resolution applicant is directed to file an affidavit before this tribunal submitting its acceptance or rejection of the said modification in the resolution plan,” NCLT ordered on May 8.
On May 27, JNPT sought 30 days from NCLT for filing the affidavit regarding its acceptance or rejection of the modified resolution plan ordered by NCLT.
“We think it appropriate to grant 30 days for filing an affidavit, but this will be treated as the last opportunity, failing which, we will be forced to pass the liquidation order under Section 33 of IBC, 2016,” NCLT wrote in its May 27 order.
However, on July 2, NCLT changed track and allowed other bidders (excluding JNPT) in the fray to submit revised resolution plans after some of them offered to better their bids.
APSEZ – India’s biggest private port operator - had quoted Rs 1 crore more than JNPT in its resolution plan but that was rejected by the Committee of Creditors (CoC) led by Bank of India, which, instead approved the bid submitted by JNPT on February 1.
JNPT said it was still in the reckoning for Dighi Port as it has merely told NCLT that “it was not in favour of modifying its resolution plan and had not withdrawn it completely”.
Port industry executives said that liquidation of a port will not benefit potential buyers of individual assets as berths and other facilities would be useless without the rights to run the port through a concession from the Maharashtra government."
7,2019-07-24,Adani,"French energy firm Total picks up 50 per cent stake in Dhamra LNG Terminal


French oil and gas giant Total SA has taken a 50 per cent stake in Dhamra LNG Terminal Pvt Ltd (DLTPL), a unit of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ), which is constructing a 12 million tonne per annum (mtpa) LNG regasification terminal at its port located at Dhamra in Odisha's Bhadrak district.
BusinessLine could not ascertain the value of the deal, the first after the New York Stock Exchange-listed French multinational and the world’s second biggest private LNG firm, announced a joint venture in October 2018 with the Adani Group to develop multi-energy offerings for the Indian market, including LNG and fuel retailing, multiple sources said.
Total could not be reached immediately for comment, while a comment from APSEZ is awaited.
The LNG terminal at Dhamra is being built with an investment of Rs 5,200 crore. APSEZ-owned Dhamra Port Co Ltd has applied to the expert appraisal committee (EAC) attached to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, to transfer the environment and coastal regulation zone clearances for the 12 mtpa terminal in favour of the LNG terminal company, according to documents reviewed by BusinessLine.
Read also: Total to acquire stake in LNG import terminals and city gas distribution projects
The LNG terminal is set to start operations by mid-2021. Apart from meeting local demand for gas, the terminal is of strategic importance for gas supply to neighbouring Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal.
The Dhamra terminal can supply Bangladesh 3-5 mtpa (Dhamra to Bangladesh is less than 300 nautical miles by sea and the distance by road to eastern Bangladesh is under 500 km).
India’s biggest oil refiner, Indian Oil Corporation, and the country’s largest natural gas firm, GAIL (India) Ltd, have separately signed long-term offtake agreements with Dhamra LNG Terminal for re-gasified LNG. 
IOC has booked 3 mtpa regasification capacity for 20 years at the Dhamra facility on a use or pay basis, helping the state-run oil refiner supply gas to its refineries in Paradip, Haldia and Barauni.
GAIL India has booked 1.5 mtpa regasification capacity for 20 years on a use or pay basis. GAIL plans to supply the gas to its customers located in the eastern region and along the Jagdishpur– Haldia gas grid, which is under development.
Initially, the terminal will have two full containment type tanks of 180,000 cubic metre capacity each. 
The LNG terminal will have a 18-metre draft jetty capable of handling a wide range of LNG supply vessels, including the largest Q-max (266,000 cubic metre) fleet from Qatar, thereby optimising sea transportation. The terminal will be capable of reloading LNG to service proximate markets via the marine route and will also have truck loading gantries to help grow the nascent LNG by truck market.
India is seeking to cut its carbon emissions rate by a third by 2030, partly by boosting the use of cleaner fuels such as LNG. The shift to cleaner fuels such as LNG is also aimed at honouring India’s commitment to the Paris accord on climate change.
By expanding the use of LNG, India is also looking to change course to a gas-based economy. It is seeking to raise gas share to 15 per cent in the primary energy mix, from 6 per cent by 2022. India currently has four LNG terminals and imports around 20 mtpa LNG, which it plans to increase to 70 mtpa by 2025.
This shift has positive implications not only from a climate change point of view, but also from a fiscal stand point, given India’s huge crude import bill.
The cost advantages of LNG are such that for a 4 per cent replacement of crude imports with LNG, India will save $1 billion in foreign exchange annually.
India’s LNG imports are estimated to rise in the face of declining domestic production of gas, rendering LNG import and re-gasification terminals such as the one being constructed at Dhamra a necessity. Assuming domestic gas production at 123–138 mmscmd, India’s LNG imports is estimated to touch about 250 mmscmd or nearly 70 MTPA by 2025."

 Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) has put in an expression of interest (EoI) to develop a port at Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu at the site of the Nagarjuna Oil Refinery that is undergoing liquidation.
The planned six-million tonnes (mt) refinery includes a captive port and a power plant.
“We have put in an expression of interest for developing a port at Nagarjuna oil refinery which is undergoing liquidation. It has a port licence/concession along with the refinery, but they have not developed anything. Captive ports in Tamil Nadu are allowed to handle commercial cargo as well,” Karan Adani, Chief Executive Officer and Whole Time Director of APSEZ, said during a quarterly earnings call on Wednesday.
APSEZ, according to Karan, is qualified for one of the bids in Chittagong port in Bangladesh. It is up to the government as to when to privatise it, he added.
Karan said that APSEZ has put on hold plans to set up a mega container port on Carey Island in Selangor State, Malaysia. “We are re-evaluating it, whether to make it or not,” he said. In 2017, APSEZ had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Malaysia’s MMC Port Holdings Sdn Bhd to begin feasibility study on building a mega container port on Carey Island.
APSEZ reported a net profit of ₹1,011 crore during the June quarter, 46 per cent higher than ₹691-crore profit it posted in the first quarter of the previous year.
Revenue jumped 16 per cent to ₹2,794 crore during the quarter (₹2,411 crore), riding on the back of strong ports volume growth and logistic operations.
APSEZ handled 57 million tonnes (48 mt) of cargo across its pan-India network of ports during the quarter, clocking a growth of 18 per cent.
The cargo volumes comprised 1.5 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), with Mundra alone handling 1.18 million TEUs to register a growth of 3 per cent.
Mundra, the flagship port of APSEZ, grew by 16 per cent; Hazira by 20 per cent; Kattupalli by 16 per cent; and Dhamra by 43 per cent. Terminals at major port trusts such as Tuna, Vizag, Goa and Ennore registered a 35 per cent cargo volume growth, the company said in a statement."

 Following the intelligence inputs about a possible Pakistani terrorist infiltration from the border district of Kutch, the Director General of Police - Gujarat State has issued a high alert for Kutch.
The district houses two important commercial port establishments at Kandla and Mundra. 
On August 27, the Coast Guard had issued a directive for enhanced security, which stated that an input from reliable sources indicates that ""Pakistani commandos are likely to infiltrate into Indian territory through Kutch area including Harami Nala, Khavda or nearby creek preferably through sea route to create communal disturbance or terrorist attack in Gujarat"". 
The directive asked all the stakeholders to stay vigilant, institute preventive measures to mitigate hostile actions and ensure combat patrolling in the coastal areas. 
The Deendayal Port Trust (formerly Kandla Port Trust) on Wednesday alerted all concerned and issued advisory. ""All shipping agents are directed to inform their vessels at Kandla Outer Anchorage, berths and expected vessels, to alert and maintain terror watch. Any suspicious activity is immediately reported to nearest coast guard station.""

In a U-turn, the Committee of Creditors (CoC) led by Bank of India has backed the resolution plan placed by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) to buy the debt-laden Dighi Port Ltd under the bankruptcy and insolvency law.
The decision of the lender’s panel was conveyed by its counsel to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) during a hearing on September 19 on a batch of appeals filed by different parties.
APSEZ, India’s biggest private port operator, is now positioned to buy Dighi Port, which will allow it an entry into Maharashtra, one of the three coastal states in which it does not have a presence. The other two states are Karnataka and West Bengal.
APSEZ’s resolution will have to be ratified by the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), where the bankruptcy case involving Dighi Port is being heard since June last year.
Dighi Port owes some Rs 3,074.51 crore (including interest and penal interest) to a clutch of 16 banks led by Bank of India.
On January 31, the CoC had rejected the resolution plan submitted by APSEZ. Instead, it cleared the plan submitted by state-run Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) the next day, though its bid was lower than the one placed by APSEZ.
APSEZ had termed the lenders’ decision to reject its resolution plan as “wrongful and illegal” and had filed an appeal in NCLAT.
Gaurav Banerji, Senior Advocate representing the Committee of Creditors, told NCLAT on Thursday that it has approved the plan submitted by APSEZ with a 99.68 per cent vote. He also informed that the proposal under Section 12A of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code submitted by Vishal Vijay Kalantri (the erstwhile promoter of Dighi Port), according to an earlier order of the Tribunal, “was also considered and was not accepted”.
On May 8, NCLT had approved the resolution plan submitted by JNPT with certain conditions, and asked JNPT to file an affidavit conveying its acceptance or rejection of the modifications.
During a hearing on July 2, JNPT told NCLT that the modifications suggested by the Tribunal were “not acceptable” to it, forcing NCLT to suggest that “one more opportunity be given to all the bidders so that maximisation of value of the corporate debtor can be achieved”.
Dighi Port Ltd, the entity that runs a private port in Maharashtra’s Raigad district, was dragged into bankruptcy proceedings under the bankruptcy law last year, after NCLT ordered the start of a corporate insolvency resolution process on a petition brought by an operational creditor – DBM Geotechnics and Constructions Pvt Ltd.
Dighi Port owed some Rs 30 crore to DBM Geotechnics for constructing multi-purpose berths 1 and 2 at Dighi and berth No 3 at Agardanda, also in Maharashtra.
Dighi Port Ltd was promoted by Balaji Infra Projects Ltd and IL&FS Ltd.
Balaji Infra and IL&FS were awarded a 50-year concession by the Maharashtra government in 2002 to develop and operate a port on the banks of Rajpuri Creek in three phases. The first phase of the port, with a capacity to load 30 million tonnes of cargo (mt), has started partial operations from two multi-purpose berths that can load coal, bauxite, steel coils and containers."
2,2019-09-23,Adani,"Corporate tax cuts: Stocks that gain the most
Earnings growth for India Inc, which has been on first gear in recent times, is all set to receive a boost from lower tax outgo, with the reduced corporate tax rates. For many manufacturing companies, the savings on this front could give them room to reduce prices or improve other spends, thereby spurring demand. Many companies in sectors such as infrastructure, capital goods and FMCG stand to gain. Some others in the auto, steel, oil and gas, and real-estate segments could also get a leg-up. IT companies may be better off under the current regime though, given the lower tax incidence at present.
Most companies in the information technology space will not be enthused by the corporate tax rate cuts announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. There are two reasons. Many companies have an effective corporate tax rate below 25.17 per cent (including surcharge and cess) and they get the benefit of profit-based deductions for exporting their services from special economic zones in India.
Also, IT and software companies that build their own intellectual property get a weighted deduction under the income-tax laws on the R&D expenses that they have incurred to build their IP.
Now, such companies might have to pay minimum alternate tax (MAT) calculated on their book profits.
The Finance Minister has slashed MAT from 18.5 per cent to 15 per cent. That puts the effective tax rate, including surcharge, for companies paying MAT at 17.5 per cent compared with 21.6 per cent earlier.
This means that IT companies that get tax deductions on their export revenues earned from operating in SEZs, and pay MAT, wouldn’t want to opt out of claiming these deductions. They would also have to forego the weighted deduction on R&D that brings down the effective corporate tax rate.
Besides, if they opt for the lower effective corporate tax rate of 25.2 per cent, they will have to take a one-time charge of any MAT credit that might be in their books.
In 2018-19, out of the top-tier IT companies in the S&P BSE IT Index, only Infosys (26 per cent) had an effective tax rate of over 25 per cent at the standalone level, while TCS (21.3 per cent), HCL Technologies (23.7 per cent), Wipro (23.02 per cent) and Tech Mahindra (19.6 per cent) had effective tax rates below 25.2 per cent.
Even most mid-tier IT companies such as Mphasis (20.5 per cent), Hexaware (22.3 per cent), Mindtree (24.9 per cent), L&T Infotech (21.7 per cent) and L&T Technology Services (24.2 per cent), had effective tax rates below 25.2 per cent.
In all, IT companies won’t be rushing to opt out of their export-based tax incentives until the benefit of paying lower taxes on export revenues runs out.
With major players such as Hindustan Unilever, Nestle, Britannia, GSK Consumer and Colgate-Palmolive suffering an effective tax of 32-36 per cent, the FMCG segment could be a beneficiary of the new 25.17 per cent tax rate.
At the same time, home-grown companies such as Dabur, Jyothy Labs, Godrej Consumer, Bajaj Consumer and Marico may not choose to move to the new regime, considering that their effective tax rates are either on a par with or lower than 25.17 per cent.
Overall, for shareholders in FMCG stocks, this move could result in the 2018-19 profits of listed FMCG players, on an aggregate, inching up by 9 per cent.
However, FMCG companies can choose to retain a portion of the benefits to increase advertising spends and/or pass it on as price cuts to boost demand. In the quarter-ended June 2019, for instance, major FMCG companies clocked single-digit growth in sales due to poor volumes.
Going by the 2018-19 numbers, Hero MotoCorp, TVS Motors and Maruti Suzuki and Eicher Motors have an effective tax rate of 29-33 per cent and could benefit from the reduced rates. However, the rates of Mahindra & Mahindra and Ashok Leyland, are much lower. Taking M&M ‘s reported tax expenses (standalone) for 2018-19, the effective tax rate is only at 24.17 per cent (21.3 per cent, considering the current year's tax expense alone).
The company also has a MAT credit of ₹1,116.35 crore in its books as on March 31, 2019. Ashok Leyland’s effective tax rate, given the reported tax expense for 2018-19, is 20.6 per cent (15.14 per cent taking the current year's expense alone). The company has availed itself of benefit to the extent of ₹233 crore on tax concessions and tax holidays in 2018-19 and has MAT credit on its books.
In such cases, companies may choose to continue under the current regime till the tax holiday/concessions exist. Since MAT also continues at a reduced rate of 15 per cent, these companies can choose to pay tax as per normal rates or as per MAT, whichever is higher — as has been the case until now. MAT credit can also be set off against the tax liability in future years.
Among auto ancillaries, MNC players such as SKF India, Goodyear and Bosch that have high effective tax rates of 33-36 per cent could be major beneficiaries. Put together, listed companies in the auto and auto ancillaries space may see a 3-5 per cent addition to their profits of 2018-19, if they choose to avail themselves of the 25.17 per cent tax rate.
For infrastructure companies, the effective tax rates in FY19, after taking into account all eligible exemptions and tax holidays, work out to 27-35 per cent of their standalone PBT. For companies such as Engineers India, Ircon International, Ashoka Buildcon and RITES, availing themselves of the lower tax rate of 25.17 per cent could translate to a 14-18 per cent jump in earnings, going forward. Whereas, giants such as Larsen & Toubro and IRB Infra developers could witness only a 2 and 5 per cent rise in PAT led by tax savings.
Among the pure construction players, NCC, Welspun and Sadhbav Engg could benefit. Certain companies have effective tax rates of less than 25 per cent, which can be on account of payment of minimum alternate tax, or availing themselves of benefits of differential depreciation on fixed assets under the IT Act. The effects of the amendments announced will hence have to be evaluated on a case-to-case basis.
For instance, Dilip Buildcon has an effective tax rate of 16 per cent in FY19 on account of MAT provisions (inferred from the annual report). Hence, the lowered MAT rates could bring down its effective tax rate further, and the company would also get the existing MAT credit entitlement.
On the other hand, Adani Port and SEZ now enjoy an effective tax rate of 21 per cent, after availing itself of deductions under Section 80IAB of the Income Tax Act for 10 years, with effect from FY07-08. This apart, it has several subsidiaries and joint ventures that can get tax holiday benefits under Section 80IA.
The company is also likely to benefit from the grandfathering of taxes on buyback, as the management had made a public announcement of the share buyback of ₹1,960 crore on June 4, 2019.
Among the cement manufacturers, the effective tax rate in FY19 for most companies (on a standalone basis) is less than 25 per cent — they may refrain from foregoing their exemptions and deductions. This includes large players like Ultratech and Shree Cement. However, there could be savings in PAT in the range of 11-15 per cent for Himadri, Deccan and India Cements if they opt for the subsidised rates, as their current effective tax rate is more than 25.17 per cent.
The impact of the lower corporate tax on the steel industry is expected to be mixed, at least in the near future.
The tax incidence on companies such as Tata Steel, Kalyani Steels and Jindal Stainless Hisar in FY19 was 39 per cent, 33 per cent and 37 per cent, respectively. Note that these are the tax rates after taking into account the tax exemptions that the companies are eligible for. Thus, these companies stand to gain in a big way if they opt for the reduced tax rate of 22 per cent (25.17 per cent including surcharge and cess).
Companies such as JSW Steel and Tata Metaliks with effective tax rates of 20 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, may not opt for the reduced tax rate immediately. Meanwhile, SAIL, Jindal Steel and Uttam Galva had zero current tax for FY19. This could be either due to companies making losses in FY19 or accumulated losses from previous years, setting off the year’s profits. If the new reduced tax rate is opted, setting-off of losses will not be possible, making it unattractive. However, in the long run, when the companies turn profitable or become eligible to pay MAT, they can opt for the new tax rates, which could reduce their tax outgo.
The move to reduce corporate tax seems largely positive for real-estate companies reeling under pressure due to tight liquidity in the market. For most realty companies, the effective tax rate is higher than 25.17 per cent (including cess and surcharge), based on standalone profit before tax. For instance, for Oberoi Realty and Ashiana Housing, the current tax rate is 29 per cent, while for Kolte-Patil, it works out to around 45 per cent.
These companies, if they adopt the new corporate tax regime, could improve their earnings, even if they forego their exemptions and MAT credit.
If players pass on the benefit to home buyers, it could spur demand in the market.
But for companies such as Sunteck Realty and Prestige Estate Properties, for which the effective current year tax rates work out to less than 5 per cent, and Brigade Enterprises and Sobha with 23 per cent rate, continuing with the existing tax structure may be better.
For the oil and gas sector, the cut in corporate tax rate seems largely positive. Going by their FY19 standalone financials, the effective tax rate for most companies in the sector is higher than the 25.17 per cent rate (including surcharge and cess) that will apply to them now. For instance, in FY19, the current tax provision of city gas distributors Indraprastha Gas and Mahanagar Gas was about 31 per cent of their profit before tax.
The effective tax rate for the PSU hydrocarbon explorers, ONGC and Oil India, and gas transmitter GAIL (India) was 27-28 per cent, while it was about 29 per cent for PSU refiner HPCL. The highest tax rate — about 32 per cent — was borne by Gujarat-based gas transmitter GSPL. For the above companies, the new tax rate of 22 per cent plus surcharge of 10 per cent and cess of 4 per cent — totalling 25.17 per cent — should translate into lower tax outgo. Even if these companies have to give up some investment-based tax exemptions and credit of minimum alternate tax carried forward from earlier years, they should be better off under the new tax rate regime.
On the other hand, there are a few companies such as Reliance Industries, PSU refiners Indian Oil and BPCL, and gas importer Petronet LNG that may not benefit from the new tax rate. In FY19, the current tax provision of Reliance Industries, Indian Oil and BPCL was about 20 per cent of their profit before tax — this is lower than the new effective tax rate of 25.17 per cent.
It is the same case for Petronet LNG, which had an effective tax rate of about 24 per cent last year. For these companies, it may be worthwhile continuing with their existing tax structure, taking the benefits, if any, of investment-based tax exemptions, and carried forward MAT credit and carried forward loss.
In the case of Reliance Industries, for instance, while the applicable tax rate in FY19 was 34.94 per cent, it was able to reduce the effective rate (excluding deferred tax adjustments) to about 20 per cent, thanks to exempted income, and additional allowances net of MAT credit.
The company may likely find it more beneficial to continue with this arrangement until the tax breaks that keep the effective tax low are exhausted.
Later, it could shift to the new regime with the effective tax rate of 25.17 per cent.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman opened the liquidity tap for corporates on Friday by announcing a sharp tax cut and leaving more money in their hands for capacity expansion. The statutory tax rate for corporates has been lowered to 22 per cent from 30 per cent. This benefit, though, is only for companies that wish to give up their tax exemptions. Given that most tax incentives and exemptions have been phased out over the past few years, companies may prefer to forego the few they enjoy now, and opt to be taxed at the lower rate of 22 per cent.
New manufacturing companies incorporated after October 1, 2019, can benefit from an even lower rate of 15 per cent tax if they don’t claim the tax benefits they are eligible for. India Inc will also get relief on MAT (Minimum Alternate Tax). The Finance Minister has reduced MAT to 15 per cent from 18.5 per cent. This would benefit companies located in SEZ developers, infrastructure, cement companies, companies with units in specified locations in the North-East and exporters. There is also relief on buyback tax.
The 20 per cent tax on buybacks by corporates, which was announced in the Budget on July 5, 2019, would not apply to companies that announced them before the Budget day. According to data from nseinfobase.com, companies, including Sasken Technologies, Greaves Cotton, Welspun Corp, Star Cement and Eris Lifesciences, whose issues are on the way, but were announced before July 5, and for companies such as Infosys, which had buybacks ongoing in July, will benefit from the change. Wipro is also set to benefit as it announced its buyback on June 5.
Companies that pay corporate taxes under the new rates of 15 and 22 per cent will be charged a flat surcharge of 10 per cent, irrespective of their taxable income. The companies that choose the existing regime, availing exemptions and deductions, will have to pay a surcharge only if their total income exceeds ₹1 crore. The rates of surcharge for them will continue to be at 7 per cent and 12 per cent, for total income between ₹1 crore and ₹10 crore and more than ₹10 crore, respectively.
The stock market on Friday cheered the Finance Minister’s move to cut taxes. While companies that are currently paying lower rates due to various deductions and exemptions, such as many information technology players, are unlikely to shift to the new regime, there are many companies across sectors that are likely to see their tax incidence move lower, thus translating to higher profits. If the lower tax incidence is passed on to customers in the form of price cuts, it can help spur demand.
 








 
Ever since the late Finance Minister Arun Jaitley kick-started the process of a phased reduction in corporate tax in 2016-17 and elimination of exemptions, the effective tax rate for India Inc has only gone up.
This is because, while smaller companies were given the benefit of a lower tax rate each year, the phasing out of some tax deductions began impacting the tax outgo of larger companies.
Further, in 2015-16, the Finance Minister also increased the surcharge on corporate tax. That year, for companies with income of up to ₹10 crore, the surcharge was increased to 7 per cent from 5 per cent, and for firms with income above ₹10 crore, it was increased to 12 per cent from 10 per cent. Thus, the effective tax rate in 2017-18 came to 29.49 per cent; it was 23.22 per cent in 2013-14. This increase — evident in the numbers of the past one year — was due to larger companies coughing up more.
In 2017-18, the effective tax rate for companies making profit of more than ₹500 crore was 26.3 per cent; in 2016-17, it was 23.94 per cent. The effective tax rate for smaller companies making profit of ₹1-10 crore came down to 27.38 per cent from 29.2 per cent. So far, withdrawal of tax exemptions has made the effective tax rate of larger companies move higher. It is from here on that these companies will start benefiting.
Now, all companies that are willing to give up their tax incentives can pay taxes at a fairly lower rate of 22 per cent.
 
India is now among the countries that have a low corporate tax rate, and can compete better globally. For the current year, KPMG data show that the statutory tax rate in Myanmar is 25 per cent; in Malaysia, it is 24 per cent; 25 per cent in Indonesia and Korea and 28 per cent in Sri Lanka. Even Chinese companies cough up more — as they pay a tax of 25 per cent — and in Brazil, it is 34 per cent.
The global average corporate tax rate is 23.79 now, and the Asian average is 21.09 per cent. That said, the current move to cut taxes is going to make a hole in the government’s tax kitty. Last year, as per the Budget estimates, the revenue foregone by the Centre on various tax incentives was ₹1.08-lakh crore. Now, with tax cuts, there will be an additional revenue loss of ₹1.45-lakh crore.
 
Bond investors who have been basking in the double-digit return glory over the past year may be in for a bumpy ride ahead. While Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s corporate tax rate cut has cheered India Inc and the equity market, the move is a dampener for bond markets.
This is because the revenue loss of ₹1.45-lakh crore owing to the cut will throw the Centre’s fiscal deficit target off track. The RBI’s surplus transfer to the Centre, at best, makes up for the existing shortfall in income tax and GST collections. While higher proceeds from disinvestment and some tax buoyancy (towards the end of the fiscal), on account of the growth-boosting measures, can aid revenues, for now, the ₹1.45-lakh crore revenue loss appears to have left a big hole in the Centre’s kitty. The fiscal deficit target could well move up to 4 per cent (from the projected 3.3 per cent), implying additional borrowings.
Based on the Controller General of Accounts’ (CGA) provisional figures for FY19 (in which income tax grew by a modest 7 per cent), the estimated growth in income tax collections for FY20 works out to 23 per cent. For April-July, CGA data suggest that the growth in net income tax was just about 6 per cent. There is also a significant shortfall in GST collections.
The surplus transfer by the RBI as recommended by the Bimal Jalan Committee has offered a much-needed respite to the Centre in the current fiscal. Excluding the ₹28,000-crore interim dividend already paid by the RBI to the Centre last fiscal, the net transfer in the current financial year amounts to ₹1,48,051 crore. But while optically, the surplus transfer appears to be a massive figure, essentially, it is about ₹60,000 crore above what was estimated in the Budget. Hence, this additional bonanza can help make good the shortfall in tax revenues.
On the disinvestment front, the Centre has set a target of ₹1.05-lakh crore (above the ₹85,000 crore achieved the previous year), which may be achievable. But given that the Centre has been missing its target on spectrum, it is unlikely to meet its estimate of ₹50,500 crore for FY20.
On balance, before the corporate tax rate cut, the Centre could have still pulled off the 3.3 per cent (risk of missing GDP growth assumptions though remained). The substantial ₹1.45-lakh crore revenue foregone on account of the corporate tax rate cut is an additional burden for the Centre that can take its fiscal deficit target to 4 per cent levels.
The joker in the pack is still the underlying growth in the economy. While the real GDP growth has fallen from 8 per cent last year to 5 per cent this fiscal in the April-June quarter, the sharp fall in nominal GDP growth from 12.6 per cent to 8 per cent during this period is worrisome.
The Centre’s fiscal deficit target assumes a 11 per cent growth in nominal GDP growth for FY20 (from the Central Statistics Office’s FY19 estimates), which is a tall task. If growth falters further, the fiscal deficit target can even move beyond 4 per cent levels.
The biggest overhang for Indian bond markets has been the huge gross market borrowings by the Centre pegged at a high ₹7.1-lakh crore in the current fiscal (from ₹5.71-lakh crore last year). But given that the borrowing calendar has been front-loaded, the market was factoring in the easing of supply of bonds in the second half of the fiscal.
For the April-September 2019 period, issuance of government securities amounts to ₹4.42-lakh crore; the balance ₹2.68-lakh crore of gross borrowings will come in the second half. But the supply of bonds in the second half could go up now. The stimulus announced by the Centre would lead to additional borrowings, which implies more supply of bonds and higher yields (bond prices and yields are inversely related).
Going ahead with the foreign sovereign bond issuance could be a saving grace. The ₹70,000-odd crore of foreign sovereign bonds pegged in by most economists can help lower bond yields in the domestic market.
Even though the RBI cut its policy repo rate by a notable 35 basis points in its August policy, Indian bond yields have only inched up. From 6.3 per cent levels in the beginning of August, the yield on 10-year government bonds has increased to 6.6 per cent levels, already factoring in expectations of a fiscal stimulus from the Centre. Post the FM’s move on corporate tax rate, the yield has moved up by another 20 basis points.
Given that expectations of fiscal slippage has been factored into bond yields to some extent, bond yields could remain range-bound in the near term, until there is more clarity on foreign sovereign bond issuance, GST collections and the disinvestment agenda. Expectations of the RBI cutting rates further, given the sanguine inflation trends, may also cap the upside in bond yields. That said, notable rise in yields cannot be ruled out in the coming months, given the significant slip on fiscal deficit and volatile rupee.
Given the uncertainty around various factors impacting bond yields, investors must cap their expectations and tread with caution. Long-term gilt funds as a category has delivered 15-16 per cent returns over the past year, thanks to the sharp rise in bond prices. A rise in yield (fall in prices) hereon can impact returns.
Hence, investors should avoid duration and credit risk in their portfolio. A chunk of your debt fund investments should be in short-term debt funds that carry less volatility in returns. Short- and medium-duration debt funds having a duration of up to 3-4 years are ideal for investors with medium risk appetite. Opt for corporate bond funds that invest a chunk of their assets in high-rated debt instruments."
