172,2018-01-02,ITC,"West Coast Paper, Kohinoor Group also submit expressions of interest for Sirpur Paper Mills

Mumbai: Telangana-based Sirpur Paper Mills Ltd, which is in the middle of insolvency proceedings at the Hyderabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), has received initial expressions of interest from several potential suitors including ITC Group, JK Paper Ltd, West Coast Paper Mills Ltd and the Kolkata-based Kohinoor Group, according to two people briefed on the matter. 
Mumbai: Telangana-based Sirpur Paper Mills Ltd, which is in the middle of insolvency proceedings at the Hyderabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), has received initial expressions of interest from several potential suitors including ITC Group, JK Paper Ltd, West Coast Paper Mills Ltd and the Kolkata-based Kohinoor Group, according to two people briefed on the matter.
The deadline for submitting the expressions of interest ended in the third week of December, following which binding bids are expected in January, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.
Emails sent to ITC Group, JK Paper, West Coast Paper Mills, Kohinoor Group and Ram Kanoongo, the interim resolution professional (IRP) for Sirpur Paper Mills, remained unanswered until press time on Monday. 
Sirpur Paper Mills is one of India’s largest manufacturers of pulp, paper board and a variety papers sold in both domestic and export markets. It employs close to 3,000 workers. Founded in 1938 by the erstwhile provincial government of Hyderabad, Sirpur is one of the oldest paper mills in the country. The mill was bought by the C.K. Birla Group, which later sold it to the Poddar family led by Ranjan and Devashish Poddar.
The mill shut operations in September 2014 following successive quarterly losses, which the management attributed to rising raw material costs making continued operations untenable.
In October 2016, IDBI Bank took possession of the mill on behalf of lenders to recover collective dues of Rs422 crore and put the assets up for sale. In October 2017, NCLT admitted a petition by one of Sirpur Paper’s operational creditors to initiate insolvency proceedings against the company and appointed an IRP.
“The revival of SPML has become a contentious issue given the issue of livelihood of thousands of employees,"" said one of the two people cited earlier. 
“The Telangana government has assured that all necessary efforts to revive the ailing company would be made,"" the person added. 
The Hindu Business Line, citing Telangana industries minister K.T. Rama Rao, reported in March that some of the concessions extended to new industries will also be offered to Sirpur Paper Mills to ensure its revival. Alongside, the state government also began looking for a strategic partner to revive the mill and held talks with at least two potential strategic partners including JK Paper and ITC to revive the mill, the report added.
Sirpur Paper Mills is among several paper manufacturers facing operational headwinds. Mint reported in January that Bilt Graphic Paper Products Ltd (BGPPL), a unit of Ballarpur Industries Ltd (BILT), was facing a working capital shortage and was in talks with potential lenders to raise additional funding over and above its existing debt of more than Rs6,000 crore.
Sirpur Paper Mills has been looking to raise additional debt after talks to sell two paper factories in Maharashtra to JK Paper broke down in November because of disagreements over valuation. A large portion of BGPPL’s debt was later acquired by Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company, which has since restructured the company’s loans. 
Mint reported in August that the paper business of Nagpur-based Murli Industries Ltd, which is under corporate insolvency, had received bids from West Coast Paper Mills Ltd and JK Paper."

170,2018-01-18,ITC,"Hindustan Unilever is just a short burst away from overtaking ITC in the market, an indication of how its fortunes have changed for the better

With so much noise in Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s (HUL’s) results, it is better to step back and see the big picture. The company management says demand is recovering, but still maintains a cautious stance, saying give it a quarter or more before one can call it a trend. That may seem overcautious from an investor’s standpoint. The worst was behind us in the September quarter, and the December quarter results give no reason to turn sceptical. 
With so much noise in Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s (HUL’s) results, it is better to step back and see the big picture. The company management says demand is recovering, but still maintains a cautious stance, saying give it a quarter or more before one can call it a trend. That may seem overcautious from an investor’s standpoint. The worst was behind us in the September quarter, and the December quarter results give no reason to turn sceptical.
Now, HUL’s 11% volume growth indeed has a base-induced bump due to demonetisation in the year-ago quarter. Still, the September quarter volumes rose by 5% compared to a 1% decline a year ago. And the December quarter’s 11% growth is off a base of a 4% decline. While both are not comparable, it does appear as if growth has strengthened. It is natural to expect volume growth to settle down in subsequent quarters.
The 17% underlying domestic consumer business growth came despite price cuts after the government cut GST (goods and services tax) rates from 28% to 18% on several fast-moving consumer goods. HUL’s financials show that its input costs as a percentage of sales declined sequentially. Although crude oil-related input costs may have turned expensive, it does not seem to have affected the company yet. This could also be attributable to a better mix.
HUL’s confidence is visible in the step-up in advertising expenses, which rose as a percentage of sales sequentially. That and higher employee costs and other expenses contributed to a slight decline in its Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin sequentially, falling by 69 basis points to 19.6%. Since the year-ago quarter’s profit after tax but before exceptional items fell by 15.8%, the December 2017 quarter’s 52.2% growth should be seen in that light.
The company’s volume growth will settle down to more normal rates in the coming quarters, although mid-FY19 will again see some base effect-linked volatility due to GST. Even if HUL’s steady-state volume growth settles in the 5-7% range, that will take it back to levels it last saw in FY16. That is a good start. Overall, expectations are that FY19 will see the economy recover and the government will take steps to give a boost to the rural economy. That could lead to a recovery in rural consumption, which should benefit the likes of HUL.
The company’s shares have risen by a fifth over six months ago as investors have been expecting the recovery, visible in its results. HUL’s shares have also done much better than peer ITC Ltd, which has been weighed down by a high tax burden and an unfavourable policy environment. HUL is just a short burst away from overtaking ITC in the market, an indication of how its fortunes have changed for the better."

Kolkata: Cigarette and consumer goods maker ITC Ltd on Friday said its fiscal third-quarter profit rose 16.8% from a year earlier, boosted by a one-time reversal of a provision of Rs412 crore.
Net profit rose to Rs3,090.20 crore in the three months ended 31 December from Rs2,646.73 crore in the year earlier. 
Adjusted for the one-time exceptional income, the company’s net profit in the December quarter grew 1.1% year-on-year (y-o-y), Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a note.
The company’s operating profit grew 10.1% to Rs3,904.5 crore from a year earlier, slightly lower than the expectations of HDFC Securities Ltd, its analysts Naveen Trivedi and Siddhant Chhabria said in a report.
Adjusted for a change in the tax regime, ITC’s gross sales value, or comparable gross revenue, grew 6.3% over last year to Rs16,746.2 crore, the company said in a statement. ITC’s performance was in line with Edelweiss’s estimates, its senior vice-president Abneesh Roy said in his report.
On Friday, ITC’s shares rose 0.37% to close at Rs273.85 on BSE, while the benchmark Sensex gained 0.71% to close at 35,511.58 points.
Though ITC’s pre-tax profit from cigarettes at Rs3,269.25 crore was up 7.7% year-on-year—a “healthy growth"", according to HDFC Securities—Edelweiss estimates cigarette sales by volume to have declined by around 5% in the December quarter. The tobacco industry faced “severe pressure due to sharp increase in taxes"", ITC said in its statement. All combined, taxes on cigarettes have tripled since 2011-12, claimed ITC.
Other consumer goods sold by the company, such as packaged food and personal care products, registered robust growth and turned in a pre-tax profit of Rs47 crore in the December quarter as against a loss of Rs19.66 crore in the same period a year ago.
Adjusted for a change in accounting norms due to the introduction of the goods and services tax, the company said its gross sales value, or revenue, from the segment rose 16.2% over the same period last year to Rs2,871.78 crore.
The company’s pre-tax profit from the hotels segment grew 30% over last year to Rs54.77 crore while segment revenue grew 10% to Rs404.44 crore. Room tariffs firmed up while sales of food and beverage also shot up, ITC said in its statement.
The paper and paperboards segment turned in a pre-tax profit of Rs268.26 crore, 9% higher than the same period last year, even as revenue from the segment contracted 4.2% to Rs1,279.6 crore.
Sales of farm commodities also slowed due to a shortage of leaf tobacco, the company said, but its profit margin from the segment expanded. Revenue from the segment fell 8.4% y-o-y to Rs1,530.86 crore, while pre-tax profit fell marginally to Rs233.34 crore from Rs236.61 crore a year ago."
167,2018-01-22,ITC,"ITC needs its cigarettes business to normalize for sales growth to revive but especially for profitability to improve

In any other year, this month would have been the occasion to wonder if ITC Ltd would face a hike in duties on cigarettes in the Budget. Under the goods and services tax (GST), that has changed as the rate fixing decision now rests with the GST Council. Not that it has made life easier for ITC. The surprise hike in cess on cigarettes in July has hit ITC’s performance for the second quarter now. 
In any other year, this month would have been the occasion to wonder if ITC Ltd would face a hike in duties on cigarettes in the Budget. Under the goods and services tax (GST), that has changed as the rate fixing decision now rests with the GST Council. Not that it has made life easier for ITC. The surprise hike in cess on cigarettes in July has hit ITC’s performance for the second quarter now.
Its packaged consumer goods business has recovered but that is good for sales growth alone. Year-on-year growth is not comparable due to accounting differences under GST. Its comparable consumer business growth was 16.2%, similar to the 17% growth that Hindustan Unilever Ltd reported. Overall, ITC’s net sales rose by 5.7% over a year ago.
ITC needs its cigarettes business to normalize for sales growth to revive but especially for profitability to improve. Even if this were to happen sometime in fiscal 2019, if the government repeats its tax hikes on cigarettes, it may again set back ITC’s growth.
On a sequential basis, ITC’s profitability has improved with its segment margin rising by 96 basis points. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. But cigarettes played no role in that as its margin declined by 1.7 percentage points, which should worry investors. Margins improved mainly due to higher contribution from packaged consumer goods, trading in agricultural products and hotels.
If the improvement in the other businesses sustain, that can support profitability but ITC’s cigarettes business still contributes to 84% of segment profits. There is no alternative at this point by comparable size and profitability to offset a declining situation in its cigarettes business. Cigarette volumes are estimated to have declined by about 2% during the quarter, over a year ago, according to Motilal Oswal Securities Research.
And, ITC continues to invest heavily in businesses such as consumer products and hotels, which tends to pull down their contribution to profits, although they may add to sales growth. ITC’s net profit before exceptional items rose by a mere 1.1% over a year ago and the reported solid 16.7% increase was chiefly due to exceptional items.
ITC’s results indicate the worst is not behind it yet. Investors will want to see volumes revive and profitability improve at its cigarettes business. But a thriving cigarettes business could again tempt the government to tap it for higher tax revenues, if the need arises. That dagger continues to dangle overhead even if it may not fall during the 2018 budget.
After Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s results, ITC’s shares perked up, perhaps on hopes that consumer businesses are seeing a gradual recovery in demand. ITC’s shares have been underperforming the market and its peers. 
A recovery in growth would imply a change in its valuations too. But the results are likely to dash investors’ hopes. As things stand, pricey though its shares may be, HUL has much more going for it than ITC has."
166,2018-02-25,ITC,"Gaggan Anand and Andre Chiang are closing, or have closed, their flagship restaurants at the peak of their careers, in pursuit of something more

The prestigious list of Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants is released each year, with thousands of chefs jostling for a coveted spot. For the past three years however, Bangkok-based modern-Indian restaurant Gaggan has settled down and set up home at the No.1 slot. The crown sits crooked on the head of Kolkata-born chef Gaggan Anand, who has a personality as memorable as his food.  
The prestigious list of Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants is released each year, with thousands of chefs jostling for a coveted spot. For the past three years however, Bangkok-based modern-Indian restaurant Gaggan has settled down and set up home at the No.1 slot. The crown sits crooked on the head of Kolkata-born chef Gaggan Anand, who has a personality as memorable as his food. 
Rockstar-meets-culinary maestro, if there ever was one, Anand pushes boundaries and even has diners lick up their plates in one of his courses, to bring in a sense of madness and fun to dining. The restaurant is always packed with a regrettable waitlist for months altogether. 
I once had the pleasure of being served by him at a special-edition dinner in Delhi. I mentioned to him that I was visiting Bangkok the week after and would definitely drop in for dinner at the restaurant. He looked at me incredulously and asked, “But have you made a reservation?"" And that was my introduction to a new world where people travel for food and reservations are as precious as a four-leaf clover. 
The No. 2 position goes to the only Chinese-origin chef in this list, Andre Chiang. Though he was born in Taiwan, Chiang spent his formative years in France and returned to Asia only 10 years ago when he felt the need to go closer to his roots. 
The launch of Restaurant Andre coincided with the opening of Marina Bay Sands, an iconic Singapore landmark, which brought global spotlight to the island and led to his restaurant being reviewed in The New York Times only two months after launch. 
The journey upwards was swift and clean, and much like Bruce Lee, whom he is compared to often in the food world, he rose to the pinnacle of success annihilating competition with clean blows. Restaurant Andre too has been notoriously difficult to dine at, with reservation waitlists overflowing into three months. 
Two artists, different as chalk and cheese, both at the peak of their career, helming restaurants that have been awarded two Michelin stars each. What do they have in common? The tiny fact that they both recently announced the closure of their incredibly popular restaurants. 
Yes, Gaggan will cease to exist in 2020 and Restaurant Andre served its last table about two weeks ago, on 14 February. These individual announcements have taken everyone by surprise and sent shock waves in a world where they are regarded as heroes. So, what brought this about? 
A desire to create something new
As Chiang put it when I asked him why he would shut at the peak of the restaurant’s popularity, he likened a restaurant to a painting. You start with a blank canvas, and slowly choose your colours and create something new. Day in and day out, you tweak it a little bit here and a tad bit there until one day, you decide that the masterpiece is “complete"". You could hold on to that painting forever and bask in its glory, or you sign the canvas, put the painting on the side and start again from scratch. 
Anand mirrors these sentiments too. In his words, “To rise again, you always have to head back down and go up. One can’t possibly jump from one mountain to another."" 
The 10-year itch
It has to be more than a coincidence that both chefs agree on a 10-year life cycle. Anand believes that by 2020, the restaurant would have completed 10 years and would have given its all. It is not that he is sitting around idle in the meantime, though. With interests in various ventures, he has many projects on and promises to keep cooking and evolving his food. 
For Chiang, it is more of a way of life. “Every 10 years, I get restless"", he shares. “I look at my life and think of how to shake it up. Complacency is not something I can live with. 10 years back I moved to Singapore from France, and now the time has come to go back to my motherland, to Taipei."" 
Burden of the Michelin crown
Recently awarded a Michelin star, the only hawker in the city to get one, Jay Fai is reportedly contemplating returning the honour. Since the announcement, the tiny stall in Bangkok where 72-year-old Supinya Junsuta cooks each dish on the wok herself, donning ski goggles to avoid oil splatter, has been inundated with diners flocking by the dozen. The restaurant has been forced to implement a reservation system, which it previously shied away from. 
Jay Fai is not too amused by tourists who are more interested in taking photographs than in the flavours of the food itself. The unmanageable crowds have swelled to such a degree that her daughter had to quit her job and join her mother and sister at the stall full time. 
“There is always good pressure and bad pressure,"" muses Anand. “Good pressure forces you to keep getting better and better. But the downside is that you forget to enjoy the journey of it.""
In his statement announcing the impending closure, Chiang respectfully returned his two Michelin stars and also requested that his Taipei restaurant, RAW, which is what he will focus on now, not be included in any future Michelin guides if they were to launch in Taiwan. 
“These accolades do not allow you to grow naturally. They push you to create a sense of perfection and stand still at that point. I want to nurture RAW and let it transform gently until I believe it is ready,"" he says. 
But do these restaurants make money?
Diners often crib about meals at such restaurants costing an arm and a leg (and a kidney too). Ranging easily from $200 to $800 per person, this is far more than what an average person is comfortable paying for a meal. Agreed that what you get here is more than a meal, it is an experience. But does that still justify the rates? 
I once posed this question on Twitter and triggered a passionate discussion, with many Michelin-starred chefs joining in the fray. “If the world’s greatest chefs cooked for a living, they would starve"", it is famously said. In that Twitter free-for-all, Anand and chef Atul Kochhar spoke about how expensive fine ingredients are. And if you heard the price of a single truffle, you may be inclined to agree. 
But there is more to the story here. El Bulli (ranked World No. 1 and awarded three Michelin stars) ran in losses for years, yet continued to serve guests only six months in the year and only for dinner. They reportedly received 800,000 reservation requests for their 48-table restaurant, which only could seat 8,000 tables in the entire season. 
Would the restaurant have made more money if it stayed open all year round and served lunch too? Absolutely. Could they have raised the price from their €250 per head and still filled those tables? Without a doubt. So why did they not? 
It may partly be explained by chef Ferran Adria’s passion that he needed that time out to reinvent and raise the bar higher each season, thus treating the restaurant like a laboratory. But the truth is also that keeping the prices affordable enough to entice more and more people to know about the El Bulli brand allowed him to create a series of businesses that fed off this brand, each of which made (and continue to make) a lot of money. 
The global diner version 2.0
In an ever-changing world, the diner is evolving at a rapid pace too. Ten years ago, people did not travel much for leisure. Fast forward to today and many are willing to go overseas, only to dine at a particular iconic restaurant. This also implies that the diner is more sophisticated and demands that chefs re-invent rather than recreate. 
To cater to such an audience, restaurant owners and chefs feel the need to be nimble and to constantly ask themselves—what next?
With great power comes great responsibility
It may have held true for Spiderman but legendary chefs like these are no less than superheroes either. Anand believes that as you climb the ladders of success, you increasingly feel the need to nurture and develop talent and make place for others to grow.
This is one of the main reasons that Chiang has decided to go back to the cradle, his homeland Taiwan. He believes that there is immense talent in the kitchens there but there is a need for that talent to be moulded and he must play his role in this. 
Two years ago, in a heart-to-heart conversation Massimo Bottura told him that he felt proud of where Andre had reached, but he also was aware that Andre is the only Taiwanese chef at that level. This touched him deeply and he felt a deep sense of responsibility, the need to give opportunities and share his knowledge with those who have not been exposed to how the food world is growing around the world. 
El Bulli, Gaggan and now Andre. Iconic restaurants that each left a distinct mark in this world. Restaurants that are spoken about in respectful hushed tones, some even years after they shut their doors. The closure of these restaurants at the peak of their popularity may be attributed to many factors. But the true genius lies in the men who created them. 
Men who sought and eventually attained perfection in their creations, but more importantly, had the courage to walk away from their masterpieces towards nothing but a blank canvas. Shedding their egos along the way and taking along merely their colours and enviable talent.

165,2018-03-07,ITC,"ITC sets goal of generating Rs10,000 crore from the Aashirvaad brand annually over five years

New Delhi: ITC Ltd has set its sights higher for Aashirvaad—the Kolkata-based cigarette-to-shampoo maker’s largest packaged food brand.  
New Delhi: ITC Ltd has set its sights higher for Aashirvaad—the Kolkata-based cigarette-to-shampoo maker’s largest packaged food brand. 
The company has set an internal target of generating Rs10,000 crore from Aashirvaad annually in five years.
For perspective, this means that in five years, ITC will generate what the country’s largest pure-play listed food company, Nestle India Ltd, notched up in calendar year 2017 sales (Rs10,135 crore), and more than the financial year 2017 revenue of biscuit maker Britannia Industries Ltd (Rs8,684 crore), by selling food products under Aashirvaad— a brand ITC created in May 2002 to sell atta, and later expanded to include spices, salt, ghee, instant mixes and ready-to-eat meals.
“At the retail level, Brand Aashirvaad’s current sales is around Rs4,200 crore. The brand has been growing at a compounded annual rate of 16-17% for the past few years. We hope to maintain the rate of growth, and the target is to cross the Rs10,000 crore mark,"" said Hemant Malik, divisional chief executive (foods), ITC.
To hit the Rs10,000 crore mark, according to Malik, Brand Aashirvaad will see a stream of product launches—backed by a micro-regional strategy for product innovation, distribution and communication targeting to get new sets of consumers. 
Besides, the company is constantly working on reducing distance to market (from factory) to ensure freshness.
“We are launching ready-to-bake roti (Indian bread), with a five-day shelf life, later this year, hopefully by winter. We have already got the technology, and will soon start test marketing the product,"" Malik said. The ready-to-bake roti will require only a few minutes’ heating.
While ready-to-bake rotis are available in some global markets, ITC will be among the first companies to bring the product to India. UK-based East End Food sells a similar product in some parts of that country. 
In India, Bengaluru-based iD Fresh Food India Pvt. Ltd and New Delhi-based Ready Roti India Pvt. Ltd, in which Mexican firm Grupo Bimbo acquired a 65% stake in May 2017, also tried selling ready-to-heat rotis but the products are hard to find.
“While we plan to price it for the masses, the product will initially be sold in metro cities that house the maximum number of double-income families, or people with little time for cooking. Also, this is a product that would compete with the restaurants that deliver to homes. We are trying to bring as much convenience as possible to make cooking easier,"" said Mailk.
ITC will also launch 7-8 variants of atta—produced with different blends of wheat—this year. 
“These will be produced with different blends of wheat to make atta more suited to the taste buds of people in a particular region or state,"" said Malik. At present, the company has 4 variants.
The idea, according to Malik, is to go micro-regional and launch products that are relevant to, say, a particular town, state, community or a socioeconomic class. 
“With 29 factories and our back-end of wheat procurement, we can have 29 blends or more,"" said Malik, adding that the company will also expand the atta and ready-to-make food portfolios to cater to people with lifestyle diseases such as diabetes or those suffering from malnutrition.
ITC’s focus on Aashirvaad is part of the company’s strategy to generate around Rs65,000 crore from packaged foods by 2030 to reach its target of Rs1 trillion revenue from non-cigarette packaged goods by that time, Mint reported on 21 September 2017. 
Meanwhile, the company has been tackling the fallout of a set of videos shared on social media that allege that Aashirvaad atta has plastic in it.
“What is being shown as plastic in these mischievous videos is actually wheat protein which is a mandated component of atta by the FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India). Protein is an integral part of any atta or wheat. This protein is what binds the atta. Without this protein, it is not possible to roll chappatis,"" said Malik."

161,2018-03-19,ITC,"Supreme Court asks ITC to move an application for any additional directions such as maintenance of status quo with respect to moveable property in Park Hyatt

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the sale of Park Hyatt Goa to ITC Ltd by Industrial Financial Corp. of India (IFCI), setting aside a Bombay high court order.  
New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the sale of Park Hyatt Goa to ITC Ltd by Industrial Financial Corp. of India (IFCI), setting aside a Bombay high court order. 
The court directed that the transfer of the property title be done within six months. 
The apex court also asked ITC to move an application for any additional directions such as maintenance of status quo with respect to moveable property in Park Hyatt. 
The judgment was pronounced by a bench comprising justices S.A. Bobde and L. Nageshwara Rao, in an appeal moved by Blue Coast Hotels, original owner of Park Hyatt Goa, against an order of the Bombay high court.
The Bombay high court had quashed the sale of Hyatt to ITC by lender IFCI, after ITC emerged as the highest bidder of the property in February 2015 with a Rs515-crore offer. 
A division bench of the Bombay high court had directed IFCI to refund the amount it received from ITC and had also permitted Blue Coast Hotels to retain physical possession of the property. 
The Bombay high court had observed that a possibility of collusion between ITC and IFCI could not be denied in an auction where ITC was the sole bidder with a bid that was only Rs1,000 higher than the reserved price. Since there were no other bidders, the property did not fetch its potential market purchase price, the court had noted.
Blue Coast Hotels had argued that the price quoted by ITC was not even half the property value as the actual value of the property was around  ₹ 1,250 crore and that there was some kind of collusion between IFCI and ITC. 
Blue Coast had mortgaged its luxury 250-room hotel in Goa with IFCI against loan taken for its expansion programmes.
After Blue Coast Hotels defaulted on the payments, IFCI took possession of the property in June 2013 under the SARFAESI Act in June 2013 and put Park Hyatt on sale through auction."
160,2018-03-27,ITC,"In a letter to food companies such as ITC, HUL, Dabur and Nestle, FSSAI said the food companies will also need to submit a 'fresh plan on the recall management'

New Delhi: Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), the country’s food regulator, on Monday said it has asked the top 200 food companies that have procured licences from the FSSAI headquarters to set up exclusive teams to manage food recalls if the situation arises in the future. 
New Delhi: Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), the country’s food regulator, on Monday said it has asked the top 200 food companies that have procured licences from the FSSAI headquarters to set up exclusive teams to manage food recalls if the situation arises in the future.
In a letter written to companies such as Kolkata-based ITC Ltd, the country’s largest packaged goods company Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), New Delhi-based Dabur India Ltd and Nestle India Ltd, the local unit of Swiss packaged food company Nestle SA, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India said the companies will also need to submit a “fresh plan on the recall management"". 
A copy of the letter has been reviewed by Mint.
The move is part of the food regulator’s plan to “implement food recall regulations across India"" that it notified in November 2017, putting the onus on companies by stating that the primary responsibility of implementing any recall lies with food companies, as it believes a recall is directly linked to “serious defects in the manufacturing process"". 
It outlined a 10-step process that companies will have to follow for a recall. 
The regulator has also asked companies to submit details of the food recall team within 30 days and the fresh recall plan within 60 days from 20 March, 2018.
The directive comes almost three years after FSSAI ordered Nestle India to recall Maggi instant noodles for alleged presence of monosodium glutamate and excess lead on 5 June 2015, which turned out to be the largest food recall in India ever. 
“As a responsible corporate citizen, we always abide by all relevant norms and regulations,"" a Nestlé India spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement.
According to the FSSAI letter, the food recall plan will be reviewed by FSSAI’s regional offices every time any of the 200 food companies applies for renewal of its licence.
“Recall is not a common thing in India. The regulator’s directive is part of preventive measures to assure consumers that companies make and sell safe food. This might have some cost pressure on companies, but that is not unjustified,"" said Rajat Wahi, partner (management consulting) at consulting firm Deloitte India."
159,2018-03-29,ITC,"Horlicks, which accounts for 85-90% of GSK Consumer Healthcare's, could fetch a valuation of 4-4.5 times of sales considering the low growth scope of the brand

New Delhi: Global food giants Nestle SA of Switzerland, Chicago-based Kraft Heinz Co., Dutch packaged goods maker Unilever, New Jersey-based Mondelez International Inc., and ITC Ltd are expected to bid for GlaxoSmithKline’s Horlicks and other health nutrition products, according to analysts tracking the sector. 
New Delhi: Global food giants Nestle SA of Switzerland, Chicago-based Kraft Heinz Co., Dutch packaged goods maker Unilever, New Jersey-based Mondelez International Inc., and ITC Ltd are expected to bid for GlaxoSmithKline’s Horlicks and other health nutrition products, according to analysts tracking the sector.
The 145-year-old dietary nutrition brand that accounts for about 85-90% of GSK Consumer Healthcare Ltd’s sales in India could fetch a valuation of 4-4.5 times of sales (going by recent trends) considering the low growth scope of the brand, said Sachin Bobade, an analyst with Mumbai-based Dolat Capital Market. According to GSK statement, its nutrition products portfolio including Horlicks had total sales of $550 million in 2017.
However, Reuters estimated the valuation to be around $4 billion, citing unidentified people. The British drug maker on Tuesday said it has initiated a “strategic review"" of Horlicks and other nutrition products to support funding of its $13-billion buyout of Novartis’s stake in the global consumer healthcare joint venture formed in 2015.
Besides the Horlicks brand, GSK is exploring sale of its 72.5% stake in Indian subsidiary GSK Consumer Healthcare. “GSK needs the money to support the Novartis deal. Naturally, it would look to conclude the deal in foreign exchange. Global companies, with presence in both India and Malaysia, such as Unilever, Danone and Nestle are the most likely ones to fight for the brand. ITC, which is looking at a bigger presence in dairy, is the only Indian company that could look at buying Horlicks for multiple reasons. While a few others may be interested, they may opt out because of the deal size that could be 2-3 times of sales,"" said Sunil Alagh, chairman, SKA Advisors, and former managing director and chief executive officer of biscuit maker Britannia Industries Ltd.
 “Going by current market capitalization, the stake is worth close to $3 billion. And Horlicks accounts for about 85% of its total business in India. Besides India, Horlicks has small business in countries like Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Malyasia,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst seeking anonymity.
A second analyst said that American companies such as PepsiCo Inc. and Coca-Cola Co. may bid as both are trying to expand presence in health and nutrition segment.
A possibility of pharmaceutical companies such as Abbott Laboratories looking at Horlicks cannot be ruled out, especially because the company already has a sizeable presence in nutrition space with Pediasure and Ensure, added a third analyst based in Mumbai, adding that Danone of France that has been struggling to find its feet in India and recently exited the dairy business to focus on nutrition may also look at buying Horlicks. Danone already has strong presence in nutrition supplement space in India with Protinex brand.
Nestle already has a presence in the health nutrition space in India with Milo. “We do not comment on market speculation,"" said a Nestle India spokesperson. Citing unnamed officials, Reuters on Tuesday reported that Nestle has previously told GSK :“privately of its interest in Horlicks on several occasions"".
Kraft Heinz, which acquired malt-based health food drink brand Complan from GSK in 1994, did not respond to Mint queries.
Spokespersons at ITC and Indian subsidiaries of Mondelez, Unilever, Coca-Cola and PerpsiCo said that they “do not comment on market speculations"" as a company policy or practice. Abbott, and Danone did not respond to Mint queries.
In India, Horlicks dominates the malt-based hot drinks market with a commanding 42.8% share (off trade volume), followed by Mondelez International’s Cadbury Bournvita with 12.6% and Boost with 10.6% (another GSK brand), according to data compiled by Euromonitor International."

New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Friday asked ITC Ltd not to continue its advertising campaign with the “say not to concentrate"", for its juice brand BNatural, till 9 April.
The directive came based on a suit filed by PepsiCo India Holdings Pvt Ltd, the local unit of American food and beverage maker PepsiCo Inc. that sells juice under Tropicana brand.
On Friday, ITC published advertisements across print media, social media and hoardings saying: “We’re inviting Tropicana and Real to join us in abandoning concentrates."".
It further added: “Will the competition join us, be there to see."" According to the advertisements, “this journey"" starts from 9 April.
The court will hear the matter again on 9 April.
ITC, the Kolkata-based cigarette-to-juice makes, declined comment on the issue.
“In response to ITC’s BNatural media campaign, we took legal action against ITC in the Delhi high court. We are pleased to note that the Hon’ble High Court today directed ITC to suspend the advertising campaign, and remove all references to the Tropicana brand as well as #SayNoToConcentrate, as it is derogatory to the category of concentrate juices.

New Delhi: ITC Ltd on Monday agreed to remove all references to PepsiCo’s Tropicana brand from an advertisement campaign for its juice brand BNatural.
ITC made the statement before a single-judge bench of the Delhi high court, which was hearing a plea made by PepsiCo India Holdings Pvt. Ltd. The local unit of American food and beverage maker PepsiCo Inc. that Tropicana juices has sued ITC for publishing advertisements across print media, social media and hoardings saying: “We’re inviting Tropicana and Real to join us in abandoning concentrates. At 7pm on 9th April. Venue: Bandstand, Bandra West, Mumbai. Yours truly, B Natural."" 
Appearing for ITC, lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi clarified that the change in the advertisement campaign to: “We are taking a pledge to make juices concentrate free!"" was an interim measure, without prejudice to the stand that its original advertisement campaign was not disparaging rival juice brands.
Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw directed the proposed change to be carried out across print, electronic and social media platforms. 
On 7 April, justice Endlaw had directed ITC to suspend the controversial advertisement campaign till 9 April and produce a revised advertisement on the next date of hearing. The matter will be heard next on 9 May.
“We are pleased to note ITC’s revised ad campaign filed today in the court does not have reference to PepsiCo brand ‘Tropicana’ and the phrase “#say no to concentrate"". ITC has been directed to use the revised approved campaigns on all advertising platforms, including social media, print and electronic. ITC has further made a statement to court that they will not use PepsiCo’s name or their brand in their ads or at their event at Mumbai. PepsiCo also requested that its products should not be disparaged at the event in Mumbai. The court has directed ITC to video record the event and allowed PepsiCo to also record the event,"" Deepika Warrier, vice-president (nutrition category), PepsiCo India, said in a statement.
“Pepsi had sought an injunction from the Court against the promotional event to be organised by ITC today in Mumbai. After briefly hearing submissions from ITC’s counsel, the Hon’ble Court declined to pass any order of injunction in favour of Pepsi. Further, ITC submitted that it would file detailed objections to Pepsi’s suit and petition. The Court has permitted ITC to file its reply and the case is now posted to 9 May, 2018 for hearing. ITC’s counsel also submitted that meanwhile, without prejudice to its contentions, and purely as an interim arrangement, ITC would not mention the names of other brands in its advertisements,"" ITC spokesperson said in emailed statement."

Kolkata: Cigarette and consumer goods maker ITC Ltd on Wednesday said its net profit in the March quarter rose 9.86% from a year ago to Rs2,932.71 crore as margins expanded. Gross revenue from sales rose only 3.56% to Rs17,933.48 crore, which the company attributed to subdued demand and disruptions in supply chain. 
Kolkata: Cigarette and consumer goods maker ITC Ltd on Wednesday said its net profit in the March quarter rose 9.86% from a year ago to Rs2,932.71 crore as margins expanded. Gross revenue from sales rose only 3.56% to Rs17,933.48 crore, which the company attributed to subdued demand and disruptions in supply chain.
The cigarette segment contributed Rs3,505.76 crore of pre-tax profit compared with Rs3,258.76 crore, up 7.57% year-on-year (y-o-y). Pre-tax profit from other consumer goods jumped to Rs91.21 crore from Rs55.56 crore in the same period a year ago. The results were in line with the expectations of its analysts, Edelweiss Capital Ltd said in a report.
For the full year, ITC’s net profit is up 10% over the previous year to Rs11,223.25 crore, or Rs9.16 per share, compared with Rs8.38 in fiscal 2017. The company will be paying a dividend of Rs5.15 per share of Re1 each for the year till 31 March. Net profit for the year, however, includes an exceptional item—a writeback of provision of Rs270 crore.
ITC’s shares closed at Rs285.95 each on BSE on Wednesday, up 1.47% in a weak market.
According to Edelweiss, cigarette sales by volume were down 1-2% y-o-y in the March quarter. In the December quarter too, cigarette sales by volume had contracted by an estimated 5%, Edelweiss said. The performance reflects “severe pressure"" on tax-compliant cigarette manufacturers in the wake of “steep escalation"" in tax rates, ITC said in a statement.
ITC has hiked prices of cigarettes by 10-11% to offset the hike in taxes, according to Edelweiss, and that, in turn, may have impacted sales by volume.
Revenue from the hotel business in the March quarter rose 5.5% y-o-y to Rs408 crore, but pre-tax profit jumped to Rs75.47 crore from Rs66.93 crore in the same period a year ago, a growth of 12.75% thanks to an improvement in room rates. The performance of the segment was impacted by huge room inventory, ITC said in its statement.
The company’s farm commodities trading business was weak in the March quarter and turned in pre-tax profit of Rs123.97 crore compared with Rs134.92 crore in the same period a year ago as the shortage of leaf tobacco due to a drought in Andhra Pradesh weighed heavily on performance, ITC said. Pre-tax profit from the paper and paperboards business was flat at Rs242.42 crore.
Adjusted for the change in tax regime, revenue from ITC’s non-tobacco consumer goods business in the March quarter grew 10% to Rs3,051.82 crore over the same period a year ago, driven by a wide range of products such as Bingo! Snacks, Sunfeast biscuits, B Natural juices, personal care products and Classmate notebooks, the company said in its statement.
“Progressive stability of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime... and expectations of normal monsoons augur well for the company business going forward,"" ITC said. 
In the year till March, this segment generated a pre-tax profit of Rs164.12 crore, compared with Rs28.12 crore in the previous year."
152,2018-05-17,ITC,"Hindustan Unilever has caught up with ITC dramatically in the past year: a year ago, ITC's market cap was 60% ahead, the gap has shrunk to merely 2.4%

Cigarette-to-soap maker ITC Ltd’s shares rose 1.5% on Wednesday, even though its March quarter net profit just about met Street expectations. Worse, revenues were 11% lower than Bloomberg consensus estimates. It’s not that there were any hidden gems in the company’s results; rather, there is a fancy for consumer sector stocks in the markets currently. 
Cigarette-to-soap maker ITC Ltd’s shares rose 1.5% on Wednesday, even though its March quarter net profit just about met Street expectations. Worse, revenues were 11% lower than Bloomberg consensus estimates. It’s not that there were any hidden gems in the company’s results; rather, there is a fancy for consumer sector stocks in the markets currently.
In fact, ITC is only enjoying a rub-off effect; other consumer goods stocks are doing far better. Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), ITC’s nemesis in the market cap tables, has caught up dramatically in the past year, as the chart above shows. A year ago, ITC’s market cap was 60% ahead; the gap has shrunk to merely 2.4%.
There have been earlier occasions in 2018 when the gap has narrowed, though not to this extent. HUL is on the verge of overtaking ITC at this point, for the first time after it ceded the pole position back in 2005.
The divergence in the performance of the two stocks is sort of reflective of differing fortunes in terms of volume growth. HUL’s growth of 11% was far ahead of estimates, while ITC’s growth, or the lack of it, remains a concern. ITC does not provide volume details but Dolat Capital Market Pvt. Ltd estimates a 2-4% decline in cigarette volumes during the March quarter. From an investor’s perspective, this amounts to small mercy, as it compares favourably with a 5% estimated decline in volumes in the December quarter.
ITC has said that volume growth is getting affected by the large pictorial warnings. And while the worst of harsh taxes may be behind it, policy-related concerns may continue to weigh on growth.
The silver lining is that in ITC’s case, while its revenues may have been lower than expected, there are signs of improvement in its business segments, leading to better profitability sequentially in most of its divisions.
The cigarettes business, which accounted for as much as 87% of ITC’s total segment Ebit, saw a 7% improvement as against the December quarter. Ebit is earnings before interest and tax.
ITC’s consumer goods business did well with comparable sales growth of 11.3% over a year ago, but it was lower than HUL’s 16% growth. Although this segment’s Ebit growth was impressive, this could change once ITC begins to invest heavily in growing the business, which is its main priority. Still, analysts say that ITC’s consumer goods business Ebit of nearly 3% is rather encouraging.
On a sequential basis, its margins were down slightly but this was chiefly due to a decline in the agricultural exports segment margins."

Mumbai: After 13 years, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) on Thursday reclaimed, albeit for some time, the spot of India’s most-valued consumer packaged goods maker, edging past ITC Ltd which has held that position all this while. 
Mumbai: After 13 years, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) on Thursday reclaimed, albeit for some time, the spot of India’s most-valued consumer packaged goods maker, edging past ITC Ltd which has held that position all this while.
Shares of HUL, India’s largest consumer-goods company by sales, rose after the company reported better-than expected volume growth for the March quarter (Q4). In intraday HUL surpassed ITC mcap. However on closing basis HUL erased gains following fall in the local equity markets. In intraday HUL mcap was at Rs343164.39 crore while ITC mcap stood at Rs342452 crore. However, at closing basis HUL mcap stood at Rs339668.68 crore while ITC’s mcap closed at Rs340449.83 crore.
ITC has held the position of India’s biggest FMCG company by market cap since February 2005.
HUL reported a net profit of Rs1,351 crore in the January-March quarter, against Rs1,183 crore a year ago. Sales at Rs9,003 crore were up 2.5% from Rs8,773 crore a year ago. A Bloomberg poll of 21 analysts had estimated the company to post a fourth quarter profit at Rs1,333 crore and revenues at Rs8,898.40 crore.
The company attributed the performance to trade conditions that have normalised after the debut of goods and service tax (GST) and higher consumption.
Sales growth was driven by underlying volume growth of 11%. In the year-ago quarter as well, volume growth was 11%, but then the base for the company in the earlier December quarter had contracted by 4% due to demonetisation.
“The volume growth has surpassed all expectations with mature categories like home delivering very strong double digit volume growth. While the sustenance of such high volume growth seems challenging but considering low base for the next two quarters HUL volume growth trajectory will continue to be very strong,"" said PhillipCapital in a note to its investors.
“We have upgraded our estimates for FY19/FY20 on improving volume growth prospects. Because of its robust distribution model and wide product portfolio, HUVR is best-placed to harness growth arising from the informal sector becoming formal. With strong volume and value growth, it will trade at premium valuations"", the report added. The brokerage firm has maintained a buy rating on the stock and increased its target price to Rs1,670 from Rs1,585 a share.
ITC on Wednesday said its net profit in the March quarter rose 9.86% from a year ago to Rs2,932.71 crore as margins expanded. Gross revenue from sales rose only 3.56% to Rs17,933.48 crore, which the company attributed to subdued demand and disruptions in supply chain.
The cigarette segment contributed Rs3,505.76 crore of pre-tax profit compared with Rs3,258.76 crore, up 7.57% year-on-year. According to Edelweiss, cigarette sales by volume were down 1-2% y-o-y in the March quarter. In the December quarter too, cigarette sales by volume had contracted by an estimated 5%
“ITC’s core cigarette segment continues to witness pressures on volume growth following the price hikes taken by the company (to offset GST-related hikes). The company continues to be largely dependent on cigarettes for its profits; thus growth will remain muted until volumes revive. Other segments of the company are yet to show traction that may aid the company beat estimates. As such, our expectations from the company in terms of profit growth remains contained,"" said Kotak Securities in a note to its investors."

149,2018-06-16,ITC,"ITC Hotels, Taj Group of Hotels and Oberoi are planning branded luxury homes in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and Mumbai and Bengaluru

Mumbai: Large legacy Indian hotel companies are warming up to the idea of setting up branded residences, a space that has largely been dominated by international hotel chains such as Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton and Grand Hyatt. 
Mumbai: Large legacy Indian hotel companies are warming up to the idea of setting up branded residences, a space that has largely been dominated by international hotel chains such as Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton and Grand Hyatt.
Despite sluggish sales of luxury homes, a host of branded residences have come up in the past 3-4 years. Besides the popular Trump Towers and Four Seasons Residences, global fashion houses, including Versace and Armani, have also collaborated with Indian developers to build luxury homes.
For branded residences, fashion houses or hospitality chains lend their brands to a luxury housing project and provide management services for a fee.
Kolkata-based conglomerate ITC Ltd, which operates hotel chains under the ITC brand, has begun construction of its first branded residence in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The company has roped in global luxury brokerage firm Sotheby’s International to sell the project, which comprises 132 luxury apartments, said one person familiar with the matter. Each unit would be priced at $1.2 million, the person added. 
Amit Goyal, CEO of India Sotheby’s International Realty, confirmed the partnership. The project will target the growing wealthy non-resident Indian community in the island country.
Indian Hotels Co. Ltd, or the Taj Group, and EIH Ltd, which runs Oberoi and Trident hotel chains, also aim to enter the branded residences segment.
While the Taj Group is looking to set up its first branded residence at Colombo in partnership with Kathmandu-based conglomerate Chaudhary Group, the Oberoi group is in talks to launch projects in Bengaluru and Mumbai, said one person, requesting anonymity. Queries emailed to Oberoi, ITC and Taj spokespersons remained unanswered till the time of going to press. 
Hotel Leela Venture Ltd, which operates the Leela chain of hotels, is developing four luxury projects across Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi. 
While its first branded housing project in Bengaluru in partnership with real estate firm Bhartiya City is nearing completion, it has also tied up with Prestige Group to build Leela Residences in the city. Besides, it is also building Leela Blu Residences in Mumbai with Indiabulls Real Estate, and Leela Skylark with Raheja Developers Ltd in the Delhi-NCR region.
“There is increased interest by Indian hotel companies towards branded residences. This is a logical extension as an asset class,"" said Mandeep Lamba, managing director, hotels and hospitality group, at real estate advisory JLL India. 
According to him, such projects, which are normally part of a luxury hotel development, help in reducing the overall capital cost for the hospitality project and also monetize part of the underlying real estate. “For hotel operators, it helps widen the opportunities in the market to leverage their brands,"" Lamba said. 
Ultra high networth individuals continue to be a huge draw for such products, said Girish Shah, executive director, Knight Frank India, a property consultancy firm. “Branded residences have been a global phenomena. As for hoteliers and developers, wherever there is an opportunity to leverage an asset, in this case a brand, they will definitely explore it,"" he said."

147,2018-06-22,ITC,"Raisa Chakravarty and Anupama Sharma of ITC bagged the Silver Lion at the Young Lions Marketers Competition at the Cannes advertising festival

Raisa Chakravarty, the 28-year-old assistant brand manager at ITC Ltd, was elated when she learnt that she along with her teammate Anupama Sharma had bagged the Silver Lion at the Young Lions Marketers Competition at the ongoing Cannes advertising festival in France. “The experience has instilled confidence and encouraged me to push boundaries towards thinking better,"" she said. 
Raisa Chakravarty, the 28-year-old assistant brand manager at ITC Ltd, was elated when she learnt that she along with her teammate Anupama Sharma had bagged the Silver Lion at the Young Lions Marketers Competition at the ongoing Cannes advertising festival in France. “The experience has instilled confidence and encouraged me to push boundaries towards thinking better,"" she said.
Cannes Lions is one of the most coveted and established awards in the creative and marketing communications industry since 1954.
The Young Lions Marketers Competition was spread over an intense 24-hour period where the teams were required to design a concise and effective brief for a product or service that would benefit the Movember Foundation—a global charity foundation focused on men’s health.
Chakravarty and Sharma proposed a product called Mo-Chips, made of nutrient-rich food to promote healthy eating habits. The chips were moustache-shaped, indicating their emphasis on men’s health. “We designed an integrated campaign that would allow consumers to participate and support the cause in the most fun and simple manner, and spread the word about men’s health at the same time,"" said Chakravarty.
Chakravarty manages the Fiama range of products at ITC. She has been working with ITC for the last two years and said marketing in today’s time and age is about being real and connecting with people by giving them true value for the products they consume. “It’s exciting to see how ITC’s brands touch people and their lives in small yet significant ways,"" she said. After studying communications at MICA, Ahmedabad, she joined Metro Cash and Carry India Pvt. Ltd. as a management trainee. She gets her management skills from her father who has been a marketer all his life. “My dad is my biggest inspiration,"" said Chakravarty.
Sharma, 25, who is Chakravarty’s colleague at ITC, shares the same passion for marketing. She is an assistant brand manager, and looks over brands such as Engage and Essenza Di Wills. Her marketing mantra is to connect with people emotionally through storytelling. She said one cannot sell a product unless the brand or an advertisement evokes emotions. “For me marketing is just about emotions. Emotions like innocence, nostalgia, regret and aspiration. It is about tapping into the inside of what people feel,"" said Sharma. She enjoys the creative part of brand management which involves concept development and development of creatives, among other things.
Participating in The Lions at Cannes was on the wish list of the two young women since their college days and when the competition was announced in India, they didn’t want to miss the opportunity. “I had been waiting for Young Lions to open in India since last December. I must have seen the website about 50 times. And the moment it opened, I decided to participate with Raisa,"" said Sharma. 
Winning the Silver Lion was not a smooth journey. The girls spent time on understanding and analysing the past years’ Cannes winning case studies and conducted mock sessions to test each other. They interacted with all the other brand teams at ITC to understand different products by the company. They also researched on topical issues such as women equality and plastic pollution.
“I would like to compliment Raisa and Anupama for their passion, enthusiasm and dedication. Their achievement at Cannes is a testimony to ITC’s commitment and focus to develop professional managers in the corporate sector as some of the best creative managerial minds of this country,"" said Sameer Satpathy, chief executive of ITC’s personal care products business.
“Raisa and Anupama stood out as they had a lightness of touch and added humour. Their style was very engaging. They had good personal chemistry and were authentic in their presentation,"" said Ruth Yearley who headed the jury at Cannes. Yearley is a partner and director of insights and strategy at Ketchum, a leading global communications consultancy headquartered in New York city.
Sharma said the process of preparing for the competition has changed many things for her. Her thought process and the way she looks at things has changed drastically. “It has changed the way I think, the way I look at data, and the way I write the brief for a product or brand,"" she said."
146,2018-06-26,ITC,"ITC Ltd will also seek shareholders' approval to extend the term of its two other whole-time directors, Nakul Anand and Rajiv Tandon, for two years from July 2019

Kolkata: Cigarettes and consumer goods maker ITC Ltd will seek shareholders’ approval to extend the term of its non-executive chairman Y.C. Deveshwar by two more years till 2022, at its next annual general meeting on 27 July. 
Kolkata: Cigarettes and consumer goods maker ITC Ltd will seek shareholders’ approval to extend the term of its non-executive chairman Y.C. Deveshwar by two more years till 2022, at its next annual general meeting on 27 July.
In July 2016, shareholders of the company had approved the appointment of Deveshwar, who has led ITC from 1996, as a non-executive chairman for three years with effect from February 2017.
His current term is to end in February 2020, but ITC’s board decided to seek extension of his term by two more years in view of the “increasing size and complexity of the organisation"", the company said in its notice to shareholders.
Sanjiv Puri, who was appointed ITC’s chief executive officer with effect from February last year “to take independent charge of the executive leadership of the company"", was appointed managing director in May this year. His term was to end in July 2019 but is being extended till July 2024. The company will seek shareholders’ approval to extend his term by five years.
The company will also seek shareholders’ approval to extend the term of its two other whole-time directors, Nakul Anand and Rajiv Tandon, for two years from July 2019.
Deveshwar, who has led ITC for two decades as executive chairman till 2016, is widely credited with the company’s diversification into consumer goods. He fought boardroom battles early on against the British American Tobacco group, a dominant shareholder in ITC, which was not in favour of venturing outside the core business of cigarettes.
The company has said in its annual report that it now has five brands with standalone revenue in excess of Rs1,000 crore each. These are Aashirvaad staples, which earned more than Rs4,000 crore in revenue in the last financial year, Sunfeast biscuits (over Rs3,500 crore), Bingo snacks (over Rs2,000 crore), Classmate stationery and Yippee noodles (both over Rs1,000 crore each).
ITC said it has 25 “mother brands"" in consumer goods with a combined annual consumer spend of nearly Rs16,000 crore. Apart from the five top brands, ITC has three brands—Vivel, Mangaldeep and Candyman—which clock over Rs500 crore each in annual revenue.
Puri joined ITC in 1986, and has worked in almost all business verticals except hotels. He was appointed a whole-time director in December 2015 and appointed chief operating officer in July 2016.
After taking over as the executive leadership of the company, Puri had said he would toe Deveshwar’s line on expansion, while making the company more efficient in production and distribution.
Anand, who oversees the hotels business of ITC, has been with the company for almost four decades. He was managing director of the erstwhile ITC Hotels Ltd between 2003 and 2005, until the company was merged with its parent. He was appointed to the board of ITC in January 2011.
Tandon, who serves as the chief financial officer, was appointed whole-time director in January 2016."
145,2018-06-27,ITC,"ITC in its annual general meeting note says an extension for Y.C. Deveshwar was in the best interest of the company, in view of 'the increasing size and complexity of the organisation'

Y .C. Deveshwar’s term as ITC Ltd’s non-executive chairman is being extended by two years and will now end on 3 February 2022. Earlier, his term was to expire on 4 February 2020. The proposal to extend his term will be put to vote at the company’s annual general meeting (AGM), to be held on 27 July. 
Y .C. Deveshwar’s term as ITC Ltd’s non-executive chairman is being extended by two years and will now end on 3 February 2022. Earlier, his term was to expire on 4 February 2020. The proposal to extend his term will be put to vote at the company’s annual general meeting (AGM), to be held on 27 July.
ITC’s AGM notice says the Nomination and Compensation Committee and the board of directors were of the view that this extension was in the best interests of the company, in view of “the increasing size and complexity of the organisation"".
Shareholders may be puzzled at this development. There is time for the current term to end and an extension could have been sought in the next AGM too. And the stated reason for the extension also does not say much about what it means by increasing size and complexity.
Now, one definition of size can be revenue or the number of new businesses. Revenue growth is actually under pressure due to rising cigarette prices because of higher taxes. FY18 also saw the goods and services tax roll-out disrupt sales in the FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) business, though temporarily. The fiscal year saw gross sales increase by only 4.5%. While the consumer goods division has plans to add new lines, that’s not new.
In terms of complexity, again, the issues facing ITC are not new. The cigarettes business has been battling rising taxes and adverse regulatory changes for years now. Its FMCG business has been in investment mode for years. These are the two businesses of most interest to shareholders.
Even if shareholders accept the board’s view that size and complexity are increasing, surely the new management is fit to handle it, and if not now, then by February 2020 at least. Consider the chief executive’s experience. Sanjiv Puri has been working in ITC since 1986 and was the chief operating officer since July 2016, before taking over as the chief executive officer and charge of the executive leadership since 5 February 2017. Recently, his designation was changed to managing director, though no reasons were given for it.
There is no doubt that ITC is going through a challenging period. Its shares have underperformed the broad market (see chart) and show little sign of recovering. FMCG stocks including that of Hindustan Unilever Ltd have gained handsomely in recent months, on the back of investor confidence that demand is reviving. ITC’s shares have not joined in. This is despite its FMCG business seeing good growth in the March quarter.
The problem child is the cigarettes business. An adverse tax regime and a regulatory push to curb smoking have created a difficult environment for the business to grow. This was the cash cow of the company, which was used to incubate businesses such as hotels, paper and more recently its consumer goods business. Continued pressure on the cigarettes business could threaten its ability to provide indefinite support to scale up the consumer goods division.
These challenges do require a strong set of hands. That is precisely what the new leadership should be prepared for, because they have been mentored for it. At some point, they will have to fly solo and what better way than a trial by fire. That is one view but another can be a more cautious one. The challenges are huge and there is much at stake, so perhaps it is better to retain a veteran with a successful track record guiding the executive management, for four more years.
While the second view may have found favour with the board, investors may wonder what it speaks about the executive leadership’s ability and calibre to independently take on tough challenges, take the company into the next phase of growth, possibly transforming it along the way. After all, that’s what Deveshwar did in his early years at ITC’s helm, which defined what the company has become today."

142,2018-07-26,ITC,"ITC's Q1 profits were affected by incremental tax burden of 20% on cigarettes after GST implementation

Kolkata: ITC Ltd posted a 10% increase in net profit in the June quarter as higher taxes on cigarettes outweighed healthy performance by other segments. 
Kolkata: ITC Ltd posted a 10% increase in net profit in the June quarter as higher taxes on cigarettes outweighed healthy performance by other segments.
The cigarette and consumer goods producer recorded a profit of  ₹ 2,818.68 crore in the three months ended 30 June. Gross sales grew 13.5% on-year to  ₹ 18,171.66 crore.
The financial performance was however largely in line with market expectations.
Despite healthy performance by almost all segments, ITC’s profits took a hit from an incremental tax burden of 20% on cigarettes post implementation of the goods and services tax, and a drop in profit from its commodities trading business. 
Operating profit from cigarettes in the June quarter grew 8.7% y-o-y to  ₹ 3,558.39 crore, which is 83% of its total pre-tax profit of  ₹ 4,299.94 crore. The company has been complaining about continued pressure on its cigarette sales.
Ahead of its earnings, ITC shares on Thursday closed at  ₹ 287.15 apiece on BSE, up 0.4% in a flat market.
ITC’s emerging non-cigarette consumer goods business turned in a pre-tax profit of  ₹ 127.76 crore in the June quarter, up 86% over the same period last year. Segment revenue adjusted for change in the indirect tax regime, grew 14% y-o-y to  ₹ 2,870 crore. The robust growth in pre-tax profit from the segment was due to “enhanced scale, product mix enrichment and cost management initiatives"", ITC said in a statement.
Revenue from the hotel business grew 12% during the quarter to  ₹ 341.28 crore, while pre-tax profit jumped from  ₹ 5.31 crore to  ₹ 13.22 crore driven by “higher room rates and strong food and beverage sales"". The company, which is building four hotel properties, opened its new hotel in Hyderabad last quarter.
The paper, paperboards and packaging segment delivered a 15% rise in pre-tax profit to  ₹ 295.66 crore in the June quarter, “driven by strategic investments in imported pulp substitution and process innovation leading to improved pulp yield"", among other initiatives, ITC said.
The commodities trading business was hit by “pressure on legal cigarette volumes and lower export incentives"", it said. Pre-tax profit from the segment fell 17% last quarter to  ₹ 194.51 crore. Revenue, however, rose 14% to  ₹ 3,151.27 crore."
138,2018-07-27,ITC,"ITC needs to strike a balance between owned-properties and managed hotels, managing director Sanjiv Puri said

Kolkata: After years of pursuing growth by building properties across India, ITC Ltd is looking to raise the share of revenue from managed hotels in a bid to shore up shareholder returns from the segment. 
Kolkata: After years of pursuing growth by building properties across India, ITC Ltd is looking to raise the share of revenue from managed hotels in a bid to shore up shareholder returns from the segment.
Going forward, the company will pursue an “asset-right"" strategy, managing director Sanjiv Puri said. ITC needs to strike a balance between owned-properties and managed hotels. The immediate target is to shore up revenue from managed properties to equal that from owned hotels, he added.
Currently, ITC’s hotels division earns 60% of its revenue from owned properties. The division currently has assets worth  ₹ 5,700 crore. In fiscal 2017-18, pre-tax profit from the division was  ₹ 139.79 crore, or around 2.5% of its assets.
ITC is currently building some six properties, including one in Colombo. Asked if the company will hold off on investing in new projects, Puri said it wouldn’t if the right opportunities were found, even as it seeks to scale up revenue from managed properties.
“The choice we have made is to benefit the country as well as our shareholders,"" chairman Y.C. Deveshwar said, defending the company’s decision to expand in the hotels business by creating new properties.
For the past few years, the division has been under pressure because of several reasons: subdued demand from so-called feeder markets, such as Europe and the US (from where it used to get most of its guests), resulting in poor occupancy and depressed tariff, a key official in the hotels division said.
“But ITC has continued to build hotels with the conviction that in certain markets, supply itself creates demand,"" the person said, asking not to be named. For instance, in Chennai, where ITC built the 650-room Grand Chola hotel, it was warned that occupancy will be the key challenge. “But today it is running at 80% occupancy,"" he added.
There have been years when return on investment for the hotels division was north of 20%, according to this person. But ITC chose to expand its footprint with the conviction that tourism in India will pick up and that the market price of these assets will appreciate with time, he added.
While admitting that the past few years have been challenging, this person said “the oversupply of rooms in key markets have more or less been absorbed"" and that the business cycle has started to look up.
Puri on Thursday said ITC will take control of the property acquired in Goa in 2015 by September this year. ITC acquired a hotel which was run under the Park Hyatt brand from IFCI Ltd, but the delinquent owners of the hotel moved court and stalled the transaction. Following favourable orders from the apex court, ITC expects to get the property under its control by 19 September.
Deveshwar on Thursday said ITC had been approached to take over the paper factory of Ballarpur Industries Ltd in Telengana by the local government. ITC is willing to take over the unit provided it was given long term incentives to turn it around. The decision on the proposal is to be made based on the incentives offered by the Telengana government, he added."

Now, with improving growth trajectory (both topline and bottomline), less likelihood of increase in cess on cigarette as the government goes into election in 2018 and strong valuation comfort (valuation discount to sector at all time high of 50%), we believe that ITC can potentially outperform the sector over the next 6-9 months"", said Jefferies India in a note to its investors.
“Given, 12.2% YoY EBIT growth (highest in 9 quarters) and all round performance across segments, we believe double-digit EBIT growth will sustain.

TCS is the country’s most valued firm with a market cap of  ₹ 7,43,930.44 crore followed by RIL ( ₹ 7,15,772.03 crore), HDFC Bank ( ₹ 5,82,044.68 crore), ITC and HUL in the top five order on BSE.
Rise in ITC was also instrumental in sending the BSE benchmark index higher by 352.21 points to close at 37,336.85."
137,2018-07-30,ITC,"ITC's cash generating machinecigarettesseems unaffected by punitive taxation and public health policy

When expectations are rock bottom, exceeding them is not difficult. That is one way of looking at ITC Ltd’s shares rising 5.2% on Friday after its net profit grew 10.2% in the June quarter. While earnings’ growth was better than expected, volume growth in its cigarettes business caught attention, with analysts estimating it at 1-1.5% over a year earlier compared to their expectations of no change. 
When expectations are rock bottom, exceeding them is not difficult. That is one way of looking at ITC Ltd’s shares rising 5.2% on Friday after its net profit grew 10.2% in the June quarter. While earnings’ growth was better than expected, volume growth in its cigarettes business caught attention, with analysts estimating it at 1-1.5% over a year earlier compared to their expectations of no change.
ITC’s underperforming cigarettes business was the main reason its shares were not doing well. A steep increase in the cess on cigarettes under the goods and services tax regime had resulted in a decline in volume growth in the previous three quarters. An unfavourable regulatory regime made matters worse. Is this all in the past now?
One factor that may be working in ITC’s favour is a steady improvement in consumption demand in the economy. That could be driving some growth to ITC’s cigarettes portfolio. Also, the tax efficiencies under the GST regime may be helping ITC, just as it does other consumer companies.
The remaining three quarters of FY19 should also see cigarette volume growth, partly with a low base effect helping. Volume declined in the year-earlier period, after ITC raised prices sharply to compensate for higher taxes.
While a really bad FY18 may be followed by a somewhat better FY19, ITC still faces threats from punitive taxation and public health policy. However, if duties on cigarettes are left unchanged in the next budget, it can signal a more stable taxation regime ahead for cigarettes. Given the uncertainty, wait and watch is the best policy.
While these risks have to be managed, ITC’s cash generating machine seems unaffected by all these events. 
In FY18, its annual report shows that its net cash from operations rose 24% to  ₹  13,169 crore, even as its operating profit rose by 8.5%. Growth and level of cash generated gives it enough flexibility to pay dividends and still have enough money left over for investing in other businesses. That also shows that even in a tough year, the cigarettes business has a lot of fight in it.
Its FMCG business may require some of that cash, as ITC continues to invest in new categories and products. The quarter did see 14% sales growth on a comparable basis, and it also reported a slender profit. Still, the number of relatively new categories it has entered is likely to continue putting pressure on margins.
That means cigarettes will continue to be the mainstay for earnings growth, while the FMCG business may provide impetus to sales. Even in the June quarter, 85% of the increase in segment profit was contributed by the cigarettes business alone.
Analysts are, on an average, expecting earnings growth to be about 12% in FY19 and FY20, according to Reuters’ compilation of analyst estimates. 
The recent increase in its shares have seen its price to earnings multiple increase to 29 times its FY19 estimated earnings and 26.6 times FY20 estimated earnings. That may seem low compared to its FMCG peers but may continue, till one can be confident that the worst of the policy measures and steep tax rate hikes are behind it."

Hong Kong/Tokyo: Bitcoin touched below $6,000 and dozens of smaller digital tokens retreated as this month’s sell-off in cryptocurrencies showed few signs of letting up. 
Hong Kong/Tokyo: Bitcoin touched below $6,000 and dozens of smaller digital tokens retreated as this month’s sell-off in cryptocurrencies showed few signs of letting up.
The largest digital currency fell as much as 6.2% to $5,887, the lowest level since June, before paring some of the drop, according to Bloomberg composite pricing. Ether sank as much as 13%, while all but one of the 100 biggest cryptocurrencies tracked by Coinmarketcap.com recorded declines over the past 24 hours.
The total market capitalization of virtual currencies dropped to $193 billion. That’s down from a peak of about $835 billion in January.
“Most cryptocurrencies have been overvalued for a very long time,"" said Samson Mow, chief strategy officer at blockchain developer Blockstream Corp. “It’s hard to pin this move on any particular factor, but it feels like the opposite of last year when money piled in as people felt FOMO (fear of missing out). Now it’s piling out as they sense panic.""
While cryptocurrencies rallied in July on hopes that a Bitcoin-backed exchange-traded fund would attract new investors, US regulators have yet to sign off on multiple proposals for such a product. The letdown has coincided with growing concern that entrepreneurs who raised crypto-denominated funds via initial coin offerings are now cashing out of holdings such as Ether, the token for the Ethereum blockchain that is a popular platform for crypto projects.
“The big story in the market today is the huge weakness in Ethereum,"" Timothy Tam, chief executive officer of CoinFi, a cryptocurrency data analysis company, said in a phone interview. “Bitcoin has held up relatively well versus Ethereum. It’s still quite weak versus the US dollar.""
At the height of Ether’s rally last year, the digital coin comprised 32% of cryptocurrency market capitalization, coming within striking distance of Bitcoin’s 39%. Ether now makes up about 14%, while Bitcoin accounts for 54% after falling less quickly than its smaller peers, according to Coinmarketcap.com.
“ICOs that have raised a lot of money are really feeling a lot of pain"" as their crypto holdings lose value, Tam said.
Ether has tumbled about 40% this month, while Bitcoin has dropped about 26%.
It’s unlikely that recent global market turbulence, fuelled by Turkey’s currency crisis, is impacting cryptocurrencies, said James Quinn, head of markets at Kenetic, a blockchain company with investment and advisory businesses.
“Correlations historically have been extremely low between cryptocurrencies and other asset classes,"" he said in a phone interview from Hong Kong. “Which is one of the reasons why there is interest in this space and why people want to make an allocation in this space.""
Still, anyone expecting Bitcoin to provide a haven from turbulence in global markets will have been disappointed. The cryptocurrency’s slide against the dollar this month is almost as big as the Turkish lira’s 25% slump."

New Delhi: Fast moving consumer goods firm ITC Ltd has entered the hand sanitiser segment with the launch of Savlon pen sanitizer spray. The move augments the company’s hygiene portfolio, which currently has antiseptic liquid, hand wash and soap.  
New Delhi: Fast moving consumer goods firm ITC Ltd has entered the hand sanitiser segment with the launch of Savlon pen sanitizer spray. The move augments the company’s hygiene portfolio, which currently has antiseptic liquid, hand wash and soap. 
It also pits the brand Savlon against the RB India-owned hygiene brand Dettol, which leads the hand hygiene market, followed by the Hindustan Unilever-owned Lifebuoy and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd’s brand Protekt, which also sells sanitisers.
While the health and hygiene category, especially hand hygiene, has seen steep growth, given increasing hygiene awareness in the country, the hand sanitizer category, growing at 21%, year on year, is still underpenetrated and is largely urban. 
The antiseptic liquid ( ₹ 650 crore) and hand wash ( ₹  600 crore) category size is much bigger than the sanitizer category, which is pegged at  ₹ 70-80 crore, according to data from market research firm Nielsen.
“The rising number of urban commuters has led to an increase in the need for out-of-home hygiene solutions such as hand sanitisers. Since our primary target group is kids, we have created the product in a pen format, which can fit inside a pencil box. The spray bottle also allows dosage control and reduces product wastage,"" said Sameer Satpathy, chief executive, personal care, ITC Ltd.
The product will be available in a small pen format priced at  ₹ 49 for a 9 ml bottle promising 100 sprays. The 55 ml bottle is priced at  ₹ 77. ITC’s decision to enter the sanitiser category follows the company’s decision to turn Savlon, which it acquired from Johnson & Johnson in 2015, into a  ₹ 500 crore brand.
ITC repositioned the brand and enhanced its focus on the hand hygiene category. Savlon hand wash was launched in 2016 and the company claims that it currently has a value share of 7-8% in the segment. ITC is now looking at investing further in the brand and driving growth through product innovations.
“Savlon is a strong health and hygiene brand. We expect to outgrow the category with innovative product solutions, leveraging our strengths in brand building and distribution. The phenomenal growth of the brand since its acquisition is testimony to our commitment to create value for the Indian consumer,"" said Satpathy.
Noting that the hand hygiene category has strong players such as Dettol and Lifebuoy, Abneesh Roy, senior vice-president at Edelweiss Securities, said only product innovation would help new launches to take market share from existing players.
“Savlon’s product format seems interesting, especially for kids. While I think the price point (Rs 49) is slightly on the higher side, the promise of 100 sprays will help the product. I believe deodorant brand Fogg also gained market share by the promise of a certain number of sprays and a no-gas proposition,"" he said. 
Roy said that the brand Savlon had also been under-advertised when it was with (J&J), and ITC was now investing heavily in marketing and promotions, which would help the brand. 
“Along with their large distribution network, as well as investment in advertising and hygiene awareness programmes, the Savlon brand will grow. Therefore, the  ₹ 500 crore target looks achievable in the next five years,"" he added."

130,2018-10-21,ITC,"The CBIC, under the Finance Ministry, said trade and industry had expressed apprehension relating to 20 October due date for claiming ITC under GST for July 2017-March 2018

 New Delhi: The Finance Ministry on Sunday extended the deadline for filing summary sales return GSTR-3B for the month of September by five days to 25 October.
With this extension, businesses which wish to claim Input Tax Credit (ITC) benefit for July 2017-March 2018 period can do so till 25 October.
The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), under the Finance Ministry, said trade and industry had expressed apprehension relating to 20 October due date for claiming ITC under GST for July 2017-March 2018.
“With a view to give some more time for the same, the last date for furnishing GSTR-3B for the month of September, 2018 is being extended up to 25th October, 2018,"" the CBIC tweeted.
The GSTR-3B of a particular month has to be filed by the 20th day of the subsequent month. The deadline for September return filing was 20 October.
Businesses had expressed concern about the 20 October deadline, saying there would be trouble in reconciling their sales returns with the purchase returns filed by their suppliers.
Since the ITC is availed on the basis of summary sales return or GSTR-3B filed, hence the deadline for ITC claims and GSTR-3B have been kept same.
Goods and Services Tax (GST) was rolled out on 1 July 2017.
AMRG & Associates Partner Rajat Mohan said the date extension comes as a shock for compliant payers, whereas it would be a tax bonanza for late filers, non-filers and tax evaders.
“It seems that government has given a date extension (after expiry) only for lifting public perception rather than creating conducive environment for businesses to nurture,"" he said."

127,2018-10-29,ITC,"While the cigarette business seems to have shrugged off the effects of GST, impact of new packaging and a further increase in taxes are threats for ITC

A long road lies ahead of ITC Ltd. Its shares have risen by a mere 4.5% in the past year, while Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s (HUL’s) shares have gained by 22.5%. Its Q2 results indicate this gap may remain for some time to come. 
A long road lies ahead of ITC Ltd. Its shares have risen by a mere 4.5% in the past year, while Hindustan Unilever Ltd’s (HUL’s) shares have gained by 22.5%. Its Q2 results indicate this gap may remain for some time to come.
Consider its cigarettes business, which contributed to 41% of sales and 85% of segment profit. Sales rose by 10.4% which was good, and while the company does not reveal volume numbers, analysts estimate volume growth at about 5-6%. Ordinarily, this should have been good. But then, its segment profit margin declined by 1 percentage point over a year, even though it rose by 1.8 percentage points sequentially. The company said that floods in Kerala damaged inventory and the shift to new graphics from 1 September resulted in higher costs. Why margins increased sequentially is unclear as also whether the entire decline in margins can be attributed to these events.
ITC’s FMCG business is doing well with sales growth at 12.8%, slightly higher than what HUL reported. But profits may have improved but remain very slender, as the company remains in investment mode in this business. Its other businesses, such as paper and hotels, have also seen stable margins sequentially.
The overall picture that emerges is one where ITC’s revenue rose by 7.3% over a year ago, while input costs declined by 1.7%. In fact, employee costs too declined by 1.7%. But it was tripped up by a sharp increase in other expenses, which rose by a fourth over a year ago. Other expenses include heads such as freight, advertising and losses from floods too would be included here.
Since the costs of floods and costs of changing graphics are one-time in nature, that should mean the cigarette business’ profitability should recover. Insurance may cover the lost stocks too. The impact of the new graphics on cigarette sales is a risk to watch out for.
Cigarettes and FMCG are the main engines of growth for ITC. Cigarettes appear to have shrugged off the effect of higher taxes in the new Goods and Sales Tax (GST) regime. Its sales growth has returned to more decent levels. The key risk here remains a further increase in taxes that will again deal a blow to volumes.
FMCG sales growth too looks healthy but margins remain a question mark. With ITC setting up a number of manufacturing units for this business, segment profits may not improve by much. In any case, ITC’s chief objective is to expand its market share and profits are secondary in importance. While margins have picked up a bit, they still remain thin.
ITC’s earnings rose by 11.9% over a year ago to  ₹ 2,955crore, which is relatively low for ITC. That then explains the divergence in share price performance over HUL, whose earnings rose by 19.2% in the September quarter. Unfortunately for ITC’s investors, it is back to watching for the risk of an increase in indirect taxes in the coming quarters. If it is spared in 2018-19, then that should set the stage for a healthier growth in both volumes and profits from the cigarettes business."
126,2018-10-30,ITC,"The company will introduce other products such as paneer and milk beverages within a few months

Kolkata: Capping 10 years of research and product development at Munger in Bihar, cigarettes and consumer goods maker ITC Ltd on Tuesday launched its dairy products in Kolkata under its flagship Aashirvad brand. 
Kolkata: Capping 10 years of research and product development at Munger in Bihar, cigarettes and consumer goods maker ITC Ltd on Tuesday launched its dairy products in Kolkata under its flagship Aashirvad brand.
With the introduction of pouched milk in the first metro city after test marketing in Bihar, ITC has set for itself an ambitious target of grabbing at least 8% share of the estimated Rs1,800 crore market in Kolkata within a year. While curd was introduced along with milk, other products such as paneer and milk beverages will follow within months.
“It started 10 years ago with artificial insemination,"" recalled Hemant Malik, divisional chief executive of the foods business. The aim at that point was to improve cattle health and build capacity, he added.
For the first three years of working with dairy farmers in Munger, ITC did not buy any milk at all, according to Malik. Thereafter, ITC started to buy milk to understand the challenges of building a full-fledged enterprise.
The first challenge was to secure the milk from bacterial growth before it could be despatched to bulk freezing centres, Malik said, adding, to address the problem, the company had to invest in rapid milk freezers.
ITC will conduct around 75 tests to test product consistency and quality, Malik said.
Because of its short shelf life, the distribution chain for pouched milk has been built from scratch, according to Sanjay Singal, chief operating officer of the dairy and beverages division.
Initially, ITC will source milk from Munger and process it at a facility near Kolkata, owned and operated by a partner. In 10 days, the company will start procuring milk from local farmers of West Bengal, Malik said.
Kolkata consumes around 1.2 million litres of pouched milk a year.
ITC aims to scale up sales to around 100,000 litres within a year, distributing pouched milk every day in the morning. It is the only product that ITC will distribute daily — all its other products have longer shelf life.
Though priced competitively, ITC is setting new standards in processing to remove bacteria, according to another executive. “Its standards are way above any competitor."" 
The fact that ITC is using the Aashirvad brand for its dairy products is an indication of its long-term plans and confidence in the scalability of the enterprise.
Malik, however, said ITC had no immediate plans of rolling out dairy products across India.
ITC has a capacity of producing around 250,000 litres of unprocessed milk at Munger. At present, it is using only around half of its installed capacity. Curd is being produced from milk sourced locally in West Bengal, according to Singal."

In an interview, Kartik Sharma, chief executive – South Asia, Wavemaker, talks about 2018 being their best year so far, focus on content and the challenges that media agencies face today. Edited excerpts.
How has been the year in terms of client wins and new business?
We have added close to  ₹ 1,000 crore worth of business so far, the largest win being the Mondelez account which we won globally and locally. We also won Eureka Forbes, Bisleri, direct selling firm Amway and Mother Dairy. Apart from this, the agency has also retained couple of big clients such as confectionery conglomerate Perfetti Van Melle, insurance comparison website Policybazaar and direct-to-home (DTH) service provider Tata Sky.
Any new category of brands that you have started working on?
We have started working with Dreams11 which is a fantasy gaming firm. It’s an emerging but a high growth category. Dreams11 was launched during the Indian Premier League (IPL) and they have been doing well. We have recently won another business in the health category which we will announce soon. I believe that these firms are set to become big players probably redefining the category in the future.
What are you doing in content?
I believe everything can be made into content. A good content piece could be a static image on Instagram or five to ten-minute video on Facebook or YouTube. Content can also be a good website created for a brand. In India, the content partnerships have been for relatively smaller period (one year) or are often campaign led. We have signed a four-year long partnership with e-commerce website Myntra and entertainment channel Zoom where viewers will get a chance to buy clothes that celebrities are seen wearing in Zoom’s shows on Myntra. Apart from this we do video led content for clients.
A lot is being said about ad fatigue especially among young consumers, what kind of ad formats they are consuming especially on digital?
Video, as a format, continues to dominate the consumption pattern of millennials. The larger question to ask is why people experience fatigue because the time spent on a digital screen has increased significantly. Therefore, a brand must find interesting ways to narrate a story. Young consumers, especially under 25 years of age, are constantly demanding novelty from brands so any kind of repetition will be ignored by them. Advertising must be informative as well as entertaining to be impactful. Vodafone does powerful storytelling and all its ads brings smile to your face while integrating product. Netflix marketing promotions are also intriguing enough to draw viewers to watch their show.
2019 is the crucial year for media agencies with elections dominating advertising spends. What kind of media platforms will be leveraged by the political parties?
I think political parties might leverage chat platform WhatsApp in the upcoming elections because of its large userbase and penetration across the country. Apart from that, digital platforms such as YouTube and Facebook will also play a crucial role.
I believe in General Elections radio will be an impactful medium as it reaches tier II and III towns as well as media dark rural areas. The use of multimedia will happen including outdoor and cinema, but it is difficult to pin point the proportion of different mediums because it would depend on whether a political party or a state is promoting. A national campaign would see mass media promotion such as television and print while a state level campaign can heavily rely on outdoor and radio.
What are the key challenges that media agencies face?
There has been a squeeze on expected compensation from clients’ side. Rise of self-served platforms such as Facebook and Google has led to this school of thought that media agencies are not required any more. It could be an opportunity for agencies to prove their worth or can also be a threat for those who are not ready to take this challenge. Today our competition is not another media agency alone but other software companies, media platform owners even clients who are investing in these platforms."

Mumbai: Diversified conglomerate ITC is looking at portfolio expansion in its food division to achieve the stated vision of the company of achieving Rs1 trillion turnover from FMCG. 
Mumbai: Diversified conglomerate ITC is looking at portfolio expansion in its food division to achieve the stated vision of the company of achieving Rs1 trillion turnover from FMCG.
“The ambition set by our chairman and managing director of Rs1 trillion by 2030 is something we are all working towards, with current categories as well as new categories that we are getting into,"" ITC divisional chief executive — foods division Hemant Malik told PTI.
The food category, which drives the fast moving consumer durable industry, is expected to contribute around 60-65% of its turnover by 2030.
The revenue generated from ITC’s foods business, is below Rs9,000 crore although consumer spend is in excess of Rs12,000 crore, with the difference due to seller discounts offered by the company.
“We are looking at the dairy space. It is a huge space, and we have launched in a few markets. We will be launching dairy beverages in a couple of months. In the snack category also there are many areas where we haven’t started operating in. We will be exploring health space in snacking shortly. In juices, we launched 100% pomegranate and we will be adding more,"" he said.
ITC recently announced it will augment its dairy portfolio by entering the paneer and milkshakes segments and is planning to launch paneer for the Kolkata market and milkshakes pan India within two months.
While milk, ghee, paneer and curd would be sold under the ‘Aashirvaad’ brand, there will be a different brand for milk shakes. The Kolkata-headquartered company is also planning to sell millets.
The company that acquired floor cleaner brand Nimyle, fruit beverage brand B Natural and antiseptic brand Savlon, reportedly backed out of the $4 billion bid for GlaxoSmithKline’s healthdrink brand Horlicks.
Asked if the company would look at the inorganic route to fuel its growth, Malik said, “Every third day there is an offer on table which we have to study and then decide if it has any merit in our overall scheme of things. Sometimes evaluation could be too high and if its worth it at this price then its okay otherwise if that category is so interesting we might as well build it. We have built so many categories, we will build two more."" ITC today tied-up with online grocery player Bigbasket to launch four new variants of its instant noodle brand Yippee.
Malik said Yippee is a Rs1000 crore brand at present today after being launched over seven years ago, enjoying a 22% market share.

Washington: The US International Trade Commission on Thursday said it had determined that American producers were being harmed by imports of certain large-diameter welded steel pipe from China and India, a finding that locks in duties on those products for five years.
Last month, the Commerce Department said the imports were being unfairly subsidized and dumped in the US market, and it announced duties to protect domestic producers.
The ITC’s final determination that US producers are being harmed ensure those duties will remain in place.
The US trade probe, which covered welded carbon and alloy line and structural steel pipes with a diameter larger than 16 inches, began after a petition from a group of privately held US producers.
In 2017, large-diameter welded pipe imported from China and India were valued at an estimated $29.2 million and $294.7 million, respectively.
The ITC, in its statement, said it did not find that imports of stainless steel pipes from China and India created the same harm.

If you’re a Google Easter Egg enthusiast and love to doodle around, you’re in luck. Google silently introduced a progressive web app called Chrome Canvas that allows users to draw around on the screen. The doodles are saved directly to your Google account via Chrome Unboxed. 
To try this out, simply type in canvas.apps.chrome in to open this micro app—no need to download anything off the Play Store or App Store. 
TheVerge says the feature first showed up in a recent Chrome OS Dev build, but it now supports any browser supporting WebAssembly, which includes Firefox.
The app works on desktop and smartphones alike. 
The interface of the app is pretty straightforward—you have a basic toolbar which lets you choose a pen, pencil, marker, chalk and eraser tools. To select colours you have a colour palette. Once you’re done making your masterpiece, you can export your drawing as a PNG. 
The most convenient part of this web app is that you can pull up your drawings on any platform—be it smartphones or desktops—and continue working on them. 
Google Chromebook, however, gets a dedicated app for this. All you have to do is tap the “three dot button"" and hit install Canvas. 
During my brief interaction with the app, I found out that although the interface of the app is absolutely barebones, it gets a little too simple at times, especially in the mobile version. 
Choosing the right tool and colours is very easy, but every time you want to get out of the tool or colour selector you have to tap out on your canvas. Once you do that, you are putting a mark on your doodle, and if you don’t want that you’ll end up hitting the undo button everytime you’re done selecting.

109,2019-01-23,ITC,"Net profit came in at  ₹3,209 crore for the three months ended 31 December 2018, compared with  ₹3,090 crore a year agoSales of cigarettes grew by 9.6% with profit before tax for the segment up by 7.8% to  ₹8,409 crore during the quarter

New Delhi: ITC Ltd, India’s largest cigarette maker, on Wednesday reported a 3.85% increase in its December quarter standalone profit, backed by growth in the company’s cigarettes and consumer goods business.
Net profit rose to  ₹3,209 crore in the three months ended 31 December from  ₹3,090 crore in the year earlier, the company said. However, the company reported that in the corresponding quarter of last year it made a one-time gain of  ₹270 crore. As such, profit for the quarter ended 31 December without considering exceptional items, represents a growth of 13.8%, it said.
Total income from operations of the maker of Sunfeast biscuits and Gold Flake cigarettes for the quarter grew by 15.7% from the year-ago period to touch  ₹12,267 crore, according to a statement made by the company to the stock exchange.
The company’s revenue for the quarter was in line with analysts’ expectations, though margins, especially in the cigarettes business, fell below estimates.
Shares of the company dipped over 4% after its declared earnings for the quarter.
“Volume growth in ITC’s cigarettes business did not translate into double digit growth in EBIT (earnings before interest and tax). EBIT growth of 8.8% was marginally below our and street expectations,"" said Abneesh Roy, senior vice president, institutional equities, at Edelweiss Securities.
“Overall, the results are in line with our expectations in terms of revenue and slightly below expectations in terms of margin,"" brokerage firm Anand Rathi said in a post-earnings note.
During the quarter, the cigarettes business of ITC grew by 9.6% to touch  ₹5,073 crore. However, EBIT margin for its cigarettes business narrowed 50 basis points year-on-year to 70.1% during the quarter.
“Segment results during the quarter include the impact of escalation in input costs largely on account of consumption of higher cost leaf tobacco crop and increased salience of capsule cigarettes in the sales mix,"" ITC said.
Meanwhile, the company’s FMCG business put up a strong performance during the quarter with double-digit revenue growth.
The business comprising packaged foods, stationery and personal care products grew by 11.5% to  ₹3,200 crore, led by growth in categories such as wheat flour, snacks, premium cream biscuits, noodles, fragrances and liquids, the company said.
However, growth in the segment during the quarter was partially impacted by the “ongoing restructuring of the lifestyle retailing business and structural changes pertaining to the timing of trade promotions in the matches and agarbatti (incense stick) business"", it said.
Analysts expect growth in the company’s FMCG business to “remain steady with further entry into categories such as flavoured drink (milk shakes) and premium chocolates priced,"" Varun Lohchab, an analyst at Jefferies India, said in a 23 January note.
Other segments put up a good show for ITC as well. Revenue from the paper and packaging business rose 20.5% to  ₹1,542 crore, driven by strong demand and capacity augmentation in the value-added paperboard and decor segments.
Its agriculture business posted a revenue growth of 26% to touch  ₹1,925 crore during the December quarter.
However, analysts cautioned of any impending tax hikes on sale of cigarettes in the upcoming budget.
“FY19 is proving to be a volume recovery year with no tax hikes and stable pricing for cigarettes business,"" Lohchab said. However, price hikes of cigarettes and a tax increase in the interim budget remain key monitorables, he said."
108,2019-01-24,ITC,"The cigarettes biz accounts for 85% of total profits; it isn’t surprising its performance is the biggest factor to drive the stockThe average annual returns in the past five years have been just 4.8% and the stock has underperformed peers by more than 20%

Cigarettes burn holes in your pocket, is a popular anti-smoking slogan. The same can be said about betting on ITC Ltd’s cigarettes business if you consider the performance of the company’s stock over the past five years.
The average annual returns in the past five years have been just 4.8% and the stock has underperformed peers by more than 20%. Things have progressively become worse. Compared to an average valuation discount of about 22% vis-à-vis other FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) stocks in the past five years, ITC now trades at a 45% discount using the one-year forward price-earnings multiple, pointed out analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd.
The company’s December quarter results did little to assuage investor concerns. Cigarette volume growth rose to a seven-year high at 7.5%, but ITC shares fell more than 4% on Wednesday. Volume growth was impressive, notwithstanding the low base a year ago when volumes fell 5%, but the increase in business wasn’t accompanied by an improvement in margins. Cigarette margins fell 50 basis points year-on-year, which meant that profits of the segment again rose in single digits.
“In the cigarettes business, both volume growth and profit growth are important and this quarter there was good news on only one of them. The fact that decent volume growth in the cigarettes business did not translate into double-digit growth in earnings before interest and tax is a disappointment,"" said Abneesh Roy, senior vice president at Edelweiss Securities Ltd.
Price hikes have been muted and were insufficient to offset higher costs, as ITC was focused on getting back share from illegal cigarettes, according to Roy. The average realizations grew in the low-single digits. Higher tobacco leaf prices and higher capsule filter usage hurt margins in this segment, said analysts.
The cigarettes business accounts for around 85% of the company’s total profits and it isn’t surprising that its performance is the single biggest factor that drives the stock.
So, though ITC’s FMCG and paper businesses did well on the profit front, it didn’t matter much to investors. Profits of the FMCG business grew 63% year-on-year, while the paper business reported 24% growth in profits. However, the contribution of these segments to overall profits is small.
One of the main reasons growth in the cigarettes business has been sluggish in recent years is high taxation levels, with the imposition of the goods and services tax dealing another blow to the sector. Now, with the interim budget nearing, some investors are worried about negative surprises in store on the taxation front as early as February, if not in the full budget of the new government.
For a stock that is at the mercy of a fiscally constrained government, it is little wonder that it has underperformed peers."

107,2019-01-27,ITC,"GST revenue has averaged around  ₹96,000 crore per month so far this fiscalNow, there is no provision for real time matching of ITC claims with the taxes already paid by suppliers of inputs

New Delhi: Concerned over a decline in GST revenues, tax officials are likely to examine the high usage of input tax credit (ITC) to set off tax liability by businesses, sources said. The issue of high ITC was flagged at the meeting of the Group of Ministers (GoM) which was set up by the GST Council to look into the reasons for revenue shortfall being faced by a large number of states.
According to sources, availing ITC ideally should not result in loss of revenue but there could be possibility of misuse of the provision by unscrupulous businesses by generating fake invoices just to claim tax credit.
During the meeting of the GoM, it was pointed out that as much as 80 per cent of the total GST liability is being settled by ITC and only 20 per cent is deposited as cash.
GST revenue has averaged around  ₹96,000 crore per month so far this fiscal and this reflects the cash component being deposited by businesses.
Under the present dispensation, there is no provision for real time matching of ITC claims with the taxes already paid by suppliers of inputs.
The matching is done on the basis of system generated GSTR-2A, after the credit has been claimed. Based on the mismatch highlighted by GSTR-2A and ITC claims, the revenue department sends notices to businesses.
""Currently there is a time gap between ITC claim and matching them with the taxes paid by suppliers. Hence there is a possibility of ITC being claimed on the basis of fake invoices,"" a source said.
Once the new return filing system becomes operational, it would become possible for the department to match the ITC claims and taxes paid on a real time basis.
The revenue department would now analyse the large number of ITC claims to find out if they are genuine or based on fake invoices and take corrective action, sources said.
GST collection stood at  ₹1.03 lakh crore in April,  ₹94,016 crore in May,  ₹95,610 crore in June,  ₹96,483 crore in July,  ₹93,960 crore in August,  ₹94,442 crore in September,  ₹1,00,710 crore in October,  ₹97,637 crore in November and  ₹94,726 crore in December 2018.

105,2019-02-01,ITC,"FMCG firms see higher demand with more money in your handsBudget may boost consumption in short term, but CEOs caution against staggering unemployment, stagnant incomes

NEW DELHI :
The fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry has welcomed the budget saying that the measures will help farmers and spur consumer spending among middle-class.
Dabur India chief executive officer Sunil Duggal said the budget would boost overall consumer confidence and play a catalyst for demand generation for branded consumer staples and consumer products.
The government's decision to allocate  ₹60,000 crore for MNREGA and another  ₹19,000 for construction of rural roads under Gram Sadak Yojana, coupled with the modest farm support scheme offering income support for marginal farmers tick all the right boxes when it comes to fuelling the rural and agrarian economy, Duggal said.
However, the upward revision in fiscal deficit target to 3.4% of GDP for 2018-19 and 2019-20 remains an area of concern, he said.
""The interim budget proposals should augur well for the Indian economy by providing a growth impetus through a boost in consumption as well as an inclusive framework designed to benefit agri and rural communities, unorganised sector workers as well the middle class,"" ITC managing director Sanjiv Puri said.
Marico's managing director and CEO Saugata Gupta said the host of measures to boost the agrarian economy through minimum support price and increased investment in the farmer scheme is a welcome move as it will benefit small and marginal farmers.
""Simplified tax assessment processes coupled with the increase in tax exemption for income upto  ₹5 lakh per annum for individual tax payers, will not only reduce the tax burden on the middle class citizens but also increase the tax payer base in India. It will additionally result in the rise of disposable income in the hands of consumers thereby augmenting consumption,"" he added.
FMCG major Nestle India expect measures announced will further accelerate domestic consumption.
Echoing the views, Godrej Consumer Products managing director and CEO Vivek Gambhir said, ""Overall, this is a 'consumption first' budget that will provide a much-needed thrust to growth in the FMCG sector. It re-emphasises the aam aadmi at the heart of the government's pro-growth, pro-reform agenda; maintaining the fiscal deficit, stimulating demand and building a sustainable growth platform.""
According to Jyothy Laboratories joint managing director Ullas Kamath, the decision of reducing the tax burden on the salaried individual's will boost the consumer sentiment thereby increase purchasing power.
""The balanced efforts taken towards the rural and the urban economy will help in boosting the demand supply chain of the country,"" he said.
The retail sector is also likely to benefit due to the budget feels Retailers Association of India CEO Kumar Rajagopalan.
""More money in the hands of middle class, thanks to the increase in basic exemption limit from  ₹2.5 lakh to  ₹5 lakh will be beneficial for retail as it will create a feeling of well-being, which is known to boost consumption,"" he said.
However, toy manufacturer Funskool India's CEO John Baby said the budget does not provide any impetus for manufacturing sector to create more employment."

Kolkata: The proposed bid by the Centre to reduce GST on the under-construction houses to a maximum of five percent without input tax credit (ITC) has been welcomed by developers who think it will revive demand.
""We are looking forward to five per cent GST without ITC though it will hurt the builders in the short run. We expect the demand for under construction housing will revive and will offset the impact in the long run,"" Credai Bengal president Nandu Belani told PTI.
This is a critical matter and the outcome will have a notable impact on real estate market sentiment, Anarock property consultants chairman Anuj Puri said.
Currently, despite a provision in place for receiving ITC, buyers are unsure about how and when they will receive this benefit. Therefore, a flat 5 per cent GST without ITC is the best option for buyers, it said.
""Even a small increase in sales on the back of reduced GST will give some relief to developers funding issues by catalysing sales to some degree. To that extent, developers will see some improvement in their balance sheets,"" Anarock said in a note.
The move is expected to benefit government also. The current 12 per cent GST prompts buyers to opt for ready-to-move-in properties which are exempt from this high tax.
A move to slash GST rates to five per cent will help attract more buyers to under-construction properties, on which stamp duty and registration can be charged, the consultant observes.
The government decision on reduction of GST slab to five per cent and three per cent for premium and affordable housing has been deferred to February 24.

NEW DELHI :
Property developers and consultants Sunday hailed the GST reduction on housing sales and termed the move as a ""revolutionary step"", saying it will boost sentiments and help the cash-starved sector in clearing around 6 lakh unsold homes
The GST Council Sunday decided to cut GST rate on affordable homes to 1 % without input tax credit (ITC) from earlier 8 % with ITC. The GST on under-construction flats, which are not under the affordable housing segment, has been reduced to 5 % without ITC from 12 % earlier with ITC.
Sales of under-construction houses were severely affected as there was no GST on completed homes. Developers had been demanding cut in GST rates as people were not buying under-construction units.
While most players welcomed the decision, some real estate developers, however, said that housing prices may increase as there will be no input tax credit available to realty firms.
""The reduction of GST on affordable housing to 1 % is a revolutionary step for Indian real estate. This move is a significant triumph for home buyers and will play a huge hand in boosting their sentiments,"" CREDAI President Jaxay Shah said.
The real estate industry is now set to leap forward with the revised GST rate and the enhanced ease of doing business, he added.
NAREDCO President Niranjan Hiranandani said the industry lauds the GST rate cut on real estate as a welcomed and positive move which brings a big relief to the home buyers and help to narrow down the demand mismatch gap.
This announcement gives an impetus to the affordable housing and enthuse homebuyers to close the sale deals, he added.
""The slash in GST rates gives the beleaguered realty sector the much-needed breathing room and will certainly help it maintain some forward momentum in 2019. Another booster shot given by the government is changing the very definition of the budget-range of affordable housing,"" ANAROCK Chairman Anuj Puri said.
Anshuman Magazine, Chairman & CEO, India, South East Asia, Middle East & Africa, CBRE, said: ""This is a huge relief for home buyers and the developers alike. The reduction in GST on under construction residential projects will further give much-needed boost to the industry.""
The reduction GST on under construction property will provide a significant boost in fuelling residential sales, JLL India CEO and Country Head Ramesh Nair said.
Knight Frank India CMD Shishir Baijal termed the step the most decisive move by the GST council with a clear focus on demand stimulation.
""This move will give the necessary fillip to the demand in under-construction segment, which has been suffering from low sales levels for last many quarters,"" he added.
Hiranandani, however, rued that GST on cement was not reduced from 28 %. He said developers will have a challenging time with no input credit available now.
Supertech Chairman R K Arora said this rate cut will provide a much needed impetus to the real estate market that is facing severe liquidity crisis.
CREDAI NCR President Pankaj Bajaj said, ""It is a great relief for both the real estate industry and the home buyer. There is no incentive to postpone the home buying decision anymore.""
PD Sundar, Business Head, Quikr Realty, said: ""This is a win-win development for both builders and home buyers given that the real estate sector has gone through a relatively tough period over the last couple of years.""
Gaurs group MD Manoj Gaur said the decision will boost housing demand as it lowers tax burden on home buyers.
Signature Global Chairman Pradeep Aggarwal said: “Today’s recommendations from the GST council is a major step towards housing for all.""
TDI Infracorp MD Kamal Taneja said: ""Applicable GST at 1 % for all properties up to 45 lakh and carpet of 90 sq mtr will cover majority of existing inventory and fresh launches"".
Gulshan Homz Director Deepak Kapoor said: “We can expect demand going up soon for under construction projects.""
Mahagun Director Dhiraj Jain said sales of flats up to  ₹45 lakh will increase.
PropTiger Chief Investment Officer Ankur Dhawan said: ""This is a very good news for home buyers, not only it reduces taxation for them but also makes it simpler. Now buyers need not worry about input tax credit and anti profiteering authority.""
However, he said developers will require recalculation of pricing if they had assumed certain input tax credit while setting prices post GST era.
Sushma group ED Prateek Mittal too felt that prices may rise in absence of ITC. Amit Modi, Director ABA corp, said the construction cost may go up in absence of ITC and demanded reduction in GST on raw materials like cement.

99,2019-03-03,ITC,"In November 2017, the GST council cut rates for both air-conditioned and non air-conditioned restaurants to 5%Under-construction properties and affordable housing are the latest segments under GST

NEW DELHI :
The government last month slashed the goods and services tax (GST) on the real estate sector, but along with that it also did away with the input tax credit (ITC), which experts and analysts feel goes against the very purpose of tracking the money trail and curbing black money.
Under-construction properties and affordable housing are the latest segments under GST, after restaurants, to have been denied ITC, by virtue of the rate cut, to 5% or below. ITC is the credit available for all taxes paid on inputs across the value-chain to make production transparent and efficient as well as create audit trails to curb tax evasion.
""It does go against the very spirit of GST. Restricting input is not a good idea for any sector, and particularly for real estate, which needs to be formalised more,"" Pratik Jain, Partner and Leader for Indirect Tax at PwC India, told IANS.
Anuj Puri, Chairman of ANAROCK Property Consultants, said after the rate cut and removal of ITC, developers may have to take a hit in their profit-margins, inducing them to resort to cash payments while purchasing inputs or raw materials. ""This will increase the scope of black money generation in the market,"" Puri told IANS.
According to Jain, the government slashed GST to 5 per cent and 1 per cent on the under-construction and affordable housing projects, respectively, and removed ITC as several real estate developers didn't pass on the availed tax credit to customers.
""It's more in the direction that it (government) wanted to give relief to the common man. But it is obviously not a good idea from a policy standpoint,"" he said, adding restricting input credit may incentivise cash or black money transactions in the sector.
Similarly, in the restaurant segment too there was a feeling that restaurants were not passing on ITC they availed to customers in the form of lower prices.
Mahesh Jaising, Partner, Deloitte India, said: ""The government's standpoint was that in the first couple of months, even though all the credit was being granted to restaurants, the base price of a menu was not declining. From the optics of customer, 18 per cent GST also felt high.""
In November 2017, the GST council cut rates for both air-conditioned and non air-conditioned restaurants to 5% from 18 and 12%, respectively.
Concluding that removal of ITC would not make much of a difference for customers, Abhishek Jain, Partner at EY, said: ""In these cases, it's a lesser evil because buyers in these segments, in any case, do not get the credit.""
According to him, the decision would have both positive and negative implications as it would increase demand but may not lead to return of cash transactions.
However, the GST council's suggestion to mandate a procurement cap of around 80 per cent of input from registered vendors may thwart untapped cash transactions, according to the analysts and sector players.
The council, while cutting rates on the real estate segment, sought to plug the loophole of having no ITC by making it mandatory for developers to procure 80 per cent inputs from GST-registered suppliers.
""I do hope after a couple of years, when GST settles down with more awareness in all sectors of industry and consumers, there could be a revisit to some of the composition schemes, as it involves credit denial,"" Jaising from Deloitte India said.
On the possibility of exclusion of ITC from any more items or segments, experts said such a move is unlikely."

Punjab cabinet Wednesday approved an amendment to the Punjab Goods & Services Tax Act 2017 to enable industrial units choose between Net GST incentives and incentivised SGST on intra-state sale.
The Cabinet meeting was chaired by Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, as per an official release.
With the new move, units which have filed their common application form on the 'Invest Punjab' business portal between October 17, 2017 and October 17, 2018 will be allowed to have one-time option to opt either for Net GST incentives or incentivised SGST on intra-state sale, it said.
Such units shall be allowed to exercise this option within 90 days from the date of the notification.
The incentivised State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) to be considered for reimbursement would mean that the eligible unit will be entitled to get reimbursement of SGST amount paid through cash ledger against the output liability of SGST on sale of eligible products.
The eligible unit shall first have to utilise all the eligible Input Tax Credit available in its credit ledger maintained on the common portal, including eligible ITC of Integrated GST as provided under section 49 of the Act as may be amended from time to time, before adjusting the SGST amount through cash ledger.

96,2019-03-07,ITC,"The company’s market cap has increased 6.9 times in the last four years to  ₹72,740 croreEffective April 2019, Britannia will become only the third fast-moving consumer goods firm in the index

What is the best thing to have happened since sliced bread? Whatever it is, Britannia Industries Ltd appears to be partaking some of it, going by the dramatic increase in its market capitalization over the past few years. The company’s market cap has increased 6.9 times in the last four years to  ₹72,740 crore and, with this, it has catapulted itself into the bellwether Nifty 50 index. Effective April 2019, Britannia will become only the third fast-moving consumer goods firm in the index, after industry heavyweights Hindustan Unilever Ltd and ITC Ltd.
In the past, investors saw Britannia as a bread-and-butter business, which was growing steadily. Now, product introductions and rising premiumization are driving higher-than-industry growth. With consumers shifting to higher value-added products, Britannia has positioned itself well with new launches. The company has been introducing newer variants of its biscuits and entering fresh categories, such as croissants. It has also been expanding its cakes menu.
All this has seen its revenue expand. Its December quarter revenue stood at  ₹2,827.40 crore, compared to  ₹2,558.3 crore in the year-ago period. The increase in sales of value-added products has also boosted margins. The Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin rose from 14.79% in December 2017 quarter to 15.79% in the latest quarter.
Lately, though, the Britannia stock has been experiencing a bumpy ride from its peak of  ₹3,467 in August 2018. It is already down 12.7% to  ₹3,027. Analysts attribute investors’ concerns to slowing revenue growth. Its year-on-year revenue growth rate has slowed in the December quarter to 10.5%. In contrast, revenue growth in the year-ago period stood at 12.9%.
Part of the reason for the stock’s stagnation is concerns over its ability to drive further margin expansion. Raw material prices have been stable largely due to the drop in food prices. “One of the big concerns is food inflation. Rising raw material prices will tend to impact margins,"" says Naveen Kulkarni, head of research at Reliance Securities.
A larger concern is the rich stock valuations, due to higher demand for consumer goods stocks. In March 2015, Britannia’s one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio used to be about 35 times. Currently, it is 51.8 times, which is 48% higher. Unless it can bake healthy growth rates in the future, investors might soon find the stock unappetizing."
95,2019-03-09,ITC,"The rate cut will induce buyers’ enthusiasm, though developers will face challenges as the input tax credit is now excludedMore properties from the premium budget now fall in to the affordable category, benefitting buyers mainly in cities like MMR and NCR, where property prices are high

The triple benefits offered to the real estate sector so far in 2019 are major booster shots that will not only improve sentiments of buyers, but also of investors and builders.
Multiple sops in the recent budget, banks lowering their interest rates, and the recent GST rate cut for affordable and premium homes gave the boost the realty sector needed to accelerate momentum.
Let’s look at the real gain that homebuyers will reap in cities such as the National Capital Region and Mumbai Metropolitan Region, where prices are exorbitantly high and any price reduction, even marginal, will boost buyer sentiments. The rate cut will induce buyers’ enthusiasm, though developers will face challenges as the input tax credit (ITC) is now excluded.
Additionally, cement continues to be taxed at 28%. Builders will either take a hit on their profit margins and not adjust current prices, or raise prices in the absence of ITC benefit and irk homebuyers again. Before builders rework their calculations, here is the cost of property before and after the rate cut.
Premium properties: Let’s assume a property of size 1,000 sq ft costs Rs. 5,000 per sq ft. With the old GST rate of 12% and ITC benefit, the buyer effectively paid Rs. 4.2 lakh as overall GST cost, assuming the builder honestly passed on the ITC benefit. If he didn’t, the GST payable was Rs. 6 lakh, an ambiguity of Rs. 1.8 lakh. Effective from 1 April, the new GST for premium properties will be 5% without ITC. Considering the same property parameters as above, the new GST to be paid by the buyer will be Rs. 2.5 lakh. Hence, you get a total benefit of Rs. 1.7 lakh. So, while buyers now have reason to cheer, the new rate cut has put builders in a fix. The exclusion of the ITC benefit to builders and failure to reduce the GST rate on cement or other main raw materials may cause developers to raise property prices after sales begin to improve. The result: renewed aggravation to homebuyers.
Some builders may decide to safeguard their profit margins and risk deflating the positive consumer sentiments by hiking property prices. Others may seek to use cash payments for input materials, thereby increasing the scope of black money in the market. However, the tighter norms and checks now in place could make such shenanigans difficult. The main benefit to builders in the near-term is increasing housing sales, which can help reduce their unsold stock substantially and improve their balance sheets to some extent.
Affordable homes: Changing the definition of affordable housing and extending the qualifying price range to less than  ₹45 lakh across the country was commendable. More properties from the premium budget now fall in to the affordable category, benefitting buyers mainly in cities like MMR and NCR, where property prices are high. A property sized 500 sq ft, priced at Rs. 3,000 per sq ft, currently costs Rs. 3,120 per sq ft including GST and the benefit of ITC by the builder.
Post the new rate of 1%, excluding ITC, the overall property cost will be Rs. 3,030 per sq ft, a flat reduction of Rs. 90 per sq ft. Reduction in GST rates will, to some extent, attract more buyers towards under-construction properties that were losing their sheen, compared to the ready-to-move-in properties that are exempt from GST.

91,2019-03-26,ITC,"The acquisition would strengthen Reliance Retail's readymade garments and accessories portfolio The deal between ITC and Reliance is estimated to be worth  ₹150 crore

Reliance Industries Ltd said on Tuesday its unit Reliance Retail Ltd (RRL) has acquired consumer goods company ITC Ltd's menswear brand John Players.
The acquisition would strengthen RRL's readymade garments and accessories portfolio in the fashion and lifestyle retail space, Reliance told Reuters in an email.
ITC sold the brand John Players and related trademarks and intellectual property to Reliance Retail as part of its restructuring plan, an ITC spokesperson said.
The two companies, however, did not disclose the financial details of the deal.
The Economic Times earlier reported that Reliance bought the John Players brand and distribution rights through 750 stores, in addition to 65 exclusive franchise outlets, for an estimated  ₹150 crore ($21.79 million).
Earlier this month, sources told Reuters that Reliance planned to grow the number of low-cost Reliance Trends fashion stores across India to 2,500 from 557 over the next five years and integrate them with its online business.
Reliance plans to diversify into e-commerce and expand in fashion as the conglomerate's billionaire owner Mukesh Ambani aims to grab a dominant share of Indian consumer spending in a struggle with rivals, particularly Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc's Flipkart.
Reliance shares climbed 1.6 percent while those of ITC were 0.95 percent lower in Mumbai trading.

89,2019-04-04,ITC,"Weak Q4 results may give FMCG stocks a reality check on valuationsSlowdown in the rural economy is seen hurting consumption growth

The slowdown in consumption demand is well known, but valuations of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies have remained lofty. However, if these muted demand trends rub off on the March quarter (Q4) financial results of these companies, investors may well finally wake up and smell the coffee.
After reporting strong volume growth for the past six quarters, growth is expected to falter in Q4. For Q4 FY19, analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd estimate revenue and net profit growth of 8.7% and 9.2%, respectively, far lower than the 14.3% and 14.8% year-on-year growth reported in the December quarter. These are aggregate numbers for FMCG companies on whom the brokerage firm has research coverage.
One of the reasons for this moderation in demand growth expectations is the slowdown in the rural economy. In fact, the rural growth multiplier to urban multiplier has come down sequentially to about 1.1 times from 1.3 times in the December quarter. That apart, an extended winter also means that demand for products that picks up with rising heat took some beating. Additionally, some hit on the demand can also be explained by the tight liquidity conditions.
“Volume growth for most staples will soften in Q4FY19,"" wrote analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 2 April. Within its coverage universe, the broker expects Marico Ltd to outperform with 9% year-on-year volume growth helped by a favourable base. This would be followed by Britannia Industries Ltd and Colgate-Palmolive (India) Ltd with 8% and 7% year-on-year volume growth, respectively.
In its pre-quarterly update on 2 April, Marico said: “While rural grew ahead of urban in the traditional channel, we believe consumption trends should be closely monitored in light of some sluggishness in wholesale in March."" The company said that it witnessed stable demand conditions and healthy offtake growth on the back of the competitive strength of its franchises.
Analysts expect Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) to clock a volume growth of about 5%. The base March 2018 quarter volume growth was much higher at 11%, representing a high base.
On the positive side, margins may get a leg-up because of some softening of input costs compared to the December quarter.
For investors, management commentary on demand outlook would be crucial to follow. Besides, a good monsoon may bring cheer for FMCG companies on expectations of better rural demand.
As pointed out earlier, valuations of consumer goods companies are high. According to Bloomberg, the Nifty FMCG index trades at 35 times estimated earnings for FY20. In that sense, the Q4 results could offer investors a reality check as far as valuations are concerned."

MUMBAI :
Private equity firm Warburg Pincus-backed Lemon Tree Hotels Ltd, India’s leading hotel chain in the mid-to-economy category by number of rooms, is diversifying into the upscale segment with the launch of a new brand this year, said a senior company executive.
The New Delhi-based hospitality firm, which listed on the domestic stock exchanges last year, is planning a soft launch of the new brand by September, Rattan Keswani, deputy managing director, Lemon Tree Hotels, said in an interview.
The first hotel from the new upscale brand will be at Udaipur, Rajasthan, he added.
The company is currently working on the new brand’s artwork and logo. He, however, declined to divulge the name of the brand, or the price points of the new hotel chain.
“Our larger piece will always be mid-scale and economy. We are not going to be in the luxury category. We will go one level above our Lemon Tree Premier,"" he said.
The new hotel chain from Lemon Tree will compete with brands such as Indian Hotel Co. Ltd’s Vivanta and Oberoi group’s Trident, said one person aware of the development, requesting anonymity.
Founded in 2002 by Patanjali Govind Keswani, Lemon Tree operates three brands—Lemon Tree Premier and Lemon Tree Hotels in the mid-scale category, and Red Fox in the economy segment.
With more than 5,500 hotel rooms across 33 cities, Lemon Tree is considered the third-largest hotel chain after Indian Hotels Ltd and ITC Ltd.
The company, which raised  ₹1,038 crore in March 2018, had said back then that it had plans to add 3,000 hotel rooms over the next three years.
Keswani said the expansion of the new hotel chain will mostly be an asset-light model. This includes signing management contracts with existing hotel owners instead of owning the properties.
At present, Lemon Tree owns around 60% of its existing hotel properties, while the rest is managed by the company.
“We would like it to be more asset-light because this kind of hotel (upscale) cost a lot of money. If we invest, it would be very selective. Through this new brand, we would like to attract hotel owners who are operating in this space,"" Keswani said.
Followed by the first property under the new brand in Udaipur, the company will look to launch the second in Mumbai. Besides, it has also lined up two management contracts for the new brand.
The past year has seen Lemon Tree in an expansion mode. The hospitality firm recently announced its entry into the rental housing segment. It has also signed a pact to acquire Keys Hotels from Berggruen Hotels Pvt. Ltd for an undisclosed amount."
86,2019-04-10,ITC,"The industry has suggested that the IGST rate on locomotives and rolling stock be increased to 18%It was pointed out that exclusion of railways rolling stock manufacturers from the scope of refund was against the principle of the fiscal neutrality

NEW DELHI :
The companies engaged in manufacturing wagons and other equipment for railways are pressing for rationalisation of the GST regime by allowing input tax credit on supplies made to Indian Railways.
In a representation to the finance ministry, the equipment manufacturers have argued that in absence of input tax credit (ITC) both vendors and Railways are suffering from avoidable burden of taxes.
It was pointed out that exclusion of railways rolling stock manufacturers from the scope of refund was against the principle of the fiscal neutrality - one of the main objectives of Goods and Services Tax (GST).
The industry has suggested that the IGST rate on locomotives and rolling stock be increased to 18 per cent, which is the pre-GST rate, so that the entire amount of ITC could be availed.
Alternatively, it suggested that the revenue department should remove restrictions on refund of accumulated unutilised ITC with respect to railway locomotives and rolling stock.
As per the industry, railways losing  ₹400-500 crore per month and the railway vendors too are losing an equivalent amount on account of not passing the ITC benefits. Therefore, the total loss to the railway ecosystem is more than  ₹1,000 crore per month.
Railways vendors also said that the discrimination and anomaly with respect to railways locomotives and rolling stock with respect to GST is contradictory to the policy of eliminating cascading tax effect and is also hurting 'Make in India' initiative of the government.

NEW DELHI :
Diversified group ITC has moved the National Company Law Tribunal against Hotel Leelaventure alleging ""oppression and mismanagement"".
ITC's current plea was mentioned before the Mumbai bench of the NCLT, which has posted the matter for hearing tomorrow, Hotel Leelaventure said in a regulatory filing.
ITC, along with the petition, has also filed two applications seeking waiver of the requirement of minimum threshold of 10%  shareholding, it added.
As per the latest information available on bourses, ITC holds 7.92% stake in Hotel Leelaventure.
However, the Kolkata-headquartered group did not share the reason for which it has moved NCLT against Hotel Leelaventures. When contacted, a company spokesperson said: ""The matter is sub-judice and therefore we would not like to comment (on it)."" On March 18, Hotel Leelaventure had announced sale of its four hotels located in Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi and Udaipur, and a property to Canadian investment fund Brookfield for  ₹3,950 crore.

MUMBAI :
The NCLT Wednesday issued notices to promoters of Hotel Leelaventure and its lender JM Financial ARC to reply to an ITC petition seeking a waiver of 10% minimum shareholding for minority shareholders to be counted in management matters and adjounred the matter to June 18.
Though the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) was keen to admit the petition of the tobaccos-to-hotels group ITC, which owns 7.92% in Leela, it did not do so citing procedural issues and decided to put the plea off to June 18.
It can be noted that the 10% minimum shareholding is defined under Section 241 of the Companies Act, 2013. There was a similar petition by Cyrus Mistry also against the Tatas after he was sacked as the group chairman in 2016, but the plea was dismissed by the Mumbai tribunal.
ITC is seeking a waiver of the 10% minimum shareholding requirement to file a petition alleging oppression and mismanagement against the hotel management and its lender JM Financial ARC and also to prevent the premium hotel chain from going ahead with the ongoing sale to Canadian fund house Brookfield for  ₹3,950 crore announced in March.
""We were suppressed of our rights as a shareholder. The postal ballot notice has not addressed many issues. It is a classic case of majority acting against minority shareholders using oppressive means, as they own 73 percent. ""We want protection for our shareholding so that the promoters cannot get away with a fraudulent deal,"" the ITC counsel Darius J Khambatta told the tribunal.
He noted that in 2017, JM Financial ARC bought the debt of Hotel Leela from banks and got 26 percent shareholding after converting the debt into equity. This led to the dilution of ITC's shareholding to below 10 percent, J Khambatta argued.
As per the information available with the bourses, ITC holds 7.92% stake in Hotel Leelaventure as of the December 2018 quarter.
Under Section 241 of the Companies Act, 2013 a minimum shareholding of 10 percent is required to file such cases.
The Mumbai bench of the NCLT comprising VP Singh and Ravikumar Duraisamy issued notices JM Financial and Hotel Leelaventure to reply within three weeks and file rejoinders in two weeks thereafter.
ITC said all major hotels of Hotel Leelaventure are being sold off excluding the flagship Mumbai property, which is facing a legal battle with the Airports Authority over land lease, and also a land parcel in Hyderabad which the hotel group is developing with Prestige Developers.
Under the deal with Brookfield, the Leela promoters will get over  ₹300 crore from the buyer under royalty and management consultancy agreements for the next five years.
""We are seeking deal details or the valuation report but the company is not co-operating,"" Khambatta added.
Meanwhile, Brookfield Asset Management Company also filed an application to be made a party to the dispute. Its counsel said, they will file an intervention application if they are not made a party to current petition.
In another development, Leelaventure in a BSE filing Wednesday said markets regulator Sebi has asked it to hold the sale of its four hotels and other assets to Brookfield.
The Securities and Exchange Board in a letter to Hotel Leelaventure said it has received representations from ITC apart from Life Insurance Corporation.
Earlier on March 18, Brookfield had agreed to acquire four hotels in New Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru and Udaipur, and a land parcel in Agra from Hotel Leelaventure for  ₹3,950 crore. The deal is yet to go through. The flagship Mumbai property is not part of the deal and together these five hotels have over 1,400 rooms.
JM Financial ARC had filed insolvency application against the Mumbai-based hotel chain in January, which owes around  ₹5,900 crore to lenders.
The Brookfield-Leela deal will also entail buying the Leela brand, existing and all its upcoming management contracts apart from absorbing the employees of these four hotels being taken over by the Canadian fund.

83,2019-04-25,ITC,"Hotel Leelaventures has struck a  ₹3,950 crore deal with Canada's Brookfield Asset Management LLC to sell four of its hotel propertiesITC has alleged that the Leela-Brookfield deal violated provisions of related-party transactions. LIC's objections could not be ascertained immediately

Mumbai: Capital markets regulator the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has barred Hotel Leelaventure Ltd from selling its assets, including four hotels, to Canadian investment fund Brookfield Asset Management LLC. Leela hotels, in a stock exchange filing on Wednesday, said it had received a letter from Sebi saying that the transaction should be put on hold, pending further directions from the regulator.
The company’s board had sought shareholders’ approval through a postal ballot on 24 April for the sale of its assets to Brookfield for  ₹3,950 crore. The assets include hotel properties in Delhi, Bengaluru, Udaipur and Chennai.
Sebi’s letter to Leela hotels was issued on the basis of complaints filed by two minority shareholders—tobacco major ITC Ltd and Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). ITC alleged that the Leela-Brookfield deal violated provisions of related-party transactions. LIC’s objections, through the ministry of finance, could not be ascertained immediately.
When contacted, spokespeople for Brookfield and Leela hotels declined to comment, as the matter was sub judice. ITC also declined to comment on queries from Mint.
According to the proposed sale agreement, the promoters and affiliates of Hotel Leela would be entitled to a consideration of  ₹300 crore from Brookfield on account of any intellectual property held, apart from certain business expansion services that the promoters have agreed to provide to the investor.
ITC alleged that the company had listed the transaction as an ordinary resolution, but it should be a special resolution, considering that Brookfield would become a related party after the transaction was completed.
“While Sebi is examining the representations in view of paucity of time and interest of investors in securities, you are advised that none of the transactions proposed in the PBN (post ballot notice) of 18 March are acted upon till further directions from Sebi,"" the markets regulator said in its letter to Hotel Leela.
The Leela-Brookfield deal is one of the few cases where Sebi has intervened on the basis of pleas by minority shareholders. 
“Sebi may have seen merit in the complaints. It does not act on every complaint by minority shareholders as they may not necessarily be contravening provisions of the Sebi Act,"" said J.N. Gupta, managing director of Stakeholders Empowerment Services (SES), a proxy advisory firm. “In this case, Brookfield does not have regulatory approval, but just a shareholder nod. If, at a later stage, Sebi finds merit in the complaint, then it would be difficult to reverse the transaction.""
SES had released a report on Tuesday advising public shareholders to vote against the Leela-Brookfield deal due to the lack of a valuation report and parallel transactions between buyer and promoters.
To be sure, even if Sebi rules there is a need for a special resolution, the transaction may still go through, given that JM Financial ARC, which holds a 26% stake in Leela, is expected to vote in favour of the asset sale.
To counter this, ITC, which has a 7.92% stake in Leela, has also approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) alleging oppression and mismanagement by Leela and its lender, JM Financial. ITC has argued that the deal is not in the interest of shareholders and has sought exemption from the 10% threshold limit for filing such a petition. NCLT heard the matter on Wednesday and posted it for 18 June.
The Mumbai bench of NCLT, comprising V.P. Singh and Ravikumar Duraisamy, issued notices to JM Financial and Leela and asked them to reply within three weeks and file rejoinders within two weeks thereafter.
The petitioners have been asked to approach NCLT if anything changes in terms of the Sebi relief or the company proceeds with the transaction.
“The charges of oppression and mismanagement are being levelled as the transaction creates a preference in favour of the promoters and lenders JM Financial ARC, as opposed to other shareholders of Leela. The deal is not in the interest of the other shareholders of Leela,"" a lawyer familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.
According to the petition before NCLT, the equity shareholding of Leela has made it impossible for any special resolution to be passed without the nod of JM Financial ARC.
In June 2014, Leela’s lenders had assigned about  ₹4,150 crore of debt to asset reconstruction companies and about 95.6% of the debt was assigned to JM Financial, while 1% was assigned to Phoenix ARC.
In September 2017, JM Financial acquired 26% of the share capital of Leela by converting a part of its loan amounting to about  ₹275 crore.
“With such acquisition of 26% equity shareholding, JM Financial gained significant influence over Leelaventure with no special resolution being capable of being passed without the consent of JM Financial. It is this conversion that resulted in ITC’s shareholding coming down from 11.78%,"" the petition said.
Darius J. Khambatta, the counsel for ITC, said the company was also seeking details of the Leela-Brookfield deal and the valuation report.
“But the company is not cooperating,"" he added."

MUMBAI :
Zinka Logistics Solutions Pvt. Ltd, which operates online freight service provider BlackBuck, said it has raised $150 million ( ₹1,050 crore) in a Series D equity funding round led by Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and Accel Partners.
While the Bengaluru-based did not disclose further details, a person familiar with the transaction pegged the pre-money valuation of the startup at close to $950 million, within striking distance of becoming a unicorn.
The Series D round also saw participation from several new investors, including Wellington Partners Technology, Sequoia Capital, B Capital and LightStreet, as well as from its existing investors—Accel Partners, US-based Sands Capital and International Finance Corp.
With the latest funding round, the total investment in the company to date has touched $230 million ( ₹1,600 crore). Significantly, the investment has come at a time when venture capital investments in business-to-business (B2B) startups have been on a rise.
On 9 January, Mint reported that the year 2018 saw 28% higher investments in B2B startups at $3.09 billion compared to $2.41 billion recorded in 2017.
“Currently, the market is fragmented and inefficient due to highly manual and opaque processes, leading to poor experiences for stakeholders across the value chain. We believe that with its technology-enabled approach to logistics and associated services, Blackbuck is well positioned to better serve the needs of shippers, fleet owners, and truck drivers,"" said Sami Ahmad, head of Asia for Goldman Sachs investment partners venture capital & growth equity team.
BlackBuck was founded in April 2015 by former ITC Ltd executives Rajesh Yabaji and Chanakya Hridaya along with transport industry veteran Ramasubramaniam B. It acts as a marketplace connecting potential customers with truck owners and freight operators for inter-city transport of goods. The company counts Tata Steel Ltd, JSW Steel Ltd, ITC Ltd, Asian Paints Ltd and Britannia Industries Ltd among its existing clients and operates over 3,00,000 partner trucks on its platform across India.
“With fresh funding in place, BlackBuck will deepen its presence across the national market by investing heavily into technology for improving its product and data science capabilities,"" said Yabaji, chief executive officer and co-founder at BlackBuck. “Long haul road transportation is a $150 billion industry for India. Despite being the market leaders in this space, we believe we are still scratching the surface,"" Yabaji said.
In its next phase of expansion, the company plans to offer additional services such as insurance and vehicle resale.
Zinka had earlier raised $70 million in Series C funding in March 2017 from Sands Capital, IFC, Accel Partners and Flipkart.

MUMBAI :
Tobaccos-to-hotels major ITC is planning to expand its dairy beverages portfolio to the rest of the country by the next summer and is eyeing a 5-10% market share in the first year of operations.
ITC's food division already offers fruits-based beverages for the past four five years and also dairy-based beverages which have been soft-launched in the South last December.
The company entered the ready-to-drink milk-based beverages market with the launch of Sunfeast Wonderz Milk last December. The milkshake market is around  ₹1,000 crore.
""We would be extending our dairy beverage business and will be launching across the country by the next summer. We expect to clock 5-10% of the  ₹1,000-crore market in the first year of operations,"" said Sanjay Singal, chief operating officer for dairy and beverages unit at ITC.
Kolkata-based company is also planning to export its dry fruits-based dairy beverages badam milkshake to Dubai and Saudi Arabia. The company had also rolled out packaged milk and curds under its Aashirvaad brand in Kolkata and Bihar.
Singal said the company would focus only in the Eastern markets for the packaged milk business in the foreseeable future, where there is less competition.
ITC on Friday launched three fruit beverages under its B Natural brand in PET bottles. It currently sells nine flavours of fruit juices in tetra packs and has a market share of 9-10% in the  ₹2,000-crore fruit beverages segment.
Singal also said within a month, it will launch vegetable juices and is evaluating opportunities in the water segment.

78,2019-05-08,ITC,"For the ongoing projects, builders have been given the option to either continue in 12% GST slab with ITC, or opt for 5% GST rate (1% for affordable housing) without ITCBuilders will be able to issue a 'Credit Note' to the buyer as per provisions of Section 34 in case of change in price or cancellation of booking

New Delhi: Builders will have to refund GST paid by home buyers in case he cancels the flat booked in the last fiscal and will be allowed to avail credit adjustment for such refunds, the tax department has said.
This clarification forms part of the FAQ released by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) on real estate sector.
The FAQ has been issued to clear the air over the migration provision, which permits the real estate players to shift to 5% GST rate for residential units and 1% for affordable housing without the benefit of input tax credit (ITC) from 1 April 2019.
For the ongoing projects, builders have been given the option to either continue in 12% Goods and Services Tax (GST) slab with ITC (8% for affordable housing), or opt for 5% GST rate (1% for affordable housing) without ITC.
The FAQ said developer will be able to issue a 'Credit Note' to the buyer as per provisions of Section 34 in case of change in price or cancellation of booking.
""Developer shall be able to take adjustment of tax paid in respect of the amount of such Credit Note,"" the FAQ said.
Giving example, it said that a developer who paid GST of  ₹1.20 lakh at the rate of 12% in respect of a gross amount of booking of  ₹10 lakh before April 1, 2019, shall be entitled to take adjustment of tax of  ₹1.20 lakh upon cancellation of the said booking on or after 1 April 2019, against other liability of GST.
AMRG & Associates Partner Rajat Mohan said ""this clarification though seems to have legal over-reach but would definitely help neutralise the tax burden which customers may face in the event of cancellation of old bookings"".
The FAQ further said that once a real estate developer opts for the either old GST taxation regime or the new one for ongoing projects manually with the jurisdictional Commissioner, he will not be permitted to modify it.
With regard to purchase of land from owner by the developer commonly termed as Transfer of Development Right (TDR), the FAQ said GST would not apply on agreements entered into on or after 1 April 2019.
However, for TDR agreements entered into prior to 1 April 2019, the developer will not be able to claim credit for the GST already paid. TDRs were taxed at 18% in the GST regime.
""Tieing in the liability to pay tax on TDR's based on agreements entered before 1 April 2019, irrespective of the fact that projects have been initiated under new tax regime without any tax credit, would result in a huge tax cost for already ailing reality sector,"" Mohan said.
The FAQ further said that all towers registered as different projects under RERA will be treated as distinct projects, for which the builder will have to maintain separate books of accounts.
In case a real estate developer has collected 12% GST from home buyers beginning 1 April 2019, but later opted for 5% rate, the builder will have to refund the extra tax (7%) collected to the buyer.
The FAQ, however, did not clearly spell out whether the 7% tax refunded by the builder will be adjusted against his GST liability.
Real estate firms have time till May 10 to communicate to their respective jurisdictional officers whether they want to continue with the old GST rates with input tax credit, failing which they will be deemed to have migrated to new tax rates.
PwC India Partner and Leader (Indirect Tax) Pratik Jain said ""developers need to carefully evaluate as to which scheme is more efficient and clearly communicate to the customers accordingly""."
77,2019-05-11,ITC,"Y C Deveshwar passes away today morning. He was 72In 2011, Y C Deveshwar received the Padma Bhushan, India's third-highest civilian award

Y C Deveshwar, chairman of ITC group, passed away on Saturday. He was 72. One of India’s longest-serving corporate chiefs, Y.C. Deveshwar took over as chairman of ITC group in January 1996 when the company was going through its worst crisis. Under Deveshwar’s watch, the company battled resistance from key shareholders to its diversification efforts.
Within two years of taking the helm, Deveshwar was forced to cut losses and get out of the edible oils and financial services business. Within four years of Deveshwar’s becoming chairman, ITC was again trying to enter new business segments. It started with stationery products and soon launched others such as food.
Through two decades of his leadership, ITC’s revenue had grown ten-fold—from  ₹ 5,200 crore to  ₹ 51,500 crore, while shareholder returns grew at a compounded annual rate of 23.3%, the company claimed in its statement to shareholders.
Also read: What an extension for Y.C. Deveshwar says about ITC’s ability to fly solo
ITC’s market capitalization at the end of 2015-16 was $45 billion, almost 50 times its market value in 1996.
“The way he has built the consumer goods business is unbelievable,"" says Sanjiv Goenka, chairman of the RP-Sanjiv Goenka group.
Deveshwar stepped down as chief executive of ITC Ltd, India's largest cigarette maker, in 2017. After that, he moved to the role of non executive chairman. He is survived by his wife and son.
He was also a director on the central board of the Reserve Bank of India
In 2011, Deveshwar received the Padma Bhushan, India's third-highest civilian award."
76,2019-05-11,ITC,"ITC's longest-serving chairman Y C Deveshwar passes away today morningTo Deveshwar, ITC was a national asset

Yogesh Chander Deveshwar or Yogi Deveshwar to his friends will have enduring remembrance as the man who became the face of institutional ownership in corporate India, otherwise dotted by family ownership where leadership is often decided by birth. Deveshwar, who breathed his last at the age of 72 years, was one of India’s longest-serving corporate chiefs with over two decades at the helm as the executive chairman and CEO at ITC, which he joined in 1968 and rose all the way to steer its bold transformation from a tobacco company to retail and FMCG major in the years following India’s economic liberalization.
The metamorphosis of ITC under Y.C. Deveshwar
In the process he fought a defining battle for control with British American Tobacco Plc (BAT), one of ITC’s largest shareholders, which wanted to keep things the old way. And at the height of the battle Deveshwar along with a few of his senior colleagues in ITC found themselves in custody fending off charges of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA). But he prevailed in the end.
Y.C. Deveshwar’s management style, in the words of his colleagues
Deveshwar later described the takeover battle saying, “Those days were not as bad as they seemed—they were worse"". But in his mind he was convinced that he had fought a hard fight to retain ITC’s Indian identity as he successfully rallied other investors, especially government-owned institutions, to back him in blocking BAT’s bid to raise its stake in ITC to 51% and take control of its cash flows.
Y.C. Deveshwar by the numbers
In his later years, Deveshwar had often talked about his legacy, which he hoped would be the model of institutional leadership and corporate governance at ITC, that he felt could be extended to India’s public sector undertakings (PSU) often plagued by bureaucratic inefficiency and apathy. To him ITC was a national asset and a perfect example of government and private partnership that could withstand the transient and volatile nature of Indian politics. Successive governments of opposing political ideologies have stood by him, extending him the same freedom and leaving ITC to its own devices. To many this would be perhaps be Deveshwar's legacy."
73,2019-05-12,ITC,"It is entirely to Deveshwar’s credit that 60% of the company’s net revenue comes from non-cigarette biz

NEW DELHI :
Some legacies are easy to assess, especially if they happen to be those of corporate chieftains. Check the growth in sales, the profitability numbers and the returns to the shareholders. Easier still, apply the standard test of the yield on a hundred rupees invested in the company at the beginning of the person’s tenure.
When it comes to Yogesh Chander Deveshwar, who passed away on Saturday at the age of 72 after a brave battle against cancer, these standard metrics aren’t wholly adequate.
Not because his scores aren’t impressive. The numbers, in fact, stack up quite nicely. ITC’s revenues over his 21-year tenure as chief executive officer (CEO) went up from  ₹5,200 crore to  ₹51,500 crore, while shareholders returns grew 23.3% compounded annually under his watch. That ensures his place in India’s business hall of fame.
The Padma Bhushan in 2011 signalled his importance to the nation as well, besides being a hat tip to the man who had repulsed all attempts by ITC’s largest single shareholder British American Tobacco (BAT) to take control of the Indian business. BAT still has a 29% stake in the Indian company, but its influence over the Indian business, following Deveshwar’s coup in 1996, has been minimal.
He had inherited a right royal mess that year when he came back after a brief but successful stint as the head of Air India to succeed K.L. Chugh as ITC’s CEO at a time when the Kolkata-based company was grappling with tax and trade-related disputes both within India and abroad. Deveshwar moved swiftly to resolve each of these issues using tact, firmness, and his legendary networking skills, especially in the upper echelons of government.
While the actual untangling took some time (it wasn’t till 2013 that the Supreme Court finally ruled in ITC’s favour in the 17-year-old excise case), those years were well spent as Deveshwar applied his genius to squeeze every bit of efficiency out of the cigarettes supply chain. At its heart, the business of selling cigarettes is simple enough—own the panwala, woo the customer and the market is yours. Deveshwar turned that into a fine art, urging his top managers to get out into the smallest of Indian towns to understand and address the needs of the distributors. Today ITC’s distribution network extends to nearly four million outlets directly and indirectly and is the bedrock of several subsequent business expansions.
Once the cigarettes business was sufficiently streamlined, Deveshwar turned his attention to leveraging this enormous distribution network and the company’s marketing skills for success in other businesses such as fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), hotels, paperboards & paper, packaging and agri-business.
Many of these had been seeded by his predecessors but it was Deveshwar who brought the strategic focus and the investment muscle needed to turn them into substantial contributors to the company’s top-line growth. If today nearly 60% of the company’s net revenue comes from non-cigarette businesses, and 56% of its $7.1 billion of export earnings over the last 10 years have come from agri-products, it is entirely to Deveshwar’s credit.
Ever restless, he also gave his support in 1999 to a project that aimed at helping farmers by using information and communication technologies.
Conceptualized by S. Sivakumar, who headed the agri-business division, it needed a strong backer. Once again, Deveshwar exhibited a rare quality to look into the future and back a good idea irrespective of its commercial possibilities. Today, e-Choupal is arguably the world’s largest rural digital platform with more than four million farmers benefitting from it.
In the years that followed, Deveshwar steered the company into products as wide ranging as potato chips and branded atta. Typical of his style of functioning, with each launch, it would storm its rival’s citadel, rapidly building brand recognition and market share. Its success at broadbasing its portfolio contrasts sharply with that of BAT, which remains almost entirely a tobacco company having had little success with its diversification attempts over the years.
That is also where Deveshwar’s legacy enters troubling territory. The inescapable truth is that much of ITC’s profits even after two decades of sustained diversifications, comes from sales of its cigarettes such as Classic, Gold Flake, Navy Cut, India Kings and Scissors. As much as we laud Deveshwar for setting ITC firmly on the path to complete dominance in its core business of tobacco, we have to be mindful of the harm the product itself has caused.
Given his nationalistic fervour, it would be fair to say he would have been happier if the move into the non-cigarette businesses that he charted early in his role as chairman of ITC had come to a fruition in his lifetime with ITC’s profits from other businesses large enough to allow it to slowly phase out the cigarettes business.
Brutally honest at all times and known to speak his mind, Deveshwar would have been the first to concede that in this respect his is a partial legacy.
The unfinished task of driving it to his avowed goal now remits to his successor Sanjiv Puri whose background is not coincidentally from the company’s FMCG business.
Deveshwar had also served as a non-executive independent director on the board of HT Media Ltd."

In a bid to rope-in more users without having to worry about the on-device space management and extravagant Internet usage, dating app Tinder is planning to launch its light-weight Tinder Lite app.
A Tinder Lite app would give it access to millions of people who have basic smartphones, limited access to data or both. 
As part of an earnings call, Mandy Ginsberg, CEO of Tinder's parent company Match Group, divulged plans for the Tinder Lite app which would be smaller and better-suited to areas where cellular data ""comes at a premium"", Engadget reported on Saturday.
Even though Ginsberg made no mention of features or a release date other than ""soon"", she pointed to the Southeast Asian region as high priority where there's an influx of young people into packed cities.
India, which has the largest population of millennials in the world, is also part of Tinder's target. According to information available on public domains, it is estimated that 50 million people worldwide use Tinder.
Several tech companies have made 'Lite' or 'Go' versions of their popular apps available for a large and rapidly growing online user base, especially in India. Google, for instance, offers its lightweight “Go""-branded apps—Google Go, Gmail Go, Files Go, YouTube Go, Google Maps Go and Google Assistant Go. Facebook Lite, Instagram Lite, Messenger Lite, Twitter Lite, Uber Lite, Spotify Lite and TikTok Lite are some other Lite variants of popular apps. 
Match, which is owned by billionaire Barry Diller’s IAC/InterActiveCorp, runs dozens of dating sites like Tinder, OKCupid, Plenty of Fish and Hinge. But the bulk of the company’s earnings gains were fueled by Tinder, which lured in more than 384,000 new subscribers in the quarter. Tinder's paid subscribers jumped 38% year-over-year (YoY) in early 2019."

68,2019-05-13,ITC,"ITC shares fell even though its profits beat estimates, with all segments posting strong growthThe cigarette biz reported 10% growth in earnings before interest and tax, the highest in 12 quarters

For ITC Ltd’s investors, reaching a high after a quarterly results announcement remains elusive. Shares fell 3% inexplicably after the company announced results for the March quarter.
While the results were better than expected, investors seem worried that higher costs and taxes would crimp profit growth in the future. This shouldn’t be surprising—you never know what danger lurks around the corner with cigarette companies. “A tax hike post the elections remains a key monitorable; we are building in 10% tax hike in FY20,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients.
Of course, none of this impacted ITC’s March quarter results. The company’s net profit increased by 19% over the same period last year to  ₹3,482 crore, higher than the Street’s consensus estimate of  ₹3,241 crore in profit.
What’s more, earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit) grew 10% in the mainstay cigarette business, the highest in 12 quarters. Volume growth is estimated at around 7.5% by analysts with average price realizations rising by about 3%. The company took two price hikes in recent months, resulting in an effective 3% price increase, analysts at Jefferies India said in a post-results note.
It’s important to note here that the cigarette division’s profit growth of 10% was slightly below revenue growth of 11.1%. As such, margins are under pressure, which analysts point out is due to an adverse product mix as well as cost pressures.
Despite forays into other businesses, the cigarette business remains crucial for ITC and accounted for as much as 84% of its total Ebit for the March quarter.
ITC’s fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) division delivered a strong performance with its operating profit rising 31% year-on-year after adjusting for one-offs. But like other FMCG firms, ITC sounded a note of caution on growth, especially in rural India.
ITC’s other segments: paper, agri- business and hotels all delivered strong growth as well, both in revenues and profits.
Overall, the company’s operating profit increased by a little more than 10% in the March quarter on a year-on-year basis. Strong other income growth and a lower effective tax rate resulted in relatively faster net profit growth.
ITC shares have lagged peers in the past one year owing to worries about costs and regulatory risks. As a result, the shares trade at 25 times estimated earnings for FY20, much lower than other consumer goods stocks.
Some analysts believe the worry about higher taxes may be overdone. “We like ITC’s focus to revive volumes in the base cigarette business with calibrated price hikes amidst a relatively softer taxation regime (no tax hikes since July 2017). Hence any tax hike in the future can be easily absorbed by consumers without impacting volumes,"" said analysts at Jefferies India."

Top US and Chinese trade negotiators concluded the first of two days of talks on Thursday to rescue a trade deal that is close to collapsing as Washington prepares to go ahead with plans to hike tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods imported from China. Tension between Washington and Beijing has risen after a major setback in negotiations last week when China revised a draft deal and weakened commitments to meet US demands for trade reform.
US President Donald Trump responded by ordering a tariff hike, and China has said it would retaliate. The 10-month-old trade war has already cost companies in both countries billions of dollars.
Meanwhile, major companies that will announce March quarter earnings this week are HDFC, ITC, Vodafone Idea, Oriental Bank, IDBI Bank, Union Bank, and Indian Bank.
Shares of State Bank of India are likely to be in focus on Monday. It posted a profit of  ₹838.40 crore. Last year, in the same quarter, the bank had posted a loss of  ₹7,718.17 crore. Provisions and contingencies of SBI surged 174.75% to  ₹16,501.89 crore during the quarter from  ₹6,006.22 crore a quarter ago.
Among macros, retail and wholesale inflation data will be released this week. India’s factory output entered negative territory in March after a gap of 21 months, contracting 0.1% to signal a slowdown in consumption, as well as investment. In February, the index of industrial production (IIP) was almost flat, growing at 0.1%.

70,2019-05-14,ITC,"Puri, who joined ITC in 1986, is expected to take forward the task of further diversifying the firm’s businessAnalysts say ITC has done well in diversifying its portfolio and little will change with Puri at the helm

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI :
ITC Ltd, India’s largest cigarette maker, on Monday named managing director Sanjiv Puri, 56, as its chairman. He will take over the legacy of Y.C. Deveshwar, the company’s longest serving chairman who died on 11 May.
Puri was set to take over the role by 2021-22, and was being mentored by Deveshwar for the post of chairman.
Deveshwar helped ITC diversify from a cigarettes company to one with business interests in retail, packaged foods, paper and packaging. He also grew its revenue ten-fold to  ₹51,500 crore during the two decades that he was at the helm of the company.
The task is now cut out for Puri, an old ITC hand, and an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur and Wharton School.
He has spent three decades working across various functions at the firm, including heading its subsidiary in Nepal.
Puri swiftly moved up the ladder to head some of the company’s biggest businesses, including its packaged consumer goods segment.
Puri, who joined ITC in 1986, is expected to take forward the task of further diversifying the company’s business.
It was under Deveshwar that ITC envisioned an ambitious target of growing its consumer goods business (non-cigarettes) to  ₹1 trillion in revenue by 2030 to reduce its reliance on the tobacco business. Cigarettes currently account for slightly over 40% of the company’s revenue.
However, higher instances of taxation and regulatory hurdles pose challenges to the sale of cigarettes.
For instance, tax incidence on cigarettes has nearly tripled between 2011-12 and 2017-18, according to a note by brokerage firm Jefferies.
Puri’s wide experience in working across roles, especially fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), where ITC hopes to generate more business from, is likely to help.
Puri started off as brand manager for various categories.
In 2001, he became a general manager at Surya Nepal Pvt. Ltd, ITC’s subsidiary in the neighbouring country.
In 2014, Puri was elevated to the role of president of the company’s FMCG businesses.
During this period, Puri also led the entry of the company into new business segments such as juices and dairy and spearheaded the acquisition of brands such as Savlon and Shower to Shower.
Analysts and industry observers who track the company say ITC has done well in diversifying its portfolio and little will change with Puri at the helm.
“I don’t think anything will change for ITC given the scale they have created, the cashthey have generated and given that they are open for acquisitions as well. I see no problem for them unless things get worse on the cigarettes front and, of course, cash flows get affected,"" an analyst with a Mumbai-based brokerage firm said on condition of anonymity.
“They have a longer-term view for the consumer business, they want to go for scale, which is great for long term and not for the near-term business and shareholders.""
“It was expected that this will happen (that Puri will lead the organization),"" said Naveen Trivedi, an analyst at HDFC Securities.
Trivedi added that ITC is on track to grow its non-cigarette consumer goods business further.
“What Deveshwar was able to do was bring in a big vision to the company,"" said another senior executive in the FMCG business, who did not wish to be named. “While their styles were very similar in the way they envisioned the future for ITC, the one difference was perhaps the way Puri was able to bring about more technology into the company. But I think what has been the standout aspect of Deveshwar has been efforts such as e-choupal and rural push. That could be hard to replicate,"" he added.
On Monday, the company also announced its earnings for the fourth quarter of the fiscal. Profit rose 19% to  ₹3,481 crore from a year earlier. Revenue rose 13% to  ₹11,992 crore.

65,2019-05-15,ITC,"The order was passed by the NAA based on a complaint filed by a buyer of a flat in 'Anand Vilas Project' The applicant complained that the benefit of lower taxes following roll out of GST from 1 July, 2017, was not passed on by way of reduction in prices

New Delhi: The anti-profiteering authority has found Delhi-based Puri Constructions guilty of not passing GST rate cut benefit, and asked it to refund  ₹15.90 lakh, to 92 home buyers.
The order was passed by the National Anti Profiteering Authority (NAA) based on a complaint filed by a buyer of a flat in 'Anand Vilas Project' of Puri Construction in Faridabad, Haryana.
The applicant had booked the flat on 9 May, 2017, and complained that the benefit of lower taxes following roll out of goods and services tax (GST) from 1 July, 2017, was not passed on by way of reduction in prices.
The effective pre-GST tax incidence on under-construction housing property was 15-18%, which was reduced to 12% with input tax credit (ITC) post GST roll out.
Later, the applicant wanted to withdraw his application saying that he was satisfied with the explanation provided by the builder, the Directorate General of Anti-Profiteering (DGAP) disallowed the applicant saying there was no such provision under the GST law.
On investigation, the DGAP found that out of the 512 flats constructed in the project, sale consideration was received only in case of 155 flats, making the buyers eligible for ITC benefits.
The DGAP found that out of these 155 flats, the ITC benefit was passed on to only 63 flat-owners and hence 92 flat buyers were denied benefit of rate reduction to the tune of  ₹15.90 lakh post GST roll out.
""The respondent (Puri Constructions) was directed to pass on  ₹15,90,239, along with interest at 18% per annum to these 92 flat buyers from the dates from which the above amount was collected by him from the buyers till the payment is made,"" the NAA said.
AMRG & Associates Partner Rajat Mohan said ""fear of anti-profiteering provision has kept a check on PAN-India GST fuelled inflation rate. With new government, we shall expect numerous changes in GST structure also, which would again highlight the need of a quasi-judicial body like NAA.

64,2019-05-16,ITC,"For the ongoing projects, builders have to decide either to continue with 12 % GST slab with ITC (8 % for affordable housing) or opt for 5% GST rate (1 % for affordable housing) without ITC

The GST Council had in March 2019 allowed real estate players to shift to 5 per cent GST rate for residential units and 1 per cent for affordable housing without the benefit of input tax credit from April 1.
GST on construction service relating to residential and related commercial apartments has gone through a sea change. From 1st April 2019, the effective GST rate is reduced to 1% from 8% for affordable category houses and to 5% from 12% for non-affordable category houses. However the reduced rate of output tax has come with conditions that No ITC would be available to the Builders, 80% of the project-wise purchases (barring few items like diesel, electricity, grant of development rights, etc) by the builder would mandatorily be required to be made from registered vendors, Cement should be purchased only from registered vendors, etc.
For a project that has commenced operations on or after 1st April 2019, the new scheme is mandatory where construction services are provided along with transfer of land. For pure construction services, an existing rate of 18% will continue to apply. Further, in case of Pure Commercial Projects, there will also not be any change in the GST rates.
However, for ongoing residential projects, the builders have an option to choose (Before 20th May 2019) either the new scheme or continue charging the old rates of GST. This decision would have a huge impact on the cost structure and future sales of promoter. If he opts for the new scheme of 1%/5%, the promoter needs to reverse the credit pertaining to un-booked flats and instalments not due, pertaining to flats booked as on 31st March 2019. However, if he opts for the old scheme of 8%/12%, no commercial impact is there in case the promoter would be able to collect 8%/12% from customers. Also under the old scheme, credit will be available on purchase and it will reduce the costs to some extent. It is also to be noted that the promoter of projects covered under RERA (Real Estate Regulations Act) may not be able to revise the price for the booked flats also. Hence the following may affect the decision making in case of a Builder –
1. If the price of the flat quoted to the customer is inclusive of taxes, then the new scheme may be beneficial for the builder. However, if the price quoted to the customer is exclusive of taxes, then the old scheme may be better for the builder.
2. If the project is almost completed i.e. 80%-90%, then it may be beneficial for the builder if he could pay GST under existing scheme. In this case a majority of inputs or input services would have been procured and credit on such procurements would have been availed. However, if the project is in initial stages of construction where major part of inputs or input services is not procured, then it may be beneficial for the builder to opt for new scheme.
3. If the project is at premium places wherein the essential cost component is due to premium value of land and construction cost and corresponding credit is not substantial, it may be ideal to go for new scheme.
4. In case the expected flats to be sold before receipt of Completion Certificate are not many then the New Scheme could be chosen. This is because in such cases, even in the exiting scheme, the credit attributable to unsold flats has to be paid back.
The decision should be made on a detailed analysis of figures on different aspects and also the qualitative aspects as to market conditions, customer relationship, clauses in the agreement, etc may be seen.
As for consumers, the new scheme looks to be a booster if all the costs are not passed on by builders to the customers by increase in rates.

NEW DELHI :
GST Network on Wednesday released a demo tool for the new and simplified return filing form which will be launched sometime later in the year.
The prototype available on webportal https://demoofflinetool.gst.gov.in/instructions gives stakeholders a feel of what the new return filing system will look like. GSTN also sought stakeholder feedback on the proposed offline tool.
It will allow users to use functionality such as drop down menus, invoice upload, upload of purchase register for matching with system created inward supplies.
In the proposed system of new GST return filing, a normal taxpayer would have to file form GST RET-1 (Normal) or Form GST RET-2 (Sahaj) or Form GST RET-3 (Sugam) on either monthly or quarterly basis.
Annexure of supplies (GST ANX-1) and Annexure of Inward Supplies (GST ANX-2) will be filed as part of these returns. All the outward supplies will be detailed in GST ANX-1 while GST ANX-2 will contain details of inward supplies auto-populated mainly from the suppliers' GST ANX-1.
Suppliers will have to file a detailed return in form GST RET-1.
Businesses which make supplies to only consumers (B2C) have to file return form 'Sahaj'. It includes details of outward supplies and inward supplies attracting reverse charge as well as summary of inward supplies for claiming input tax credit (ITC).
Besides, businesses making supplies to both businesses (B2B) and consumers (B2C) have to file returns form 'Sugam'. It includes summary of supplies made and tax liability, summary of inward supplies for claiming ITC, along with details of interest due and tax payment.
Stakeholders can share their comments on 'feedback.newreturn@gstn.org.in', said GSTN, the company which handles the technology backbone of Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime.
The new return filing format would replace the current requirement of filing final sales return GSTR-1; and summary sales return GSTR-3B.
The GST Council in July last year decided that the simplified GST return forms -- Sahaj and Sugam -- would be rolled out on a pilot basis from April 1, 2019, while mandatory filing across the country would kick in from July.
However, the pilot project was deferred as the systems were not finalised.
EY India Tax Partner Abhishek Jain said, “with this prototype being released, implementation of the new simplified returns is expected to be a reality soon.
""The companies would now need to ensure appropriate modifications are executed to their ERPs, business processes, etc. for culling out information to be disclosed and eligibility of input tax credits.""
AMRG & Associates Partner Rajat Mohan said ""users and developers are expected to use the interactive tool and give a feedback on the prototype, allowing users to use various functionalities including uploading of invoices and purchase registers""."

Mumbai: Hotel major ITC Tuesday sought waiver of the norms regarding minority shareholders in its case against Hotel Leelaventure in which it owns less than the mandated 10 percent.
The ITC counsel told the tribunal comprising VP Singh and R Duraisamy that as of now they hold only 8.72 percent in Hotel Leelaventure, which Canadian private equity fund Brookfield has agreed to take over for  ₹3,950 crore but that was because a part of its shareholding was converted into equity after the banks sold their loans to JM Financial ARC, which did the debt-equity conversion.
The Company Act provisions recognize only those with 10 percent or more non-promoters as minority shareholders.
Before JM Financial ARC converted its debt into equity, ITC had held 11.78 percent in the rival hotel company, which has been in financial crisis for long now. Brookfield, the promoters along with JM Financial ARC, which owns 26 percent after debt conversion, are proposing to sell 96.8 percent of the company.
After the sale, ITC alleged that large amounts will be paid to the promoters and JM Financial ARC will also benefit from the deal but the company will not receive any value.
Since other minority shareholders have very low shareholding in Leela now, they don't have the capacity to maintain a petition of oppression and mismanagement, therefore, ITC filed the case, it argued.
He said, ITC wants a waiver of the minimum 10 percent shareholding requirement clause for any minority shareholder to file a petition for oppression and mis-management against the management. And if Sebi decides to give a go ahead to the deal, they can fight the case on its merit in NCLT, he added.
To this, the Leela counsel said this is a grossly motivated and mala-fide move of a business rival which is trying to kill competition by taking over the company.
The value of their shareholding is negative as of now and they knew about the corporate debt restructuring scheme and JM's conversion of debt to equity but didn't oppose it as they abstained from voting on those issues, he added.
The tribunal will continue to hear the matter Wednesday.
Earlier ITC and LIC, which owns 2 percent in Leela had moved the Sebi seeking to stay the deal with Brookfield saying the  ₹3,950-crore will leave the holding company a skeleton as deal involves selling all the four key properties of Leela in Delhi, Udaipur Chennai and Bengaluru, and land parcel in Agra leaving only the Mumbai property, which anyway is under dispute with the Airports Authority over land ownership.
Following this, Sebi asked Leela and JM Financial ARC to put the deal, announced on March 18, on hold.

MUMBAI :
The promoters of Hotel Leelaventure and JM Financial ARC, which holds 26 percent in the bankrupt hotel group, Wednesday told NCLT that ITC's bid to stall their deal with Brookfield is an attempt to wrest the control of the premium hotel chain through the back door.
The counsel for JM Financial ARC said that even after knowing the financial health of Leela, ITC Hotels has been picking up stake in the company between 2008 and 2013, acquiring 13 percent.
""Through this petition they want to drag the matter so that the  ₹3,950-crore Brookfield deal falls through and to take over Leela for a song after sending it for bankruptcy.
""Their main aim is not to get returns on investment but to acquire the hotel,"" he argued.
""If the sale goes through, public money will be recovered,"" he said, adding JM Financial ARC will get only 6 percent and the rest will go to 14 banks most of them public sector ones.
Meanwhile, the promoters' counsel in their reply said this waiver application (of 10 percent shareholding to be considered as a minority shareholder) needs to be dismissed as, ITC's prayer is contradictory where on the one hand it is saying it still owns 11.78 percent even after conversion of debt into equity and on the other hand asking for the waiver.
""One cannot ride on both the horses,"" the counsel said, adding the tribunal should also consider continuity of the jobs of over 6,500 people if the deal with Brookfield is allowed to go ahead.
He also pointed out that from 2013 till 2017, ITC did not even vote when Hotel Leelaventure disposed off many of its properties, and after it began to take interest in the company only after media reports said the company would be revived and suddenly it woke up.
""ITC's intention is grossly mala fide,"" he added.
The NCLT will hear the rejoinder of ITC on June 24.
Earlier, ITC and LIC, which owns 2 percent in Leela had moved the Sebi seeking to stay the deal with Brookfield saying the  ₹3,950-crore deal will leave the holding company a skeleton as deal involves selling all the four key properties of Leela in New Delhi, Udaipur, Chennai and Bengaluru, and a land parcel in Agra, leaving only the Mumbai property, which anyway is under litigation with the Airports Authority over land ownership.
Following this, Sebi asked Leela and JM Financial ARC to put the deal, announced on March 18, on hold.
As of now ITC owns only 8.72 percent in Hotel Leelaventure and claimed that its holding came down from 11.78 percent after JM converted debt into equity after the banks sold their loans to JM Financial ARC, which did the debt- equity conversion.
The Company Act provisions recongnise only those with 10 percent or more non-promoters as minority shareholders who can sue the management for oppression and mismanagement.
The promoters along with JM Financial ARC are proposing to sell 96.8 percent of the company to the Canadian private equity player Brookfield.
Tuesday ITC while seeking the waiver of the 10 percent shareholding norms, had argued that since other minority shareholders have very low shareholding in Leela, they don't have the capacity to maintain a petition of oppression and mismanagement, therefore, ITC filed the case, it argued.
He said, ITC wants a waiver of the minimum 10 percent shareholding requirement clause for any minority shareholder to file a petition for oppression and miss-management against the management. And if Sebi decides to give a go ahead to the deal, they can fight the case on its merit in NCLT, he had said.

Investors are not high on cigarette-to-soaps conglomerate ITC Ltd at the moment. The stock has declined by 6.7% so far this fiscal year. In comparison, the Nifty 100 index has risen by 1% whereas the Nifty FMCG index has declined by 2.6% during the same time frame.
One of the reasons for the sluggish sentiment for the ITC stock has been general fears over any increases in tax rates on cigarettes and tobacco products, especially with the Union budget coming up on 5 July.
“We see a high probability of rational tax increases post two years of muted/low single digit tax collections from cigarettes to the exchequer,"" said a Deutsche Bank report on the March quarter results update last month.
While worries about higher taxation are weighing on the stock, investors would be relieved to see an all-round improvement in the company’s financials last year.
ITC recently released its annual report for FY19.
“We conclude that ITC’s disclosure levels are adequate and it boasts an all-round top-notch financial health—volume growth, free cash flows, working capital and EBITDA to operating cash flow conversion,"" wrote analysts from Edelweiss Securities Ltd on 20 June, commenting on the company’s annual report. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, is a measure of profitability.
Further, the contribution of the cigarette business in overall revenues has reduced in FY19 compared to FY18.
Still, Ebit contribution of the cigarette business remained pretty much constant at around 85%.
On the cigarette volume growth front, the company appears to have done well. While ITC does not provide volume details, analysts from Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd estimate cigarette volume growth for FY19 at 5.5%.
This comes after six years of weak performance in the measure.
As such, the base was favourable for FY19 and it is possible that the company could benefit from a favourable base for FY20 as well.
Sure, the non-cigarette portion of the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) business is ramping up well. Ebit contribution of this segment expanded robustly. However, the segment is too small to move the needle at the moment and as such, will take a while to contribute substantially to the company.
During FY19, ITC launched more than 50 new FMCG products, across categories such as foods, personal care and stationery products.
Meanwhile, valuations remain understandably lower than peers, given the high regulatory risks associated with the cigarette business.
Currently, ITC shares trade at 24 times estimated earnings for FY20. In comparison, the Nifty FMCG index trades at 34 times one-year forward earnings.
If tax-related developments do not disappoint over the year, valuations may get some room for expansion."
55,2019-07-01,ITC,"The system sends SMS alerts to promoters and directors of business and helps them to rectify the mistakesWith effect from 22 August, the facility for generating e-way bill will be blocked for businesses which do not file GSTR-3B for two consecutive months

New Delhi: The GST Network has developed a system whereby SMSes are being sent to promoters, directors and proprietors automatically in case of default in payment of tax, filing of returns or mismatch in ITC claims by the business entities, its Chief Executive Prakash Kumar said.
He further said that once the GST system generates ""red flag"" alerts, the information is also shared with the revenue department to alert taxmen to take appropriate steps.
""Wherever there is a difference between GSTR-3B and GSTR-1, GSTR-3B and e-way bill, reminder SMSes now go not only to the authorised signatories, but also to the promoters of businesses and directors on board. GST system automatically sends these SMSes three days after last date of filing of returns,"" Kumar told PTI in an interview.
The five system generated ""red flags"" include default in payment of tax and non-filing of GSTR-3B, and mismatch in the input tax credit (ITC) claimed by businesses vis-a-vis the returns filed by the supplier.
Discrepancy in GSTR-3B (summary returns) and GSTR-1 (supplies return), and generating e-way bill but not filing returns, are also the parameters based on which alerts are generated.
""This information we are also showing to the taxpayer on their dashboard. We started sending (SMSes) to promoters because maybe the promoters do not know. It may be the accounts guy or CFO who checks the dashboard. So we send it to promoters,"" Kumar said.
Once the alerts are generated by the system, the SMSes are sent to the promoter and directors three days after the due date of filing of monthly Goods and Services Tax (GST) returns.
The system sends SMS alerts to promoters and directors of business and helps them to rectify the mistakes as many times the promoters are not aware whether the returns are being filed timely and correctly by the officer concerned, he said.
Explaining further, Kumar said for big businesses which have not filed GSTR-3B by the 20th of a month, reminders are sent to promoters and directors on the 23rd of that month.
""Again we check whether they have filed by 10th of next month. This helps us a lot, because if SMS goes to promoters, it has impact,"" Kumar said.
The SMSes are sent every month and quarterly for regular and composition taxpayers respectively.
Separately, GST Network, the company which handles the technology backbone for the indirect tax regime, is also sharing information with the tax department about businesses which have not filed returns for two consecutive months.
With effect from August 22, 2019, the facility for generating e-way bill will be blocked for businesses which do not file GSTR-3B for two consecutive months.
Dubbed as an anti-evasion step, transporters and businesses are required to generate e-way bill for transporting goods more than  ₹50,000.
Currently there are 1.22 crore businesses registered under GST, of which 17.5 lakh are composition taxpayers.

54,2019-07-03,ITC,"ITC announced the launch of ragi flour and gluten-free flour under its Aashirvaad staples’ brandThis new range will be available in New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Chennai

New Delhi: Cigarette-to-biscuit conglomerate ITC Ltd on Wednesday announced the launch of ragi flour and gluten-free flour, among others, under its Aashirvaad staples’ brand as it seeks to cater to the growing demand among urban consumers seeking healthier alternatives to regular flour.
The three variants launched under the Aashirvaad Nature’s Super Foods range include a gluten-free flour, ragi flour and multi-millet mix flour. This new range, priced at a premium to regular flour, will be available in New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Chennai, the company said in a statement.
“The launch of Aashirvaad Nature’s Super Foods’ comes at a time when consumers are looking for products that are healthier options. Constant lifestyle changes among urban consumers is increasingly driving interest in back-to-roots, simple food. Easy-to-incorporate in daily meals, Nature’s Super Foods’ wholesome and healthy blends will help cater to consumers’ diverse nutri-wellness dietary requirements,"" said Hemant Malik, divisional chief executive, foods, ITC Ltd. To be sure, Aashirvaad already sells a multi-grain flour.
The brand that was first launched in 2002, crossed a turnover of  ₹4,500 crore in FY19, and today sells flour, spices, dairy products, and instant mixes.
ITC’s push to diversify its fast moving consumer goods portfolio that comprises Vivel soap, Aashirvaad dairy products, Bingo chips, Sunfeast biscuits etc comes at a time when the company is increasingly looking to draw more sales from its FMCG business and reduce reliance on sales of tobacco products. The company has set a target to draw  ₹100,000 crore revenue for FMCG by 2030.
Last year, ITC launched over 50 new FMCG products, across categories such as foods, personal care, education and stationery products, agarbatti etc, the company said in its annual report for FY19. It also forayed into dairy products under the Aashirwad brand to include packaged yogurt, paneer, and packaged rice to make it a staples brand.
Packaged food companies have been looking to add more nutrition and health benefits to their offerings. Biscuit-maker Britannia has been selling oats and ragi biscuits under its NutriChoice brand. Earlier this year, Bengaluru-based packaged foods company iD Fresh Food said it will sell organic 'idli-dosa' batter, as the company moves to serve consumers who seek more health benefits and transparency regarding the quality of food consumed."
53,2019-07-07,ITC,"Investors must stay tuned to management commentaries on demand conditions in the upcoming June-quarter results seasonManagement commentary can offer meaningful clues on rural demand conditions, impact of liquidity tightness

The Union budget has not made life any easier for consumer staples companies, which means demand worries in the near term will continue to be a major overhang for them.
“Expenditure on rural schemes and disposable incomes for low-end consumption are largely unchanged (from the interim budget) in the absence of a fresh stimulus,"" pointed out Varun Lohchab of Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a 5 July note.
The imposition of a nominal tax on cigarettes is slightly negative for ITC Ltd. What needs monitoring for ITC now is whether the goods and services tax rates change in the coming months. Separately, the government raised customs duty on gold from 10% to 12.5%, which will make the yellow metal pricier. As a result, consumers may shy away from shopping for gold, which Titan Co. Ltd’s investors won’t appreciate.
More crucially, investors must stay tuned to management commentaries on demand conditions in the forthcoming June quarter results season. As such, expectations are not high, which is understandable after consumer staples firms threw up a tepid March quarter performance owing to a demand slowdown.
“We expect the aggregate volume growth of FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) companies to further moderate in Q1 FY20 to ~5.3%, compared to ~6.1% in Q4 FY19 and 8.2% in Q3 FY19,"" wrote analysts from Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in a report on 3 July.
Some companies have indicated the emergence of some green-shoots in June even as the weak start to the quarter would likely mean restrained growth for the quarter as a whole, said analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities in a consumer staples June quarter preview report on 4 July.
Management commentary, therefore, can offer meaningful clues on rural demand conditions and the impact of liquidity tightness.
So far, commentaries are lukewarm. Quarterly updates of Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) and Marico Ltd were not heartening. GCPL said its domestic volume growth was in mid-single digits in the June quarter, which is more or less in line with Street estimates. In its update, Marico said the June quarter was characterized by moderation in the overall demand environment.
In a nutshell, there are hardly any triggers for FMCG stocks going ahead. It’s worth noting here that the Nifty FMCG index has declined 1.8% so far this calendar year. In comparison, the Nifty 50 index has increased 8.7%."

New Delhi: Cigarettes to packaged consumer goods conglomerate ITC Ltd on Friday reiterated its plans to expand its fast-moving consumer goods business by adding newer segments under its portfolio and even looking at strategic acquisitions, the company said during its 108th annual general meeting in Kolkata.
“To accelerate growth in the FMCG businesses, the endeavour is not only to fortify the existing categories towards delivering industry leading performance but also to foray into newer categories and sub-segments. This would be supported by multi-dimensional investments as well as strategic opportunities for acquisitions,"" ITC’s Sanjiv Puri told shareholders during his maiden AGM address as the chairman of the company.
The move is in line with ITC’s efforts to reduce its dependence on the tobacco business riddled with excessive taxing and regulation, and instead build a large stable of consumer goods brands to compete with the likes of Hindustan Unilever, PepsiCo and Britannia.
For the year ended March 2019, ITC posted a net revenue of  ₹44,415 crore, with profit after tax of  ₹12,464 crore. For the same year, the revenue for its FMCG-others business, including branded packaged foods, personal care stationery products, lifestyle retailing, incense sticks and matches stood at  ₹12,505.28 crores.
To be sure ITC already sells packaged foods, personal care, and stationery under its consumer goods portfolio, spanning brands such as Aashirwad, Sunfeast biscuits, Yippie noodles, B Natural juices, Vivel soaps, Bingo chips and incense sticks. Last year, the company also forayed into dairy products. Over 50 products were launched last year to strengthen existing categories and enter newer segments, the company said.
“In the last two to three years, ITC has expanded its FMCG portfolio by foraying into new segments. This includes the luxury ‘Fabelle’ Chocolates collection, dairy & dairy beverages under the ‘Aashirvaad Svasti’ and ‘Sunfeast Wonderz’ brands, frozen foods from the ‘ITC Master Chef’ collection, skincare with the premium ‘Dermafique' among others.
As a result, newer FMCG businesses contribute 25% to ITC’s segment revenue; while EBITDA for the segment jumped over 50% to  ₹688 crore in FY19, the company said on Friday. Some of its key brands also achieved scale. In the last financial year, its packaged foods brand Aashirvaad touched  ₹4,500 crore in sales; Sunfeast is over Rs.3,800 crores; Bingo! became a  ₹2,500-crore brand.
The company, said Puri, is also scaling its manufacturing infrastructure, by “investing in building state-of-the-art manufacturing infrastructure across the country to rapidly scale up the FMCG businesses..."" This includes the creation of 20 Integrated Consumer Goods Manufacturing and Logistics (ICML) facilities that will aid the company with economies of scale, freshness and close-to-market distribution.
ITC’s consumer goods reach six million retail outlets today, a network it will continue to expand, according to Puri. “Substantive investments are being made in expanding this network and in developing alternate and emerging channels such as modern trade, on-the-go, food services, end-to-end cold chain, e-commerce and so on.""

50,2019-07-18,ITC,"Nielsen has lowered its 2019 growth forecast for FMCG to 9-10% from its previous outlook of 11-12%In the first half of the year, growth in FMCG sales was 12%, lower than Nielsen’s earlier prediction of 13-14% for the same period

New Delhi: Market researcher Nielsen lowered its annual sales forecast for India’s packaged goods sector on Wednesday, as consumption cooled for the third straight quarter, led by a sharp rural slowdown.
Sales of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) grew 10% in the three months ended 30 June, Nielsen said in its quarterly insights report, down marginally from the year-ago period and down 3.4% from the preceding quarter.
“In Q219, FMCG value growth has dropped to 10% inching towards a slowdown; this follows the softening from the highs of Q32018 when the sector grew by 16.2%,"" Nielsen said in a statement. Nielsen follows a January-December year.
In the first half of the year, growth in FMCG sales was 12%, lower than Nielsen’s earlier prediction of 13-14% for the same period. For the second half, Nielsen expects growth of around 8%.
Nielsen lowered its 2019 growth forecast for FMCG to 9-10% from its previous forecast of 11-12%, citing macroeconomic factors such as slowing growth and the impact of a deficient monsoon. Within this, food categories are expected to grow at a higher rate of 10-11%, while personal and home care are expected to grow 7-8%.
India is an agrarian economy significantly dependent on rainfall, Sunil Khiani, head of retail measurement services at Nielsen South Asia, said at a press conference in New Delhi. “So, the distribution of rainfall is critical. Also, we have to see how GDP and inflationary trends play out that will have a huge impact on consumption.""
The slowdown in growth was more pronounced in rural markets, even as they continued to grow ahead of urban. “Rural is slowing down at double the rate of urban,"" noted Nielsen, something that could reflect in the upcoming June quarter earnings of some of India’s biggest consumer goods companies.
The slowdown in sales of FMCG products in the hinterland, accounting for 37% of spends for the sector, occurred at a sharper pace compared to urban markets. Rural growth dipped to 10.3% in the April-June quarter, down from 12.7% clocked in the year-ago period. Compared to the third quarter of 2018, FMCG growth in rural areas fell 9.7%.
“Rural India has historically been growing around 3 to 5 percentage points faster than urban on account of increasing affordability, availability and demand. However, rural growth is slowing down at double the rate of urban in recent quarters. This has brought rural growth closer to urban growth in Q219,"" Nielsen said.
The rural slowdown is most pronounced in north India, followed by the west. Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Assam are among the states leading the slowdown."

45,2019-07-29,ITC,"Firm will hire distributors to sell these brands via neighbourhood storesRIL will sell its store brands across categories such as staples, food, personal care and general merchandise

MUMBAI :
Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) will soon hire distributors to sell private-label brands owned by its retail unit through neighbourhood stores, as billionaire Mukesh Ambani aims to boost the contribution of the company’s consumer business, two people aware of the development said.
RIL will sell its store brands across categories such as staples, food, home and personal care and general merchandise, the people said on condition of anonymity. RIL sells these products through its retail stores under brand names such as Best Farms, Good Life, Masti Oye, Kaffe, Enzo, Mopz, Expelz and Home One.
Ambani, India’s richest man, wants to reduce the company’s reliance on the energy business. He expects the consumer businesses to contribute nearly as much to RIL’s overall earnings as the energy and refining businesses by 2025. As part of this strategy, RIL is taking on online retailers such as Amazon and Flipkart in the e-commerce segment and the likes of Hindustan Unilever Ltd and ITC Ltd in the offline segment.
“RIL is planning to appoint FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) distributors on a trial basis,"" said one of the two people cited above.
“A network of FMCG dealers will help RIL meet the logistics and delivery needs from online channels,"" said the second person cited above. RIL did not respond to an email sent on Friday.
After its fiscal first-quarter earnings on 19 July, RIL executives told investors that the company’s telecom arm, Jio, is likely to roll out its new commerce/kirana initiative and the fibre-to-the-home business this fiscal.
According to the people cited above, the commercial launch of these services is scheduled at the company’s annual general meeting on 12 August.
In the past, RIL has often chosen its annual meetings to make strategic announcements and release new products. While the JioPhone was launched at the 2017 AGM, 2018 saw the launch of JioPhone 2 and the unveiling of JioGigaFiber.
In April, Reliance Retail began testing its food and grocery app among a select group of users, largely comprising its employees. The company has also on-boarded local kirana stores in metro cities to receive orders from customers.
Reliance Retail operates neighbourhood stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets, wholesale, specialty and online stores. RIL has also initiated a pilot for assisted e-commerce at Jio Stores wherein store staff will take orders and the customer can collect/return orders from a Jio Store, RIL told analysts in a presentation on 19 July.
For its e-commerce venture, RIL has signed up local merchants offering them an O2O (online-to-offline) marketplace, a business model pioneered by the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Under the O2O model, a consumer searches for the product or services online but buys it through an offline channel.
RIL plans to consolidate merchants under an e-commerce platform. The merchants, in turn, will cater to the demand. This will help the company save costs and enter areas currently outside the traditional purview of e-commerce companies."
44,2019-07-30,ITC,"India’s apparel market will be worth $59.3 billion in 2022, making it the sixth largest in the worldThough growing, sustainable or slow fashion is still a small contributor to India’s apparel market

For designer Sunaina Sahani, 28, the meaning of fashion has changed in the past five years, since she started working with fast fashion brands. “A lot of fast fashion and volume-driven retail is not conducive to the changes that are happening in the environment. My first-hand experience working with a few of them made me realize that adopting organic fabrics and natural dyes is the way forward if we want to save our planet,"" she said.
Sahani only buys brands that retail apparels made from organic and handwoven material, and ensure ethical manufacturing process. Taking a cue from the increasing environment awareness and ethical fashion choices, a variety of big and small-scale fashion retailers, such as H&M, Wills Lifestyle, W and Akira Ming, are latching onto the concept of organic, or slow fashion.
These brands are creating clothing lines using organic material, natural dyes and designs that lead to minimal wastage and, in turn, cause minimum damage to the environment. The new trend addresses the concerns about the costs of the fast-moving industry, whose carbon emissions are estimated to be more than those of all international flights and maritime shipping combined. Although sustainable, or slow fashion, is still a small contributor to India’s apparel market, which will be worth $59.3 billion in 2022, it is the sixth largest in the world.
“Undoubtedly, sustainability is becoming a conversation among consumers, especially with the climate change issue. I feel it is a good start that brands are taking note of it,"" said Ankur Bisen, senior vice president, retail and consumer products, Technopa.
Today, textile production is the world’s second most polluting sector after the oil industry. The annual greenhouse gas emissions from textile production stands at 1.2 billion tonnes, says journal, Nature Climate Change.
Sunita Singh, 57, marketing head at an electronics company, says: “It helps to know that what you are wearing hasn’t hurt the environment. I don’t mind paying a little extra because I get the quality I want and, in a way, I support the organic movement.""
In February, ITC Ltd-owned fashion retailer WLS (formerly Wills Lifestyle) said that all its garments will be made of natural fabrics and will be fully biodegradable. Even threads, buttons and labels will consist of purely natural elements. “Evolved consumers understand the consequences of their actions—on themselves, their communities and the planet,"" said Vikas Gupta, divisional chief executive, lifestyle retailing business division, ITC.
TCNS Clothing Co. Ltd-owned apparel brand W has also launched a Yolo collection made from environment-friendly fabrics.
Global fast fashion brand H&M, too, sells sustainable clothing through the “Conscious"" line made from tencel blends, recycled polyester and sustainably-sourced cotton voile and linen blends. It has vowed to only use cotton from sustainable sources by 2020, and shift to recycled and other sustainably sourced materials by 2030.
“We have committed to become climate positive by 2040 for our entire value chain. We will work to reduce more greenhouse gas emissions than our value chain emits,"" said an H&M India spokesperson in an emailed response.
Apart from fabric, ethical practices also need to seep in through the manufacturing process. Slow fashion brands, for instance, ditch chemical dyes and opt for vegetable dyes and use water-based binders instead of petroleum binders for printing on cloth. Since organic fabric is not as elastic as factory-produced material conscious clothing tends to be mostly roomy or boxy which also need design innovation to be well-crafted.
According to Divya Ahluwalia, founder of fashion label Akira Ming which sells clothing made of khadi and silk with wooden, mother of pearl or coconut shell buttons on Etsy.com, design plays a huge role.
“The construction of the garment is such that it leads to minimal wastage and whatever scraps are left we use it to make patchwork cushions or donate it to non-governmental organizations to create up cycled products such as rugs,"" she added.
With fast fashion brands fuelling consumption among growing markets such as India, excess inventory and garment disposal by consumers continue to pose a serious question. “One brand, retailer or even a country can’t drive sustainability. All these efforts need to be formalised through global accepted policies and regulations that can drive sustainability. Sadly, we do not have any such policies for sustainable fashion,"" said Technopak Advisors’ Bisen."

New Delhi: ITC Ltd, India’s largest cigarette maker, on Friday reported 12.6% increase in its June quarter stand-alone profit, in line with Street estimates.
Net profit of the Sunfeast biscuits and Gold Flake cigarettes maker rose to  ₹3,173.94 crore in the three months ended 30 June from  ₹2,818.68 crore in the year-ago period. Revenue from operations for the June quarter grew by 5.7% from the year-ago period to touch  ₹11,502.82 crore, according to the company’s filings to the stock exchange.
A Bloomberg poll of 16 analysts pegged the cigarette-to-biscuit makers’ profit for the quarter at  ₹3,153.70 crore, with stand-alone revenue projections at  ₹11,758.90 crore. “The results were largely in line, with cigarette volume growth at 3% year-on-year,"" said Abneesh Roy, senior vice-president, Edelweiss Securities.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) stood at  ₹4,565 crore.
The company, which also sells personal care products, reported segmental revenues for the quarter.
While the cigarettes business of ITC grew by 6% to touch  ₹5,433.40 crore, earnings before interest and taxes for the cigarettes business was up 8%. Segmental revenue at the company’s FMCG-others business, which includes packaged food and personal care products, grew 6.6% to  ₹3,060 crore; the segment’s EBIT grew 55% to  ₹78.02 crore.
“Cigarette revenue and volumes growth was moderate, while cigarette EBIT growth was healthy at 8%,"" said analysts Naveen Trivedi and Siddhant Chhabria of HDFC Securities, adding that growth in the company’s non-cigarettes business was broad-based.
“The FMCG-others segment delivered a resilient performance during the quarter amid a marked slowdown in the FMCG industry across urban and rural markets,"" it said. This was largely driven by its branded food business.
During the quarter, the company added new variants to its brands, including a premium Fiama hand wash and a premium version of its Engage body perfumes. Chocolate brand Fabelle saw more additions during the quarter, while its packaged atta brand Aashirvaad, too, added new variants.
Cigarettes and consumer goods apart, ITC’s other businesses reported lower margins.
Revenue from the hotel segment grew 15% to  ₹392.59 crore “driven by the recently commissioned hotels, ITC Kohenur, Hyderabad, and ITC Grand Goa, Resort and Spa,"" it added.
Its paperboards, and paper packaging segment revenue was up 13%. Revenue from agriculture business was up 14.6% to  ₹3,611.23 crore. “The recent foray into the frozen snacks segment under the ‘ITC Master Chef’ brand, buoyed by encouraging consumer response, continues to be scaled up. However, lack of trading opportunities in oilseeds and pulses, subdued demand for leaf tobacco in international markets, relatively steeper depreciation in currencies of competing origins in recent years and adverse business mix weighed on segment results,"" the company said.
ITC’s results come amid muted consumer demand across the board. Last month research and insights firm Nielsen had revised its forecast for the country’s fast moving consumer goods market lowering it from its previous forecast of 11-12% to 9-10%.
ITC has been pushing to diversify its business as it seeks to expand its consumer goods business.
At the company’s 108th annual general meeting last month in Kolkata, ITC reiterated its plans to expand its fast-moving consumer goods business by adding newer segments under its portfolio and even looking at strategic acquisitions, in line with efforts to reduce its dependence on the tobacco business."
41,2019-08-02,ITC,"Maggi is currently manufactured at three plants in India with lines dedicated to the instant noodle brandThe new plant will come up in Gujarat

New Delhi: The local arm of Swiss consumer goods company Nestle will invest  ₹700 crore initially over the next two years to set up a new plant for Maggi noodles, nearly four years after the brand was hit by its worst food crisis in the country.
The construction of the plant will commence soon in Gujarat, the company informed stock exchanges on Friday. This will be Nestle’s ninth factory in India.
“The state-of-the-art, environmentally sustainable factory for Maggi noodles will involve an initial investment of nearly  ₹700 crore over the next two years,"" the company said in the statement.
This makes it the company’s first such investment in dedicating a new manufacturing facility for production of the instant noodle brand, after a nationwide ban in 2015 hit sales. India’s food regulator banned the sale of Maggi noodles for almost six months over allegations that the packaged food product contained more than permissible levels of lead and MSG. This forced Nestle to withdraw stocks of Maggi across India. However, the brand was relaunched later that year.
At present, Maggi instant noodles are manufactured at three plants in India with lines dedicated to the instant noodle brand. Two more plants partially produce Maggi. The new plant in Gujarat will further help boost the brand's sales.
Last year, the company announced that Maggi had attained over 60% marketshare since its withdrawal in 2015. Before the crisis, Maggi commanded a 75% share of the instant noodles market. It, however, touched its pre-crisis level mark in terms of value last year.
Maggi competes with ITC’s Yippie Noodles in India.
The company on Friday also announced its earnings for the second quarter ended June 2019. Profit for the maker of Nescafe coffee and Maggi noodles was up 10.8% at  ₹438 crore. Total sales for the quarter were up 11.35% at  ₹2,983.83 crore. Domestic sales growth for the company increased by 13.1%. “...We have now delivered 10 straight quarters of volume & mix led growth. Our continuing momentum is a testimony to the unrelenting efforts of our employees, partners and other stakeholders, as well as to our quest for consumer relevant, science based innovation and renovation,"" said Suresh Narayanan, Chairman and Managing Director, Nestlé India."

Hiramasa Kingfish is one of chef Julia Komp’s favourite creations, so it’s apt that this India-inspired dish with a tandoori masala, lentils and rambutan finds pride of place in her five-city culinary pop-up with ITC Hotels in India. Komp is the youngest female chef from Germany to helm a Michelin-starred restaurant and is infusing new life into the country’s fine-dining movement.
In her ongoing tour of ITC properties in Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Delhi, she is showcasing dishes inspired by different geographies. “I prefer to work with ingredients that are more light, fresh, fruity and spicy. The focus lies on the harmony between taste and visual details elevated to a perfectly balanced sensory dining experience,"" says Komp. And her India menu reflects this ethos.
While each course has a deceptively simple name, like “tomato"", “okra"" or “lamb"", it is wonderfully complex in flavour and combinations. For example, the“tomato"" is a delicate salad with ricotta and coriander and passion fruit, while the “lamb"" is a grill with Persian lime and baba ganoush.

38,2019-08-05,ITC,"ITC’s fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) business saw a revenue growth of 6% which is not extraordinaryThe cigarette business’ Ebit increased by 8% year-on-year during April-June

Cigarette-to-soap maker ITC Ltd’s shares touched a new 52-week low of  ₹257.65 on the National Stock Exchange on Monday. Not without reason. Its June quarter results, announced post market hours on Friday, are far from inspiring.
Volume growth of its mainstay cigarettes business, which accounted for as much as 86% of the company’s overall June quarter Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) is a key disappointing factor.
“ITC’s Q1FY20 missed slightly operationally as cigarette volumes grew 3% year-on-year (versus our 4% expectation), and cigarette Ebit grew 8% yoy (1% below estimate),"" said Varun Lohchab, an analyst at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd.
Kotak Institutional Equities’ analysts point out, “A modest volume growth despite two years of stable taxation could be due to share loss to illicit/smuggled volumes, higher competitive intensity in select sub segments and perhaps some change in consumer preferences.""
Cigarette revenues increased by 6% helped by volume growth and price/product mix. On the other hand, ITC’s fast-moving consumer goods business (non-cigarettes) saw a like-for-like revenue growth of 8%, which is hardly extraordinary. However, it is in keeping with the broader trends of consumption slowdown being witnessed in the economy.
Revenue growth from other businesses—hotels, agri, and paperboards, paper and packaging— was in double digits. The paper business posted an Ebit growth of about 12%. However, Ebit growth in the other two segments lagged relatively. Agri business Ebit increased at a slower pace of 4%. Depreciation relating to new properties impacted hotels’ profitability, resulting in an Ebit decline of 21%. For better or worse, contribution from these segments to profits is relatively smaller at the moment and as such doesn’t move the needle dramatically for ITC.
Overall, the company’s net profit of  ₹3,174 crore is marginally better than Bloomberg’s consensus estimate of  ₹3,153.70 crore. Note that a whopping 54% growth in other income to  ₹620 crore helped ITC’s June quarter net profit growth substantially.
The company’s shares eventually closed lower by 1.7% on Monday, a day when the Nifty 50 index declined 1.2%. The stock trades at about 23 times estimated FY20 earnings. Agreed, ITC’s valuations are not as demanding as that of some other consumer goods’ firms. But, the risk of an increase in cigarette taxes lingers.
“We believe that the slowdown of cigarette volumes and a possible tax hike may cause downsides to earnings. The recent stock underperformance limits downsides, but a tax increase in the near term would be negative, putting further pressure on its volumes/ Ebit,"" wrote analysts from Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd in a report on 4 August."

MUMBAI :
Cigarette-to-soap maker, ITC’s June quarter results were not particularly encouraging. The cigarette business, which is ITC’s mainstay, disappointed.
Varun Lohchab, analyst at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd, points out that “ITC’s Q1FY20 missed slightly operationally as cigarette volumes grew 3% year-on-year (versus our 4% expectation)."" Note that cigarettes form a big chunk of ITC’s profit contribution. For the June quarter, cigarettes accounted for as much as 86% of the company’s overall earnings before interest and tax, or Ebit. The cigarette business’ Ebit increased by 8% year-on-year during April-June. To put it in perspective, the growth was 1% below Jefferies’ estimates.
ITC’s fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) business saw a revenue growth of 6% which is not extraordinary and is largely in line with broader consumption trends, given the slowdown in the economy. Revenue growth from other businesses--hotels, farm, and paperboards, paper and packaging--was in double digits, which is nothing to complain about. However, the contribution from these segments to profits is relatively low at the moment. As such then, these segments don’t move the needle dramatically for ITC.
Overall, the company’s net profit of  ₹3,174 crore was marginally better than a Bloomberg consensus estimate of  ₹3,153.70 crore. Note that a whopping 54% growth in other income to  ₹620 crore helped ITC’s June quarter net profit growth substantially.
“ITC’s 1Q performance was soft versus its financial year 2019 show but in-line with FMCG peers,"" said HDFC Securities Institutional Research in a report on 5 August.
What’s more, outlook isn’t inspiring. “We expect 1Q growth trajectory to replicate over FY20, led by higher base of cig (cigarette) volume growth and consumption slowdown,"" said analysts from HDFC Securities.

Bengaluru-based Fireside Ventures, an early-stage venture investment fund focused on consumer brands, is in the process of raising a $100-million second fund, said two people aware of the development, requesting anonymity.
The corpus of the second fund will be more than double that of the first fund, said the people.
The VC firm’s first fund had a corpus of  ₹340 crore (approximately $48 million) and was backed by FMCG brands such as Unilever Ventures, Emami Ltd and ITC Ltd.
Premji Invest, Westbridge Capital, Mariwala Family Office, Sanjiv Goenka Family Office, and Sunil Munjal’s Hero Enterprise Investment Office had also invested in the fund. Led by consumer industry veteran Kanwaljit Singh, besides Vinay Singh and V.S. Kannan Sitaram, Fireside Ventures was founded in 2017. It has invested across segments such as personal care, processed foods, lifestyle and home products. Its portfolio include the likes of Yoga Bar, Samosa Singh, Bombay Shaving Co., Mama Earth and Vahdam Teas.
“It is well-positioned to announce the first close in a month’s time,"" said a Bengaluru-based investment banker, who is one of the people cited above. After the first close, an investment fund starts committing and deploying capital.
An email sent to Kanwaljit Singh, managing partner, Fireside Ventures, on Thursday did not elicit any response.
Earlier this year, the VC firm had said that it intends to create as many as 20-25 iconic consumer brands, with revenue of as much as  ₹1,000 crore per portfolio firm, over 10-15 years. To be sure, the fund’s focus has been on backing founders who are creating brands catering to the emerging millennial consumers.
At the back of this investment thesis is the country’s consumption market. India is expected to see a fourfold jump in consumer spend by 2030, according to a World Economic Forum and Bain & Co. report released earlier this year. Consumer spend is expected to surge from $1.5 trillion to $6 trillion. Also, the country will be a young consumer economy with 77% millennials and Gen Z.
“Fireside Ventures is a vertical specific venture fund and has an advantage as no one else has with such a strong sector focus on consumer brands. There are good opportunities to invest in this space,"" said Anil Joshi, managing partner, Unicorn India Ventures, a venture capital firm.
Joshi said consumer brands, such as Manpasand Beverages Ltd, which offers mango drink MangoSip; Cremica, a maker of cookies and other baked products; and potato chips maker Balaji Wafers, have been successful in creating a base of loyal customers for decades now.
“India has a large consumption story and, with the right product and price mix, there is a potential to become a success story. Interesting product offerings like Timla Foods (which makes flavoured pop-corn under its brand name PopiCorn) and MilkMantra (which offers natural milk products to urban consumers) have shown there are large opportunities to scale,"" said Joshi.
Joshi added that individual brands can scale fast provided they are funded right and for a longer period. “Their success can attract a lot of competition. Also, once proved as a model, the brand will need more funds to achieve a larger scale. With better logistics now, India offers opportunity to look beyond local boundaries.""
“Exit is not a problem for investors. There are strategic buyouts, and IPO opportunities,"" Joshi said."

Deliberations are at preliminary stage and may not lead to a formal offer, according to the people. ITC received an inquiry from an intermediary on Coffee Day and there has been no progress, its spokesman said in response to Bloomberg query. Coffee Day declined to comment.

29,2019-09-05,ITC,"The decision not to sell a stake in Coffee Day Global follows talks with potential suitors including ITC and Coca-ColaTo pare debt, the promoters are also exploring the possibility of inducting an investor in Coffee Day Enterprises

New Delhi: Promoters of Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd and its lenders have temporarily shelved a plan to sell a controlling stake in the unit that owns the Café Coffee Day (CCD) chain, two people directly aware of the development said.
The decision not to sell a stake in Coffee Day Global Ltd follows initial talks with potential suitors, including Coca-Cola and ITC Ltd, the people cited above said requesting anonymity.
“The promoters feel that they should first exhaust all other available options to raise funds before committing to the sale of the profitable coffee business, which remains the focus of the group,"" the first person cited above said.
Founder Siddhartha, who allegedly committed suicide in July under mounting stress and high debt levels, built CCD from a single café in Bengaluru in 1996 to India’s largest coffee chain with more than 1,750 stores spanning 243 cities. In the process, Coffee Day Enterprises amassed a debt of  ₹6,547 crore as of end March.
To pare debt, the promoters are also exploring the possibility of inducting an investor in Coffee Day Enterprises. The holding company includes Coffee Day Global (coffee business), Sical Logistics Ltd (integrated logistics), Tanglin Developments Ltd (real estate), Way2Wealth (financial services) and Coffee Day Hotels and Resorts Ltd (hospitality). In the year ended 31 March, Coffee Day Enterprises reported net operating revenue of  ₹4,264 crore, a 13% increase from a year earlier. Profit grew 21% to  ₹128 crore.
Soon after Siddhartha’s demise, Coffee Day Enterprises announced the sale of its Global Village Tech Park, owned by unit Tanglin Developments, to US-based buyout giant Blackstone Group Llp for  ₹2,600-3,000 crore in August.
“The group is trying to monetize other assets as well which include its holding in Sical Logistics and the financial services arm,"" the person second person cited above said. “The promoters feel that if these transactions conclude then there may not be an immediate need to sell the coffee business.""
In the last financial year, Coffee Day Global posted a 10% increase in its net profit to  ₹41 crore. Revenue grew 8% to  ₹1,468 crore. Mint reported on 30 July that Siddhartha was in talks to urgently refinance a large portion of his and his company’s outstanding debt taken in his personal capacity. The debt in question is around  ₹2,000 crore and is over and above the consolidated borrowings of CCD group.
“However, the family is cognizant of the group’s debt obligations and may revisit sale of the coffee business at a later date,"" the second person said.
“The promoters are in touch with the lenders, who have in turn agreed to extend the flexibility to Coffee Day Enterprises to explore sale of non-core assets for the next six months or so,"" the person said. “However, a potential sale will involve a formal bidding process and a bilateral deal is unlikely.""
A regulatory filing by Coffee Day Enterprises has pegged the value of the CCD brand at  ₹7,000-8,000 crore, which includes the coffee chain and more than 54,000 vending machines and over 500 express stores.
Shares of Coffee Day Enterprises fell by the maximum 5% daily limit on Wednesday after lenders invoked the pledged shares of the promoters. According to exchange filings, Edelweiss and IndusInd Bank invoked up to 5.24% of the company’s pledged shares between 1 and 27 August."

Private equity (PE) firm KKR on Monday acquired a 10% stake in CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd by invoking the pledge on shares provided as collateral for credit facilities extended to entities related to promoter Gautam Thapar.
The next few days are likely to reveal KKR’s plans for the company, given that there is no identifiable management at the moment, after the board removed chairman Thapar and the chief executive officer (CEO) also put in his papers.
According to stock exchange data, KKR India Debt Opportunities Fund II and KKR India Financial Services have acquired over 62.6 million shares in CG Power, from Vistra ITCL (India) Ltd. As on 30 June, Vistra ITCL held a 21.63% stake in the company.
“KKR India Financial Services Ltd and KKR India Debt Opportunities Fund II have, in exercise of their rights in respect of credit facilities extended to Avantha Holdings Ltd and its subsidiary Salient Financial Solutions Ltd and through the enforcement of pledges created by Avantha Holdings Ltd, respectively, acquired 50,736,588 and 11,938,021 equity shares of CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd through a transaction on the stock exchange,"" the PE firm said in a statement on Monday.
This translates into a total of just under 10%, the PE firm said.
In March, CG Power had said creditors had invoked 67.6 million pledged equity shares, constituting 10.8% of the company’s share capital, held by one of its promoters, Avantha Holdings. Vistra ITCL on behalf of debenture holders—BOI AXA Credit Risk Fund, KKR India Financial Services and KKR India Debt Opportunities Fund II—had invoked these shares.
Besides, in March, private sector lender Yes Bank had acquired 80 million shares, or a 12.8% stake, in CG Power on invocation of pledged shares of its promoter.
On 20 August, the board of CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd said the company will restate accounts after discovering “significant accounting irregularities"" and governance lapses, sending its shares plunging by the maximum daily limit of 20%.
Thapar was removed from CG Power’s chairmanship on 30 August. The company’s board is considering selling non-core assets and exploring various fundraising avenues to deleverage the company and optimize its operations.

Mumbai: Shares of cigarette makers surged on Wednesday after the Union Cabinet has approved banning e-cigarettes.
Shares of ITC Ltd rose 1.8%, Godfrey Phillips India Ltd soared 7.8%, VST Industries Ltd gained 1% and Golden Tobacco Ltd climbed 4.5% .
The Union Cabinet in its meeting on Wednesday approved the banning of e-cigarettes in the country.
Earlier, following an advisory from the health ministry, at least 12 states in India had banned Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS). Health officials have proposed jail terms of up to three years, with a penalty of up to  ₹5 lakh ($7,000), for repeat offenders against the new rules.
Punjab, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Jharkhand have taken steps to ban the use of ENDS, Mint had reported.
In August 2018, the ministry had issued an advisory to all states and union territories to ensure that ENDS, e-cigarettes, heat-not-burn devices, vape, e-sheesha, e-nicotine flavoured hookah, and similar devices that enable nicotine delivery are not sold (including online sale), manufactured, distributed, traded, imported and advertised in their jurisdictions.
The move came in the wake of the Delhi High Court taking strong exception to the Centre’s delay in coming up with appropriate measures to tackle the “new emerging threat"" of e-cigarettes in the country. Recently, the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), had also issued a similar order."

Morning Boost
I believe that the way you begin your day is what decides how it is going to end. I wake up at 6.30am, open the blinds, feed my pet rabbit and birds, wake up my daughters at 7am and see them off to school. Then I sip some tea while browsing the newspaper. For breakfast, I usually have muesli with cold milk thrice a week. Poha, eggs and fruits fill in for the rest of the days. On Saturdays, Aloo Paratha with butter is a must.
Fitness Files
I find gym too boring, so I usually alternate between yoga and taking walks. I also play tennis once in a while. High-intensity workouts don’t suit me, high-intensity sports do.
Sleep Log
Six hours of sleep works best for me. If work demands, I can go long hours without sleep. While travelling, I make sure I take power naps, drink ample coffee and adjust my schedule to get some sleep according to the Indian Standard Time.
Food For Fuel
I avoid sugar and processed foods, and eat a lot of hydroponically grown (without soil) veggies, including spinach, basil, kale and rosemary.
How I Find My Zen
I love spending time with my daughters and playing games with them. Other than that, I love listening to music, watching stand-up comedy and reading. Everyone has their own way of finding peace—I have recently started using Calm app, and it’s good."
25,2019-09-23,ITC,"Many brokerages have raised their earnings estimates for India Inc and Sensex and Nifty target after the corporate tax cutIt is important to see when FPIs will resume their buying spree: Analyst

Indian stocks markets today extended the Friday's rally by moving sharply higher. The Sensex rose as much as 1,426 points to 39,441 at day's high, adding to Friday's mammoth 1,921-point rally. The Nifty also rose to 11,694 at day's high today. On Friday, the government slashed corporate tax rates in a surprise move designed to woo manufacturers and revive private investment and lift growth from a six-year low. The move will cost the government  ₹1.45 lakh crore in the current fiscal year in terms of lost revenue. The Sensex settled 1075 points higher at 39,090 while Nifty settled at 11,603, up
Here are 10 updates from Indian stocks markets:
1) Banking, auto and FMCG stocks led the gains today. The Nifty Bank index rose 5.5% to reclaim the 30,000 level. Among the banking stocks, Axis Bank, Kotak Bank, IndusInd Bank and ICICI Bank gained between 6% and 7.5%.
2) The Nifty FMCG index rose 4.4% with gains led by ITC (+8%), Britannia (+7%) and HUL (+4%). The banks and the FMCG companies are immediate clear winners as they pay the highest tax, HDFC Securities said in a note.
3) Many brokerages have raised their earnings estimates for India Inc and Sensex and Nifty target after the corporate tax cut. Morgan Stanley has raised its earnings growth estimates for the BSE Sensex to 25% in FY2020, raising Sensex target to 45,000 by June-2020.
4) The BSE midcap and smallcap indices also participated in today's rally. The BSE midcap and smallcap indices rose nearly 3% each. Many analysts are betting on a rebound in midcap and smallcap stocks, citing valuation gap between largecap stocks and broader markets.
5) IT stocks saw some strong profit-taking after as analysts say that the benefit of the cut in corporate tax rate to 22% will be negligible or modest at best for IT companies in the current fiscal. Many IT services companies enjoy tax exemptions on revenues from special economic zones (SEZs). Infosys fell 5% while TCS 2.5% and HCL Tech 1.6%.
6) Analysts will be closely watching how foreign institutional investors will take the tax rate cut.""It is important to see when FPIs will resume their buying spree and how they are taking the tax rate cut,"" says Jimeet Modi, founder and CEO of SAMCO Securities. On Friday, FPIs had bought Indian equities of just  ₹30 crore (net) while domestic investors had poured in over  ₹3,000 crore.
7) Analysts say higher corporate profits after the tax cuts will help boost investment and demand. ""Lower taxes will improve the cash flow and profitability of corporate India. It will provide elbow room for higher investments which will boost demand in the economy. We don't expect corporates to share a benefits of lower taxes with consumers or employees,"" says domestic brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher.
8) Kotak Institutional Equities expects net profits of the Nifty-50 Index to grow 25% for FY2020 versus 15% earlier buoyed by the sharp cut in corporate tax rate. ""This assumes that companies will retain the bulk of the tax cuts; in reality, some of them will pass on some benefits to consumers,"" it added.
9) Automobiles, banks, capital goods, consumer staples, diversified financials and oil, gas and consumable fuels will be key beneficiaries of the sharp cut in corporate tax rate while electric utilities, IT and pharmaceuticals will see little or no impact, Kotak Institutional Equities said.
10) Other measures announced on Friday including that the enhanced tax surcharge introduced in July 2019 shall not apply to capital gains on sale of equity share which is subject to STT (Securities Transactions Tax) would go a big way in restoring confidence in the Indian equity markets, says Shibani Kurian, head of equity research at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company."
24,2019-09-23,ITC,"The stock touched a high of  ₹260.30 on the BSE and gained as much as 9.3%The stock’s market cap increased by nearly $3.66 billion

Mumbai: Shares of ITC Ltd on Monday surged over 9%, its biggest jump since March 2016, after the GST Council meeting did not announce any increase in cess on cigarettes.
The stock touched a high of  ₹260.30 on the BSE and gained as much as 9.3%, its maximum gain since March 2016. At 9.40 am, the scrip was trading at  ₹256.30, up 7.6% from its previous close. The stock’s market cap increased by nearly $3.66 billion.
Rivals, Godfrey Phillips India rose 2.56%, VST Industries gained 4.46% and Golden Tobacco advanced 4.3%
""No increase in cess and e-cigarettes ban announced earlier in the week is a big positive for ITC,"" said Jefferies India in a 23 September note.
""We now see a high probability of no cess hike in FY20, which would mark a second consecutive year of stable and rational taxation, which is helping recoup lost volumes from the illicit segment,"" Jefferies India added.
On 9 September, the government banned electronic cigarettes amid growing fears over the health risks posed by vaping. The government, on Wednesday, made manufacture, import, sale, distribution and advertisements of e-cigarettes a cognizable offence.
According to Jefferies India ban is also positive for ITC as e-cigarettes would potentially have resulted in a loss of market share in the medium term.
Given the sharp de-rating in line with global tobacco companies over the past couple of years and “the stock trading below -1 std dev valuation, the risk-reward seems attractive given an earnings boost of ~12% with the lower corp tax rate,"" the brokerage firm added."
23,2019-09-26,ITC,"Hotel Leelaventure’s voting results show the majority of the shareholders (89.12%) voted in favour of the dealThe sale was approved by Leela’s board in March, but was put on hold following Sebi’s directions over complaints by ITC and LIC

MUMBAI :
The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Thursday dismissed an appeal by ITC Ltd challenging the sale of Hotel Leelaventure Ltd’s assets to Brookfield Asset Management Inc, bringing the Canadian alternative asset manager a step closer to acquiring four luxury Leela hotels.
The sale, worth more half a billion dollars, was approved by Leela’s board in March but was put on hold following directions by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) based on complaints by ITC and Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC).
Hotel Leelaventure on Thursday posted on BSE the voting results of a postal ballot in the asset sale. The majority of the shareholders (89.12%) voted in favour of the deal, the results showed.
Sebi told Hotel Leelaventure in July to conduct a fresh shareholder vote seeking approval for the sale of the assets to Brookfield. Accordingly, the hospitality company issued fresh postal ballot notices to its shareholders on 13 August. It planned to declare the results on 18 September but did so on Thursday.
The markets regulator had also allowed JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co. Ltd, which owns a 26% stake in Leela, to vote on the deal.
ITC, which holds 7.92% in Hotel Leelaventure, had moved SAT challenging the market regulator’s order, rejecting its argument that the sale of assets to Brookfield should not be allowed because of related-party transactions.
The deal hit a roadblock after Hotel Leelaventure’s minority stakeholders, ITC and LIC, approached Sebi alleging that JM Financial ARC was a related party and could not vote on the board’s resolution approving the deal.
In an oral order on Thursday SAT rejected ITC Ltd’s plea. The Economic Times reported online that ITC is seeking to challenge the SAT ruling in the Supreme Court.
“This (order) means that the deal will be closed soon. There’s nothing much to be done now. This was the only thing holding up the deal. The deck has been cleared,"" said a person who is closely involved with the deal, requesting anonymity.
Email queries to an ITC spokesperson remained unanswered till press time. A spokesperson for Brookfield declined to comment on the tribunal’s order and the proposed transaction.
The hotel chain was earlier barred from declaring or acting upon the results as per an interim order passed by SAT on 13 September.
In March, Hotel Leelaventure had said that it was selling four hotel properties and a land parcel to Brookfield for  ₹3,950 crore, making it the largest ever hotel deal by value in India. The deal was finalized after more than a year of talks between Brookfield and stakeholders of debt-laden Hotel Leelaventure, which has been in the middle of a financial restructuring.
The luxury hotel chain owns five hotels, comprising more than 1,400 rooms, across New Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai and Udaipur. The deal excludes the hotel in Mumbai, but involves a land parcel in Agra.
As part of the proposed deal, Brookfield will buy the Leela brand, existing and all upcoming management contracts of Hotel Leelaventure and also absorb the employees of the four hotels.
The hotel company, set up by C.P. Krishnan Nair in 1986, had been looking to pare debt by selling its hotels, as well as some of its non-core assets, including land. The company had an outstanding debt of around  ₹3,799 crore as of 31 March 2018."

21,2019-09-30,ITC,"News flow on the potential sale of an 8% govt stake in ITC held by SUUTI has weighed on sentiments, say analystsSure, the tax cut gives ITC room to delay price hikes and that may prove helpful

ITC Ltd, whose mainstay is the cigarettes business, has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the cut in corporate tax rates. Since the tax rates were slashed, the stock is up 7%. But investors want more. That’s because, despite the recent appreciation in the share price, the ITC stock has lagged so far in FY20. For perspective: ITC shares declined as much as 15% compared to the flattish performance of the Nifty 50 index in the current fiscal year.
What gives?
For one, volume growth concerns remain high. ITC’s cigarette volume growth was estimated at 3% for the June quarter. The cigarette business accounted for 86% of ITC’s overall last quarter Ebit (earnings before interest and tax). As such, analysts have been reducing its valuation multiples for the cigarette business. One reason is that the valuation multiples of global tobacco firms are under pressure due to muted volume outlook and threat from e-cigarettes.
“We are now valuing ITC at a lower multiple for its cigarettes business at 20x vs 25x earlier on expectations of higher tax increases ahead given benign taxation over the last couple of years and also to reflect market apathy towards global tobacco stocks,"" said Varun Lohchab of Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 26 September. That is not all. Competition has been nipping at the heels of ITC. As Nitin Gupta, analyst, SBICAP Securities Ltd, said: “ITC is gradually losing ground as far as market share is concerned. Fierce competition from the likes of Godfrey Phillips India Ltd in north and west, and VST Industries Ltd in south is slowly eating into ITC’s market share.""
Sure, the tax cut gives ITC room to delay price hikes and that may prove helpful. This remains to be seen. Additionally, news flow on a potential sale of the 8% government stake in ITC held by SUUTI (Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India) has weighed on sentiments, said analysts.
That apart, regulatory concerns persist. While the goods and services tax (GST) Council has not increased cess on cigarettes on 20 September, the risk still remains. “The risk of an increase in GST/cess remains high, particularly because: The last increase was in July 2017, the burden of lower-income tax for corporates will have to be recouped from somewhere, unlike alcohol, which is not part of GST, cigarettes levies are under the purview of the central government and states may raise excise duties,"" said analysts from Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd in a report on 23 September.
Overall, ITC shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 22 times based on FY20 estimated earnings, as per Bloomberg data. The above-mentioned concerns could well keep a check on further expansion in the stock’s valuations."

18,2019-10-06,ITC,"Companies look to invest in budding consumer startups, which have not been hit by slowdownConsumer spending across consumer goods segments have fallen in past few quarters

Leading fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms and retailers including Haldiram’s, Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting Ltd, LuLu Group and Burman Family Holdings, the family office of Dabur India, are scouting for investments in consumer brand startups to boost growth in a weak economy, multiple investors and industry executives said.
Consumer spending across the FMCG and consumer packaged goods (CPG) segment have fallen sharply in the last couple of quarters.
Wipro Consumer recently launched a venture fund to invest in startups in the consumer brands space. A Wipro spokesperson said the company will look to invest about  ₹10-30 crore in early to mid-stage startups. “We will be looking at those startups where we can add value as well learn from them. Financial returns would be an important objective of the fund as well as adding strategic value, but all as a minority investor,"" the spokesperson added.
Dabur Group’s family office Burman Family Holdings’ has been evaluating startups in the branded consumer goods space, according to a person aware of the group’s investment strategy. Gaurav Burman, director of Dabur International and investor in Burman Family Holdings, said his family fund’s investments will be stage-agnostic with a long-term investment view. “We have no minimum limit on ticket size, although we will look to deploy at least  ₹70 crore per investment through the life of the opportunity,"" Burman said in an email.
LuLu Group, an Indian MNC that operates hypermarkets and retail chains has also been eyeing Indian startups in consumer goods, a consultant aware of the development said. LuLu Group did not respond to an email seeking comments until press time.
Haldiram’s, one of the oldest names in packaged foods space in India, is in discussions with multiple startups in the consumer brands space including Bengaluru-based Frozen Bottle, a quick-service restaurant (QSR) chain that sells milkshakes and desserts, Mint reported on 14 September. While big FMCG and CPG majors turn to consumer brands led by startups, their overall revenues have also been declining consistently in the past couple of quarters, amid an economic slowdown.
Dabur, Hindustan Unilever, ITC Ltd and Britannia Industries have acknowledged that the slowdown has hit their revenue, especially among premium portfolio brands.
A Credit Suisse report this month said the FMCG segment revenue is likely to decline by around 5% in the second and third quarters of 2019-20. FMCG revenue growth had earlier declined from 11% in the third quarter of 2018-19 to around 7% in the first quarter of the current fiscal, the worst revenue growth in the last 15 years.
Analysts and industry observers attribute falling consumer spending to not just low incomes, but also a lack of brand innovation, and failure to understand niche consumer needs, at least in Tier-1 and Tier-2 markets. The renewed interest displayed by traditional firms in startup-led consumer brands, is mostly steered by the fact that these brands virtually saw no impact of the economic slowdown.
“When you are the market leader with a 30% market share, slowdowns are scary. (But) when you are an insurgent brand with less than 1% market share and have a strong product and brand narrative, you should continue growing,"" said Deepak Shahdadpuri, founder and MD, DSG Consumer Partner. According to him, CPG start-ups are least impacted by the cyclical slowdown because they are doing between  ₹50 lakh to  ₹5 crore of net revenue per month. Between May to August from the DSGCP portfolio, companies like Veeba, Sleepy Owl, Arata, The Moms Co., Chai Point, Suzette Kitchen Garden, and Goa Brewing, did not see any slowdown, added Shahdadpuri. “It could also be because the companies we back tend to be in the more premium categories in Tier-1 cities where the slowdown has not had the same impact yet,"" Shahdadpuri added.
Vinay Singh, co-founder and partner at consumer-focused VC fund Fireside Ventures said his portfolio of brands across segments like personal care, clothing and accessories, and lifestyle, witnessed record month-on-month growth (in terms of revenues) in the last couple of months. Fireside Ventures had earlier raised money from ITC, Emami, L’Oreal, and Unilever to reinvest in consumer startups.
To be sure, if smaller brands which appeals to a niche consumer base escape the slowdown, then logically, big FMCG and CPG majors should also be emulating them, but that isn’t the case in the Indian scenario.
According to Harsha Razdan, partner, head of consumer markets at KPMG India, a large company with its vast distribution network is better off acquiring startups and layering their distribution network on top of the new brand, mostly because small brands are splintered in size and reach, which poses a logistics challenge."

MUMBAI :
Hospitality firm Hotel Leelaventure Ltd on Tuesday said it has completed sale of its hotel properties and operations to Canada-based Brookfield Asset Management Inc.
The Rs3,950 crore deal also marks the entry of Brookfield in India’s hospitality market in a big way.
The Mumbai-based hotel chain had announced in March this year that it has agreed to sell four of its hotel assets located in New Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai and Udaipur along with a land parcel in Agra. The deal excludes its fifth property, located in Mumbai.
In a filing to the stock exchanges, the hospitality firm said that it has received the total amount of Rs3,950 crore from Brookfield on 16 October 2019.
""...The entire consideration, net of transaction-related costs of  ₹70 crore were used to repay the banks and financial institutions who were lenders to the Company, in full and final settlement, as one-time settlement,"" the company said.
As part of the transaction, the Leela brand and trademarks in the hotels and hospitality space have also been transferred to Brookfield for Rs150 crore, the filing said.
On September 26, the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) had dismissed an appeal by ITC Ltd, a minority shareholder in the company, challenging the sale of Hotel Leelaventure's assets to Brookfield.
Following the transaction, Hotel Leelaventure also announced the resignation of its president Rajiv Kaul and chief financial officer Rajan Shah from the company. Instead, the company has appointed Umesh Dombe as the chief financial officer with effect from 23 October, it said.

ITC’s consolidated earnings were largely weaker than expected, but gains from the corporate tax rate cuts seem to be the saving grace. Reflecting this, the stock rose over 2% in trade on Friday.
Its core cigarettes business saw a decent growth with revenues improving 6.8% year-on-year to  ₹5842 crore. While this also implies that cigarette volumes have increased about 3% on key operating metrics, the growth may have disappointed investors. Besides, competition is nipping at the heels of ITC and may limit its pricing power.
“The cigarette division’s sales growth was similar to Q1 at 6%, indicating 3% volume growth and continuing loss in market share. We note that after the steep price hikes in the deluxe filter segment (64mm filter sticks) and several brand exits from Rs5 per stick price point, ITC’s cigarette volume growth has been impacted,"" said Emkay Financial Services in a note to clients.
In its other important FMCG businesses, which account for about 26% of revenues, sales grew about 4% year on year. While this is comparable to other FMCG companies, operating margins are still quite low, implying that ITC has not been able to make the desired improvement in costs.
Its hotels business has seen a healthy revenue growth of 17% year-on-year. ITC’s new properties are beginning to pay off. However, operating performance here has been weak.
Overall, Ebitda margin has improved by about 110 basis points to 38.4% in Q2 largely due to better product mix and operating leverage in its cigarettes business. Ebitda is earnings before income, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Besides, its net profit was boosted as the firm switched to the new corporate tax rate structure, which has led to substantial savings in cash. Net profit increased by about 36% year-on-year. However, profit before tax grew about 10% year-on-year.
Investors looking for a bigger puff in the earnings story may not find many positives. However, as the stock undershot the broader market over the last one year, valuations may seem fair. Going ahead, much of the growth will have to come from its profitable cigarettes business, otherwise the stock may not have much room for improving its price-earnings multiple.
“The stock has underperformed significantly and at current valuations of 19x FY21EEPS (earnings estimate per share), downsides appear limited. However, growth triggers are still missing and a possible increase in cigarette taxes remains a near-term risk to earnings,"" said Emkay in the note."

The BJP’s (Bharatiya Janata Party’s) under-performance in rural constituencies is reminiscent of the struggle it has been facing in multiple state elections since 2018, where adverse terms of trade have dented rural incomes,"" said Nomura Research in a note to its investors.

MUMBAI :
ITC Ltd, India’s largest cigarette maker, on Thursday reported a 36.16% jump in its September quarter stand-alone profit, beating Street estimates.
Net profit at the maker of Sunfeast biscuits and Gold Flake cigarettes rose from  ₹2,954.67 crore in the year-ago period to  ₹4,023.10 crore in the three months ended 30 September.
Revenue from operations for the September quarter grew by 5.31% from the year-ago period to touch  ₹11,871.47 crore, according to the company’s filings with the stock exchanges.
A Bloomberg poll of 24 analysts had estimated ITC’s profit for the quarter at  ₹3,641.60 crore, with stand-alone revenue projections at  ₹11,910 crore.
“The operating environment was rendered particularly challenging during the quarter with further deceleration in economic activity, accentuated by a drop in consumption, especially in rural areas, severe crunch in market liquidity conditions and disruptions/floods in several parts of the country,"" ITC said in a statement.
The company’s cigarette business grew by 5.9% to  ₹5,326.83 crore during the reporting quarter. Segmental revenue at the company’s FMCG-others business, which includes packaged food and personal care products, grew 4% to  ₹3,288.31crore; the segment’s Ebitda grew 39% to  ₹221 crore.
“The FMCG-others segment delivered a resilient performance during the quarter, which witnessed a further slowdown in consumption both in urban and rural markets. Categories with relatively higher rural salience were impacted the most,"" the company added.
The Kolkata-based firm said it continued to mitigate the impact of the slowdown through several proactive measures, such as enhancing direct reach, increasing the frequency of market servicing and introducing targeted offers for value-seeking consumers.
The company’s hotel business grew by 17.67% to  ₹426.63 crore, primarily on the back of the launch of three new properties—ITC Kohenur, ITC Grand Goa and ITC Royal Bengal. However, sluggish demand weighed on RevPar (revenue per available room) growth in most major markets, it said.
The paperboards, paper and packaging segment revenue was up 10% to  ₹1,565.42 crore, riding on the growth in the value-added paperboards segment. However, the packaging and printing business was impacted by a slowdown in the FMCG and liquor industry."

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Friday:
Bharti Airtel: The stock closed more than 3% higher on Thursday, having slumped 6% after the Supreme Court upheld the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) provided by the department of telecommunications (DoT). This came as a major blow for telecom companies as they will now have to pay  ₹92,000 crore in past dues at a time of rising debt and shrinking revenues.
Vodafone Idea: The stock crashed 23% on Thursday due to concerns over the telecom operator shutting down as investors anticipated that it will not be able to meet its payment obligations under the DoT’s definition of AGR. Vodafone Idea Ltd alone has to pay a massive  ₹28,308 crore as the SC ruled in favour of the government.
Indigo: InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, which runs India’s largest budget airline IndiGo, reported its first quarterly loss during the current fiscal as higher maintenance and overhaul costs outweighed an increase in passenger traffic. It posted a loss of  ₹1,062 crore in the September quarter as against a loss of  ₹652 crore a year ago.
SBI: The largest public-sector bank will announce its September quarter earnings later today. Shares were under pressure on Thursday after the SC rejected telecom operators’ definition of AGR. The bank has huge exposure to the sector and more financial stress for telecom companies would increase the risk of fresh bad loans for the lender.
ITC: FMCG major ITC Ltd on Thursday posted a 36.2% year-on-year rise in its standalone profit to  ₹4,023.1 crore for the quarter ended September. The company had posted a profit of  ₹2,954.7 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. The profit number, which was also boosted by a one-time tax credit of  ₹166.2 crore, was largely in line with the Street’s estimate.
Tata Steel BSL: The steelmaker released its earnings for July-September on Thursday. It reported a standalone net loss of  ₹255.9 crore for the quarter compared with a net profit of 60.7 crore in the year-ago period. The stock has been under pressure as its parent Tata Steel stares at uncertainty around a no-deal Brexit. Tata Steel has a significant presence in the UK and Europe.
Biocon: The pharmaceutical company has set a target of $1 billion for annual sales of its biologics business by 2021-22 (Apr-Mar). To achieve the aim, the company, among other strategies, plans to supply recombinant human insulin to diabetes patients in countries at low and middle income levels at less than 10 cents per day, roughly one-third the cost of current prices in these countries.
Tata Motors: The company will announce its earnings for the September quarter today. The stock may be in focus as the numbers will be announced at a time when the auto sector has been grappling with severe demand slowdown. The company’s sales had nearly halved to 36,376 units in September from 69,991 a year ago.
PNB Housing: The company announced its earnings for the September quarter on Thursday after market hours. PNB Housing Finance Ltd reported a 45% rise in net profit to  ₹366.8 crore in the second quarter-ended September of this fiscal. It had posted a net profit of  ₹253 crore in the same period last year.
Jubilant Life Sciences: The pharmaceutical company will report its July-September earnings today. Marico Ltd will also announce the numbers for the said quarter."

5,2019-11-11,ITC,"The restrictions on availment of ITC shall be on the basis of self-assessment of taxpayers, and will not be imposed through common portal

The government has allowed businesses to do self-assessment while claiming credits for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) paid on raw materials and services in cases where their suppliers have not uploaded invoices.
Businesses can claim only 20% of the total tax credits due to them if suppliers have not uploaded invoices and not paid taxes to the government, as per rules notified in October. A Finance Ministry circular on Monday showed that the authorities have decided to allow businesses to do self-assessment while complying with this rule, rather than enforcing it through making software changes in GSTN, the portal for filing returns.
The decision was taken as it was a new rule meant to improve compliance. Wrongful claim of tax credits is a big area of tax evasion that the government wants to address but it prefers to tighten rules only gradually to avoid a backlash.
A set of clarifications issued by the Finance Ministry on Monday said that it was the responsibility of the taxpayer to ensure that credit is availed of as per rules, adding that it shall be done on self-assessment basis by them.
Abhishek Jain, tax partner, EY said the clarifications seek to remove ambiguities as well as apprehensions of businesses. According to Archit Gupta, founder and chief executive officer of ClearTax., a taxpayer services firm, the new rule on restriction of credit will impact on businesses, big or small, as they will have a higher tax outgo if supplier has not uploaded an invoice. “Its critical that they regularly carry out reconciliation of GSTR-2A (an automatically generated return on purchases made) with books of accounts."""

Seven years after launching the fragrance brand Engage, ITC Ltd on Friday announced the appointment of Bollywood actor Kartik Aaryan and Tara Sutaria as it’s first endorsers. The company has also launched a new set of fragrances to augment the deodorant range with Intrigue and Spirit for Him and Her.
“ITC Engage, since its inception, has grown to become one of the most loved fragrance brands in the country. The brand has kept pace with the evolving needs of the consumers with its range of innovative offerings and experiences. Kartik Aaryan and Tara Sutaria embody the core brand value of Engage and we are happy to have them on board,"" said Sameer Satpathy, chief executive, personal care products business division, ITC Ltd.
The brand has also launched a new campaign ‘It’s hard to say Goodbyes’ featuring the two actors. Created by advertising agency Wunderman Thompson, the film is playful and weaves in the tease and the passionate chemistry of the young love. The narrative builds on the feeling of being inseparable in love which makes even bidding a simple goodbye very difficult. The television ad subtly threads in the lingering fragrances at the core of its story.
Tista Sen, regional creative director, Wunderman Thompson said, “This new spot captures what is truly the essence of a couple who are at the end of an evening out but make the moment of goodbye another expression that captures what being inseparable in love is all about. Moody and distinctive with a fresh appeal the couple Kartik and Tara embodies the playful chemistry which brand Engage is synonymous with. The poignant track adds another dimension and hits the sweet spot in this new launch of Engage Deo.""
Apart from television, the spot is also being promoted across digital and social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. Under the brand Engage, ITC retails both deodorants and perfumes. It has also recently launched pocket sized deodorants called Engage On in 2017. Engage holds nearly 11% of India’s deodorant market which stands at  ₹3,047 crore.

The Sensex ended 70 points lower at 40,779 while the broader Nifty settled 12,018, down 0.21%. The RBI today left its key repo rate unchanged at 5.15% and said it would continue with an accommodative stance after its policy meeting.
Banking and auto stocks led the losses today. The Nifty Bank index fell 0.83% to 31,712.95. IDFC First, IndusInd Bank, RBL Bank, PNB and SBI were down between 1.5% and 3%. Among the auto stocks, Hero MotoCorp, Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland fell around 2%. 
""A precautionary pause due to high food inflation and tepid pace in transmission of previous rate cuts prompted RBI to have more vigil on inflationary trajectory,"" said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.
Gains in heavyweights TCS and ITC helped cap losses. TCS shares gained 2% while ITC rose 1.5%. 
Expectations of a rate cut were fueled after India's economic growth slowed to 4.5% in the July-September period, its weakest pace since 2013. The Sensex has risen over 8% since the last rate cut in October, mainly due to measures such as reducing the corporate tax rate and hopes of more stimulus.
Ajit Mishra, VP for research at Religare Broking, said,"" We expect consolidation to extend further in the benchmark thus traders should continue with the stock-specific trading approach.""

1,2019-12-12,ITC,"In the last two months, the Kolkata-based conglomerate has launched many products under the ITC Master Chef brandITC had forayed into the Rs7,400-crore frozen foods market in 2017 with raw prawns

Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) major ITC Ltd on Wednesday said it was expanding its portfolio and distribution network for its frozen foods brand ITC Master Chef.
In the last two months, the Kolkata-based conglomerate has launched many products under the ITC Master Chef brand, with distribution networks across 60 cities. The products are available in retail stores, hotels, restaurants and banquets.
ITC had forayed into the Rs7,400-crore frozen foods market in 2017 with raw prawns. In 2018, it added 10 new products including fries, tikki and pizza pockets, but on a pilot basis, while fine-tuning its cold-chain and supply chain for the category.
Over the last 12-18 months the company was busy “putting together a supply chain, and understanding the dynamics of the category,"" said Sachid Madan, chief executive, frozen snacks, fruits and vegetables, ITC Ltd. In the last two months, the company added seven new variants to its retail or consumer range.
The focus, now, added Madan, is on expanding the penetration of the category by making it widely available to consumers and to the food services segment including restaurants, cafes and pubs across the country including tier 2 and tier 3 cities.
The company has 17 SKUs including Mumbai Vada Pop, Achari Beetroot Kebab, Chicken Galauti, that are currently being retailed through stores in 11 cities in India. In all, its frozen foods range has 50 variants that are largely sold to food services clients.
“The idea was to test the market a little bit. The whole hog started about 1-2 months ago,"" Madan said.
The company’s push to ramp up distribution of its frozen foods brand comes as the cigarettes-to-notebooks company is hoping to reduce its dependance on the highly regulated cigarettes market.
The company has set an ambitious target to generate sales of  ₹1 lakh crore in fast-moving consumer goods by 2030.
As a result, ITC has been releasing more products in the market. In 2018-19, ITC launched over 50 new FMCG products, across categories such as foods, personal care, education and stationery products, agarbatti and matches, the company said in its annual report. For the year ended March 2019, ITC’s fast moving consumer goods business stood at Rs12,505 crore.
However, the market for in-home consumption of frozen foods products is still limited. Madan added that generating consumer trial and getting consumers to buy these more repeatedly is a challenge.
“Perception among consumers is that it is not as good as fresh, and it lacks nutrition and it is not healthy and tasty and people don’t even want to try it. It is a category they are not interested in. We want to explode the category. We are doing that by offering new variants, going beyond potatoes,"" he said.
The company is now generating trials at retail stores and large office complexes.
In a recent study done on India’s snacking market, packaged foods company Mondelez said that snacks are increasingly being swapped for meals in India making a case for launching more packaged snacks here."
0,2019-12-24,ITC,"The cigarette business Ebit formed nearly 85% of the firm’s overall Ebit for the half-year ended SeptemberITC's cigarette volume growth for FY20 so far has broadly remained satisfactory

ITC Ltd’s investors have no reason to celebrate. After all, so far in 2019 the stock has declined by about 15%. This compares miserably with the 9% gain in the Nifty 200 index.
A couple of factors have weighed on ITC’s shares. For one, investors are worried that taxes on cigarettes will increase, considering that the last tax hike was two years ago. Furthermore, global tobacco stocks have been derated a lot, said an analyst, adding that ITC’s valuations reflect that. “The primary reason for ITC’s derating during the last two years has been the lack of double-digit Ebit growth in cigarettes,"" analysts of Antique Stock Broking Ltd said in a report on 18 December. Ebit is earnings before interest and tax.
Additionally, intense competition in the cigarettes space has been a problem area, too. Note that the cigarette business growth is crucial for ITC, as the segment is a large contributor to profit. For the half-year ended September, cigarette Ebit formed nearly 85% of the company’s overall Ebit.
“Even though ITC is looking to become a more diversified FMCG company, the non-cigarette segments contribute very little to profits,"" said Nitin Gupta, analyst at SBICAP Securities Ltd. ITC’s fast-moving consumer goods products are finding it difficult to make a mark in the market and the company has to invest more in this segment, which can keep its margin profile in other-FMCG segment sub-par, added Gupta.
To be sure, ITC’s valuations are compelling; trading at 19 times estimated earnings for FY20, based on Bloomberg data. On the brighter side, downside risks appear limited at this level. The moot question now is what are the triggers. Hereon, investors will have to watch out for news flow on cigarette tax hikes. A few analysts say a reasonable increase in tax could be helpful for the company. “We believe that a moderate hike in cigarette duties after a gap could enable ITC to take meaningful price hikes, which in turn provides an opportunity to regain the double-digit Ebit growth and trigger a re-rating,"" said Antique analysts. Besides, better cigarette volume growth may fetch brownie points as well."
