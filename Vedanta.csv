171,2018-01-09,Vedanta,"Kumar Mangalam Birla is bidding for US aluminium producer Aleris, while Anil Agarwal of Vedanta rewarded himself with a 20% stake in Anglo American, becoming its largest shareholder

It’s hard to believe it now, but once upon a time Indians had a far bigger appetite for outbound M&A than their Chinese rivals. 
It’s hard to believe it now, but once upon a time Indians had a far bigger appetite for outbound M&A than their Chinese rivals.
That was just before the 2008 financial crisis, which dealt a body blow to India Inc.’s global ambitions. Then, in quick succession, came the credit-fuelled growth of China’s state-owned enterprises; the yuan’s appreciation; a string of corruption scandals in India that bred a climate of distrust in 2013 and 2014; and the subsequent meltdown in commodity markets, which hurt the more internationally active Indian buyers.
The tables have now turned so comprehensively it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the rankings to reverse.
Even last year, when Beijing was clamping down on Chinese firms’ shopping for trophy assets—like Anbang Insurance Group Co.’s purchase of the Waldorf Astoria or Dalian Wanda Group Co.’s takeover of Legendary Entertainment LLC—mainland buyers still ended up committing $144 billion to assets outside of China or Hong Kong. India’s tally was a paltry $5 billion.
Still, as the juggernaut of Chinese M&A rolls on (minus the flashy deals for which communist leaders have developed a distaste), Indians may not be down and out for too long. 
That’s the message from Kumar Mangalam Birla, whose Mumbai-listed Hindalco Industries Ltd is bidding for US aluminium producer Aleris Corp. According to Bloomberg reporters George Smith Alexander and Bhuma Shrivastava, the deal could value Aleris at about $2.5 billion, including debt. The last time Birla attempted anything this bold was when he paid $5.7 billion for Novelis Inc., the vehicle he’s using now to buy Aleris. That was 11 years ago.
The timing is impeccable. The automotive aluminium market is forecast to grow at a rate of 8.8% a year in the decade through 2026, driven by tougher fuel-economy standards. More than 40,000 new commercial jets will be delivered over the two decades through 2036, according to Boeing Co., representing another major source of aluminium demand.
Forecast annual expansion of aluminium market to 2026
Alcoa Inc.’s 2016 split from Arconic Inc. was predicated on the idea that the latter’s downstream business—which, like Aleris, provides specialized parts to key industrial users—would outperform the other unit’s smelting of commoditized primary aluminium.
Then on Thursday, Birla announced a plan to pump a little more than $500 million into his highly leveraged Indian telecom venture, which continues to hemorrhage amid intense competition from billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
Confident that his Idea Cellular Ltd, which is merging with the local unit of Vodafone Plc, will be among three mobile operators to survive the bloodbath, Birla is bringing in fresh equity.
This signals an inflection point. In 2013, the scion of the 150-year-old business family caused a flutter by telling Bloomberg News that India’s heightened uncertainty and lack of policy transparency were the worst among the 36 countries in which the group operated; he would rather invest overseas, Birla said then.
He didn’t quite make that splash abroad. Unlike Thai tycoons who are buying insurance against military control of their country by acquiring assets from Singapore to Vietnam and Myanmar, it’s important for the likes of Birla and the Tata group to do well at home—that’s what gives Indian entrepreneurs the confidence to make big moves overseas.
Take Anil Agarwal. Just two years ago, 2019 dollar bonds of the aluminium czar’s Vedanta Resources Plc were trading at less than 50 cents on the dollar.
After zinc prices doubled in a year, Agarwal came back as strong as his bond, and rewarded himself with a 20% stake in London-listed Anglo American Plc, becoming its largest shareholder. Nobody knows what he wants to do with Anglo. For clues, though, watch his bid to put together an Indian steel empire by plucking assets out of bankruptcy. If he’s successful, Agarwal could launch a global play in mining and metals.
The other Agrawal to watch spells his name like that. The first challenge for Saurabh Agrawal, who left Birla’s camp last year to become chief financial officer of the $105 billion Tata group, was to exit telecom and stabilize a troubled European steel unit. As cost savings from merging that business with Thyssenkrupp AG’s metals division materialize, expect Agrawal to slowly put Tata, the owner of Jaguar Land Rover and Tetley tea, back in the game as a buyer of global assets.
It’s hard to predict the timing, but bankers should be getting ready to say hello to Indian billionaires. They’re coming back. Bloomberg Gadfly"

169,2018-01-18,Vedanta,"Apart from Vedanta, a Japanese metals company may also join the race for acquiring Aleris

Mumbai: Mining mogul Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Resources Plc. is considering a bid for Aleris Corp., a move that may pit it against Hindalco Industries Ltd’s $2.5 billion bid for the US-based aluminium products maker, two people aware of the development said. 
Mumbai: Mining mogul Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Resources Plc. is considering a bid for Aleris Corp., a move that may pit it against Hindalco Industries Ltd’s $2.5 billion bid for the US-based aluminium products maker, two people aware of the development said.
Apart from Vedanta, a Japanese metals company may also join the contest for Aleris, a third person familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity. The name of the Japanese company could not immediately be ascertained. 
“While there is no certainty that Vedanta will eventually make a bid for Aleris, competitive bidding, if it happens, can make the deal expensive for the acquirer,"" said one of the two people cited in the first instance, requesting anonymity.
Requests for comment sent to Vedanta group remained unanswered until press time on Wednesday. A spokesperson for the Aditya Birla Group, of which Hindalco Industries is a part, said that “in line with our policy we do not comment on market stories"". A spokesperson for Aleris said the company did not comment or speculate on rumours.
Vedanta Resources has mines across the world and oil and gas operations in three countries. Its main products are copper, zinc, aluminium, lead, iron ore and petroleum. 
Vedanta group, which has raised close to $2 billion in the past one year, has been on an acquisitive mode in India as well and has shown interest in at least two distressed steel companies. 
Mint reported in December that Vedanta group was among the potential suitors for debt-laden Essar Steel Ltd, which is currently under corporate insolvency proceedings.
Apart from Essar Steel, Vedanta has also made a bid to acquire Electrosteel Steels Ltd, which is also under corporate insolvency proceedings, the people cited above said.
Mint reported in September that the Aditya Birla Group was among potential bidders for the Cleveland, Ohio-based Aleris for which the group was looking to assign a $2.5 billion enterprise value.
The offer is expected to include an investment of close to $1 billion through equity and debt, and refinancing of the company’s debt of around $1.5 billion, Mint reported, citing people aware of the matter. 
Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Hindalco Industries had made a non-binding offer for Aleris through its US unit Novelis Inc. 
“The transaction is likely to be driven from the US by Novelis, which will raise bulk of the acquisition funding whereas its parent Hindalco will only fund a smaller chunk if the acquisition goes through,"" said the second person cited above, also requesting anonymity.
Aleris’s private equity owners Oaktree Capital Group LLC and Apollo Global Management LLC had earlier agreed to sell the company to Zhongwang USA LLC for an enterprise value of $2.3 billion.
The transaction was called off in November after US officials raised national-security concerns about the Chinese-backed bidder, Bloomberg reported in January."

166,2018-03-07,Vedanta,"Vedanta will have to establish the existence and ownership of 34,544 metric tonnes of iron ore to rebut allegations of illegal mining

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed Vedanta Ltd to approach the additional city civil and sessions judge and special judge for CBI cases at Bangalore for release of 34,544 metric tonnes of iron ore.  
New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed Vedanta Ltd to approach the additional city civil and sessions judge and special judge for CBI cases at Bangalore for release of 34,544 metric tonnes of iron ore. 
Vedanta will have to establish its existence and ownership to rebut allegations of illegal mining over the same.
In doing so, a bench headed by Justice A.K. Sikri set aside a ruling of the Karnataka high court that had allowed the release of iron ore to Vedanta. 
It was noted that the high court while allowing the plea for release of iron ore had only relied on acceptance of the final report by the CBI judge dated 15 December, 2015.
The court was ruling on a plea by the state of Karnataka challenging a July 2017 order of the Karnataka high court allowing the release of 34,544 metric tonne of iron ore to Vedanta. The said iron ore was earlier seized on allegations of illegal mining against Vedanta.
On 4 July, 2017, the Karnataka high court, in the wake of a final report submitted by a special investigation team (SIT) set up by the Karnataka govt to look into the issue which did not find any impediment to release the iron ore in favour of Vedanta, had ordered its immediate release. 
The apex court on 7 September, 2012 had directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate into the illegal extraction and export of iron ore to other countries.
By a subsequent order of 16 September, 2013, the apex court permitted the CBI to refer the matter to the state government, and simultaneously directed it to take further necessary action in cases where the exporters had exported less than 50,000 metric tonnes without valid permits.
Accordingly, a SIT was appointed by the state of Karnataka, which submitted its final report on 8 October, 2015, found to be in favour of Vedanta."
165,2018-03-09,Vedanta,"Abhishek Dalmia's Renaissance Steel says Tata Steel and Vedanta are not eligible to bid for Electrosteel Steels's assets as they are guilty of criminal misconduct punishable with two or more years in jail

Kolkata: Abhishek Dalmia’s Renaissance Steel India Pvt. Ltd on Thursday approached the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) alleging Tata Steel Ltd and Vedanta Ltd are not eligible to bid for the assets of Electrosteel Steels Ltd, which are being auctioned under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). 
Kolkata: Abhishek Dalmia’s Renaissance Steel India Pvt. Ltd on Thursday approached the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) alleging Tata Steel Ltd and Vedanta Ltd are not eligible to bid for the assets of Electrosteel Steels Ltd, which are being auctioned under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
In two separate petitions, Renaissance Steel said both Tata Steel and Vedanta group were found guilty of criminal misconduct punishable with two or more years in jail. 
So, under Section 29A of IBC, they are barred from bidding for stressed assets being sold under insolvency resolution.
The petitions have been admitted for further hearing, said Debanjan Mandal, partner, Fox and Mandal, the law firm representing Renaissance.
Renaissance Steel has alleged that Tata Steel UK Ltd, a subsidiary of the Indian steel maker, had pleaded guilty several times to violating the UK Health and Safety at Work Act.
“Tata Steel UK has faced multiple prosecutions, and has been convicted on each occasion,"" said the petition opposing Tata Steel’s bid, adding that the offences were punishable on conviction by up to two years in jail. But the UK authorities only imposed fines.
Tata Steel declined to comment. A spokesperson for Vedanta didn’t respond to an email seeking comments till press time.
The development comes a day after Tata Steel emerged the top bidder for Bhushan Steel, India’s top auto-grade steel maker.
That bid, too, could also suffer if Renaissance Steel’s objection to its bid for Electrosteel Steels is upheld in court.
Electrosteel Steels, which owes at least Rs11,000 crore, was taken to NCLT by State Bank of India.
Resolution professional Dhaivat Anjaria was not immediately available for comments.
In the second petition, Renaissance Steel said a subsidiary of Vedanta Resources Plc, the UK-based holding company, had violated pollution norms in Zambia, and was found guilty of criminal misconduct.
Konkola Copper Mines of the Vedanta group, which runs mining operations in Zambia, had in 2010 pleaded guilty to four charges brought against it under pollution laws.
Some of these offences were punishable with imprisonment of up to three years, Renaissance Steel said.
Renaissance Steel claimed in its petition that the resolution professional for Electrosteel Steels had accepted the “undertaking of eligibility"" provided by the bidders at “face value"", and that he was “duty bound to examine the issue of eligibility"" before receiving bids.
Enough information is available in the public domain which questions the eligibility of both the companies, Renaissance Steel said.
The key question facing the company law tribunal is whether Renaissance Steel could file objections at this stage, said a corporate lawyer in Kolkata, who asked not to be identified.
Though the bids have been received for the company’s assets, the resolution professional and the creditors have not yet picked any bid as successful, said this person. 
The company law tribunal may itself decide or ask the resolution professional to determine if the two bidders are eligible to bid, he added."

Mumbai: Shares of Vedanta Ltd rallied after India’s biggest base metals producer announced a record dividend worth $1.2 billion, potentially helping its London-listed parent pare debt.
Vedanta, owned by billionaire Anil Agarwal, reversed from a loss to rise as much as 2.1% to Rs323.80 in Mumbai after its board approved Rs21.2 a share for a payout of Rs7,881 crore, its best-ever dividend and topping a record last year. A 7.5% payment on preference shares took the total to Rs8,091 crore for the fiscal year through March.
At 2.43pm, Vedanta shares were trading 0.96% up at Rs320 on BSE, while the Sensex was down 0.54% to 33,732.69 points.
The dividend, which is about double market expectations, will allow parent Vedanta Resources Plc to trim some of its borrowings, Goutam Chakraborty, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, said by phone from Mumbai.
Vedanta Resources’ debt was almost $18 billion at the end of the last fiscal year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, while Vedanta Ltd owed $11 billion. The Mumbai-based company mines and produces a variety of metals, including copper, zinc and aluminium. Base metals traded in London have risen 17% over the past year. Bloomberg"

Earlier this month, Abhishek Dalmia-led Renaissance Steel India Pvt. Ltd moved the Kolkata bench of the NCLT alleging in two separate petitions that both Tata Steel and Vedanta were ineligible for bidding under section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) because they have been found guilty of criminal misconduct punishable with two or more years in jail.
Tata Steel and Vedanta were not immediately available for comments. Dhaivat Anjaria, the resolution professional, also could not be contacted immediately.
In its order, the bench directed the resolution professional to inform Renaissance Steel about his stand on the eligibility of Tata Steel and Vedanta within three days, following which Renaissance Steel is to hand in written objections, if any, to the resolution professional’s views. 
The bench further directed the resolution professional to place Renaissance Steel’s objections before Electrosteel Steels’ committee of creditors, according to two lawyers who had seen the order. They asked not to be named.
Renaissance Steel had alleged that Tata Steel UK Ltd, a subsidiary, had pleaded guilty several times to violating the UK Health and Safety at Work Act. The company faced multiple prosecutions and was convicted each time, Renaissance Steel said in its petition. The offences were punishable with two years in jail, but the UK authorities chose to impose fines.
Under section 29A of IBC, anyone convicted in a criminal case punishable with two or more years in jail is barred from bidding for stressed assets.

Konkola Copper Mines of the Vedanta group had in 2010 pleaded guilty to four charges brought against it under pollution laws. Some of these offences were punishable with three years in jail, the Renaissance Steel petition said.
Renaissance Steel had said that the resolution professional accepted the so-called undertaking of eligibility at “face value"", whereas he was “duty-bound to examine the issue of eligibility"" before receiving the bids. 
Enough information was readily available in the public domain to question the eligibility of Tata Steel and Vedanta, Renaissance Steel said in its petition.
Though the resolution professional has received bids, the creditors haven’t decided yet on a resolution plan for Electrosteel Steels. They have less than month to firm up a resolution plan."

Mumbai: Anil Agarwal-promoted Vedanta Ltd has finalized the terms of a Rs4,000 crore bond issue at a time rising yields have depressed local debt issuances, two people aware of the development said.
The company, with business interests ranging across zinc, lead, silver, oil & gas, aluminium, copper, iron ore and power, plans to sell bonds maturing in three years at a likely coupon rate of 8.50%, the people mentioned above said on condition of anonymity.
The money raised from the Vedanta bond issue will be used for working capital requirements, general corporate purposes and to refinance debt.
In a notice to stock exchanges on Tuesday, Vedanta informed that it proposes to raise up to Rs4,500 crore in one or more tranches though secured non-convertible debentures. The company’s committee of directors will be meeting in this regard on 23 March.
“Vedanta is a marque name and bonds from the manufacturing sector usually have higher demand as they are not sold very frequently. This has helped the company to get commitments of investors, from mutual funds to insurance companies, and price the bonds at a finer rate despite a large size of the issue, especially at a time when yields have hardened,"" said the first person mentioned above.
According to bond dealers, amid rising bond yields, not all companies can price bonds at a cheaper rate. Corporate bonds are priced at a premium over government bond yields, which have risen because of fiscal concerns and expectation of rising interest rates.  
Rating agency Crisil has assigned AA as Vedanta’s long-term rating. On 12 March, Crisil upgraded its outlook on the long-term bank facilities and debt programmes of Vedanta to 'positive' from 'stable'. 
“The revision in outlook reflects Crisil's expectation of a strengthening business profile driven by a structural improvement in aluminium profitability and expected volume ramp-up across businesses, both of which should support a greater resilience of Vedanta's profitability to a decline in commodity prices. The revision in outlook also reflects expectation of continued deleveraging over the medium term,"" Crisil said in a note. 
Vedanta had sold bonds in December 2017, where it raised Rs500 crore through three-year paper at 7.80%."

Kolkata: Lenders to Electrosteel Steels Ltd are staring at an over 50% haircut even as they have picked Vedanta Ltd as the top bidder for the assets amid a legal challenge to the bid’s validity.
Vedanta has offered to pay a little more than Rs5,000 crore for the assets of the distressed steelmaker, according to two people familiar with the bids, who asked not to be named. It is “considerably higher"" than the second highest bid from Tata Steel Ltd, said one of them.
Electrosteel Steels, which is setting up a 2.5 million tonne integrated steel plant near Bokaro town, owes its lenders Rs11,000 crore.
Dhaivat Anjaria, the resolution professional or the administrator of the company, declined to comment.
All the bids are not similar in nature, so a headline number could be misleading, cautioned the people cited above. The highest bid was selected by a committee of creditors through a scoring system combining various parameters, they added.
“Banks agreeing to take a substantial haircut is predictable,"" said a consultant who has advised lenders on Electrosteel Steels, asking not to be named. 
The erstwhile management of Electrosteel Steels, however, has always held lenders responsible for the current woes. The management had said last year that if a fresh line of credit of Rs1,300 crore was extended in 2013, the company could have been turned around.
Meanwhile, the two highest bids for Electrosteel have been challenged by Renaissance Steel India Pvt. Ltd, which has alleged in two separate petitions to the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that Vedanta and Tata Steel are ineligible to bid under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). 
With the committee of creditors deciding on Thursday to accept Vedanta’s bid, rejecting the legal challenge to its validity, Renaissance Steel will next week move the Kolkata bench of the NCLT seeking the tribunal’s scrutiny of its allegations, said lawyers briefed on the matter. They, too, asked not to be identified.
Abhishek Dalmia-led Renaissance Steel has alleged that affiliates of both Vedanta and Tata Steel have been found guilty of criminal offences that are punishable with two or more years in jail. 
Under section 29A of the IBC, companies or individuals convicted of such offences are barred from bidding for stressed assets.
Renaissance Steel has alleged that Tata Steel UK Ltd, a unit of the Indian steelmaker, had pleaded guilty several times to violating the UK Health and Safety at Work Act. The UK subsidiary faced multiple probes and was convicted each time. Though the offences were punishable with two years in jail, the UK authorities chose to impose fines, Renaissance Steel has claimed.
Similarly, against Vedanta, Renaissance Steel has alleged that a subsidiary of its parent Vedanta Resources Plc. had violated pollution norms in Zambia. Vedanta Resources-controlled Konkola Copper Mines had, in 2010, pleaded guilty to four charges brought against it by the Zambian authorities for violation of pollution norms. Some of these offences were punishable with three years in jail, according to Renaissance Steel.
Time is running out for the administrator to finalize a resolution plan. He has a little over two weeks to get the tribunal’s approval for the plan, failing which the company will go into liquidation. The IBC allows 270 days for resolution of insolvency. Insolvency resolution at Electrosteel Steels started in July last year."
156,2018-04-02,Vedanta,"Vedanta enters race for the bankrupt Essar Steel, as do ArcelorMittal, as second round of bidding opens

Mumbai/Ahmedabad: The battle for Essar Steel Ltd Monday saw the surprise entry of Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Steel Ltd, which has formed a tie-up with Numetal Mauritius, which is already in fray.  
Mumbai/Ahmedabad: The battle for Essar Steel Ltd Monday saw the surprise entry of Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Steel Ltd, which has formed a tie-up with Numetal Mauritius, which is already in fray. 
Monday’s auction of Essar Steel Ltd also saw bids from ArcelorMittal Netherlands NV-Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corporation (NSSMC) duo, and Vedanta Plc submitting their bids for the debt-ridden steel firm. Vedanta, which had submitted expression of interest earlier, is a new entrant as well. 
On 21 March, the committee of creditors (CoC) for Essar Steel had announced a second round of bidding for Essar Steel after rejecting the only bids received from ArcelorMittal and Numetal, citing the related party clause under the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC). While the resolution professional for the distressed steel company received expressions of interest (EoIs) from six entities in the first round, only two firms—ArcelorMittal and Numetal participated in the bidding process. 
The second round was open only to firms that had submitted EoIs in the first round, blocking new entrants from submitting resolution plans. 
Numetal had been disqualified due to Aurora Enterprises Ltd’s shareholding in the firm. During the first round of bidding Aurora Enterprises, a firm controlled by a trust owned by Rewant Ruia, held a minority stake in NuMetal. Rewant Ruia is son of Ravi Ruia, vice-chairman of Essar Group. Numetal had suggested that it was willing to drop Aurora, if required, as a corrective measure. It could not be immediately ascertained if Aurora’s stake has been bought out by existing shareholders or JSW Steel. However, a person close to the development on condition of anonymity said that JSW Steel had bought out Rewant Ruia's stake.   
Even as JSW Steel could not participate in the bidding process on a standalone basis (since it had not submitted an EoI), it decided to pair up with Numetal to submit a resolution plan. The two firms submitted a joint bid on Monday. 
“Considering the lenders had allowed only those firms who had submitted EOIs in the first round to bid, we had limited options. So, we decided to partner with Numetal as they were willing to tie up with us,"" Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director and group chief financial officer at JSW Steel told Mint over phone. Rao added that considering that Arcelor had already tied up with Nippon, possibilities to tie up with other applicants, considering their strategic interests in the assets, were limited for JSW . Numetal spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. Rao declined to comment on whether JSW Steel has bought out Ruia's stake.
A spokesperson for ArcelorMittal said that JSW and Numetal coming together will be detrimental to competition. “JSW joining Numetal is clearly a defensive move—they don’t want competition…India has an ambitious target to increase its steel production to 300 million tonnes. It needs new firms to achieve that. We continue to believe that ArcelorMittal -Nippon is the strongest possible partner for Essar,"" he said. ArcelorMittal has formed a joint venture with Nippon to jointly acquire the assets of Essar Steel. 
Meanwhile, Numetal has challenged the disqualification of its previous bid in the Ahmedabad National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). It has also asked the tribunal to defer the opening of bids unless the tribunal decides its eligibility in the first round. The court has deferred the opening of bids till 4 April. On the same day, NCLT Ahmedabad will also hear petitions filed by NuMetal and ArcelorMittal challenging their disqualification in round one.
As on 31 March 2016, Essar Steel owed around Rs45,000 crore to lenders. State Bank of India is the lead bank and Satish Kumar Gupta is the resolution professional. Gupta declined to comment on the matter."
157,2018-04-02,Vedanta,"For Vedanta, if the Goa mining ban is a worry, the bid for Electrosteel Steels is an attempt to secure future growth

Last week, the Vedanta group’s iron ore business was in the news. Firstly, its parent London-listed Vedanta Resources Ltd told investors to expect an impairment charge for its Indian iron ore operations. Secondly, Vedanta Ltd’s (Vedanta) bid for the resolution of Electrosteel Steels Ltd was declared successful. 
Last week, the Vedanta group’s iron ore business was in the news. Firstly, its parent London-listed Vedanta Resources Ltd told investors to expect an impairment charge for its Indian iron ore operations. Secondly, Vedanta Ltd’s (Vedanta) bid for the resolution of Electrosteel Steels Ltd was declared successful.
The bad news on impairment was expected. Goa iron ore mining operations of Vedanta, and other miners, had to shut from 16 March, following a Supreme Court order. It has to obtain fresh clearances before restarting operations. The amount of impairment because of the ban could be $700-800 million at the gross level or $600-700 million net of taxes, according to a Vedanta Resources statement.
Although Vedanta itself is yet to make an announcement, it is reasonable to expect impairment in its books as well. It’s a non-cash charge and is reversible. Iron contributed only 2.8% to Vedanta’s segment profit in the December quarter and its Karnataka iron ore operations are functioning. The impact on profits will be marginal.
If the Goa mining ban is a worry, the bid for Electrosteel Steels is an attempt to secure future growth. In its January conference call, Vedanta had said that its iron ore mining licence in Jharkhand requires it to do value addition within the state. The policy seeks to encourage setting up of domestic industry rather than mine ore and transport it to another state for value addition. That’s its main interest in acquiring Electrosteel.
Vedanta’s presentation talks about a 10 million tonnes per annum iron ore project in Jharkhand. In fact, it is in the process of setting up a 1 million tonnes plant to make pig iron and ductile pipes in Jharkhand, which is in the preliminary stage.
Electrosteel was setting up a 2.5 million tonnes integrated steel plant to make pig iron, billets, bars, wire rods, and ductile iron pipes. The project got delayed but is partially operational. More importantly, Electrosteel has iron ore linkages to supply raw material to the project, so Vedanta could get access to these mining reserves as well.
In the quarter ended December 2017, Electrosteel earned revenue of Rs857 crore but incurred a loss of Rs327 crore, with interest costs alone at Rs285 crore. It had a negative net worth of Rs568 crore, which will worsen in the current fiscal, as nine-month losses were Rs867 crore. The company’s insolvency process puts financial creditors’ claims at Rs13,395 crore and operational creditors at Rs782 crore.
Newspaper reports have indicated Vedanta having offered Rs5,000 crore to banks but these bids need to be seen overall for what they offer, in terms of equity stake, funding concessions and so on. Once Vedanta gets control, it will have to invest money to complete the project. Vedanta’s consolidated net debt to equity of 17% gives it the flexibility to fund this bid without stretching itself.
More clarity on the bid amount, structure and additional funding should become clear in the coming months, as also whether Vedanta proposes to merge Electrosteel or keep it separate. While the acquisition itself increases the steel component of Vedanta’s metals business, its attraction is in using this to add to its iron ore mining reserves. At present, domestic steel capacity is ample to meet domestic demand, with companies having to export surplus steel. If domestic demand exceeds supply on a sustainable basis, Vedanta may then consider a ramp-up of its ambitions in the steel business to a much bigger level."

Mumbai/Chennai: Vedanta Ltd.’s plan to expand a copper smelter in Tamil Nadu as part of an $8 billion drive to boost its national production capacity for metals is being dogged by movie stars and local protesters. 
Mumbai/Chennai: Vedanta Ltd.’s plan to expand a copper smelter in Tamil Nadu as part of an $8 billion drive to boost its national production capacity for metals is being dogged by movie stars and local protesters.
Stars-turned-politicians Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan are lending their voices to protests by neighbouring villagers against the plant in Tamil Nadu because of health concerns. Vedanta is working on doubling the capacity at the 400,000 metric ton-a-year smelter, which was shut last week for 15 days for regular maintenance, it said.
Actor Rajinikanth tweeted questioning government approval for the factory, while Kamal Haasan made a trip to the locality demanding closure of the plant.
The smelter received all the necessary regulatory clearances for the expansion and Vedanta was committed to the well-being of the surrounding communities, the company said on Monday. It uses zero discharge systems and waste for sustainable applications as well as stringent emission monitoring, it said.
The smelter protests come after the Anil Agarwal-owned commodity giant’s iron ore operations were hit when the nation’s top court banned mining in the state of Goa from mid-March. Bloomberg"
154,2018-04-05,Vedanta,"The IRP and Electrosteel Steel lenders rejected the allegation that Vedanta was ineligible to bid because its affiliate was found guilty of criminal misconduct eight years ago and paid a fine as punishment

Mumbai: The resolution professional, or administrator, for Electrosteel Steels Ltd on Wednesday told the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that he and the company’s lenders had rejected the allegation that Vedanta Ltd was ineligible to bid because an affiliate of the company was found guilty of criminal misconduct eight years ago and paid a fine as punishment. 
Mumbai: The resolution professional, or administrator, for Electrosteel Steels Ltd on Wednesday told the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that he and the company’s lenders had rejected the allegation that Vedanta Ltd was ineligible to bid because an affiliate of the company was found guilty of criminal misconduct eight years ago and paid a fine as punishment.
Lawyers for the resolution professional wondered whether a company could be declared ineligible to bid for stressed assets under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) for an offence it admitted to long ago.
They said Vedanta had offered to pay Rs5,320 crore for Electrosteel Steels’ yet-to-be-completed 2.5 million tonne steel plant, at least Rs2,000 crore more than Renaissance Steel India Pvt. Ltd, which has filed separate petitions with the Kolkata bench of the NCLT—alleging that both Vedanta and Tata Steel Ltd, the second highest bidder, were ineligible to bid under section 29A of IBC.
Renaissance Steel has alleged that Konkola Copper Mines, a company controlled by UK-based Vedanta Resources, had been found guilty of flouting pollution norms in Zambia. Konkola Copper Mines had pleaded guilty to four charges brought against it by the Zambian authorities, and some of these offences were punishable with up to three years in jail.
Under section 29A of IBC, companies convicted of criminal misconduct punishable with two or more years in jail are barred from bidding for stressed assets.
In a separate petition, Renaissance Steel has alleged that Tata Steel UK Ltd, a subsidiary of the Indian steel maker, had been found guilty of violating the UK Health and Safety at Work Act. But both Tata Steel UK and the Vedanta affiliate were let off with fines.
Ratnanko Banerji, counsel for Renaissance Steel, argued that it did not matter that the criminal misconduct, which the Vedanta affiliate admitted to, dates back to 2010. Also, it is of no consequence that only a fine was imposed on Konkola Copper Mines. 
The offence it committed was also punishable with up to three years in jail, he argued.
The bench didn’t immediately pass a verdict on the eligibility of Vedanta to bid for stressed assets under IBC. The matter is to be heard on 11 April. 
The petition alleging Tata Steel’s ineligibility to bid was not heard on Wednesday.
The administrator of Electrosteel Steels has less than two weeks to finalize a resolution plan for the indebted firm within the statutory 270-day window for completion of the process, failing which the company may be ordered to be liquidated."

152,2018-04-16,Vedanta,"Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, who takes over from interim CEO Kuldip Kaura, will leave Johannesburg-based AngloGold on 30 August and join Vedanta a day later

Nairobi/London: Anil Agarwal hired AngloGold Ashanti Ltd’s Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan to run his Vedanta Resources Plc in a move that may hint at the Indian billionaire’s plans for his global commodity portfolio. 
Nairobi/London: Anil Agarwal hired AngloGold Ashanti Ltd’s Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan to run his Vedanta Resources Plc in a move that may hint at the Indian billionaire’s plans for his global commodity portfolio.
Venkatakrishnan, 53, has been CEO of Johannesburg-based AngloGold for five years and spent much of his career working in Africa. That’s a first for a Vedanta CEO and points to the growing importance of the Indian group’s investments on the continent, where its assets include Zambian copper and South African zinc.
Agarwal, who is also mining giant Anglo American Plc’s biggest shareholder, highlighted Venkatakrishnan’s African experience in a statement on Monday.
“It is interesting that Vedanta so clearly seems to be targeting South Africa as a key part of their strategy,"" said Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd analyst Paul Gait. “Having a South African background, South African experience and the ability to negotiate in a South African environment is clearly something that Agarwal and Vedanta value.""
Venkatakrishnan, who was born and educated in India, was CFO of Ashanti Goldfields Ltd before its merger with AngloGold, where he served as finance chief for eight years until his promotion to CEO. During that time, he worked for six years alongside then-CEO Mark Cutifani, who now holds the top job at Anglo American.
Agarwal surprised Anglo American’s management last year when he took a 21% stake in the company, a move that has left the market speculating over his long-term intentions for the blue chip mining company. In 2016, Agarwal proposed a tie-up between Anglo and the zinc unit of Vedanta, and he said last year the combination would have been a good match.
“It’s hard not to see these events as somehow connected,"" Bernstein’s Gait said.
Agarwal, who has been hunting for a new Vedanta CEO for more than a year, has consistently sought talent from the world’s biggest miners. He hired former Rio Tinto Group CEO Tom Albanese as chief executive in 2014 and former Anglo American head Cynthia Carroll worked as an adviser until last year.
Venkatakrishnan’s South African experience looks more important than his corporate experience, Gait said. Agarwal has been a vocal supporter of the country, arguing that Anglo American should remain committed to its assets there.
“Africa is tomorrow’s rising sun,"" Agarwal said in an interview last week in the Zambian capital Lusaka. He’s told Anglo American that “you have to look at Africa, you have to invest in Africa,"" he said.
Still, Venkatakrishnan’s tenure as chief executive of AngloGold hasn’t all been smooth sailing. The company was forced to scrap a $2.1 billion share sale and plan to split its South African and international assets in 2014 after an investor revolt.
And even though that plan failed, the company has continued to reduce its footprint in South Africa, where aging infrastructure, reserve depletion and accidents raised costs and put pressure on output. Last year AngloGold agreed to sell two mines in a deal that halved the gold producer’s South African production.
That doesn’t reflect poorly on Venkatakrishnan, said Yatish Chowthee, an analyst at Macquarie Group.
“He inherited a company that was navigating through difficult times and selling the South Africa assets was probably the best decision given the environment,"" Chowthee said. “He should fit in there, given the way Agarwal wants the company to go forward.""
Vedanta declined 3.9% by 1:57pm in London on Monday. The shares have lost 11% this year, valuing the company at about $2.8 billion. The company also has iron ore, aluminium and oil assets in India and plans to double its Indian copper capacity by 2020. AngloGold’s stock has dropped 13% in the same period and is now worth $3.8 billion.
Vedanta, which is set to begin production at its new Gamsberg zinc mine in South Africa this year, had been searching for a new chief executive since Albanese’s flagged departure last year. AngloGold has started a search to replace Venkatakrishnan. Bloomberg"
151,2018-04-17,Vedanta,"NCLT cleared the resolution plan of Electrosteel Steels Ltd, approved by the CoC with a voting share of 100% , submitted by Vedanta

Mumbai: Electrosteel Steels Ltd became the first of the 12 large loan defaulters identified by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to win court approval to exit bankruptcy. 
Mumbai: Electrosteel Steels Ltd became the first of the 12 large loan defaulters identified by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to win court approval to exit bankruptcy.
The Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday cleared Vedanta Ltd’s Rs5,320 crore resolution plan for Electrosteel, rejecting objections of an unsuccessful bidder, which had challenged the decision of the lenders on the ground that Vedanta was ineligible to bid for stressed assets under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
RBI had ordered lenders to refer Electrosteel to a bankruptcy court in June 2017, along with 11 other companies. Electrosteel, which is setting up a 2.5 million tonne steel plant near Bokaro, owes lenders Rs13,395 crore. The NCLT approved resolution plan for Electrosteel entails a more than 50% haircut for lenders, Mint reported on 31 March.
The bench’s verdict should send a message to delinquent promoters that their companies could be taken away, said Rishav Banerjee, an insolvency practitioner and a lawyer who had moved the petition for State Bank of India (SBI), one of the biggest lenders to Electrosteel.
However, a consultant who had advised SBI earlier on Electrosteel said “this is the best that lenders could have got from the derailed project"".
One of the bidders, Renaissance Steel India Pvt. Ltd had contended that one of Vedanta’s affiliates—a unit of its UK-based parent Vedanta Resources Plc—had been found guilty of criminal misconduct punishable with two or more years in jail. But based on semantics, the bench ruled that Vedanta was eligible to bid.
Though lenders of Electrosteel had taken a stand that Konkola Copper Mines, a unit of Vedanta Resources, could not be described as a “connected"" entity under IBC, the bench ruled the opposite. But because only fines were imposed on the delinquent company, the bench said that Vedanta wasn’t barred from bidding for stressed assets.
Renaissance Steel had alleged that Konkola Copper Mines had admitted to flouting Zambia’s environment laws several times, and that it was an offence punishable with three years in jail.
Citing a judgement of the Supreme Court, the bench made a distinction between “imprisonment or fine"" and “imprisonment and fine"", ruling that fine as an option meant the company was guilty of a “less serious offence"" than what being convicted for an offence punishable with imprisonment alone would mean.
“It appears to us that an offence punishable with imprisonment is different (from) an offence punishable with imprisonment or fine,"" the bench said in its order, adding that Konkola Copper Mines’ offence did not lead to Vedanta’s disqualification.
It isn’t immediately known if Renaissance Steel will challenge the NCLT’s verdict. Its bid for Electrosteel Steels was at least Rs2,000 crore lower than Vedanta’s. Lawyers for Electrosteel declined to comment.
Apart from Vedanta and Renaissance Steel, Tata Steel Ltd had also bid for Electrosteel Steels. Tata Steel’s bid was the second highest. In a separate petition, Renaissance Steel had alleged that Tata Steel, too, was ineligible to bid for stressed assets under IBC because its UK subsidiary was held guilty of criminal misconduct.
Renaissance had alleged that Tata Steel UK Ltd had flouted the UK Health and Safety at Work Act, and that the offence was punishable with imprisonment of two or more years. But in the case of Tata Steel, too, only fines were imposed."
150,2018-04-21,Vedanta,"Vedanta's acquisition of Electrosteel Steels is credit neutral on the resources major as it will have only a marginal impact on its overstretched balance sheet, says an India Ratings report

Mumbai: Vedanta’s acquisition of the crippled Electrosteel Steels is credit neutral on the resources major as it will have only a marginal impact on its overstretched balance sheet, says a report.  
Mumbai: Vedanta’s acquisition of the crippled Electrosteel Steels is credit neutral on the resources major as it will have only a marginal impact on its overstretched balance sheet, says a report. 
The London-based Vedanta group is highly leveraged with Rs1.03 trillion in debt. Its debt-equity ratio stood at 2.2 times last fiscal. In a report India Ratings on Friday said the lower impact on its credit rating is despite higher cash outflows relating to the acquisition of 90% stake in Electrosteel and closure of Goa iron ore mining and copper smelting operations.
The agency expects loss of cash flows from this division to be countered by higher-than-expected operational cash flows in the base metals and oil and gas divisions, supported by increased volumes. It also termed the deal between Vedanta and ESL as credit neutral.
The report sees the Electroseteel deal stretching balance sheet to 2.5 times in FY19 from 2.2 times in FY18. “FY19 net leverage is likely to increase to a range of 2.3x-2.5x from FY18 estimate of 2.2x. This will be due to the cash outflows relating to this acquisition and stoppage of Goan iron ore mining and copper smelting operations,"" the report said. 
Billionaire Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta’s resolution plan for the bankrupt ESL was approved by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) last week, making it the first of the 12 largest accounts referred by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last June to NCLT for resolution. As per the deal, Vedanta will pick up 90% stake in Electrosteel for  ₹ ,321 crore. Of this  ₹ ,806 crore will be equity and  ₹ 3,515 crore of debt. The remaining 10% will be held by the existing shareholders and financial creditors. The funds received by Electrosteel will be used to fully settle the debts owed to its existing financial creditors. 
Electrosteel owned over Rs13,000 crore to bankers before it went bankrupt. Vedanta has a 0.8 million tonne per annum pig iron capacity in Goa. The acquisition will add 1.5MT capacity to this and another 1MT on the completion of the expansion programme. 
Electrosteel plant is in Jharkhand where Vedanta has a prospecting licence for iron ore mining. Vedanta’s pre-feasibility report proposes a 5MT iron ore mining capacity for the assessed resource base of 186.7MT of iron ore with an average grade ranging 54-65%. 
The report further said the acquisition will provide synergies in form of forward integration of Electrosteel’s steel plant with Vedanta’s possible mining operations in Jharkhand. In February, the Supreme Court had ordered closure of iron ore mining in Goa, which impacted Vedanta’s operations. Also, in March, its copper smelting operations were shut down due to the denial of annual consent for operations, according to the report."

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Tuesday ordered status quo in the insolvency process of Electrosteel Steel India Pvt. Ltd, asking its management not to spend any money other than for day to day affairs.
A bench headed by S.J. Mukhopadhyay was hearing an appeal moved by one of the unsuccessful bidders, Renaissance Steel India Pvt. Ltd, against a 17 April order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Kolkata bench approving Vedanta Ltd’s Rs5,320 crore resolution plan for the debt-riden Electrosteel.
The NCLAT bench agreed to hear Renissance’s appeal, and issued notices to Vedanta and lenders asking them to reply in 10 days. The matter will be heard next on 17 May. 
Renaissance Steel has opposed the resolution plan, stating Vendanta was not eligible to bid for Electrosteel under Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The company also said its resolution plan of Rs6,000 crore was higher than Vedanta’s.
Electrosteel is one of the 12 bad loans notified by the Reserve Bank of India in June 2017, and owes lenders Rs13,395 crore.
While approving Anil Agarwal led Vedanta’s bid, NCLT Kolkata Bench had rejected the Section 29A objection raised by Renaissance Steel.
Renaissance Steel had contended that one of Vedanta’s affiliates—a unit of its UK-based parent Vedanta Resources Plc—had been found guilty of criminal misconduct punishable with two or more years in jail.
Before NCLT, a similar objection was raised by Renaissance Steel against another bidder, Tata Steel, claiming one of its UK subsidiaries had flouted the UK Health and Safety at Work Act, and fines were imposed on it."
147,2018-05-02,Vedanta,"Vedanta bid for all the 55 blocks while ONGC bid for 37 blocks either on its own or in consortium with other state-owned firms

New Delhi: Mining moghul Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd and state-owned ONGC were top bidders on Wednesday for 55 oil and gas blocks offered in India’s maiden open acreage auction that was shunned by domestic private and international energy majors. 
New Delhi: Mining moghul Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd and state-owned ONGC were top bidders on Wednesday for 55 oil and gas blocks offered in India’s maiden open acreage auction that was shunned by domestic private and international energy majors.
Vedanta bid for all the 55 blocks while ONGC bid for ‎37 blocks either on its own or in consortium with other state-owned firms. State-owned Oil India Ltd (OIL) bid for 22 blocks in a similar fashion. Vedanta was sole bidder for two blocks and had either ONGC or OIL as direct competitor in the remaining. 
Except for the two blocks that received three bids each, all the other 53 had just two bidders. Reliance Industries and its partner BP Plc. did not bid for a single area. Essar Oil and Russia’s Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy also abstained from the round. 
No foreign company participated in the auction, a first since India began offering oil and gas area for exploration and production through bids in 1999. Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan had touted the maiden auction under the open acreage licensing policy (OALP) as game changer. 
DGH said a total of 110 bids were received from a total of nine companies—five state-run and four private firms. Besides Vedanta’s oil unit, Cairn India, other private players bidding included Selan Exploration, HOEC and Sun Petro. 
Bidding in the auction of 55 exploration blocks on offer for prospecting of oil and gas under the OALP closed on Wednesday. People in the know said Cairn put in very aggressive bids for 13 blocks and a little less aggressive bids for another nine. The remaining bids were mostly routine, they said. 
DGH, the upstream technical arm of the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, began opening of offers received under the OALP bid round being held under the new Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (Help). 
India had in July last year allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice with a view to bringing about 2.8 million sq. km of unexplored area in the country under exploration. Under this policy, companies are allowed to put in an expression of interest (EoI) for prospecting of oil and gas in any area that is presently not under any production or exploration licence. 
The EoIs can be put in anytime of the year but their are accumulated twice annually. As many as 55 blocks were sought for prospecting of oil and gas by prospective bidders, mostly by state-owned explorers, 
Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) and OIL, and private sector Cairn India by the end of the first EoI cycle on 15 November 2017, they said. The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area getting a 5-mark advantage. 
The 55 blocks have a total area of 59,282 sq. km. This compares to about 1,02,000 sq. km being under exploration currently, they said. Blocks would be awarded to the company which offers highest share of oil and gas to the government as well as commits to do maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic survey and drilling exploration wells. Increased exploration would lead to more oil and gas production, helping the world’s third largest oil importer to cut import dependence.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of cutting oil import bill by 10% to 67% by 2022 and to half by 2030. Import dependence has increased since 2015 when Modi had set the target. India currently imports 81% of its oil needs. 
People in the know said ONGC and Cairn India had put in 41 out of 57 bids received in November last year. Private player Hindustan Oil Exploration Co (HOEC) bid for one area in a round. Of the 57 EOIs put up, only 55 blocks were cleared for bidding after eliminating areas that are under no-go zone or overlapping with existing mining lease. 
The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from production sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue sharing model where companies offering maximum share of oil and gas to government are awarded the block. 
The government till now has been selecting and demarcating areas it feels can be offered for bidding in an exploration licensing round. So far 256 blocks had been offered for exploration and production since 2000. The last bid round happened in 2010. Of these, 254 blocks were awarded. But as many as 156 have already been relinquished due to poor prospects."
148,2018-05-02,Vedanta,"Vedanta says it may accelerate expansion of its African zinc operations to take advantage of a surge in prices of the metal

Bengaluru: Vedanta Resources’ Zinc International unit said it was exploring the feasibility of developing and constructing a smelter to process zinc mined from its flagship Gamsberg project in South Africa.
The global mining conglomerate said in February it may accelerate expansion of its African zinc operations to take advantage of a surge in prices of the metal.
Zinc prices have rallied to their highest since 2007, boosting overall profits of Vedanta, which has zinc projects in India, South Africa and Namibia.
The company could invest between $700 million and $800 million at the Gamsberg refinery, Vedanta Zinc International said.
The first phase of the smelter-refinery complex is expected to have a capacity of 250,000 tonnes per year of finished zinc metal, matching Gamsberg’s expected annual output by early 2019.
The smelting plant will make Gamsberg, one of the world’s largest undeveloped zinc resource, a fully integrated zinc production site."

144,2018-05-04,Vedanta,"Vedanta expects its aluminium realizations to improve going ahead, aided by higher production of value-added products and more focus on the local market

With commodity prices rising, everyone expected Vedanta Ltd to reap those benefits during the March quarter. It not only did that, but did much better than the Street forecast. 
With commodity prices rising, everyone expected Vedanta Ltd to reap those benefits during the March quarter. It not only did that, but did much better than the Street forecast.
Consolidated Ebitda at Rs7,837 crore, nearly 16% higher compared to the December quarter, is praiseworthy. Kotak Institutional Equities and Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd were expecting the measure at Rs6,974.5 crore and Rs7,249 crore, respectively.
Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
What helped? 
Chiefly, higher volumes from Zinc India business and the aluminium business, capitalization of certain expenses at the aluminium business, and better commodity prices boosted operating performance. 
The aluminium business performed well what with its Ebit rising as much as 86% over the December quarter. 
Further, the Ebit of the oil and gas business increased a massive 94% sequentially, helped by more volumes and better price realizations. What’s more, the outlook on this business is strong given Brent crude prices are hovering around $75 per barrel.
The aluminium price outlook too is bright over the medium term. Kotak expects aluminium fundamentals to improve from the widening deficit outside China and supply reforms in China. However, if the US sanctions are lifted completely, it could mean a risk to aluminium prices. 
Vedanta expects its aluminium realizations to improve going ahead, aided by higher production of value-added products and more focus on the local market.
Nevertheless, there are also a few bumps on the road ahead. On the aluminium business, investors should keep a close watch on cost headwinds due to domestic coal and bauxite availability, and high alumina and carbon prices. In a post-earnings conference call, the company said alumina continues to trade at an all-time high driven by supply tightening and uncertainties due to US sanctions on Rusal.
To counter inflationary cost pressures, Vedanta is looking to ramp-up its alumina output this year, source high-quality low-cost bauxite from Odisha and diversify imported alumina sourcing. On the power cost front, the company is working towards increasing its linkage coal mix from 45% to 63%. Nonetheless, the supply dynamics for global alumina and prices for other input commodities remain uncertain. The company has guided for its cost of production for fiscal year 2019 being at $1,725-1,775 per tonne. 
But on the flip side, zinc prices have been rather muted in April and investors will have to watch whether the trend reverses. 
Vedanta’s net debt on 31 March has increased to about Rs22,000 crore from Rs16,300 crore three months ago. Still, net debt-to-Ebitda ratio at 0.9 times is among the lowest across Indian and global peers, according to the company. The ratio measures the ability of a company to pay off its debts and the lower the ratio, the better.
Currently, the stock trades at an undemanding 8.2 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year, based on Bloomberg data."
143,2018-05-10,Vedanta,"Delhi HC was hearing Vedanta's plea seeking a direction about the policy under which an extension was to be preferred, without affecting a pending litigation between Vedanta, ONGC and the Centre

New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thursday asked Vedanta Ltd to approach the Centre under the revised March 2017 policy for an extension of its production sharing contract (PSC) with state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd for the Barmer block in Rajasthan which is set to expire on 14 May 2020. 
New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thursday asked Vedanta Ltd to approach the Centre under the revised March 2017 policy for an extension of its production sharing contract (PSC) with state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd for the Barmer block in Rajasthan which is set to expire on 14 May 2020.
An application for extension of a PSC has to be made two years before its expiration date, the court was informed. 
The bench of Justice Rajiv Shakdhar was hearing Vedanta’s plea seeking a direction from the court about the policy under which an extension was to be preferred, without affecting a pending litigation between Vedanta, ONGC and the Centre with respect to the terms and conditions that would apply to the period so extended.
Cairn India, which is part of the Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Group, had moved the high court in December 2015 seeking an extension of the PSC for the Barmer block.
However, the union cabinet had in March 2017 granted extension of 10 years or the economic life of the field, whichever is earlier, to PSCs for 10 oil and gas blocks, including the PSC between Cairn India and ONGC for the Barmer block, under different terms and conditions. 
The new policy mandated higher profit sharing with the government, a no-litigation clause and a compulsory clause on arbitration, among others.
During the course of hearing, ONGC supported the government, arguing that the terms and conditions as per the new policy of March 2017 should be applied as the mutual agreement to extend the PSC on existing terms was before the new policy came in.
The PSC between Cairn India and ONGC for the project was signed on 15 May 1995 for 25 years. While Cairn India operates the block with 70% participating interest, ONGC has the remaining 30%. The Barmer block comprises the Mangala, Bhagyam, Aishwariya and Raageshwari oil and gas fields.
The decision of the court on application of the revised policy to the extended PSC is pending."
142,2018-05-17,Vedanta,"The Vedanta plant has been shut since 27 March, when it was closed as part of a 15-day scheduled maintenance as the Tamil Nadu pollution board rejected its license for flouting local environmental laws

New Delhi: Vedanta Resources Plc’s Thootukudi copper smelter, one of India’s biggest, will remain shut until at least 6 June, a lawyer petitioning against the plant reopening said on Thursday.
The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has adjourned a hearing to grant Vedanta a renewal of consent to operate the smelter until that date, said V. Ramasubbu, a local lawyer who filed the petition because of environmental concerns.
A Vedanta spokesman did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters seeking comment. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board did not immediate reply to an emailed request for a comment.
The smelter, which can produce 400,000 tonnes of copper cathode a year, is run by Vedanta’s Sterlite Copper unit, which is controlled by Vedanta Ltd, a majority-owned subsidiary of London-listed Vedanta. The plant has been shut since 27 March, when it was closed as part of a 15-day scheduled maintenance. 
During the closure, the pollution board rejected Vedanta’s license to operate the smelter in April, saying the company had not complied with five local environmental laws.
The people of Thootukudi, a port city in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, have been protesting against a proposed expansion of the smelter and are demanding the closure of the plant.
Vedanta says the protests are based on “false allegations"" and the company has been providing “regular information through various media on the truth"". 
The company plans to double capacity at the smelter to 800,000 tonnes per year.
India’s copper consumption has been increasing consistently over the last few years. At current local demand growth of 7% to 8% per year, India may turn into a net importer of copper by the year ended March 2020 if no new plant is commissioned, consultancy firm ICRA Ltd said in an April report."

Ltd, one of the unsuccessful bidders for Electrosteel Steel India Pvt.

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Thursday admitted the appeal moved by Renaissance Steel India Pvt. Ltd, one of the unsuccessful bidders for Electrosteel Steel India Pvt. Ltd, against a 17 April order of the National Company Law Tribunal’s (NCLT) Kolkata bench approving Vedanta Ltd’s Rs5,320 crore resolution plan for the debt-ridden Electrosteel.
Renaissance Steel contended that Vendanta was ineligible to bid under Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) as one of Vedanta’s affiliates in Zambia—a unit of its UK-based parent Vedanta Resources Plc—had been found guilty of violating certain environmental laws punishable with two or more years in jail. Renaissance Steel also raised an objection against committee of creditors’ decision to not allow it to participate in the meeting in which the successful bidder was decided.
Before NCLT, a similar objection was raised by Renaissance Steel against another bidder, Tata Steel, claiming one of its UK subsidiaries had flouted the UK Health and Safety at Work Act, and fines were imposed on it.
State Bank of India’s insolvency plea against Electrosteel, which is one of the 12 initial accounts identified by the Reserve Bank of India for resolution, was admitted by the Kolkata Bench of NCLT in July 2017. NCLT’s 17 April order made Electrosteel the first of the 12 to exit a corporate insolvency resolution process. 
The matter would be heard on 28 May."

New Delhi:Diversified global natural resources giant Vedanta Resources on Wednesday reported a 27% surge in operating profit to $4.1 billion for 2017-18 on higher output and increase in prices.
The LSE listed company, which produces aluminium, copper, zinc, lead, silver, iron ore, oil and gas and commercial energy, had registered group EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) of $3.2 billion in the financial year 2016-17, it said in a statement. 
Its revenue increased by 33% to $15.4 billion driven by firmer commodity prices and volume ramp-ups. The gross debt at $15.2 billion saw a reduction of $3 billion in 12 months which included repayment of $1.2 billion of temporary borrowing at Zinc India, the company said. 
Vedanta Resources Plc chairman Anil Agarwal said: “...increased volumes and prices underpinned a 33% increase in revenues to reach $15.4 billion, as well as a 27% growth in EBITDA to $4.1 billion."" 
Agarwal said the Group’s focus on all-round improvement was complemented by improving markets and commodity prices. 
He added: “We reached record production levels at several of our businesses. We transformed our approach to developing our assets, which gives me confidence of efficient and productive ramp-ups across our world class assets... “Vedanta remains well positioned to capitalise on India’s growing resources demand. I look forward to another strong year for the company."" 
About India, the mining baron said the country has an abundance of opportunities as it is one of the fastest-growing G20 economies, and by 2030 forecasts suggest it will be worth $6 trillion with a population of over 1.5 billion. 
“Over 80% of India’s demand for oil and minerals is currently met by imports, and the consumption of metals per capita remains around 70% below the global average. As the country’s sole diversified natural resource group, Vedanta is uniquely placed to help power India’s growth, and we are committed to investing in its future,"" he said. 
He said the Indian Government has introduced important pro-business reforms that will attract global investments and be a catalyst for growth. The amended MMDRA (Mines and Mineral Development and Regulation Act) in 2015 has brought increased clarity on the licencing around mining, he said. 
Key regulatory reforms around opening commercial coal mining to the private sector and the launch of Open Acreage Licensing (OALP) in the oil and gas sector to improve exploration, are some of the steps in the past year towards creating a more favourable business environment, he added. 
On the new insolvency code and the resolution process therein, he said: “We have participated in this process and are very pleased at the smooth and transparent way in which it was run. “I am happy with the outcome and look forward to the integration of Electrosteel, post completion of due processes, with our Iron Ore business in Jharkhand as we focus on avenues to create value."""
136,2018-05-24,Vedanta,"In reference to the Goa mining and the ongoing Sterlite protests in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu, Anil Agarwal tweeted that Vedanta was the victim of a foreign conspiracy aimed at keeping India reliant on imports

New Delhi: Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal often talks about his dream to turn his London-listed company Vedanta Resources Plc into a global resources giant. He has already bought stakes in big mining companies, such as Anglo American Plc, and says he plans to spend at least $1 billion on investments in Africa. 
New Delhi: Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal often talks about his dream to turn his London-listed company Vedanta Resources Plc into a global resources giant. He has already bought stakes in big mining companies, such as Anglo American Plc, and says he plans to spend at least $1 billion on investments in Africa.
But in India, where he rose from a scrap dealer to a metals magnate, court-imposed fines, costly plant and mine shutdowns, and public protests against his businesses for allegedly polluting the environment, have held back his lofty ambitions and hurt the company’s valuation, according to bankers and analysts.
The struggle with opponents took a particularly ugly turn on Tuesday when police opened fire on protesters seeking to shut down Sesa Sterlite’s copper plant in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu, killing 10. Two more people died on Wednesday, and the state government has transferred senior police and administrative officials from the city.
Vedanta said in a statement it regretted the incidents and was working with authorities to ensure the safety of its employees, facilities and the surrounding community.
“This can lead to investors becoming more conscious against investing in the company which can hurt long term sustainability of some of the businesses,"" said Shriram Subramanian, managing director of proxy advisory firm InGovern, adding that the violence in southern India suggested they weren’t listening to concerns about the environment and health issues.
Agarwal, who holds a 71.4% stake in Vedanta, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Wednesday that he plans to step back from running the company.
Temporary halt
Agarwal said on Twitter earlier this month that his company was the victim of a foreign conspiracy aimed at keeping India reliant on imports. He did not name any specific countries or companies.
“Certain vested interests will prefer India to remain import dependent and use our country as their market, making India spend hard-earned foreign exchange and lose millions of jobs,"" he said, in reference to a court-ordered stoppage of iron ore mining in Goa, the campaign against the Thoothukudi copper plant and a shortage of bauxite for an aluminium smelter.
A court on Wednesday put a temporary halt to Vedanta’s much-delayed plan to nearly double capacity at the Thoothukudi plant, which would make it one of the biggest copper smelters in the world.
Residents and environmental activists say emissions from the plant, India’s second biggest, are polluting the air and water, affecting people’s health.
Vedanta has denied the allegations and said it was working on restarting the plant as soon as possible. Analysts say copper contributes around 8% to the consolidated operating profit of the company.
Investors sent Vedanta’s London-listed shares down 7% in afternoon trading on Wednesday despite the company posting better-than-expected full-year results. Its Indian stock closed down more than 6%.
At about eight times, the company has the lowest price to earnings ratio among eight top London-listed resources companies including Anglo American, Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Glencore, according to Thomson Reuters SmartEstimate.
Vedanta analysts are split on their recommendation on the stock: five rate it ‘strong buy’ or ‘buy’, while three have placed ‘hold’ on the stock and two have tagged it a ‘sell’.
Element of fear
Several investment bankers said that Vedanta’s management did have a strong reputation for turning around businesses and keeping costs under control.
“Still, there is always an element of fear among the investors,"" said an international banker in reference to the various controversies it is entangled in. The banker, who has previously advised the company, declined to be named.
Vedanta, whose acquisitive journey started with Agarwal buying a copper company in 1979, now has businesses spread across the world, including India, Africa, Ireland and Australia. It was the first Indian company to list in London in 2003.
But that listing meant it became the target of a sustained campaign by a London-registered environmental group called Foil Vedanta, which holds demonstrations outside Vedanta’s annual meetings in London.
The government-run Norwegian Pension Fund dropped Vedanta from its investment portfolio in 2007, partly because of environmental issues in India. In 2014, the fund dropped Vedanta’s then unit, Sesa Sterlite.
Norway’s Council on Ethics, which makes recommendations to the pension fund, said it did a “particularly thorough assessment “ of Vedanta Resources in 2016 and found grounds to stay away from it. Edinburgh-based investment fund Martin Currie has also sold off its Vedanta shares on ethical grounds.
In Thoothukudi, Vedanta’s copper plant has been shut for more than 50 days and will remain closed until at least June 6 because the local pollution regulator has said the facility is not complying with environmental rules.
Several cases have been filed against the plant since it started in 1996, and India’s top court in 2013 fined it about $18 million for breaking environmental laws.
The next year, Vedanta lost a battle to mine bauxite in the a lushly forested area, Niyamgiri hills in Odisha state, that the Dongria Kondh tribe there considers sacred.
The rejection forced the company to not only import expensive bauxite for an aluminium plant in the same state but to also delay its expansion."

New Delhi: India’s biggest aluminium producer Vedanta Ltd may be forced to reduce output if restrictions on coal supplies to the non-power sector drag on for another week, according to its chief executive for metals business in the country. 
New Delhi: India’s biggest aluminium producer Vedanta Ltd may be forced to reduce output if restrictions on coal supplies to the non-power sector drag on for another week, according to its chief executive for metals business in the country.
Vedanta has just one day’s worth of coal stockpiles left at its Jharsuguda smelter in Odisha after a unit of state-run monopoly Coal India Ltd stopped supplies from 18 May, Samir Cairae said. Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd last week issued orders to halt deliveries to all non-power customers following a government directive to prioritize the electricity industry.
“The question now is how to run the plant,"" Cairae said in a phone interview Tuesday. If the coal shortage lasts another week, the company will be forced to shut some units at the 1.7 million tons a year smelter. “There will be no other industrial solutions,"" he said.
The government has prioritized supplies to power stations to boost their inventories, which are near the lowest since mid-February. The decision is set to bring industries that generate their own electricity using coal to a standstill, the Indian Captive Power Producers Association said this week.
Temporary measures
An aluminium smelter once shut down needs at least six months to restart, Cairae said. Vedanta will take temporary steps such as purchasing electricity from the grid to prevent a shutdown, Cairae said. The measures will bring down production, but keep the plant running.
A shutdown would not be on the cards for Vedanta because of the time required to restart the facility and a “better way would be to import coal even if they operate at lower margins as aluminium prices are still very good,"" Bhavesh Chauhan, an analyst at IDBI Capital Markets & Securities Ltd., said by phone from Mumbai. The only concern remains “whether it is logistically possible to import high amounts of coal to the plant.""
Jharsuguda requires 17 million tons of coal a year to generate electricity at its captive power plant, half of which comes from contracts with Coal India, Cairae said. It sources the rest from imports and auctions by Coal India. Vedanta imported 2 million tons for the smelter in the year through March, he said.
“We hope this matter is resolved soon and we don’t have to import more. It’s not a sustainable solution for us,"" Cairae said.
Vedanta shares extended their decline in Mumbai following deadly protests at Sesa Sterlite’s copper smelter in Tamil Nadu. The stock slid 2.1% to Rs247.40 on Thursday, the lowest level since June."

Chennai:The Madras high court on Wednesday ordered a stay on the expansion plans of Vedanta Resources Plc’s Sterlite copper smelter in Thoothukudi, even as the Tamil Nadu port town was rocked by a second day’s violence in which a protester was killed in police firing.
Police fired in the morning at protesters near the government hospital in Thoothukudi—also known as Tuticorin—while one person was killed in a second round of firing at Anna Nagar, taking the toll since the protests broke out on Tuesday to 12.
On Tuesday, 11 people were killed and more than 50 injured in police firing after a three-month-long protest against alleged pollution caused by the smelter.
The entire town was shut down on Wednesday, with shops and businesses remaining closed and transportation coming to a halt. District collector N. Venkatesh imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 till 8am on Friday.
The state government directed a suspension of all internet services in Thoothukudi and neighbouring Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari districts until 27 May.
Meanwhile, on Wednesday the Madurai bench of the Madras high court passed an interim order on a public interest litigation (PIL), staying the expansion of Sterlite Industries. The PIL had demanded cancellation of environmental clearance, stating that the company had obtained it without conducting a public hearing as prescribed by the Environmental Impact Assessment notification.
“The application for renewal of environmental clearance submitted by Vedanta shall be processed expeditiously after conduct of mandatory public hearing. In any event, the application shall be decided by the appropriate authorities within a period of four months from today — on or before 23 September 2018. In the meanwhile, Vedanta shall cease construction and all other activities on-site proposed unit II of the copper smelting plant at Tuticorin with immediate effect,"" the court observed.
“While, on the one hand, the economic benefits of encouraging industries cannot be ignored, the toll extracted on available resources, water and soil regimes by such industries, cannot also be lost sight of. There is thus yet another stakeholder before us, one that is invisible in the array of parties, the environment in itself. In balancing the interests of all parties to this public interest litigation, we believe that the interests of this hapless party should be treated on par, if not made paramount,"" said the division bench of justices M. Sundar and Anita Sumanth.
Sterlite said in a statement that the company has “appealed to the government and authorities to ensure the safety of our employees, facilities and the surrounding community. The Sterlite copper plant is currently non-operational as we await approval for the consent to operate.""
Various political parties and organisations staged agitations across Tamil Nadu condemning the police firing on the protestors. The opposition parties led by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) have called for a statewide stir on Friday. The lawyers association of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry would also organise demonstrations against the police action. The Traders Association has decided to shut businesses across Tamil Nadu on Thursday.
Opposition leader M.K. Stalin of the DMK termed the deaths in police firing “brutal murder"". “Will the chief minister take action against the director general of police for failing to maintain law and order? Will the chief secretary explain her role in this entire episode? Will there be justice for the Sterlite protest?"" asked Stalin, who visited Thoothukudi district.
“The brutality of the state police is revealed by the fact that many of those killed and injured have bullet injuries on their heads and faces,"" the Communist Party of India (Marxist) said in a statement.
CPI(M) leaders, led by state secretary K. Balakrishnan, have launched an indefinite hunger fast against the police action.
Organisations such as Amnesty India and Greenpeace India condemned the incidents.
In March, thousands of residents had gathered at Thoothukudi town to protest against the copper smelting factory, the latest in a series of protests going back over 20 years against Sterlite Industries."

Thoothukudi: Tamil Nadu state said on Thursday that it was seeking a permanent closure of a big copper smelter run by London-listed Vedanta Resources after 13 people died in protests demanding the closure of the plant on environmental grounds.
“The government’s position is very clear, it doesn’t want the plant to run,"" said Sandeep Nanduri, the top official of the district where the plant is located, after a meeting with senior state government officials. Other state officials confirmed the government’s position.
On Tuesday, police opened fire on protesters demanding that the smelter in the port city of Thoothukudi be shut down. In all, 13 protesters have been killed this week.
Residents and environmental activists say emissions from the plant, India’s second biggest, are polluting the air and water, affecting people’s health.
Earlier on Thursday, authorities cut the power to the smelter. The pollution control board of Tamil Nadu said the smelter, which was shut pending renewal of its operating license, was found last week to be preparing to resume production without permission.
On Thursday, Vedanta’s Indian stock closed down 2%.
A company spokesman did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ email seeking comment on Tamil Nadu’s closure plan and the allegation that it had been preparing to resume production without approvals. Vedanta has previously denied that the smelter has been polluting the air and water.
“The issue of renewal of consent for the year 2018-2023 has been rejected ... due to non compliance of certain conditions,"" the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) said in an order dated Wednesday.
It did not elaborate on the conditions the smelter had not met but said it “shall be disconnected with power supply and closed with immediate effect"". 
The agency told Vedanta it could not resume operations without permission.
The plant has already been shut for more than 50 days and had been ordered to stay closed until at least 6 June, pending environmental clearances."

London: Billionaire industrialist Anil Agarwal plans to leave behind a legacy: an Indian resources group to rival the world’s biggest.
The founder and owner of Vedanta Resources Plc wants to keep building the company into a giant producer of the commodities that India needs to curb its reliance on imports, create jobs and reduce poverty. Despite its insatiable appetite for materials, India is yet to impose itself among the mining heavyweights in the way that Australia, China or even the UK does.
“It can be the second- or third-largest resource company in the world,"" Agarwal, 64, said in an interview in London. Domestic resources have been key to the success of all of the world’s biggest economies and India should be no different, he said. “We thought India should have a company.""
The goal is to invest in more local production of all commodities to feed India’s rapidly growing economy, which currently depends on imports for 80 percent of its oil and minerals. What’s less clear is how Agarwal’s stake in Anglo American Plc fits into that plan. The structure of his purchase last year — he’s now Anglo’s top shareholder but effectively rents the shares — led to speculation that he might take an activist role and seek to merge assets with Vedanta.
Management talks
Anglo’s management have consulted Agarwal regularly, he said, and so far his interventions have been limited to advice that the miner shouldn’t abandon South Africa as well as offering to help it expand into India. He said he’s committed to his 21% stake in Anglo.
“I am long-term, we can always keep extending, I can buy the bonds,"" he said. “We can do anything.""
The self-made businessman has enjoyed an audacious ascent from a small-town metal business in northern India to chairman of Vedanta, which he founded in Mumbai in 1976 and listed in London in 2003. Through its local Vedanta Ltd. and Hindustan Zinc Ltd. units, it controls oil fields, zinc mines, iron ore assets and aluminium and copper operations in India. It also has mines in Zambia and South Africa.
To keep expanding, Vedanta will invest $8 billion in the next 2 and 1/2 years. That’s a bigger share of annual revenue than miners such as Rio Tinto Group and Anglo have pledged to spend over a similar period.
“We take chances,"" Agarwal said. “We are like a river, we are going as and where assets are available.""
Agarwal’s confidence is largely driven by India’s reliance on imported raw materials. The country’s economy is expected to triple by 2030, and at the moment oil and mineral imports cost the nation about $300 billion a year, he said. By developing local mines, he hopes to curb that import spend and increase the mining industry’s contribution to the economy from 2.5% to 10%.
“In India we have enough resources,"" Agarwal said “India’s policies are liberalizing and improving the ease of doing business, and we don’t have to go outside of India.""
While Agarwal sees Vedanta’s growth and his philanthropy as key to helping reduce India’s poverty, the company’s expansion plans haven’t always been welcomed in the country. Deaths this week during protests at its copper smelting operations in southern India are the latest incidents in a controversial rise that has seen the company clash with communities and environmental standards. It shows the challenges of mining in the world’s most populated democracy.
Last month, Agarwal hired AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.’s Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan to take over as chief executive officer, giving Vedanta a chief with global mining experience and a strong reputation in India. Agarwal said it will allow him to better focus on company strategy, in the way he did before former CEO Tom Albanese left last year, as well as philanthropic work. But he won’t be walking away from the company.
“I’ll never retire, why should I retire,"" he said."
133,2018-05-26,Vedanta,"Labour Party calls for Vedanta Resources to be delisted from the London Stock Exchange following the death of 13 people during violent protests against Vedanta in Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu

London: The UK’s opposition, Labour Party, has called for Vedanta Resources Ltd to be delisted from the London Stock Exchange following the death of 13 people during violent protests against the mining giant in Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu. 
London: The UK’s opposition, Labour Party, has called for Vedanta Resources Ltd to be delisted from the London Stock Exchange following the death of 13 people during violent protests against the mining giant in Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu.
John McDonnell, the UK’s shadow chancellor, said removing Vedanta Resources from the London financial markets would prevent reputational damage from the “rogue"" company, which has been operating “illegal"" mining concerns for years.
“After the massacre of the protestors this week, regulators must now take action. Vedanta must be immediately delisted from the London Stock Exchange to remove its cloak of respectability, restore confidence in the governance of the Stock Exchange, and prevent further reputational damage to London’s financial markets from this rogue corporation,"" McDonnell said in a statement on Friday.
Violent protests had erupted in Tuticorin on Tuesday as locals took to the streets demanding closure of a copper factory of the Vedanta group over pollution concerns.
“The news from Tamil Nadu that 13 protestors against Vedanta have been killed is shocking and demands action. This is a major multinational company that for years has operated illegal mining concerns, trashing the environment and forcibly evicting local people,"" he said.
The statement from the senior Labour MP, who highlighted that campaigners and international NGOs like Amnesty International have accused Vedanta of a string of human rights and environmental abuses in India, Zambia and across the globe, came as protesters are preparing to stage a major protest against Vedanta outside the Indian High Commission in London on Saturday afternoon.
Hundreds of protesters mobilised by groups such as Foil Vedanta, Tamil People in the UK, Periyar Ambedkar Study Circle, South Asia Solidarity Group, Tamil Solidarity, Parai Voice of Freedom and Veera Tamilar Munnani will stage protests alongside worldwide action to condemn the Tamil Nadu state government’s “collusion"" in what they have termed as “corporate massacre"".
Samarendra Das from Foil Vedanta also called on the UK government to investigate and delist this company. “For 15 years since Vedanta’s London listing we have been warning the British government that this criminal company is undermining democracy across India and in Zambia whilst gaining a ‘cloak of respectability’ from London.This corporate massacre on a peaceful environmental movement must be the last straw,"" he said.
Karthik Kamalakannan from Tamil People in UK added: “It is disgusting to learn that a British company has put its profits above human cries for safe air to breathe and water to drink. The leaders of this peaceful environmental movement have been targeted by snipers, which is no surprise knowing reputation of Vedanta against any uprising against them. The Internet blackout in Tuticorin destroys all semblance of democracy. This is a sad time for Tamil people.""
The groups are calling on the British government to launch an inquiry into the “multiple legal, environmental and human rights violations"" by Vedanta Resources.
Vedanta Resources’ subsidiary Sterlite Copper has begun construction of a new 4-million tonne/year smelter on the edge of the town of Tuticorin, almost doubling their capacity, but residents argue the existing smelter has continuously polluted their water and air since it was established in 1996.
They claim it has led to respiratory and skin problems, fainting and other illness, especially among children. Activists also claim that Sterlite obtained its environmental clearance illegally by falsifying information to statutory authorities, while the existing plant is regularly found to be dumping toxic waste in the town, and operating without proper licenses.
The plant releases its waste into the sensitive Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve, an area of coral reefs and mangrove forests, the protesters claim.
Sterlite was the first company set up by Anil Agarwal in India before he launched Vedanta Resources on the London Stock Exchange in 2003, which is now a multinational FTSE 250 company with operations across India and Africa.
Vedanta has previously denied that the smelter has been responsible for air and water pollution. The company said it is working with authorities to restore power to the plant, which has been offline since late March.
“I assure you that I am committed to the environment, the people of Tuticorin and Tamil Nadu, and we will abide by the law of the land. It is with your wish that we would like to continue this business,"" Agarwal said in a video message."
132,2018-05-28,Vedanta,"A combination of bad news across its operating industries has made Vedanta's stock one of the biggest losers this year among the 10-member S&P BSE India Metal Index

Mumbai: A troubled 2018 so far for billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd may get worse amid concern that its key copper smelter in southern India could remain shut until 2019, further pressuring a stock that’s down 25% since the start of the year. 
Mumbai: A troubled 2018 so far for billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd may get worse amid concern that its key copper smelter in southern India could remain shut until 2019, further pressuring a stock that’s down 25% since the start of the year.
Deadly protests last week over alleged pollution from the Tuticorin smelter have prolonged a shutdown of the 400,000 metric ton-a-year operation. After being hit earlier in the year by an iron ore mining ban and a steel acquisition roadblock, Vedanta, India’s biggest aluminium producer, has also warned it may be forced to reduce output of the metal.
The copper smelter may not restart for at least 12 months and the closure may shave about $200 million-$250 million from pre-tax earnings, said Vishal Kulkarni, a Singapore-based analyst at S&P Global Ratings. “The intensity of the protests and the intensity of the regulatory issues might mean that it could take some time.""
A combination of bad news across its operating industries has made Vedanta one of the biggest losers this year among the 10-member S&P BSE India Metal Index that’s slid by 12%. Concern over the stock’s growth prospects may see further falls, according to CNI Research Ltd.
Vedanta didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the timing of the smelter closure and the share price outlook.
The Tamil Nadu government set up an inquiry after nine people were reported killed this week in protests against the smelter, which was halted for maintenance at the end of March. The closure was extended in the face of mounting opposition from villagers over allegations that pollution was hurting locals’ health. The producer has denied the claims.
Plans to double its capacity are also under threat after a local court delivered an interim order staying the expansion until a further hearing, to be held by 23 September, Vedanta said Wednesday.
For the next nine months, any meaningful earnings from the unit would be a “very optimistic scenario, "" Kulkarni said in a phone interview. “In the past, similar regulatory issues and social unrest has limited Vedanta’s ability to mine bauxite in the eastern Indian state of Odisha.""
Vedanta’s pre-tax earnings may be Rs30,299 crore this fiscal year, according to the average of 19 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That’s an improvement on the Rs25,164 crore reported last fiscal year.
While copper and iron ore look small on the company’s balance sheet, they were considered as stable and solid cash flow providers that didn’t attract much commodity price risk, Kulkarni said.
As well as potential output cuts at its aluminium plant on coal shortages, there are media reports that the Indian government is considering a price-linked windfall tax on oil producers. If that happens it may squeeze the company’s money-spinning oil and gas unit.
All these factors have made investors wary about Vedanta’s growth prospects and may trigger further exodus from the stock, according to CNI Research’s chairman Kishor Ostwal. He expects a further 10% to 20% loss, if the problems persist for a longer period.
“A lot of investors will have concerns,"" Ostwal said. In the case of the copper unit, “it is a political issue and we need to see how it gets resolved,"" he said."
131,2018-05-28,Vedanta,"The Tamil Nadu government has asked the state pollution control board to seal Vedanta's Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi

Chennai: Sterlite Industries Ltd’s Thoothukudi plant was sealed on Monday after the Tamil Nadu government ordered its permanent closure in the wake of last week’s firing that killed 13 people protesting against the plant. 
Chennai: Sterlite Industries Ltd’s Thoothukudi plant was sealed on Monday after the Tamil Nadu government ordered its permanent closure in the wake of last week’s firing that killed 13 people protesting against the plant.
“Under section 18(1)(b) of the Water Act, 1974, in the larger public interest, the government endorses the closure direction of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and also directs the TNPCB to seal the unit and close the plant permanently,"" an order from the environment and forests department said.
It also said that under the Article 48 A of the Constitution, “the state shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country"".
Minutes after the government issued the order, Thoothukudi district collector Sandeep Nanduri sealed the Sterlite campus.
Vedanta termed the closure of the plant as an unfortunate development. “We will study the order and decide on the future course of action,"" the company said in a statement. “We have operated the plant for over 22 years in the most transparent and sustainable way, contributing to the Tuticorin and state’s socio-economic development."" 
The people of the port town, who have been protesting against Sterlite Industries for over two decades, had intensified their agitation in the last few months, when TNPCB issued ‘consent to establish’ licences to the copper smelting unit for its expansion plans that would double Sterlite’s production to 800,000 metric tonnes per annum.
Sterlite protests: Thoothukudi limping back to normalcy but anguish, pain remain
On 22 May, as thousands marched towards the district collector’s office demanding the closure of the copper smelting unit, the protest turned violent and police opened fire. According to the state government, 13 people were killed and more than 100 injured.
A day after the violence, the Madurai bench of the Madras high court passed an interim order on a public interest litigation (PIL), staying the expansion of the plant. The PIL had demanded cancellation of the environmental clearance, stating that the company had obtained it without conducting a public hearing as prescribed by the Environmental Impact Assessment notification.
The order issued by the state on Monday also highlighted that the TNPCB “did not renew the consent to operate (licence) to Vedanta Ltd’s Copper Smelter Plant"" in its order dated 9 April.
Since the last week of March, the unit has remained shut for its annual maintenance, according to the company. TNPCB also disconnected the power supply to the unit on 24 May.
Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said in Chennai that the state government has decided to shut the plant based on the request of the people who have strongly opposed it.
Earlier in the day, deputy chief minister O. Panneerselvam visited Thoothukudi. Governor Banwarilal Purohit is also expected to review the situation."
130,2018-05-28,Vedanta,"During the proceedings of NCLAT, Vedanta's advocate says status quo is causing losses to the banks involved

New Delhi: Vedanta Ltd on Monday asked the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) to vacate its order for maintaining status quo over the sale of debt ridden Electrosteel Steel.  
New Delhi: Vedanta Ltd on Monday asked the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) to vacate its order for maintaining status quo over the sale of debt ridden Electrosteel Steel. 
During the proceedings of the appellate tribunal, senior advocate C.A. Sundaram appearing for Vedanta Ltd said that status quo is causing losses to the banks involved. The NCLAT bench, headed by Justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya, has directed to list the matter tomorrow and would hear it continuously for three days till 31 May. 
On 17 May, NCLAT admitted the petition of Renaissance Steel challenging Vedanta’s bid for debt ridden Electrosteel. Renaissance Steel’s resolution application was rejected by the Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Electrosteel Steels. 
On 1 May, NCLAT had directed to maintain status quo in the case pertaining to the sale of debt ridden Electrosteel Steels to Vedanta Ltd. Renaissance has submitted before NCLAT that Vedanta is not eligible to bid for Electrosteel under section 29 A of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code as one of Vedanta’s affiliates in Zambia — a unit of its UK-based parent Vedanta Resources Plc — had been found guilty of criminal misconduct. 
It also raised an objection against CoC’s decision to not allow it to participate in the meeting in which the successful bidder was decided. The NCLT had last month approved the resolution plan submitted by Vedanta Ltd for Electrosteel Steels, making it the first among 12 large stressed accounts identified by RBI last year to get resolved under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. 
The resolution plan involved close to Rs5,300 crore cash payout and a haircut of 60% of the total banks’ debt. Electrosteel Steels owes lenders more than Rs13,000 crore, of which about Rs5,000 crore is to State Bank of India alone. 
Vedanta had said in a statement earlier that “one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries will subscribe to the share capital of Electrosteel for an aggregate amount of  ₹ 1,805 crore (USD 275.7 million) and provide additional funds aggregating to  ₹ 3,515 crore (USD 536.9 million) by way of debt"".
“Upon implementation of the Resolution Plan, the company will hold approximately 90 per cent of the paid up share capital of Electrosteel,"" it had said."

Chennai: Authorities in Tamil Nadu cancelled the allotment of a piece of land set aside for Sterlite Industries Ltd’s controversial expansion plans in Thoothukudi on Tuesday even as chief minister E.K. Palaniswami justified the police firing that killed 13 protesters last week as “unavoidable.""  
Chennai: Authorities in Tamil Nadu cancelled the allotment of a piece of land set aside for Sterlite Industries Ltd’s controversial expansion plans in Thoothukudi on Tuesday even as chief minister E.K. Palaniswami justified the police firing that killed 13 protesters last week as “unavoidable."" 
A day after the state government sealed the offices of Vedanta’s Sterlite Industries in Thoothukudi, it cancelled the allotment of the 342.22 acre-land for the copper smelting plant.
In its order, the State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu Ltd (SIPCOT) said: “In larger public interest, the land allotment made by SIPCOT for the proposed expansion of copper smelter plant (phase 2) by Vedanta Ltd is hereby cancelled. The price collected for the said land allotment will be refunded as per norms of SIPCOT.""
The corporation’s move followed days of protests over the alleged environmental impact of the smelter, triggering police firing in which 13 protesters died. SIPCOT had allotted the land to Vedanta through various orders between 2005 and 2010.
Vedanta termed the closure of the plant as unfortunate. “We will study the order and decide on the future course of action,"" it said in a statement.
Protests against Sterlite Industries, which go back to over two decades, intensified in the past few months, after the state pollution control board gave its “consent to establish"" licences to the copper smelting unit for its expansion. It would have doubled Sterlite’s production to 800,000 metric tonnes per annum.
Palaniswami tabled a report in the state assembly that said police took measures like bursting tear gas shells and making baton charges against those who indulged in violence on 22 May. 
“In unavoidable circumstances, police personnel were forced to take action,"" he added, triggering a walkout by the opposition, which called the order for permanent closure of the smelter an “eyewash."" 
Tamil Nadu DGP T.K. Rajendran said on Tuesday the case related to the anti- Sterlite protests would be transferred to the Crime Branch Crime Investigation Department (CB-CID).
The question of who ordered police to fire into the protesters was answered when copies of a First Information Report or FIR from the police stations of SIPCOT, Thoothukudi north and south revealed that three deputy tahsildars had given their consent to the police action.
The FIR, reviewed by Mint, said that despite prohibitory orders members of fringe groups among the protesters instigated the violence. It also added that “over 10, 000 people with deadly weapons"", damaged public property.
A complaint by Special Deputy Tahsildar (Election) P. Sekar said that he ordered the police to open fire as a “last resort,"" after warnings, using of tear gas and a lathicharge."

New Delhi: Vedanta Resources Plc is working on a legal challenge to Tamil Nadu ordering a permanent shutdown of the Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi, but it will not proceed until tensions over the deaths of 13 people during protests last week have eased, two people told Reuters. 
New Delhi: Vedanta Resources Plc is working on a legal challenge to Tamil Nadu ordering a permanent shutdown of the Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi, but it will not proceed until tensions over the deaths of 13 people during protests last week have eased, two people told Reuters.
Tamil Nadu ordered the permanent closure of the Sterlite copper plant on Monday after police fired on protesters demanding its closure on environmental grounds.
London-listed Vedanta, majority owned by billionaire Anil Agarwal, considers it is now left with no other option than to file a writ petition challenging the Tamil Nadu government’s decision in the Madras high court or the Supreme Court in New Delhi, the two people close to the company said.
“They have not presented a single (piece of) evidence against the company,"" said one of the people, both of whom declined to be named. “Vedanta is confident that it has a strong case legally. It has not violated any law.""
However, the people said that with local tensions running high over the deaths of the protesters, the resources company was holding off for now from filing the legal challenge.
A Vedanta spokesman did not respond to requests seeking comment. The company earlier said it had broken no rules, and hoped soon to reopen the plant and double its capacity to 800,000 tonnes a year at a cost of more than $700 million.
The chief of Vedanta’s India copper business, P. Ramnath, told Reuters on Friday the company would legally fight any attempt to close the plant.
D. Jayakumar, a senior Tamil Nadu minister, said the Sterlite copper plant was closed mainly in response to the demands of residents of the coastal city of Thoothukudi, and that the state government would defend itself in court.
“We’ve closed the plant based on various violations raised by the pollution control board. They will of course say that they have not violated any rule,"" Jayakumar, who speaks for the state government, told Reuters. “People are totally against the plant. We’re with the people only. We go by their demand and the law.""
He declined to give details of the violations.
D. Sekar, a senior official with the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, also declined to explain the reasons, saying only that the closure was a “policy decision"".
The plant, India’s second-biggest copper plant known as Sterlite Copper, has been shut since late March for maintenance and pending a renewal of its licence, as residents continued largely peaceful protests demanding it be shut for good.
Residents of Thoothukudi and environmental activists have long demanded a shutdown of the copper smelter, which has annual production of more than 400,000 tonnes, citing air and water pollution. Vedanta denies the accusations of pollution.
The opposition escalated last week when thousands of people marched towards a government office on the 100th day of the protest. Ten people were killed in police firing that day, while three more died in subsequent days, piling pressure on the state government as protests spread elsewhere in the state.
Minister Jayakumar said his government has been opposed to the smelter since 2013, when a suspected gas leak led to its closure for more than two months. The plant was allowed to reopen after a court-appointed team of experts found no instance of emissions beyond set limits.
In recent weeks, however, Tamil Nadu has cancelled a decision to allocate a plot of land to Vedanta for a doubling of the plant’s capacity and cut its electricity connection and water supply, he said."
125,2018-05-30,Vedanta,"The NCLAT, however, reserved its verdict on Vedanta's eligibility to submit a resolution plan for Electrosteel Steels under Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Wednesday permitted Vedanta Ltd to make an upfront payment of Rs5,320 crore to the Committee of Creditors (CoC) of debt-ridden Electrosteel Steels India Ltd, according to its approved debt resolution plan. 
New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Wednesday permitted Vedanta Ltd to make an upfront payment of Rs5,320 crore to the Committee of Creditors (CoC) of debt-ridden Electrosteel Steels India Ltd, according to its approved debt resolution plan.
However, the appellate tribunal reserved its verdict on Vedanta’s eligibility to submit a resolution plan under Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) asked the parties to “act in terms of the (resolution) plan"", which, effectively, vacated an earlier order passed by it asking Vedanta and its committee of creditors to maintain status quo in Electrosteel’s corporate insolvency resolution process.
Subsequently, if Vedanta’s bid is found to be in contravention of IBC, the lenders will revert the amount received, the appellate tribunal clarified.
A two-judge bench led by Justice S.J. Mukhopadhyaya was hearing an appeal by Renaissance Steel India Pvt. Ltd, one of the unsuccessful bidders for Electrosteel, against a 17 April order of National Company Law Tribunal’s (NCLT’s) Kolkata bench, approving Vedanta Ltd’s Rs5,320 crore resolution plan for Electrosteel.
Renaissance Steel had contended that Vedanta was ineligible to bid under Section 29A of the IBC as one of Vedanta’s affiliates in Zambia—a unit of its UK-based parent Vedanta Resources Plc—had been found guilty of violating certain environmental laws, punishable with two or more years in jail. 
A similar objection was raised by Renaissance Steel against another bidder, Tata Steel Ltd, claiming that one of its UK subsidiaries had flouted the UK Health and Safety at Work Act, and fines were imposed on it.
Renaissance Steel’s appeal seeking Tata Steel’s ineligibility under the IBC is pending before the appellate tribunal.

“The permanent closure of Vedanta’s Indian copper operations is credit negative because it will reduce the company’s scale and business diversity, adding pressure to its other business segments to maintain their strong performance and make up the total revenue and EBITDA decline,"" Moody’s said in a statement. 
Further, it said, the cancellation of Vedanta’s land rights towards the copper expansion is a key concern in view of the company’s ability to restart copper smelting operations. 
It is yet unclear to what extent the company will be compensated for the land acquired for the expansion. 
“Only 26% of the $717 million capital spending was incurred until March 2018, but the company’s ability to recoup the amount spent is likely to be difficult,"" it said. 
Moody’s further said it expects Vedanta’s other businesses—zinc, aluminium and oil and gas—to deliver a solid performance in 2018-19, mirroring strong commodity prices and higher production volumes.
As such, the copper smelter shutdown has no immediate impact on Vedanta’s ratings, the statement said. 
“We expect the company’s scale, as measured by pro forma revenue for fiscal 2018, to decline by 25% to $11.5 billion from $15.4 billion. Vedanta’s reported EBITDA will decline 5% to $3.85 billion from $4.1 billion pro forma for fiscal 2018,"" it said. 
Vedanta’s copper operations have historically generated low profitability as compared with the company’s other business segments. 
The company’s copper operations in India generated single digit EBITDA margins, because the operational and financial performance of the copper smelter depends upon the availability and the price of the copper concentrate which is used to produce end products such as copper bars, rods and wires."

Mumbai: Billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd has taken over on Monday control of bankrupt company Electrosteel Steels Ltd, the former said in a regulatory filing. 
Mumbai: Billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd has taken over on Monday control of bankrupt company Electrosteel Steels Ltd, the former said in a regulatory filing.
In its note to stock exchanges, Vedanta Ltd said that its fully-owned subsidiary Vedanta Star Ltd (VSL) has deposited an upfront amount of Rs5,320 crore in an escrow account for the Electrosteel acquisition.
VSL has funded this acquisition by way of equity infusion of Rs1,765 crore and an inter-corporate loan of Rs3,555 crore. VSL now holds 90% of the paid-up capital of Elelctrosteel and has appointed a new board of directors.
This acquisition marks Vedanta’s entry into steelmaking in India. Electrosteel has a steel manufacturing capacity of 1.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in Bokaro, Jharkhand. VSL believes the plant’s capacity can be increased to 2.5 mtpa.
Last week, the National Company Law Tribunal allowed Vedanta to make the upfront payment that would seal its takeover of Electrosteel. However, the court has reserved its verdict on Vedanta’s eligibility to take over the debt-ridden steel company. Renaissance Steel, which had also bid for Electrosteel, contends that Vedanta is ineligible under Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) as one of Vedanta’s affiliates in Zambia — a unit of its UK-based parent Vedanta Resources Plc—had been found guilty of violating certain environmental laws.
This is the second company in the RBI’s dirty dozen list of toxic corporate borrowers, which have been sold to new owners under IBC. In May, Tata Steel acquired the distressed assets of Bhushan Steel for Rs35,200 crore."

The company has allotted nearly 740 crore equity shares to 26 lenders, out of which the country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) got 271,61,79,203 equity shares. 
“The company has issued and allotted 7,399,132,055 equity shares of Rs10 each on a preferential/private placement basis to financial creditors of the company...pursuant to conversion of loan equivalent to Rs73,991,320,550 in terms of Resolution Plan approved by National Company Law Tribunal- Kolkata Bench,"" Electrosteel Steels said in a regulatory filing. 
The company had on Tuesday spelled out steps to be taken for completion of its takeover by Vedanta Star Ltd and subsequent delisting from stock exchanges. 
In a filing to the BSE, it had said that since the liquidation value of the company as determined by the Resolution Professional is not sufficient to cover the debt of financial creditors in full, the liquidation value of the company in the hands of equity shareholder is nil. 
However, it added that “as per the Resolution plan, the shareholder of the company will be paid  ₹ 0.19 per equity share they hold as on date (Pre-capital Reduction Price). “On completion of Transaction Steps, Vedanta Star Ltd will make the delisting offer to the then shareholders of the company. The equivalent per share exit price post completion of Transaction Steps is  ₹ 9.54 per equity share (Post-capital Reduction Price),"" Electrosteel Steels said. 
In March, Vedanta was declared as successful resolution applicant by the committee of creditors (CoC) for Electrosteel Steels Ltd under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.

120,2018-06-20,Vedanta,"Vedanta says a sulphuric acid leak from a tank at its Sterlite copper plant at  Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu is severe and inaction can lead to serious environmental consequences

Thoothukudi: Vedanta Ltd said on Wednesday a sulphuric acid leak from a tank at its Sterlite copper plant in Tamil Nadu was severe and inaction could lead to serious environmental consequences.  
Thoothukudi: Vedanta Ltd said on Wednesday a sulphuric acid leak from a tank at its Sterlite copper plant in Tamil Nadu was severe and inaction could lead to serious environmental consequences. 
The district administration had said on Sunday the leak at the plant in the seaside town of Thoothukudi was minor, and steps were being taken to empty the storage tanks as a safety precaution.
“There is a severe leakage in the pipe flanges and ... the pipe flanges are submerged in the acid pool collected in the dykes around the acid storage tank,"" the company said in a petition to the Madras high court.
The Tamil Nadu government ordered a permanent closure of the plant and disconnected the power supply last month following protests over alleged pollution that turned violent and culminated in the police opening fire on protesters, killing 13 of them.
Vedanta, the Indian subsidiary of London-listed Vedanta Resources, said it sought a limited reconnection of the electricity supply for maintenance to guard against a potential loss of life and damage to air and ground water.
“There is a grave risk and danger as there are other tanks and there are flammable chemicals and materials within the plant area,"" it said.
However, the district’s top administrative official Sandeep Nanduri stuck to the earlier view that the leak was minor. 
“That is their version, and this is ours. However, we are completely evacuating the sulphuric acid from all tanks as a safety precaution,"" said Nanduri.
Activists and residents have demanded a permanent shutdown of the plant, which they said was causing air and water pollution. Locals and activists see the smelter as a risk to fisheries. Vedanta says the protests are based on false notions.
Police said on Wednesday they had arrested about 50 people over the past week, taking the total to 254 for rioting and causing damage to property. Some people said they were being unfairly targeted over the protests and there was an atmosphere of fear in the town and surrounding villages.
Naseeba Bhanu, from a village 115 km from the town, said she had only learnt from a television news bulletin that her husband and two sons, who had taken part in the protests, had been arrested under the National Security Act, which gives police the authority to detain people without charge for up to a year.
Police officer Murali Ramba said things were returning to normal after the violence that erupted last month, the most serious anti-industrial action in years in India.
“Women were sleeping outside their houses till 2 days ago, fearing late-night raids. They have gone back to sleeping in their houses after we assured them there was no reason to fear,"" he said.
The smelter, which has been shut for about three months, accounted for over a third of India’s refined copper production, and employed over 3,000 people. The company plans to appeal the government’s move to shut the plant."

Mumbai: Utility vehicles maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd is currently the most-preferred Sensex stock for analysts as they place their bets on improving demand in the rural sector on the back of a good monsoon.
Of the top five most preferred stocks, three are financials, with ICICI Bank being the second-most preferred stock, and most preferred financial stock despite being in the news for all the wrong reasons, as brokerages welcomed cheaper valuations coupled with steps to investigate alleged wrongdoing.
The analysis includes stocks which have the highest percentage of buys/outperform/add ratings from the Sensex pack of the total ratings for the respective stocks.
According to data from Bloomberg, Mahindra is the most preferred stock with 42, or 97.67% of analysts tracking the stock rating it a buy or outperform, and only one analyst or 2.33% of the total analysts rating the stock a hold or a neutral. There were no sell ratings on the stock.
Mahindra shares that started rallying on 21 February have gained 26.8% since then. Year to date, they are up 19.6% at  ₹  898.30, outperforming BSE’s benchmark 30-share Sensex which rose 4.21% during the period.

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Wednesday refused to stay the delisting of Electrosteel Steel Ltd shares by its new promoter Vedanta Ltd, pursuant to the approval of the latter’s insolvency resolution plan for the debt-ridden steel manufacturer. 
Vedanta Star Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vedanta Ltd, intended to make a delisting offer to the existing shareholders of Electrosteel, offering an equivalent exit price of  ₹ 9.54 per equity share after completion of the transaction steps for capital restructuring, according to a regulatory filing by Electrosteel with the BSE earlier this month.
The order by a two-judge bench led by justice S.J. Mukhopadhyay came on an application moved by Renaissance Steel India Pvt. Ltd, one of the unsuccessful bidders for Electrosteel, seeking to halt Electrosteel’s takeover by Vedanta.
The application was part of the main appeal by Renaissance Steel against a 17 April order of the National Company Law Tribunal’s (NCLT’s) Kolkata bench, approving Vedanta Ltd’s  ₹ 5,320 crore resolution plan for Electrosteel.
Renaissance Steel has contested Vedanta’s eligibility to bid under Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) as one of Vedanta’s affiliates in Zambia, a unit of its UK-based parent Vedanta Resources Plc, had been found guilty of violating certain environmental laws, punishable with two or more years in jail.
NCLAT had on 30 May reserved its verdict on Vedanta’s eligibility to submit a resolution plan, after hearing counsels for Renaissance Steel and Vedanta at length. 
The appellate tribunal, however, allowed Vedanta to make an upfront payment of  ₹ 5,320 crore to the committee of creditors (CoC) of Electrosteel, according to its approved debt resolution plan, and to further “act in terms of the (resolution) plan"".
If Vedanta’s bid is subsequently found by NCLAT to be in contravention of IBC, the lenders would revert the money received.
State Bank of India’s insolvency plea against Electrosteel, which is one of the 12 initial NPA accounts identified by the Reserve Bank of India for resolution, was admitted by NCLT’s Kolkata bench in July 2017."

Bengaluru: Vedanta Resources Plc said on Monday that chairman Anil Agarwal’s family trust has agreed to buy the rest of the company in a deal that values the mining conglomerate at £2.3 billion ($3.03 billion). An independent committee, formed to review and evaluate the proposal, has indicated to Volcan Investments that it supports the offer and intends to recommend a firm offer to Vedanta’s shareholders. Volcan currently holds about 66.53% of Vedanta. 
Bengaluru: Vedanta Resources Plc said on Monday that chairman Anil Agarwal’s family trust has agreed to buy the rest of the company in a deal that values the mining conglomerate at £2.3 billion ($3.03 billion). An independent committee, formed to review and evaluate the proposal, has indicated to Volcan Investments that it supports the offer and intends to recommend a firm offer to Vedanta’s shareholders. Volcan currently holds about 66.53% of Vedanta.
The offer of 825 pence per share represents a 27.6% premium to London-listed Vedanta’s close on Friday of 646.8 pence.
In addition to the offer price, shareholders will also be entitled to receive a previously announced dividend of 41 cents per Vedanta share, the company said, adding that this would boost the offer price to 856 pence per share.
Industrialist Agarwal said last year he does not intend to keep Vedanta in family hands and would withdraw from the group in the next few years. Agarwal is also Anglo American’s biggest shareholder with a nearly 20% stake through Volcan. Agarwal earlier this year played down speculation that he is seeking a tie-up with Anglo.
Vedanta has come under increased scrutiny in India since police opened fire on protesters, killing 13, at a demonstration against a copper smelter in May. The smelter has since been shut down."
115,2018-07-03,Vedanta,"Anil Agarwal's move to delist Vedanta Resources comes weeks after killing of 13 protesters in police firing at the firm's copper smelter plant in Tamil Nadu last month

New Delhi: Mining mogul Anil Agarwal on Tuesday said that his plan to delist his flagship Vedanta Resources Plc from London Stock Exchange and take it private is no way linked to the Tuticorin incident and is merely an exercise to simplify a sprawling business empire. 
New Delhi: Mining mogul Anil Agarwal on Tuesday said that his plan to delist his flagship Vedanta Resources Plc from London Stock Exchange and take it private is no way linked to the Tuticorin incident and is merely an exercise to simplify a sprawling business empire.
Agarwal, who launched a $1 billion offer to buy the 33.65% stake of London-listed Vedanta that his family trust does not own, while on a cruise with family in the Mediterranean, said the liquidity of Indian markets now means that the need for a separate London listing is no longer critical.
The move to delist Vedanta came weeks after killing of 13 protesters in police firing at the firm’s copper smelter plant in Tamil Nadu last month that led to political opposition to the company in the UK and drop in its share price.
There were demands from some quarters that the firm be delisted from London Stock Exchange. Asked if the decision was linked to the turn of events at Tuticorin, Agarwal said: “No link at all. This is driven by the desire to simplify the corporate structure"".
Vedanta, which owns copper, aluminium, iron ore, oil and steel businesses, has been facing environmental pressure on its operations. Protesters at Tuticorin were demanding the closure of Vedanta’s copper smelter when they were fired upon by the police.
Agarwal said there will be no material impact of delisting on the businesses. “The rationale for the move is two-fold. One, corporate simplification. We have been simplifying for years, through the merger of the Indian companies to create Vedanta Ltd, and then the merger of Cairn India into Vedanta Ltd. This transaction is a logical next step in that process. Two, increasing maturity of Indian markets. The liquidity of Indian markets now means that the need for a separate London listing is no longer critical,"" he told PTI.
Volcan, a holding company owned by a trust controlled by Agarwal, on Monday announced an intention to make a $1 billion offer to buy the 33.65% of Vedanta at 825 pence per share. He said that the announcement was an intention to make an offer. “It is expected that an offer will be made in 28 days. That offer will be open for a certain period of time governed by UK rules (3-6 weeks), following which the process will be completed.""
Asked how the share purchase will be funded, he said Volcan has the financing for the offer lined up and will announce details before the formal offer. If his offer goes through, Agarwal will be left with just two Mumbai-listed companies—Vedanta Ltd, that produces everything from oil and gas to copper, and Hindustan Zinc Ltd.
“Post delisting, there will be two listed entities: Vedanta Ltd and HZL. Both are listed in India, and Vedanta Ltd also has an ADR listing on the New York Stock Exchange,"" he said. Vedanta Resources listed on London in December 2003, raising just over 500 million pounds from a sale of shares at 390 pence.
Agarwal said there is no plan “at this stage"" to further consolidate the subsidiaries under one umbrella. While its Tuticorin plant has been shut down, Vedanta’s iron ore business too has been hit by the Supreme Court, ordering a suspension of mining in Goa, where most of its iron ore mines are located. The company’s mines in Karnataka, however, continue to operate.
It recently entered the steel business by acquiring bankrupt Indian firm Electrosteel Steels Ltd.
Vedanta Resources owns 50.1% of Vedanta Ltd and has near 65% holding in Hindustan Zinc. It also owns 79.4% of Konkona Copper Mines in Zambia, Africa."
116,2018-07-03,Vedanta,"The Vedanta Group's statement of Vedanta Resources delisting does not hint at any change in its plans for Vedanta Ltd

Vedanta Resources Plc’s decision to delist from exchanges appears to have pleased Vedanta Ltd’s (Vedanta) investors. If Vedanta becomes the vehicle for the group’s future global investments, they will get a slice of that action as well. But that’s a long shot. 
Vedanta Resources Plc’s decision to delist from exchanges appears to have pleased Vedanta Ltd’s (Vedanta) investors. If Vedanta becomes the vehicle for the group’s future global investments, they will get a slice of that action as well. But that’s a long shot.
On Monday, Vedanta’s shares were initially down, joining other metal shares in the dumps. After Vedanta Resources’ statement, the mood changed and its shares gained 1.25%, while the BSE Metal Index was down by 1.8%.
Ordinarily, Vedanta Resources’ delisting should not matter to domestic investors. The desire to delist, according to a report in The Economic Times, was due to protests in the UK following the controversy over alleged environmental violations at its Tuticorin copper smelter and deaths of protestors in police firing.
The official statement, however, says the delisting will simplify the group corporate structure, and eliminate dual listing. Dual listing is mentioned because most of Vedanta Resources’ valuation is derived from Vedanta. In FY18, 92% of Vedanta Resources’ revenue and 97.4% of its Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) was attributable to Vedanta.
Vedanta Resources was created to access international capital markets for the group. Subsequent years saw restructuring of group holdings, leaving Vedanta as the main holding company in India. This development and India’s deepened capital markets are the reasons why Vedanta Resources does not require to be listed, according to the statement.
One definite implication is that those wanting to remain invested in the Vedanta group will have to buy Vedanta’s shares. That’s a new source of demand for its shares.
The bigger picture is that any significant fundraising by the Vedanta group, requiring it to access public equity markets, is likely to be done through Vedanta. That gives investors the opportunity to participate in the group’s expansion plans also. This can cut both ways; for example, investors may not want to participate in an investment that the group is interested in.
Now, the promoter group could still make investments privately. For instance, Volcan has an interest of just over 20% stake in Anglo American Plc, according to the Financial Times. When the fund requirement is of a higher order, that’s when a listed company’s balance sheet will be required. That’s where Vedanta will come in.
Still, there is the matter of the promoter group’s eventual designs on Anglo American. If they do acquire control—which they have denied being interested in—they may still own an overseas listed company.
While Monday’s development does elevate Vedanta’s status to that of the group’s uncontested listed flagship, it does not automatically mean it will also be the launch vehicle for the Vedanta group’s global ambitions. The group’s statement also does not hint at any change in its plans for Vedanta. When the group makes its next big move, what part Vedanta plays will give a sure indication of how deep a change this is."

Mumbai: Volcan Investments Ltd, the family trust of Vedanta Resources Plc. founder Anil Agarwal, is considering a plan to acquire control of Anglo American Plc’s South African business by merging Vedanta Resources with the South African unit via a share swap, two people directly aware of the plan said. 
The merger of Vedanta Resources and Anglo American South Africa will create an entity valued at about $7 billion and eventually give Volcan Investments control of the merged entity, the people said, requesting anonymity. Agarwal, through Volcan, already owns a 19.35% stake in parent Anglo American.
The control of Anglo American South Africa will give Agarwal, who rose from a scrap metal dealer to become a metals billionaire, control of a company that owns the iconic De Beers, the world’s largest diamond producer. 
Volcan Investments on Monday offered to purchase the shares in Vedanta Resources that it does not already own and then delist the company from the London Stock Exchange, as part of a plan to simplify the company’s structure.
“So, once Vedanta Resources merges with Anglo American SA as per the plan being thought about, Volcan will become a promoter shareholder in the merged entity. Volcan will first attempt to secure a board approval for taking over Anglo American SA, whose value is estimated at around $4 billion, but even if that does not happen, Vedanta Resources will look to increase its stake to over 50% in Anglo American SA, which will increase Volcan’s economic interest in Anglo American,"" said one of the two people cited above.
Anglo American SA’s businesses include four firms—Anglo American Platinum Ltd, Coal SA, De Beers Consolidated Mines and Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. The four units own assets worth around $12 billion in South Africa.
At present, both Agarwal’s Vedanta Group and Anglo American are valued at around $35 billion each.
Marcelo Esquivel, a spokesperson for Anglo American Plc. declined to comment on the proposed takeover in response to an email. A spokesperson for Vedanta Group also declined to comment.
An email sent to Volcan Investments on Monday remained unanswered till Tuesday night.
Also read: Cheering Vedanta Ltd’s elevation as listed flagship may be premature
“The idea is to first buy back the public shares of Vedanta Resources, which will save costs of being listed and make holding structure simpler,"" said the second person. “The second stage of the strategy is to take over Anglo American SA so that Volcan’s economic interest increases further in the company and is able to gain from Anglo’s growth. In the third stage, an option is to list the merged entity, which will ultimately benefit all stakeholders.""
He said the strategy will potentially help Vedanta create one of the world’s biggest mining giants and compete with larger rivals such as BHP Billiton Plc., Rio Tinto Plc., Vale SA and Glencore Plc.
Agarwal’s Volcan Investments, which currently holds 66.53% in Vedanta Resources, offered 825 pence a share, around 14% premium to the company’s three-month volume weighted average price, to buy out the 33.5% stake the company does not own for about $1 billion.
Vedanta said it does not find the London listing necessary to access capital."

New Delhi: British energy firm Cairn Energy Plc on Monday said the Indian government had sold some of the shares it owned in Vedanta Ltd, which were earlier attached in a tax dispute, for $216 million. 
New Delhi: British energy firm Cairn Energy Plc on Monday said the Indian government had sold some of the shares it owned in Vedanta Ltd, which were earlier attached in a tax dispute, for $216 million.
The Edinburgh-based company had received 5% stake and preference shares in Vedanta in exchange for its residual stake in its former subsidiary Cairn India, which has been merged with Vedanta. 
Citing an income-tax department communication, Cairn Energy said after the sale, the attached shares amount to a 3% stake in Vedanta. “It is possible that the Indian income-tax department may make further sales,"" added the company.
Cairn Energy, which sold its Indian arm to Vedanta’s parent, Vedanta Resources Plc, in 2011, retained roughly 10% stake in the unit, which was later attached by the tax department to recover alleged tax dues arising from a retrospective change in tax law in 2012. The tax department is seeking to recover capital gains tax on a 2006 internal reorganization of Cairn India Ltd prior to its listing in 2007 and subsequent sale to Vedanta Resources.
Cairn Energy said it is pursuing restitution of $1.3 billion losses from the Indian government on account of the regulatory action. After the share sale, Cairn will write down the carrying value of its investment in Vedanta, resulting in an impairment charge. Cairn’s demand for compensation for the regulatory action is now part of an international arbitration. Final hearings are scheduled for two weeks from 20 August in The Hague, said the company.
So far, the tax department has seized dividends due to Cairn from its shareholding in Vedanta totalling about $155 million, and has offset a tax rebate of $234 million due to Cairn from overpayment of capital gains tax on a separate matter, the company said.
The tax department claims a principal tax due of about  ₹ 10,200 crore plus interest and penalties. The company claims the arbitration will result in a binding and internationally enforceable award.
“The group has legal advice confirming that the maximum amount that could ultimately be recovered from Cairn by the Indian income-tax department is limited to the value of Cairn UK Holdings Ltd’s assets, principally the ordinary and preference shares in Vedanta Ltd, plus the seized dividends and tax refund from 2011,"" said the company in an update issued on the tax dispute."

The Sterlite copper plant has been shut since May after the Tamil Nadu government cut power supply to the unit, following violent protests over alleged pollution resulted in the death of 13 people in police firing.
Vedanta has sought a permanent injunction against the state government from interfering with the operations of its copper smelter, according to a petition filed with the country’s environmental court.
“This (plant) is about 2% of our balance sheet... and if the plant is shut down for the whole year we will have a loss of about $100 million,"" Agarwal told the channel.
Agarwal did not elaborate and the company did not respond to Reuters’ email seeking comments.
When asked about his firm’s backup plan if the government orders for a permanent closure of the plant, he said “Whatever will happen, we will accept.""
Agarwal, however, said he was hopeful of a resolution to the shutdown.
Shares in the company were trading down 2.74% at  ₹ 202.50 by 0720 GMT, after falling as much as 3.6% earlier in the session.
Vedanta, which aims to delist its shares from the London Stock Exchange, has interest in hydrocarbons, metal and mining business in India.
The company wants to raise its stake in Hindustan Zinc Ltd through purchase of government’s stake.
“The government had intentions to give another 20-25% of shares and whenever they give, we will take it and we can merge in and make it (Hindustan Zinc) one Vedanta Ltd. But at this point I am very comfortable to run the entire company together,"" he said.
Agarwal said Vedanta’s current cost of oil production stands at $6 a barrel and it aims to produce 50% of the country’s oil output. The company produces about 30% of India’s oil output, mainly through its block in the desert state of Rajasthan."

“Only certain chemicals that are at the bottom of the tank and, that cannot be sucked haven’t been cleared. These will be neutralized inside the Sterlite campus,"" he said.
Nanduri also dismissed rumours that the copper unit will be reopened.
The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Monday refused to grant an interim stay to Vedanta on the Tamil Nadu government’s order on the closure of the Sterlite unit and fixed 9 August as the date for final hearing.
Last month, the state government had constituted a committee to remove acids and chemicals from the site, following reports of acid leak inside the factory.
A recent Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) study had also indicated high levels of groundwater contamination in and around the Sterlite plant.
“The study indicates that most of the groundwater samples are contaminated with high total dissolved solids (TDS) and heavy metals like cadmium, chromium, manganese, iron and arsenic, which are beyond (the) permissible limit,"" Arjun Ram Meghwal, the Union minister of state for water resources, said in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha last week.
Sterlite, however, countered that the unit is equipped with sufficient effluent treatment plants as well as three reverse osmosis facilities that support 100% recycling. As such, there is no possibility of groundwater contamination due to the plant’s operations, it said.
The people of the port town, who have been protesting against Sterlite Industries for more than two decades, had intensified their agitation earlier this year, when the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) issued “consent to establish"" licences to the copper smelting unit for its expansion plans that would double Sterlite’s production to 800,000 metric tonnes per annum.
On 22 May, as thousands marched towards the district collector’s office demanding the closure of the copper smelting unit, the protest turned violent and police opened fire. According to the state government, 13 people were killed and more than 100 injured.
A week later, the Tamil Nadu government sealed the Sterlite unit in Thoothukudi and cancelled the allotment of the 342.22 acres for the expansion of the copper smelting plant.
However, according to the company, the unit has remained shut for its annual maintenance since the last week of March. 
TNPCB also disconnected the power supply to the unit on 24 May."

106,2018-08-02,Vedanta,"How Vedanta's output ramps up in the rest of 2018-19 will determine how profitability improves

The steep fall in Vedanta Ltd’s shares in the first quarter was in anticipation of its performance suffering on multiple fronts. If the firm’s shares still fell by 1.8% on Wednesday, that’s perhaps taking cognizance of the time required for its performance to regain form. The rest of FY19 is likely to see a gradual return to better sales growth. 
The steep fall in Vedanta Ltd’s shares in the first quarter was in anticipation of its performance suffering on multiple fronts. If the firm’s shares still fell by 1.8% on Wednesday, that’s perhaps taking cognizance of the time required for its performance to regain form. The rest of FY19 is likely to see a gradual return to better sales growth.
The risks are from the volatility in metal prices, due to the uncertainty caused by the trade wars that are playing out. That China is reporting slower industrial growth in recent months should also be a concern for metal producers globally.
Vedanta’s sales declined by 19.6% sequentially although it managed to hold its Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margins steady. Its copper business suffered during the quarter due to the smelter shutdown at Tuticorin, while its iron ore division has seen business suffer from the mining shutdown in Goa. There is no clarity on when these operations can resume and to that extent, they will continue to cast a shadow on its performance in FY19.
The company’s zinc business is normally a star performer, but lower output in India and even in its international business saw it underperform. The good news, however, is that output will increase in the next three quarters. Considering that zinc contributed to 62% of segment profit in FY18, a recovery here will make a significant difference to Vedanta’s profits. Rising oil prices saw the profitability of the oil and gas business improve.
The aluminium business is expected to benefit in FY19 from higher usage of locally sourced high-quality bauxite and lower-cost coal supplies. Aluminium output is also expected to increase.
What should investors look out for in FY19? Global events pose an overarching risk. How Vedanta’s output ramps up in the rest of the year will determine how profitability improves. Higher output will add to revenues and lower the per unit cost of production. A sharp fall in metal prices is a main risk, as it can hurt margins even if output increases. Resolution of its stranded copper and iron ore businesses are crucial events.
Lastly, the company has sufficient cash on its consolidated books and its business generates enough cash to meet ongoing capital expenditure. The promoters are proposing to delist Vedanta’s parent company Vedanta Resources Plc from the London Stock Exchange. Once that happens, the question is if there is a plan to further expand the group’s presence in the global metals industry. And if yes, then the role Vedanta’s balance sheet plays in that expansion is something to watch out for."
105,2018-08-07,Vedanta,"The Empowered Committee of Secretaries has cleared award of blocks offered in OALP-1, the recommendations will now go to ministers of finance and petroleum for approval

New Delhi: Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd is likely to bag as many as 40 oil and gas exploration blocks in India’s maiden open acreage auction, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. 
New Delhi: Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd is likely to bag as many as 40 oil and gas exploration blocks in India’s maiden open acreage auction, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
An Empowered Committee of Secretaries (ECS) has cleared award of blocks offered in OALP-1, bidding for which closed on 2 May. The recommendations of the panel will now go to ministers of finance and petroleum for approval, they said.
The Union Cabinet had in April delegated its power to ministers of finance and petroleum to award oil and gas blocks to their winners in the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) auction.
At the close of the bidding on 2 May, Vedanta’s oil and gas arm, Cairn India had bid for all the 55 blocks on offer while state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had bid for 37 blocks either on its own or in consortium with other state-owned firms. State-owned Oil India Ltd (OIL) bid for 22 blocks in a similar fashion.
Sources said while Vedanta is likely to walk away with 40 blocks, ONGC may get two or a maximum of three areas. Hindustan Oil Exploration Co (HOEC) is likely to get one while OIL may get around half a dozen blocks. They said the award of the blocks is awaiting the finance minister’s nod. 
Piyush Goyal is officiating as the finance minister as Arun Jaitley recuperates from a renal transplant. It is being speculated that Jaitley may be back in office as early as next week and may clear the OALP-1 bids.
When the bids closed on 2 May, Vedanta was the sole bidder for two blocks and had either ONGC or OIL as a direct competitor in the remaining. Except for the two blocks that received three bids each, all the other 53 had just two bidders. 
Neither local giants Reliance Industries nor any foreign company participated in the auction, a first since India began offering oil and gas area for exploration and production through bids in 1999. 
India had in July last year allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice with a view to bringing about 2.8 million sq km of unexplored area in the country under exploration. 
Under this policy, companies are allowed to put in an expression of interest (EoI) for prospecting of oil and gas in an area that is presently not under any production or exploration license. The EoIs can be put in any time of the year but they are accumulated twice annually. 
As many as 55 blocks were sought for prospecting of oil and gas by prospective bidders, mostly by state-owned explorers, ONGC and OIL, and private sector Vedanta by the end of the first EoI cycle on 15 November 2017, they said.
The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area getting a 5-mark advantage.
The 55 blocks have a total area of 59,282 sq km. This compares to about 1,02,000 sq km being under exploration currently, they said. Blocks would be awarded to the company which offers highest share of oil and gas to the government as well as commits to do maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic survey and drilling exploration wells.
Increased exploration would lead to more oil and gas production, helping the world’s third largest oil importer to cut import dependence. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of cutting oil import bill by 10% to 67% by 2022 and to half by 2030. Import dependence has increased since 2015 when Modi had set the target.
India currently imports 81% of its oil needs. The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from production sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue-sharing model where companies offering the maximum share of oil and gas to the government are awarded the block. The government till now has been selecting and demarcating areas it feels can be offered for bidding in an exploration licensing round.
 So far 256 blocks had been offered for exploration and production since 2000. The last bid round happened in 2010. Of these, 254 blocks were awarded. But as many as 156 have already been relinquished due to poor prospectivity."

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Friday ruled that Tata Steel Ltd and Vedanta Ltd were eligible to bid for Bhushan Steel Ltd and Electrosteel Steels Ltd, respectively. 
The two-judge NCLAT bench headed by Justice S.J. Mukhopadhyay rejected pleas by Bhushan Steel founder Neeraj Singal and the firm’s operational creditor Larsen & Toubro Ltd, and ruled that Tata Steel was eligible to bid for the debt-ridden company.
“On hearing the counsel for the parties and taking into consideration the submissions made by the counsel for the appellant ‘operational creditor’ and the respondents, we hold that the ‘resolution plan’ submitted by ‘Tata Steel Limited’ is fair and equitable to all the creditors, including the ‘operational creditors’. Therefore, no interference is called for,"" the tribunal said.
The NCLAT order comes a day after the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) arrested Singal on charges of siphoning off more than  ₹ 2,000 crore from Bhushan Steel’s bank loans using 80 different companies.
Singal had moved NCLAT questioning Tata Steel’s eligibility to bid for the company under Section 29(A) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), while L&T had moved the appellate tribunal seeking to be declared a secured creditor so that it received higher priority in repayment of dues.
Tata Steel’s resolution plan had proposed to pay Bhushan Steel’s operational creditors  ₹ 1,000 crore and another  ₹ 200 crore on a pro-rata basis over one year, depending on the “vitality to running the business"".
The appellate tribunal also rejected appeals against Electrosteel Steels sale to Vedanta. “We hold that ‘Vedanta Limited’ is eligible and clause (d) of Section 29(A) of the ‘I&B Code’ is not attracted in its case,"" it said in its judgment to various appeals by Renaissance Steel India Pvt Ltd, one of the unsuccessful bidders for Electrosteel, against a 17 April order of the National Company Law Tribunal’s (NCLT’s) Kolkata bench approving Vedanta Ltd’s  ₹ 5,320 crore resolution plan for Electrosteel.
Renaissance Steel had contended that Vedanta was ineligible to bid under Section 29(A) of IBC as one of Vedanta’s affiliates in Zambia—a unit of its UK-based parent Vedanta Resources Plc—had been found guilty of violating certain environmental laws, punishable with two or more years in jail.
Electrosteel owes lenders more than  ₹ 13,000 crore, of which about  ₹ 5,000 crore is to State Bank of India alone.
Both Bhushan Power and Steel and Electrosteel are among the 12 initial accounts identified by the Reserve Bank for resolution.
Bhushan Power and Steel owes more than Rs48,500 crore to a consortium of lenders led by Punjab National Bank. A recent report by credit rating agency Crisil pegged Bhushan Steel’s flat steel capacity at 5 million tonnes a year, about 9% of the Indian market.
State Bank of India’s insolvency plea against Electrosteel was admitted by the Kolkata bench of NCLT in July 2017."

A bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra and justice A.M. Khanwilkar considered the submission of the state government and posted its plea for hearing on 17 August.
The NGT had on August 9 allowed Vedanta to enter its administrative unit inside its Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi, observing that no environmental damage would be caused by allowing access to the administrative section. The tribunal, however, had said that the plant would remain closed and the company would not have access to its production unit and directed the district magistrate to ensure this.
The Tamil Nadu government had on 28 May ordered the state pollution control board to seal and “permanently"" close the mining group’s copper plant following violent protests over environmental concerns.
Sterlite’s factory had made the headlines in March 2013 when a gas leak led to the death of one person and injuries to several others, after which then chief minister J. Jayalalithaa had ordered its closure. The company had then appealed to the NGT, which had overturned the government order.

Hyderabad: Vedanta Ltd has said it will be investing $2.3 billion towards capex on its oil and gas activities in the “near term"" to increase the reserve base by around 375 million barrels. According to its latest annual report, Vedanta aims to increase production from the current 200,000 barrels per day to 300,000 bpd over the next few years.
“In the near term, we are investing gross capex of $2.3 billion to increase our resource and reserve base by around 375 million barrels. Our rich project portfolio is comprised of enhanced oil recovery projects, tight oil and gas projects and exploration prospects. As well as boosting production, this investment will generate sustainable employment opportunities, directly and indirectly and bring cutting edge solutions to community needs,"" Vedanta said.
For FY19, Vedanta expects to achieve a significant growth in production with total volumes in the range of 220-250 bpd through executing growth projects, with operating expenditure of sub-$7/boe (barrel of equivalent). “We estimate the net capex commitment at $600-800 million (for FY 19),"" it said.
Kuldip Kaura, chief executive officer of Vedanta, said the company’s vision was to contribute 50% of the country’s domestic crude oil production by increasing their gross production to 500,000 boepd.
“Working towards this goal, we announced growth projects, including enhanced oil recovery (EOR), tight oil and gas projects, upgrade of liquid handling facilities and exploration, for which key contracts have been awarded to world-class partners. These projects, along with an exit run rate of 200,000 boepd in March 2018, will pave the way to achieve 300,000 boepd in the near-term and 500,000 boepd in the medium-term,"" Kaura said.
As the largest private sector producer of crude oil in India, and with a strong track record and growth pipeline in exploration and development, Vedanta is well positioned to benefit from the government’s desire to boost domestic production and to leverage India’s oil and gas resource potential, it said.
Vedanta had recently bid for all 55 blocks on offer in the first round of oil and gas auctions under the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) auction.

According to sources, the government had, in April, submitted its final rejoinder to Cairn’s claim for full restitution for losses resulting from the expropriation of its investments in India in 2014 and continued attempts to enforce retrospective tax measures. Following the government’s move, Cairn submitted its final pleading in May, and now the tribunal would begin final hearing before giving the final verdict, sources said. Arbitration award was likely to come within four months, they added.
The tax department had in January 2014 used a two-year-old retrospective tax law to raise a  ₹ 10,247-crore demand on alleged capital gains made by Cairn Energy on a decade-old internal reorganisation of its India business. This was followed by attaching the company’s residual 9.8% shares in its erstwhile subsidiary, Cairn India.
Cairn India was subsequently merged with its new parent Vedanta, in which Cairn Energy held around 4.95% stake. These shares continued to be attached for four years, but the tax department earlier this year got them transferred to itself. 
In its March-quarter filing to stock exchanges, Vedanta showed 18.41 crore (4.95%) shares being held by Tax Recovery Officer (International taxation)-I. This dropped to 11.96 crore shares (3.22%) during the June quarter.
On July 9, Cairn said in a statement that the tax department sold around 40% of its shares in Vedanta for $216 million and was likely to sell remaining stake as well. Reports also said that the I-T department would sell the remaining shares without waiting for the arbitration award.
E-mails sent to the tax department for comments remained unanswered.
Cairn last month said the tax department continued to enforce its retrospective tax claim against the company, though the arbitration initiated under the UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty was ongoing. “To date, the tax department has seized dividends due to Cairn from its shareholding in Vedanta totalling $155 million and has offset a tax rebate of $234 million due to Cairn as a result of overpayment of capital gains tax on a separate matter."" Together, the department recovered $605 million (around  ₹ 4,000 crore according to foreign exchange rates prevalent at the times of the action). The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had, in April, said in response to a PTI query that “there is no legal advice against the sale of the attached shares""."

New Delhi: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Monday said an independent judicial committee will decide in about six weeks whether to allow Vedanta Ltd to reopen its copper smelter, which was shut by the Tamil Nadu government on environmental grounds. Tamil Nadu ordered the permanent closure of the plant and disconnected its power supply in May following protests that turned violent and culminated in the police opening fire on protesters, killing 13 of them. 
New Delhi: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Monday said an independent judicial committee will decide in about six weeks whether to allow Vedanta Ltd to reopen its copper smelter, which was shut by the Tamil Nadu government on environmental grounds. Tamil Nadu ordered the permanent closure of the plant and disconnected its power supply in May following protests that turned violent and culminated in the police opening fire on protesters, killing 13 of them.
The company has denied that the plant, India’s second biggest copper smelter located in the port city of Thoothukudi, pollutes the area.
NGT Chairman Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said the committee, including representatives from Vedanta, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and the federal environment ministry, will look into the matter afresh. The committee, to be headed by a retired judge, will have to deliver its verdict within four weeks of formation.
The smelter has an annual production capacity of more than 400,000 tonnes, and the company said last month the closure impacted 350 companies that buy its products.
The NGT earlier this month granted Vedanta, an unity of London-listed Vedanta Resources Ltd, conditional access to the smelter for “administrative purposes""."

New Delhi: Metals and mining giant Vedanta Ltd on Friday said it will pump in around $8 billion (around  ₹ 56,000 crore) over the next three years on various projects across businesses. There is immense growth potential in sight, Vedanta Ltd Chairman Navin Agarwal said at the company’s annual general meeting, where he made the investment announcement. 
New Delhi: Metals and mining giant Vedanta Ltd on Friday said it will pump in around $8 billion (around  ₹ 56,000 crore) over the next three years on various projects across businesses. There is immense growth potential in sight, Vedanta Ltd Chairman Navin Agarwal said at the company’s annual general meeting, where he made the investment announcement.
“As India’s largest private sector oil producer, your company contributes 27% to domestic production and aspires to take it up to 50%. Towards this, your company will invest $3-4 billion over the next two to three years, in various growth projects,"" he said.
This year, Vedanta recorded all-time high production in its zinc-lead-silver and aluminium businesses. The company will further invest $3-4 billion in these businesses in the next two to three years, Agarwal added.
On the Tuticorin unit, which had been permanently shut down by the Tamil Nadu government following the deaths of 13 people in police firing on protesters against the plant, Agarwal said the company was greatly grieved by the tragic loss of lives and had extended all possible support to impacted families. 
In April, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board rejected Vedanta Sterlite’s plea to renew the Consent To Operate certification, saying the company had not complied with the stipulated conditions. Following this, the government had issued a permanent closure notice to the plant. After Sterlite announced its plans to expand the Tuticorin plant, villagers started fresh protests that continued for over 100 days, culminating in the May 22 police firing that claimed 13 lives and left scores injured. 
In 2017-18, Vedanta Ltd increased its revenue by 22%, year on year to  ₹ 92,900 crore. Its EBITDA or operating profit also increased 19% to  ₹ 25,500 crore, and profit after taxes rose 10% to  ₹ 8,200 crore. “Free cash flow stood at  ₹ 7,900 crore and we reduced our gross debt by  ₹ 8,500 crore,"" Agarwal said. 
During the year, the company acquired Electrosteel Steels Ltd, integrating it with its existing iron ore business."
97,2018-08-28,Vedanta,"Oil India won nine blocks, while ONGC managed to win two among the 55 oil and gas blocks on offer

New Delhi: Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd has bagged 41 out of 55 oil and gas exploration blocks offered in India’s maiden open acreage auction, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) said on Tuesday. State-owned Oil India Ltd won nine blocks, while Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) managed to win just two. State gas utility GAIL, upstream arm of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Hindustan Oil Exploration Co received one block each, DGH said, while giving out the list of winners of Open Acreage licensing Policy (OALP) round-1.  
New Delhi: Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd has bagged 41 out of 55 oil and gas exploration blocks offered in India’s maiden open acreage auction, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) said on Tuesday. State-owned Oil India Ltd won nine blocks, while Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) managed to win just two. State gas utility GAIL, upstream arm of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Hindustan Oil Exploration Co received one block each, DGH said, while giving out the list of winners of Open Acreage licensing Policy (OALP) round-1. 
Vedanta, which had put in bids for all the 55 blocks, won right to explore and produce oil and gas in 41 of them. “We will work hard to make the best of this opportunity. We are an energy deficient country and policies like OALP will help reduce the country’s import dependence for oil from around 80% now to 67% by 2022, in line with (the) PM’s vision. The development further strengthens our vision to invest in India and contribute 50% of India’s domestic crude oil production,"" Agarwal said.
At the close of the bidding on May 2, ONGC had bid for 37 blocks either on its own or in consortium with other state-owned firms. OIL bid for 22 blocks in a similar fashion. Vedanta was the sole bidder for two blocks and had either ONGC or OIL as a direct competitor for the rest. Except for the two blocks that received three bids each, all the other 53 had just two bidders.
Neither Reliance Industries nor any foreign company participated in the auction, a first since India began offering oil and gas area for exploration and production through bids in 1999. The government had in July last year allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice, with a view to bring around 2.8 million sq km of unexplored area in the country under exploration. Under this policy, companies are allowed to put in an expression of interest (EoI) for prospecting of oil and gas in an area that is currently not under any production or exploration licence. The EoIs can be put in any time of the year, but are accumulated twice annually.
The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area getting a five-mark advantage. The 55 blocks have a total area of 59,282 sq km. This compares to around 1,02,000 sq km that is currently under exploration. Blocks are awarded to the company which offers the highest share of oil and gas to the government as well as commits to do the maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic survey and drilling exploration wells. 
Increased exploration will lead to more oil and gas production, helping the world’s third largest oil importer to cut import dependence. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of cutting the country’s oil import bill by 10% to 67% by 2022 and to half by 2030. India currently imports 81% of its oil needs.
The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from the production-sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue-sharing model, where companies offering the maximum share of oil and gas to the government are awarded the block. So far 256 blocks had been offered for exploration and production since 2000. The last bidding round happened in 2010. Of these, 254 blocks were awarded."
96,2018-08-29,Vedanta,"JSW Energy, Tata Power, Adani Power and Vedanta are among the firms making a beeline for stressed assets in the power sector

Despite all their trials and tribulations, private sector power companies are making a beeline for stressed power plants. JSW Energy Ltd and a Tata Power Co. Ltd-backed fund are vying for a power plant. Adani Power Ltd, its poor financial condition notwithstanding, too has thrown its hat into the ring, an analyst said on condition of anonymity. 
Despite all their trials and tribulations, private sector power companies are making a beeline for stressed power plants. JSW Energy Ltd and a Tata Power Co. Ltd-backed fund are vying for a power plant. Adani Power Ltd, its poor financial condition notwithstanding, too has thrown its hat into the ring, an analyst said on condition of anonymity.
Reports also indicate that other private sector groups such as Vedanta and asset reconstruction firms have shown interest in acquiring stressed power plants. Another analyst aware of the matter said large investors from overseas are awaiting the resolution processes to place bids.
Buyers’ interest should provide comfort to the lenders of stressed power plants, who otherwise are staring at large write-offs. What is intriguing, though, are the bids from listed private sector firms who are still suffering from the wrong bets they had made and from unhindered capacity build-up in the domestic market.
What could be the reason for the keen interest in acquiring stressed power assets? The answer is growth, which has been stunted for conventional power generators. Deepak Agrawala, executive director-investment banking (industrials, infrastructure and utilities) at Elara Capital (India) Pvt. Ltd, says a power generator can grow by building new plants or acquiring them or diversifying into areas such as renewables. For large listed utility firms, the ongoing resolution of stressed thermal power assets offers an excellent inorganic growth opportunity.
Considering the prolonged land acquisition and approval process and construction period, it can take as much as five-eight years to set up a new greenfield coal-fired power plant and generate cash flows, adds Agrawala. Far better, in the circumstances, to snap up assets in a fire sale.
Swarnim Maheshwari, an analyst at Edelweiss Securities Ltd, echoes the views. “You are taking this call for the next 15-20 years (about long- term growth), not for the next one-two years,"" he says."

New Delhi:The National Green Tribunal has appointed former Meghalaya high court chief justice Tarun Agrawal as head of a three-member committee to decide mining company Vedanta’s plea challenging closure of its Sterlite copper plant at Tuticorin.  
New Delhi:The National Green Tribunal has appointed former Meghalaya high court chief justice Tarun Agrawal as head of a three-member committee to decide mining company Vedanta’s plea challenging closure of its Sterlite copper plant at Tuticorin. 
A bench headed by chairperson A K Goel had earlier named former Punjab and Haryana high court chief justice S J Vazifdar as head of the panel, however, he expressed inability to accept the appointment stating personal reasons. 
“The matter has been put up on receipt of a communication from Justice S J Vazifdar, former chief justice of Punjab & Haryana high court and former judge of Bombay high court dated 28 August expressing inability to accept the appointment in terms of the order dated 20 August for personal reasons. 
“In view of above, we substitute justice S J Vazifdar by justice Tarun Agrawal, former chief justice of Meghalaya high court and former judge of Allahabad high court. All other terms of order dated 20 August will remain,"" the bench, also comprising justices Jawad Rahim and S P Wangdi, said. 
The tribunal also made it clear that if there is any non-compliance with the order, the company would be at liberty to take its remedies or to point out the same before the committee. 
“Pending the finalisation of remuneration by the chief secretary of Tamil Nadu, the Central Pollution Control Board will provide immediate logistic support and organise the visit of justice Tarun Agrawal, chairman of the committee, and other members to the site or to the venue of the hearing,"" the bench said. 
The NGT had earlier said a credible mechanism, through which rival contentions can be balanced and a final view taken, has to be evolved. The green body had said the committee, which include representatives of the Central Pollution Control Board and the Ministry of Environment and Forests, may visit the site and consider technical data. 
It had noted in its order that it cannot be ignored that the copper smelting plant contributed to copper production in the country and employed 1,300 people. 
On 9 August, the tribunal had allowed Vedanta to enter the administrative unit inside its Sterlite copper plant at Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu, observing that no environmental damage would be caused by allowing access to the section. 
The green panel had, however, said the plant would remain closed and the company would not have access to its production unit and directed the district magistrate to ensure this. 
On 30 July, the court had refused to grant any interim relief to Vedanta, which had challenged the Tamil Nadu government’s order to permanently shut down its Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi, even as the firm termed the government action “political"". 
On 5 July, the tribunal had issued notices to the state government and the pollution board seeking their responses after Tamil Nadu raised preliminary objections with regard to the maintainability of Vedanta’s plea. 
The Tamil Nadu government had, on 28 May, ordered the state pollution control board to seal and “permanently"" close the mining group’s copper plant following violent protests over pollution concerns.
Earlier in April, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board had rejected Sterlite’s plea to renew the ‘Consent To Operate’ certification, saying the company had not complied with the stipulated conditions. 
At least 13 people were killed and several injured on 22 May when the police had opened fire on a huge crowd of people protesting against environment pollution being allegedly caused by the factory."

Bengaluru: Vedanta Resources Plc chairman Anil Agarwal will take the London-listed miner private on 1 October, after the holders of 26% of shares agreed to sell to his family trust Volcan Investments. Volcan now holds or has received acceptances for 92.31% of Vedanta’s shares, it said.
The trust said on Monday the $1 billion offer to take Vedanta Resources private would remain open for acceptances from shareholders until further notice.
Volcan, which held about 67% of Vedanta before it announced in July its firm intention to make the buyout offer, was expected to face some shareholder resistance, with a large minority shareholder saying the offer undervalued the company.
Amid the going-private process, Vedanta, the first Indian company to list in London in 2003, is waiting to hear from a judicial committee in India on whether its Sterlite copper plant, which was shut by Tamil Nadu, can be reopened.

Mumbai: ArcelorMittal India Pvt. Ltd has withdrawn its letter to the Essar Steel resolution professional (RP) wherein it had hinted that Vedanta may not be eligible to bid for the debt-laden company, given its patchy environmental and human rights record.
The first letter on 15 September, written to the court-appointed RP, Satish Kumar Gupta, ran into six pages and listed the various infractions committed by Vedanta and its sister companies.
In a tacit admission of a faux pas, the second letter, a one-pager written on 16 September, requested the RP to ignore the first. “An internal draft of such a letter was inadvertently shared with you. Please ignore the communication for now. We regret any inconvenience caused to you."" Mint has reviewed both letters, which were signed by Sanjay Sharma, the chief executive officer, India and China, ArcelorMittal.

ArcelorMittal, promoted by Indian-born L.N. Mittal, is the largest steel company in the world, and is engaged in a battle for control of Essar Steel, which owns a 10-million tonne steel plant in Gujarat. Essar Steel was admitted into bankruptcy court earlier this year as it was unable to pay its debt of  ₹ 50,786 crore.
Mittal has bid  ₹ 42,000 crore to buy out Essar Steel, while Vedanta’s bid was at  ₹ 34,000 crore. Numetal, a consortium promoted by Russia’s VTB Bank, has also placed a bid of  ₹ 37,000 crore for Essar.
Over the last few months, both ArcelorMittal and Numetal, the front runners in the three-way battle for Essar, have been attempting to disprove each other’s eligibility as qualified bidders. Last week, ArcelorMittal contested the eligibility of Numetal at the Supreme Court saying it was formed by Aurora Enterprises Ltd, where Rewant Ruia is a prominent shareholder. The Ruia family are the original promoters of Essar Steel and are disqualified from reclaiming their bankrupt company under Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.

ArcelorMittal’s letter to the RP appears to say that the company had intended to train its guns on Vedanta, the lowest bidder in the fray, as well. In the first letter, Sharma of ArcelorMittal had said: “We believe that one of the cornerstones of the IBC process is full and complete disclosure of all material facts necessary for the committee of creditors to assess the eligibility of the resolution applicants as well as the feasibility and viability of any resolution plan submitted by such applicants."" 
The letter then lists environmental law violations committed in India (specifically Tuticorin and Lanjigarh), Zambia and other jurisdictions, illegal mining, disregard for safety standards and human rights violations, involving the Vedanta Group, in order to “maintain the sanctity of the IBC process, as well as in the interest of transparency"".
The facts mentioned in the letter regarding Vedanta and its sister companies are public knowledge. ArcelorMittal points to the recent violence that broke out at Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu, when a copper smelter operated in the town by Sterlite, a subsidiary of Vedanta’s, was accused of damaging the local environment. The letter says that the Supreme Court has admitted a civil appeal and issued notice to Sterlite for dumping over 3.52 lakh tonnes of copper slag waste in the water-spread area of Uppar river.
The letter also refers to Konkola Copper Mines, a Zambian subsidiary of Vedanta Plc, which was convicted in 2015 under the (Zambian) Environment Protection and Pollution Control Act, 1990, for water pollution, which poisoned thousands of Chingola residents in 2006.

It also points to Sesa Goa, another subsidiary of Vedanta Ltd, which the Supreme Court pulled up in 2014 for illegal mining in Goa. Its mining licences were suspended as are the environmental clearances granted to its mines in Goa. ArceorMittal also pointed to lax safety standards at Bharat Aluminium Co. Ltd, an aluminium plant run by Vedanta in Chhattisgarh, and investigations by the Indian National Human Rights Commission into human rights violations associated with Vedanta’s operations in Lanjigarh. ArcelorMittal also pointed out that several large foreign investors, including the Norwegian Pension Fund and the Church of England, had withdrawn their investment in Vedanta Plc citing lax ethical standards.
A representative for ArcelorMittal declined to comment on the letters. When contacted, a spokesperson for Vedanta Ltd said: “We are highly disappointed that such baseless and irrelevant issues are being raised and unfounded allegations are being made with the objective to malign competitors. Similar condemnable attempts were made at the time of our bid for Electrosteel Steels Ltd as well, and the same were dealt with by NCLT and NCLAT appropriately by dismissing the challenges of competing resolution applicants. NCLAT in its order dated 10 August 2018 declared Vedanta Ltd an eligible applicant under Section 29A of the IBC."""

New Delhi/Mumbai: Vedanta Ltd is investing $4.1 billion to boost oil output from its flagship Barmer block in the desert state of Rajasthan to over 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2021, chairman Anil Agarwal said. 
New Delhi/Mumbai: Vedanta Ltd is investing $4.1 billion to boost oil output from its flagship Barmer block in the desert state of Rajasthan to over 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2021, chairman Anil Agarwal said.
Agarwal said oil output from the block would rise next year to more than 300,000 bpd from about 250,000 bpd currently. “In 2-3 years it will be 450,000 bpd. We are investing almost 300 billion rupees to reach there,"" Agarwal told reporters.
India, the world’s third biggest oil importer, ships in 80% of its oil needs from overseas as its local output has stagnated for years. The country produces an average of 720,000 bpd oil.
The conglomerate on Monday bagged 41 of the 55 blocks offered by India under the new eased rules that offer the freedom to bidders to carve out areas for drilling. 
For the new blocks, the company plans to invest 30-40 billion rupees in the exploration phase, Agarwal said.
Vedanta, the Indian unit of diversified mining group Vedanta Resources Plc, wants to scale up its operations to be able to contribute at least 1 percent to the nation’s planned $5 trillion economy by 2025, he said.
In contrast to Vedanta’s aggressive bidding for the latest auction, key foreign players continue to shy away from participating.
“I am looking for more and more competition to come. I want at least 10 more players to come ... This market will be better than foreign markets,"" Agarwal said.
India’s strong economic growth and the demographic advantage of having a pool of young people will remain key drivers in its energy demand growth.
India’s crude oil demand is forecast to grow to 500 million tonnes per year by 2040, according to the country’s top refiner Indian Oil Corp.
Agarwal, however, said India need to ease policies further to attract foreign majors to exploration. India bars exports of crude which means producers are limited to who they can sell their oil, often at a discount.
“Foreign players will not come until and unless they get international prices ... Today also they (the government) set the price, and which is so discouraging for the international players to come,"" he said.
Vedanta is currently selling its oil to local refiners at 10-12% discount to global benchmark Brent, he said, adding the company’s current cost of production is $7/barrel.

Tokyo/New Delhi: Indian aluminium makers including Hindalco Industries and Vedanta Ltd are boosting sales to Japan as U.S. sanctions against Russia’s Rusal and import tariffs shake up traditional supply routes. India’s product has generally not been regarded as high enough quality by Japan’s demanding buyers, who have preferred top-tier producers like Rio Tinto , Alcoa and South32 as well as United Company Rusal. However, imports of aluminium ingot from India doubled in the first eight months of 2018 from a year ago, Japanese trade data shows, while imports of alloy - which include higher-value products - surged 11-fold off a tiny base. 
Tokyo/New Delhi: Indian aluminium makers including Hindalco Industries and Vedanta Ltd are boosting sales to Japan as U.S. sanctions against Russia’s Rusal and import tariffs shake up traditional supply routes. India’s product has generally not been regarded as high enough quality by Japan’s demanding buyers, who have preferred top-tier producers like Rio Tinto , Alcoa and South32 as well as United Company Rusal. However, imports of aluminium ingot from India doubled in the first eight months of 2018 from a year ago, Japanese trade data shows, while imports of alloy - which include higher-value products - surged 11-fold off a tiny base.
“Because of the sanctions, consumers would like to ensure some security of supply, so they’d like to prefer multiple suppliers instead of one supplier,"" Samir Cairae, chief executive of Vedanta’s diversified metals business in India, told Reuters.
The increased trade is a blow to Rusal, the world’s second-biggest aluminium maker, which accounted for about 20 percent of Japan’s imports of both aluminium ingot and alloy in 2017, but which has been hit by U.S. sanctions.
Customers globally have had to scramble to find alternative sources of metal even after the United States eased sanctions restrictions for some customers, and they were likely to permanently diversify supply chains, said a source at a Japanese trading house.
“Many of their customers are reluctant to order the same amount of supplies that they have bought in past years for next year even if the U.S. sanctions are lifted,"" the trader said.
Japanese trading houses such as Mitsubishi Corp have been aggressively importing supplies from India as well as other countries to help customers diversify supply, trading sources said. Mitsubishi declined to comment.
Products from India are mainly refined ingots rather than value-added products such as billets and slabs, said a second trading house source. Substitute material for Rusal’s higher quality products has come from the Middle East and Malaysia.
However, Indian metal was winning growing acceptance and was also being sold at a discount to traditional suppliers.
“Japanese buyers are getting Indian metal for cheap,"" the source said.
IMPORTS SWELL
Japan took 59,545 tonnes of aluminium ingot in the eight months to March, double a year ago, while material from Russia fell 21 pct to 175,694 tonnes, Japanese trade data showed.
Imports of aluminium alloy from India jumped to 3,008 tonnes over the same period, while Russian imports fell 10 percent to 185,685 tonnes.
The U.S. trade actions - 10 percent import tariffs on the light metal from March and sanctions against Rusal from April - sent shockwaves through the market, boosting aluminium prices to seven-year highs and pushing up costs to obtain physical metal in the U.S. domestic market.
“Stronger U.S. premiums have become incentives for smelters in Australia, which is exempted from the duties, to ship more products to the United States,"" said a third trader, who saw Indian products filling the supply gap left by Rusal in Asia.
Vedanta, India’s largest producer of aluminium, sees a big opportunity in Asia including Japan and Korea.
Cairae said the company is focusing on ramping up exports of its value-added products such as billets, which can be used in the transport, construction and packaging industries, and wire rods.
Hindalco did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
89,2018-10-30,Vedanta,"Renaissance Steel has challenged Vedanta's eligibility to bid for Electrosteel Steels as one of its affiliates in Zambia, Konkola Copper Mines, was found guilty of violating environmental laws in that country

New Delhi: The Supreme Court (SC) on Monday sought a response from Vedanta Ltd on an appeal by Renaissance Steel India Pvt. Ltd challenging its eligibility to bid for Electrosteel Steels Ltd as one of its affiliates in Zambia, Konkola Copper Mines Plc., was found guilty of violating environmental laws punishable with two or more years in jail.  
New Delhi: The Supreme Court (SC) on Monday sought a response from Vedanta Ltd on an appeal by Renaissance Steel India Pvt. Ltd challenging its eligibility to bid for Electrosteel Steels Ltd as one of its affiliates in Zambia, Konkola Copper Mines Plc., was found guilty of violating environmental laws punishable with two or more years in jail. 
Electrosteel is among the 12 initial accounts identified by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for resolution. Renaissance is one of the unsuccessful bidders for Electrosteel.
A bench headed by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman, while agreeing to hear the matter, sought replies from Vedanta, State Bank of India (SBI), Electrosteel, and the resolution professional, Dhaivat Anjaria; on the matter.
Renaissance claimed that the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had contradicted itself in its interpretation of the word “punishable"" and had also misconstrued the phrase “convicted for any offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more"" as under provisions of the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC).
“The Hon’ble NCLAT has failed to consider that what is relevant under Section 29A(d) is the punishability of the offence (whether it is capable of being punished with imprisonment for two years or more) and not the capability of the offender to suffer such punishment,"" the plea said.
On 10 August, NCLAT ruled that Vedanta was eligible to bid for Electrosteel.
“We hold that ‘Vedanta Limited’ is eligible and clause (d) of Section 29(A) of the ‘I&B Code’ is not attracted in its case,"" the appellate tribunal said in its judgment to various appeals by Renaissance Steel against a 17 April order of the National Company Law Tribunal’s Kolkata bench approving Vedanta’s  ₹ 5,320 crore resolution plan for Electrosteel.
Renaissance Steel had contended before the NCLAT that Vedanta was ineligible to bid under Section 29(A) of IBC as one of its affiliates in Zambia, Konkola Copper Mines—a unit of its UK-based parent Vedanta Resources Plc.—had been found guilty of violating certain environmental laws, punishable with two or more years in jail.
Electrosteel owes lenders more than  ₹ 13,000 crore, of which about  ₹ 5,000 crore is owed to SBI."

Mumbai: Cairn Oil and Gas, a unit of Vedanta Ltd, will invest $4 billion in its flagship Barmer oil block in Rajasthan, Cairn said on Tuesday. The Delhi high court on Monday allowed a 10-year extension to the block on the condition that it pays a higher share of profit to the government. The extension results in an overall increase of oil and gas reserves of 400 billion barrels and a production of 125,000 barrels, said Sudhir Mathur, chief executive officer of Cairn India.

The extension results in an overall increase of oil and gas reserves of 400 billion barrels and a production of 125,000 barrels, said Sudhir Mathur, chief executive officer of Cairn India.
“The extension also increases our reserves by 250 million barrels. That is quite a big booster to our overall reserve position,"" said Mathur. “Cairn has driven up its share of India’s oil output by 3.5 times in the last nine years, significantly from the Rajasthan block and the extension is a great acknowledgement of our performance.""
The extension also paves the way for further investments. “We are spending $4 billion, out of which we have already signed contracts worth $2.3 billion and the work has started in a big way. There are already 13 rigs operating in the Rajasthan block,"" said the CEO.
State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) is a 30% partner in the Barmer oil block.
“The government of India, acting through the directorate general of hydrocarbons, ministry of petroleum and natural gas, has granted its approval for a 10-year extension of the PSC for the Rajasthan Block, RJ-ON-90/1,"" Vedanta Ltd said in an exchange filing on Monday.
The 25-year contract for exploration and production of oil and gas from Barmer block RJ-ON-90/1 was due for renewal on 14 May 2020.
In April 2017, the government had approved a new policy for extension of PSCs, which would provide for a contract extension only if companies operating the fields agree to increase the state’s share of profit by 10%.
However, Vedanta felt that the May 1995 PSC for the block provided for an automatic 10-year extension on same commercial terms if there are hydrocarbons left to be produced. Vedanta thus challenged the April 2017 policy and the matter is sub judice.
“The applicability of the pre-NELP Extension Policy to the Rajasthan Block PSC is currently sub judice,"" Vedanta said in the filing. Its partner ONGC was also of the opinion that PSC provides for an extension on same terms.
“Let the legal process take its own course. Whatever the verdict of the court, we will accept that,"" Anil Agarwal, chairman of Vedanta Resources, had said earlier this month."

New Delhi: Metals and mining conglomerate Vedanta Ltd Wednesday reported a 34.32% decline in its consolidated net profit to Rs1,343 crore for the July-September quarter.
The Anil Agarwal-led company had clocked a “Profit attributable to owners of Vedanta Ltd"" of Rs2,045 crore during the corresponding quarter previous fiscal.
Its total income during the quarter rose to Rs23,297 crore as against Rs22,509 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal.
The total expenses also rose to Rs20,999 crore during the quarter under review as against Rs18,854 crore in the year-ago period.
The company said in a statement that its balance sheet was strong and the net debt reduced by Rs3,553 crores in Q2 FY2019.
“I am pleased with the growth in volume this quarter at our businesses. The Company is uniquely poised to grow in commodities that have rising demand especially in India with an enviable growth pipeline which is systematically being brought to fruition. I am very excited to be part of the Vedanta growth story and see a strong second half in both volumes and profitability across the businesses,"" Vedanta Chief Executive Officer Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan said."
86,2018-11-12,Vedanta,"Vedanta Chairman Anil Agarwal today announced the company’s plan to inject Rs15,000 crore to raise the alumina refinery capacity at Lanjigarh three-fold to six mtpa

 Bhubaneswar: Vedanta Resources Chairman Anil Agarwal on Monday announced the company’s plan to inject Rs15,000 crore to raise the alumina refinery capacity at Lanjigarh three-fold to six mtpa and firm up downstream sector in Odisha in three years. 
 Bhubaneswar: Vedanta Resources Chairman Anil Agarwal on Monday announced the company’s plan to inject Rs15,000 crore to raise the alumina refinery capacity at Lanjigarh three-fold to six mtpa and firm up downstream sector in Odisha in three years.
The expansion of the Lanjigarh plant in phases would increase the capacity of the refinery from the existing two million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to four mtpa and then to six mtpa in the next three years, Anil Agarwal, who is also the founder of the company said addressing the Make in Odisha Conclave.
“Vedanta has already invested over Rs50,000 crore in Odisha projects. Fresh investment of Rs15,000 crore will be made in the next three years for expansion of Lanjigarh refinery and strengthening of downstream sector,"" Agarwal said this while addressing the conclave and later interacting with journalists.
He said, Vedanta’s aluminium park at Jharsuguda, where its smelter unit is located, is progressing well and around 25 downstream industries have come up and over 100 such units are likely to be set up in the complex spread over an area of 250 acres.
Agarwal, however, voiced concern over scarce availability of raw materials like coal and bauxite in the state.
He said government companies get 100% coal, while private entities are given only 25% supply which makes it tough for them to run in a viable manner.
“It is the responsibility of all to ensure that coal produced in the state is made available to local industries,"" he said adding it would go a long way in boosting investment in Odisha.
Stating that half of the coal produced in Odisha moves out of the state, the Vedanta chairman said the whole mechanism is “discriminatory"" and an increase of even 10% in coal share would be of immense help to the private sector in which over five lakh employees are involved.
About bauxite, Agarwal said only about one per cent of the mineral’s reserves in Odisha have been explored and it is essential to open more bauxite blocks to ensure expansion of the aluminium sector in the state.
Vedanta, he said, has been given a small bauxite mine at Kodingamali and like oil blocks, more of them should be put to auction for growth of aluminium units.
Vedanta would participate in auctions of new bauxite mines to feed to its expansion programme, he said.
Odisha has 700 mt of known bauxite reserves and has the potential to become the bauxite capital of the world. The state has 70% of India’s total bauxite reserves, the world’s fifth-largest, he said.
Comparing Odisha and Australia, Agarwal said both have similar geology and the Make in Odisha Conclave will attract more investment and best of technology to increase mining production to the same levels as that of the southern hemisphere country.
This can reduce country’s import bill by Rs1 trillion and create over 10 million jobs, said Agarwal.
“Odisha’s strategic location gives it excellent connectivity by air, land and water, while its skilled human resources, abundant water and power make the state an ideal place for investment,"" he said.
It is a matter of pride for Odisha to be crowned the ‘Aluminium Capital of India’ with Vedanta’s share at 60% among the three players based in the State, he said.
The company, he claimed, has acted as a “juggernaut"" for investment in Odisha whose GDP has grown from Rs60,000 crore to over Rs4 trillion at a rapid rate of 14% since Vedanta’s inception.
Agarwal said over 14 lakh people of Kalahandi district have benefited by Vedanta’s alumnina refinery at Lanjigarh and the GDP growth rate has increased from 1% to 16%.
The annual per capita income of the Kalahandi district has increased three times from Rs13,000 to Rs35,000 which is line with over all Odisha per capita income. “We have created a favourable eco-system by developing schools, hospitals, college, road and rail lines in the district"", he said.
Vedanta has developed an airstrip in Kalahandi which can be used by the government to promote connectivity and investment, the company chairman added."

Parent Vedanta Resources Plc chairman Anil Agarwal and Cairn chief executive Sudhir Mathur met with executives from around 70 oil services companies this week in Houston to encourage the firms to organise into consortia to compete for contracts, according to a Reuters report. 
“We fully support India’s drive to become self-sufficient in energy resources by 2030. We strongly believe in India’s growth prospects, in the country’s huge oil and gas potential and will commit the investment needed over the next five years in the upstream activities,"" Agarwal said in a press statement.
This August, Vedanta won 41 of the 55 blocks auctioned under India’s first licensing round for small discovered fields. It expects the blocks will eventually produce 500,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent.
“With the allocation of these new blocks, the company is looking to partner with global exploration and production and technology companies to expedite the exploration works for its newly awarded 41 blocks,"" Cairn said. 
Some of the acquired blocks are close to Cairn’s existing fields and could be put to production in nearly 12-18 months after award of contracts, Cairn said.
“We are gearing up for a new, extended phase of growth with considerable investments in our brownfield, as well as greenfield blocks. The best technology and expertise will be critical to fast-track this process and realise our vision to achieve energy security for India,"" said Mathur. 
The company is investing $4 billion in its flagship Barmer oil block in Rajasthan. The Delhi high court last month allowed a 10-year extension to the block on the condition that it pays a higher share of profit to the government. The extension results in an overall increase of oil and gas reserves of 400 billion barrels and a production of 125,000 barrels.
Currently, Cairn accounts for over 25% of India’s domestic crude oil production."

Ahmedabad: The committee of creditors (CoC) led by the State Bank of India (SBI) on Monday told a bankruptcy court that it was not in the committee’s powers to consider a settlement plan proposed by the shareholders of Essar Steel India Ltd. 
Ahmedabad: The committee of creditors (CoC) led by the State Bank of India (SBI) on Monday told a bankruptcy court that it was not in the committee’s powers to consider a settlement plan proposed by the shareholders of Essar Steel India Ltd.
Citing a recent Supreme Court order in the debt-ridden Essar Steel case, senior counsel Rajiv Kadam, who appeared on behalf of the committee of creditors challenged the shareholders’ proposal and said it was “impermissible"" for them to submit a proposal. 
In October, the Supreme Court allowed ArcelorMittal and Numetal to bid for bankrupt Essar Steel provided they paid off the dues of defaulters connected to them within two weeks. 
The CoC were to decide on the best offer in eight weeks’ time after also considering the proposal of the Vedanta group, the third bidder, the apex court said. 
“The Supreme Court order has mandated CoC to look into the proposals of ArcelorMittal, Numetal and Vedanta. CoC cannot consider any other application as it is beyond the Supreme Court’s directive,"" said Kadam. He was responding to an application filed by Essar Steel shareholders before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for consideration of their settlement plan by the committee of creditors. 
“Essar Steel Asia Holdings along with Essar Steel India had moved a proposal for settlement on 20 April, 2018, which was rejected by the CoC on 8 May,"" Kadam told the tribunal. 
On 25 October, more than 92% of creditors of Essar Steel voted in favour of handing over the debt-laden company to ArcelorMittal after it cleared pending dues to Uttam Galva and KSS Petron. 
ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan envisages an upfront payment of  ₹ 42,000 crore to lenders and an additional  ₹ 8,000 crore towards capital expenditure. 
Meanwhile, the shareholders of Essar Steel submitted a proposal to the CoC for settlement of the entire admitted claims of the financial creditors, operational creditors, and workmen and employees of Essar Steel India Ltd (ESIL), aggregating  ₹ 54,389 crore. Essar Steel shareholders claimed that their application was in accordance with section 12 (a) of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. 
The resolution professional appointed by CoC on 30 October filed ArcelorMittal’s plan with the Ahmedabad bench of the NCLT.
A clutch of operational creditors and Essar Steel shareholders have challenged the CoC and RP’s decision to accept ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan. Standard Chartered Plc has also approached the NCLT as dissenting financial creditor so that it could be heard before the tribunal decides on ArcelorMittal’s bid.
Senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi who appeared on behalf of ArcelorMittal and the CoC’s Kadam argued before the tribunal that Essar Steel shareholders’ application was in violation of section 12 (a) of IBC. 
Section 12A states that any application to withdraw must be submitted prior to the issuance of the invitation for expressions of interest and must be accepted by 90% of creditors, they said. 
Senior counsel Darius Khambatta who appeared on behalf of resolution professional Satish Kumar Gupta said Essar Steel shareholders’ offer was not valid as it came after the April 29, 2018 deadline. No application can be admitted after 270 days deadline to complete the insolvency process, he said. 
Essar Steel is an integrated steel producer with an annual production capacity of 10 million tonnes. The facility comprises ore beneficiation, pellet-making, iron-making, steel-making, and downstream facilities. Located at Hazira in Gujarat, the facility also includes a power plant and a port that can handle 30 million tonnes of cargo annually."

The Tamil Nadu government will move the Supreme Court against the NGT’s order. 
Chennai: The National Green Tribunal on Saturday ordered the reopening of Vedanta’s Sterlite Industries Ltd’s copper smelter plant in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi, months after the smelter was ordered shut by the Tamil Nadu government over alleged pollution that led to violent protests and culminated in police opening fire on demonstrators and killing 13. The Tamil Nadu government will move the Supreme Court against the NGT’s order.
Environment minister K.C. Karuppanan said the state government will challenge the NGT’s final order, which set aside the government’s order for closure of the plant.
In the wake of the police firing on 22 and 23 May that killed 13 people protesting against the plant, the state government ordered a permanent closure of the copper smelting unit.
On Saturday, while passing its order, the NGT directed the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to pass fresh order of renewal of consent and authorisation to handle hazardous substances, “subject to appropriate conditions for protection of environment in accordance with law within three weeks from today.""
“The appellant will also be entitled to restoration of electricity for its operations,"" the tribunal said.
Terming the closure “unjustifiable"", the tribunal also has directed Vedanta to spend  ₹ 100 crore over the next three years for Thoothukudi’s “welfare activities.""
When ordering the closure of the Sterlite unit, the government of Tamil Nadu had stated that it endorsed the closure direction of the TNPCB, and also directed the board to seal the unit and close the plant permanently under section 18(1)(b) of the Water Act, 1974, “in the larger public interest.""
It had also added that under the Article 48 A of the Constitution, “the state shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country"".
However, on Saturday, the NGT Bench headed by its chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said the Tamil Nadu government’s order issued under Section 18(1)(b) of the Water Act cannot be referred to as an independent order “but relied on and endorsing the views of the TNPCB, which is under challenge and are not sufficient for ordering closure or refusal to grant even consent.""
“If there are no other materials for the government of Tamil Nadu to arrive at the conclusion of closure on the ground of irreversible pollution being caused to the environment allowing the unit to function, then it cannot be said to be a policy decision to close down the industry permanently. If any order was passed based on the order by the Pollution Control Board, without independent application of mind and arbitrarily, then that can also be incidentally considered by the tribunal for the purpose of deciding the question of legality of that order,"" the NGT said in its order.

82,2018-12-19,Vedanta,"The Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu, was shut in May, and its reopening will boost Vedanta's earnings

The National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) decision to let Vedanta Ltd resume operations at its Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu, has brought some respite for investors. The Vedanta stock has risen 4% in the last two trading sessions, erasing some of its earlier losses. The Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi contributed 5% of Vedanta’s operating profits last fiscal. The plant was shut in May and its reopening will boost Vedanta’s earnings.

The Sterlite copper plant in Thoothukudi contributed 5% of Vedanta’s operating profits last fiscal. The plant was shut in May and its reopening will boost Vedanta’s earnings.
But the pertinent question investors need to ask is whether the NGT order will hold before courts and, more importantly, the political powers that be. 
The Tamil Nadu government plans to appeal against the NGT decision in the Supreme Court. This can delay the plant’s reopening. “We believe the restart of the copper smelter may be contingent upon the decision by the Supreme Court and will also require preparatory work by Vedanta,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities.
Even if the apex court upholds the NGT decision, it has to be seen how the state government takes it forward. The recent Supreme Court judgments with larger ramifications (such as the Sabarimala verdict) have wedged a split between the judiciary and political authority, with the later pandering to popular beliefs. Most political parties in Tamil Nadu support those protesting against the plant.
Perhaps the apex court’s ratification will provide the legal cover, paving the way for a resolution. This is happening in the resolution of stressed ultra mega power projects in Gujarat.
Even so, given the limited contribution of the copper business to consolidated earnings and the fact that final deliberations are yet to begin, the stock’s trajectory will continue to be determined by existing businesses, and the outlook here is mixed.
On the positive side, Vedanta’s zinc business, which generated three-fifths of consolidated operating profit last year, is adding new capacities. This provides a healthy outlook on volumes and revenue. The company is also trying to ramp-up captive alumina production and source cheaper coal. The measures are expected to lower aluminium production costs.
These positives may, however, be overtaken by the US-China trade war and the resultant volatility in metal prices.
Last quarter, Vedanta saw cuts in earnings estimates as low prices crimped profitability. The situation remains uncertain over concerns of slowing demand in China clouding the outlook. The company’s undemanding valuations of 9 times FY19 earnings estimates, coupled with cost reduction plans, should hold the stock in good stead. But for it to break the downtrend, global demand outlook has to improve."

The plant will be part of the company’s newly-acquired Electrosteel Steels Ltd (ESL) at Bokaro, Vedanta Resources chairman Anil Agarwal said. 
“This would be a new steel plant under ESL and in the same location at Bokaro... so it’s a brownfield investment per se. The amount is likely to be to the tune of $3-4 billion for a capacity of 4.5 million tonnes (MT),"" Agarwal said.
Vedanta would initially invest around $300 million to augment Electrosteel Steels’s capacity to 2.5 MT from the existing 1.5 MT. Once the new facility is commissioned, the total capacity of Electrosteel Steels would be around 7 MT, Agarwal said, without elaborating on the time frame.
The plant would create 1,20,000 jobs in the form of direct and indirect employment, he added. “We have about 2,200 acres at ESL and are scouting for a little more... The Jharkhand government has been very cooperative in this regard.""
In March, Vedanta was declared as the successful resolution applicant for ESL under the corporate insolvency resolution process. The company acquired control of Electrosteel Steels and a new board of directors was put in place.

As Mint has reported, in December three major developments took place in the matter of Sterlite Copper’s closed plant in Thoothukudi in south-eastern Tamil Nadu. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the state’s government to reopen the plant that was sealed on 28 May by the local administration. Autopsy reports of 13 protesters killed by police over 22-23 May as a demonstration against the plant turned violent, show deliberate intent to kill—as demonstrated at the time by at least one newspaper and a video news provider. And, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has begun its work to probe the incident in which several hundred protesters were also injured. 
As Mint has reported, in December three major developments took place in the matter of Sterlite Copper’s closed plant in Thoothukudi in south-eastern Tamil Nadu. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the state’s government to reopen the plant that was sealed on 28 May by the local administration.

And, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has begun its work to probe the incident in which several hundred protesters were also injured.
I cannot pre-empt or predict CBI’s conclusions but, beyond the matter of shoot-to-kill and how the events in May unfolded, is the matter of Sterlite’s position in relation to a government that ordered violence to quell violence. The local administration claimed that protesters ignored orders banning their march, became violent, and indulged in arson and stone-pelting. The police were compelled to shoot at a crowd estimated to be 20,000.
It is unclear as to how the situation was permitted to spiral out of control. When the protest is against a particular plant, reaching out to protesters and locals is the necessary function of Sterlite, a business of Vedanta Resources Plc, the local administration, and the state government.
In May, Tamil Nadu chief minister K. Palaniswami told the assembly as well as the media that the shooting was “unavoidable"". In an interview with Business Today right after news of deaths and injuries came in, Sterlite Copper’s chief executive officer P. Ramnath said he “totally"" regretted what had happened, that “It was totally uncalled for and is really unfortunate"". However, he undercut the pathos with repeated reference to “nefarious elements"" and also introduced conspiracy (“… perhaps infiltration of a number of nefarious elements, who probably had their own interests and it all took a violent turn, which we completely regret.."".)
Whatever the merits of Ramnath’s comments, Palaniswami’s response was untenable. As with most such instances, violence was entirely avoidable. Even if, as Ramnath claimed, one “faction"" of protesters had agreed to dialogue and another did not, and went ahead with protests that centred around a clearance by the state’s pollution control board to double production of Sterlite copper smelter to 800,000 tonnes a year. In several tense situations, police have fired in the air, used tear gas, but evidence of kill-first-ask-questions-later shared by media sits poorly, whatever the provocation.
This is the universe of a community having every right to protest, seek answers and redress, and a business that has every right to do business according to the law of the land, in compliance with human rights, a position that also extends to the government. 
It isn’t as if there were no grounds for concern at the expansion. Though Sterlite maintains it followed all environmental and safety norms, there was precedence of fault. 
In 2013, the year of protests over allegations of toxic gas leaks at the plant, the Supreme Court fined Sterlite  ₹ 100 crore for “such damages caused to the environment from 1997 to 2012 and for operating the plant without a valid renewal for a fairly long period...""
Besides, the permission to expand production had arrived even as the plant remained closed since March, when a formal “consent to operate"" wasn’t renewed by Tamil Nadu. Indeed, Vedanta admitted to investors in early May that the plant did not possess “the consent to operate"".
Sterlite and Vedanta will naturally push for reopening of the plant through legal means and policy pressure if the state government objects for reasons of political capital. And, while reopening is certain to ignite protest, pushing for expansion would be suicidal. 
In any case, amends will need to be seen to be made by both company and government. For that, even the  ₹ 100 crore that NGT directed Sterlite to spend on “welfare activities"" in Thoothukudi over three years may not be enough.

London: Lawyers for Vedanta Resources told England’s Supreme Court on Tuesday that a case raised against the mining company by nearly 2,000 Zambian villagers should be heard in Zambia not London.
India-listed Vedanta, which delisted from London last year but maintains a legal base in Britain, is appealing a lower court ruling that a case in which villagers alleged their land was polluted by a Vedanta unit could be heard in England.
The two-day hearing will be watched by other multinational companies with a base in London and facing legal challenges about their operations abroad from local residents.
England’s highest court is not expected to deliver a judgment for several weeks, court officials said.
Vedanta’s legal team argued that Zambia was the “natural forum"" for the case and said the parent company did not control operations in Zambia, which were governed by Zambian law.
In 2017, London’s Court of Appeal had found that 1,826 Zambian citizens living in Zambia’s Copperbelt had the right to sue Vedanta in the English courts. Vedanta is challenging this.
The villagers allege their land and livelihood have been destroyed by water pollution caused by the Nchanga Copper Mine, owned by Vedanta through its subsidiary Konkola Copper Mines.
London law firm Leigh Day has argued that the English courts were the only route for the villagers to achieve justice.
Separately, Leigh Day is seeking the right to appeal to the Supreme Court after a lower court found Nigerians could not pursue a claim against Royal Dutch Shell in London in relation to oil spills in Nigeria’s Delta region.
The firm is also seeking to take a case against Unilever to the Supreme Court over a lawsuit it has brought on behalf of tea plantation workers and their families in Kenya in connection with ethnic violence in 2008.
Vedanta’s case will also likely be watched by miner BHP, which has said it will fight an English suit by Brazilians seeking damages over an environmental disaster caused when the Fundao dam that stored mining waste burst in 2015.
Outside the court, action group Foil Vedanta was among those protesting against what they allege is pollution by Vedanta.
“While the financial and material gains from copper have been allowed to flow seamlessly out of the country, justice risks being restricted by economic and institutional barriers of territoriality,"" Foil Vedanta campaigner Samarendra Das said in an emailed statement.
A Vedanta spokesman referred Reuters to the website when asked for comment. The website said Vedanta seeks a “positive impact on the community"" and that “operating responsibly and ethically is an integral part of Vedanta’s core values"".

New Delhi: The Supreme Court fixed for hearing on January 29 Vedanta's plea seeking an interim order allowing it to open the Sterlite plant at Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu.
The state government and the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader, Vaiko, who was present in the court on Thursday, opposed Vedanta's request, saying it cannot be done unless pollution norms are complied with.
Vaiko also submitted to the court that people were killed in police firing during a protest against the plant in May last year.
To this, the bench of justices R F Nariman and Navin Sinha objected to his statements and said he should focus on legal aspects of the case and not digress from the main issue.
Vaiko, however, continued. He said he represents the people of the area and blood was split on streets.
""You please keep your voice modulated. Don't shout at the court. We will not hear your speeches. You can go on your own trip or stick to answering our questions. We hear legal arguments here. Come straight away to the point,"" the bench said.
The court initially indicated it may pass an interim order directing the state government to open the plant and provide electricity if the company complies with the conditions laid down by the National Green Tribunal to curb pollution.
But the court later deferred the plea for hearing on January 29, along with the appeal filed by Tamil Nadu against the December 15 NGT order setting aside the government's decision to close the plant. The NGT had said saying the state government's decision was ""non sustainable"" and ""unjustified"".
At the outset, the bench had asked senior advocate C A Sundaram, appearing for Vedanta, what were their immediate grievances.
Sundaram said they were not being provided electricity and the company can only comply with the conditions laid down by NGT if there was electricity to operate.
He said it takes 30 to 60 days for the plant to start production.
The court was hearing a plea by Vedanta group seeking a direction to Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to implement the NGT order.
On January 8, the apex court paved the way to re-open the plant by refusing to stay the green tribunal order. It also stayed the December 21 decision of the Madurai bench of the Madras High Court which had ordered status quo with respect to re-opening the plant.
The top court also sought response from Vedanta on the state government's appeal against the NGT order to reopen the plant.
At least 13 people were killed and several injured on May 22 last year when police opened fire on people protesting against the environment pollution being caused by the unit.
Six days later, the Tamil Nadu government ordered the state pollution control board to seal and ""permanently"" close the plant.

Bengaluru: Shares of Vedanta Ltd slumped to a two-and-a-half-year low on Friday after analysts expressed concerns over an investment by a unit of the company in African miner Anglo American.
Vedanta said on Thursday its foreign unit Cairn India Holdings Ltd had paid $200 million to buy a stake in Anglo American from Volcan Investments Ltd, the miner's parent company, as a part of its ""cash management activities"".
The miner's returns from the deal depends on Anglo American's stock price and returns are not guaranteed, Morgan Stanley said in a note.
""While there is some downside protection for Vedanta in specific scenarios (not clarified by the management), returns are not guaranteed,"" Morgan Stanley said.
The stock slumped as much as 19.86% on Friday, the largest intraday fall since October 2008. More than 74 million shares — 7.4 times its 30-day average — had changed hands by early afternoon, making it the most-heavily traded security on the NSE index.
Industry players too have speculated that Agarwal, who controls about a fifth of Anglo American, wants some form of a tie-up with the global miner.
In September last year, Vedanta Resources' Chairman Anil Agarwal's decision to take the London-listed miner private was seen by some as a prelude to a potentially broader deal with bigger miner Anglo American.
Kotak's analysts in a note said that while Vedanta stated the investment is to earn higher returns, they fail to see merit in the arrangement.

London: Copper prices rose on Monday on concerns that supply will be tight after a court ruling cast doubt on the future of a smelter in India and a large mine in Indonesia said its export permit had expired.
Better than expected Chinese lending data on Friday, meanwhile, suggested that demand from the world's biggest consumer of metals will remain strong.

But there is little sign of a serious supply shortfall, Deutsche Bank analyst Nick Snowdon said, adding that the outlook for US-China trade negotiations and global economic growth remained the most important driver of copper prices.

New Delhi: In a major setback to Vedanta Resources Plc, the Supreme Court set aside Monday the order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that allowed Sterlite Industries Ltd to reopen its copper plant at Tuticorin.
The order was set aside on the grounds of maintainability.
In the latest twist to the battle pitting environmentalists against the multinational firm, a bench comprising justices R.F. Nariman and Vineet Saran asked Vedanta to approach the Madras high court for interim relief. It was held that NGT should not have passed the order for reopening of the copper plant as it lacked jurisdiction to do so.
The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board had approached the apex court against the 15 December NGT order, arguing that it was “erroneous"" and passed without application of mind to the evidence furnished by the state government to show that the Vedanta unit had polluted groundwater.
“The tribunal failed to consider the data, document and evidence furnished by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to prove that Vedanta had irreversibly polluted the groundwater in and around Thoothukudi (Tuticorin) district,"" the petition said.
The NGT had ordered the reopening of the plant, months after it was closed by the state government in the aftermath of clashes between protesting environmentalists and the police, killing 13 demonstrators.
The NGT had also asked the TNPCB to pass a fresh order of renewal of consent and authorization to handle hazardous substances, subject to appropriate conditions for protection of the environment within three weeks.
A bench headed by NGT chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel had said that the Tamil Nadu government’s order issued under Section 18 (1)(b) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, could not be referred to as an independent order “but relied upon and endorsing the views of the TNPCB, which is under challenge, and are not sufficient for ordering closure or refusal to grant even consent"".
“If there are no other materials for the government of Tamil Nadu to arrive at the conclusion of closure on the ground of irreversible pollution being caused to the environment allowing the unit to function, then it cannot be said to be a policy decision to close down the industry permanently. If any order was passed based on the order by the Pollution Control Board, without independent application of mind and arbitrarily, then that can also be incidentally considered by the tribunal for the purpose of deciding the question of legality of that order,"" the NGT had said in its order.

New Delhi/Beijing: Vedanta Ltd is selling down copper concentrate stocks from its Sterlite smelter in Tamil Nadu, looking to cut costs at the plant ordered permanently shut in May, company and government sources told Reuters last week.
The Thoothukudi plant was ordered shut by the state government after protests against alleged pollution culminated in police killing 13 demonstrators.
General elections are due in May, and the two main political parties in Tamil Nadu are against reopening the smelter, increasing the likelihood that the shutdown will continue.
""Vedanta has disposed of 55,000 tonnes of copper concentrate, and has about 35,000 tonnes left, which will be disposed of soon,"" one of the government officials told Reuters.
The official could not be named because he was not authorised to speak publicly.
Vedanta shipped the copper concentrate in two cargoes to Chinese buyers, one of 25,000 tonnes in late December, and another of 30,000 tonnes in late January, according to two company sources and two shipping industry sources.
Vedanta plans to sell soon the remaining 35,000 tonnes of concentrate left at the 400,000 tonne-per-year smelter, one of Asia's biggest outside China, said three Indian government sources. The sources declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
""Inventory of concentrate will be liquidated in line with our commercial protocols and as per the direction of district administration,"" Vedanta said in a statement, giving no further details.
An official at Daye Nonferrous Metals Group, one of China's top copper smelters, said his company had taken a cargo of Vedanta's concentrate at the port of Nanjing, without specifying how much."
68,2019-03-01,Vedanta,"The Tamil Nadu government ordered the smelter shut permanently on 28 May last yearDespite the troubles over its Tamil Nadu smelter, Vedanta plans to invest $8.4 billion in the country over the next three years

New Delhi: Vedanta Ltd told an Indian court it has been losing  ₹50 million ($706,000) a day ever since the closure of one of its copper smelters in May, after police fired on protesters against the plant and killed 13 people.
The Tamil Nadu government ordered the smelter shut permanently on 28 May last year after bloody protests at the plant in the city of Thoothukudi culminated in police opening fire on demonstrators.
The ""unit has been and is continuing to suffer a daily loss of about  ₹5 crores ( ₹50 million rupees),"" Vedanta said in a petition to the Madras High Court reviewed by Reuters.
That translates to a loss of about  ₹1,380 crore ($195 million) since the plant was shut nine months ago. Vedanta Group Chairman Anil Agarwal had said in July the company could lose $100 million if the plant was shut for a year.
A Vedanta spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The case, in which the company is seeking to reopen the smelter, is due to open in the Madras High Court on Friday.
Vedanta won a favourable judgment in December from India's Natural Green Tribunal (NGT), clearing the way to reopen the smelter, but India's Supreme Court ruled in February that the NGT did not have the jurisdiction to grant relief.
In addition to a potentially long legal battle, reopening the smelter could face further complications with federal elections due in May. The two main political parties in Tamil Nadu are against reopening the smelter, increasing the likelihood that the shutdown will continue.
Vedanta is also seeking to gain access to its plant, which has been maintained by the government since the shutdown, and said it would need tens of millions of rupees to restore it.
The company ""would be subjected to irreparable harm and hardship, not capable of being compensated in monetary terms if the interim reliefs (for access) ... are not granted,"" Vedanta said in its petition.
Chairman Agarwal is betting big on India despite the troubles over its Tamil Nadu smelter, and plans to invest $8.4 billion in the country over the next three years.
Vedanta's shares have lost about half their value over the last 12 months. They had their largest one-day fall in over a decade in February due to concerns over an investment in South African miner Anglo American Plc.

NEW DELHI :
State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) Friday won five oilfields in the second discovered small field (DSF) auction round.
Oil India Ltd (OIL) and Vedanta Ltd walked away with two fields each while lesser known Ganges Geo Resources Pvt Ltd won five fields, an official statement said here.
Indian Oil Corp and its partner HOEC won one field.
""The Empowered Committee of Secretaries (ECS) and Group of Ministers on March 1 2019 has approved the award of 23 contract areas to highest ranked bidders as part of the Discovered Small Field (DSF) Bid Round – II,"" it said.
The remaining fields went to little known firms like Arch Softwares Pvt Ltd, Shanti GD Ispat Power Pvt Ltd, Arsh Corporate Services Pvt Ltd, Invenire ENergy Pvt Ltd, Keerthi Industries and Gem Petro E&P Pvt Ltd.
As many as 39 firms, including six foreign players, had put in 145 bids for 24 out of the 25 oil and gas fields on offer in DSF-II at the close of bidding on January 30. Mining giant Vedanta put in the maximum number of bids for 21 fields.
The statement said one bid for a field has been kept in abeyance as the matter is sub-judice.
ONGC and OIL had put in bids for 10 fields each while Indian Oil Corp (IOC) bid for 3.
British company Soco International made its foray into India, bidding for one field but it failed to make a dent. Arch Softwares, a firm floated by a ex-Cairn India employee, had put in bids for 15 fields.

66,2019-03-08,Vedanta,"The negative outlook reflects the likelihood of a lower rating on Vedanta Resources over the next nine monthsVedanta Resources' financial ratios will likely stay weaker than levels commensurate with the current rating, says S&P

New Delhi: S&P Global Ratings Friday revised the outlook on Vedanta Resources Ltd to negative from positive on weaker operating performance. ""The outlook revision reflects our view that Vedanta Resources' financial ratios will likely stay weaker than levels commensurate with the current rating,"" it said in a statement.
""The company's operating performance and cash flows lag our estimates, and its debt related to privatisation and growth investments should keep leverage higher than our expectation for the rating,"" the statement said. 
The negative outlook reflects the likelihood of a lower rating on Vedanta Resources over the next nine months, S&P Global Ratings said. ""This is because, in the absence of a better operating performance than we expect and an unlikely reduction of elevated debt (related to privatisation, steel business acquisition etc.), the company's cash flow leverage will be higher than the level commensurate with a 'B+' rating,"" it said.
S&P Global Ratings further said its annual gross Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) expectation for Vedanta Resources was now about $4 billion over 2019-20 and 2020-21, a drop of about $1.0 billion from its estimate nine months ago.
This is due to a combination of lower base metal prices, higher input costs of aluminium, slower new zinc project ramp up, and the closure of copper smelting.
""Slower worldwide economic growth (especially for China) has lowered our estimate of demand growth in base metals,"" it said."
65,2019-03-11,Vedanta,"An international arbitration tribunal had in August 2018 concluded hearings in Cairn Energy's India retrospective tax caseThe tribunal was supposed to give an award by February 2019 but the same is now expected not before the end of 2019

New Delhi: Cairn Energy Plc of the UK on Monday said it expects the long-running arbitration process against the Indian authorities over retrospective taxation to be more protracted than originally anticipated and is unlikely to be concluded until later this year.
An international arbitration tribunal had in August 2018 concluded main court hearings in Cairn Energy's challenge to the Indian government using retrospective legislation to seek  ₹10,247 crore in taxes. The tribunal was supposed to give an award by February 2019 but the same is now expected not before the end of the year.
Cairn Energy in a statement said that it had last month written to the three-member panel seeking guidance on the likely timing of the arbitration award.
""The Panel has now responded that although it remains mindful of Cairn's need for a swift decision, given its workload and the number of matters before it, it is still unable to provide specific guidance on timing,"" the statement said.
""As a result of this, Cairn expects that the timetable for issuing the award will be more protracted than originally anticipated and is unlikely to be before late 2019.""
In January 2014, Cairn Energy received notice from India's income tax department, requesting information relating to the group reorganization done in 2006. The I-T department attached the company's near 10% shareholding in Cairn India, which was subsequently merged with its parent Vedanta.
Cairn Energy held a 4.95% stake in Vedanta post that move.
Cairn Energy received a draft assessment order from the Indian I-T department in March 2015 and subsequently filed a notice of dispute under the UK-India Investment Treaty in order to protect its ""legal position and shareholder interests"".
Pending arbitration proceedings, the I-T department, beginning May 2018, has sold most of the Cairn shares to recover tax dues.
With merits submissions and hearings concluded, the arbitration panel is preparing its final award.
""The panel had originally guided arbitration parties that it expected to issue an award expeditiously following the conclusion of the main merits hearings in The Hague held in August 2018,"" Cairn said.
""When the parties appeared before the tribunal in December 2018, the panel advised that it had not been able to advance the award as expected due to the number of procedural matters that had been brought before it since the August hearings, and that it is was not in a position at that time to give guidance to the parties on the expected timing of the issuance of the award.""
Final merits hearings for the arbitration concluded during 2018.
Cairn Energy's claim under the treaty is for monetary compensation of $1.4 billion, the sum required to reinstate the company to the position it would have been in, but for the actions of the tax department since January 2014.
""The arbitration Panel is expected to issue a binding and internationally enforceable award, and Cairn continues to have a high level of confidence in the merits of its claims in the arbitration,"" it said."
63,2019-03-12,Vedanta,"The top 20 business conglomerates in India contributed less than one-third to overall private sector investments in the three years from 2015-16 to 2017-18, data shows

Mumbai: India’s largest conglomerates are investing far less in the country than they used to. The top 20 conglomerates, based on aggregate turnover, contributed less than a third to overall private sector investments in the three years from fiscal years 2015-16 to 2017-18.
These companies accounted for more than half of all new project announcements at the turn of the century, a Mint analysis of capital expenditure (capex) data shows.
The data for the analysis is based on figures for new project announcements from the capex-tracking database of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). The categorization of business groups by CMIE is largely based on the 1966 R.K. Hazari Committee report.
The analysis is based on data from FY98 till FY18 and—given the lumpy nature of capex spending—considers investments in each three-year period. Data for business houses that have split in the period under consideration (including the Ambanis, the Jindals, and the Bajajs) have been merged to ensure comparability across the time period.
The data pertains only to domestic investments and does not take into account outward foreign investments by these groups. Although growth in fresh investments recovered in the last three years after hitting a record low in 2013-15, the improvement is largely due to the low base and the growth rate is still much lower than what it was in the early 2000s.
The 2012-15 period actually saw negative growth for this set of conglomerates, primarily because several of the large conglomerates were deep in debt during that period.
According to a 2015 report by Credit Suisse titled Still in the Woods, total debt at 10 of the biggest business groups climbed seven times in the eight years leading up to that year, adding up to 12% of the loans in the banking system and 27% of corporate loans. The Essar Group, Larsen and Toubro (L&T) and Godrej saw the sharpest declines in new investments during this period. L&T also witnessed the sharpest improvement in the subsequent three years, from FY2016-2018.
Other groups that led investment recovery in this period were companies under the former KK Birla Group, TVS and the Rajan Raheja group. The Ambanis (aggregate of firms owned by Mukesh and Anil Ambani), Bharti Telecom, and the Tatas witnessed the most sluggish investment activity in the same period.
Interestingly, over the last two decades, the three biggest business groups—Ambanis, Tatas and Jindals—have lost significant share in terms of their contribution to new investment projects.
In the financial years 1997-2000, the combined share of these three groups in new private sector investments was 33%. This has fallen to about 10% in recent years.
Even so, among the top 20, Jindals and Ambanis remained the biggest contributors to fresh investments in India. In fact, a comparison of the performance of new conglomerates (founded after 1970), such as Vedanta, Adani and the Ambani group, with older conglomerates (those founded before 1970), including the Tatas, Jindals and Godrej, shows that the contribution of the older conglomerates has fallen more in recent years.
The analysis also shows that manufacturing investments by the top conglomerates have been far more volatile than investments in services, which have been led by groups such as Larsen and Toubro, the Jindals, and the Ambanis (See chart 4). 
An earlier Plain Facts column had highlighted how investments are now spread more equally among states. This analysis suggests that investments among firms are a bit more equal than they used to be."
64,2019-03-12,Vedanta,"Companies are complaining about the endless host of litigation that they face under IBC codeOperational creditors, who are unhappy with the settlements, often stall the insolvency process

Mumbai: Now that two years have passed since the first major acquisitions under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), several players—buyers, investment bankers and dissatisfied creditors—are slowly opening up about what they see as chinks in India's bankruptcy law.
These include repeated litigation—both during and after the process—missing physical assets in plants, the lack of judges and questions over the integrity of promoters of distressed businesses and resolution professionals.
The cracks in the resolution process are evident from the following developments:
■ After acquisition of Monnet Ispat by JSW Steel Ltd in September 2018, operational creditor Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) and unsecured creditor IFCI Ltd have challenged the resolution plan.
■ The bidders for Amtek Auto and its unit Metalyst Forgings—London-based Liberty House and US-based hedge fund Deccan Value Investors, respectively—are challenging the information provided to them by the resolution professional during the bidding process. While Deccan Value Investors has asked NCLT to cancel its resolution plan, Liberty house has alleged in court that the contents of a forensic audit conducted by EY into Amtek Auto were not revealed to it.
“Often, resolution professionals are ill-equipped to fully oversee operations at companies. In other cases, there are serious integrity issues among resolution professionals and promoters,"" an investment banker said on condition of anonymity. “We know of cases where equipment has been stolen from plants during the resolution process. In some cases, promoters litigate to draw out the resolution process while we hear of money being siphoned away from the company during this period."" 
Mahesh Singh, founder and managing director, Singhi Advisors, said sometimes assets do go missing at the time of closure of the deal. “Buyers should get a chance to do the closing due diligence. Even so, there are legal remedies for when assets are missing because there is always a lag between selling a business and finally getting possession.""
Godrej Group chairman Adi Godrej said: “The bankruptcy code has been very poorly implemented because there have been so many cases of bankruptcy which have not been finalized. We allow them to go from one court to another and then we give them stay order. Our judicial process is very slow. “It (IBC) is not being implemented as well as it could have been. That is not perhaps for lack of trying but it is also our legal system and legislation.""
JSW Steel's joint managing director, M.V.S. Seshagiri Rao said in a recent interview: “Under IBC, once a case in admitted, whatever cases are pending against a company, there is a moratorium on them. But once the resolution plan is approved, all of these spring up again. We are seeing this in several forums, in all companies that have been acquired, not just ours. I think some clarity is required here so winning bidders feel more comfortable that once the settlement is paid, everything else is extinguished.""
The major acquisitions under IBC were those of Bhushan Steel by Tata Steel Ltd; Binani Cement Ltd by UltraTech Cement Ltd; and Monnet Ispat by JSW Steel-AION Capital.
Kalpesh Kikani, managing director and senior partner, AION Capital, said at the Mint Investment Summit in Mumbai on 1 March: “First, the challenge is getting to know what the true price for the asset is. Step 2 is who gets how much among various financial creditors, be it secured, unsecured, secured with guarantee, unsecured with guarantee, and then you have some operational creditors who believe they are equal to financial creditors and others who believe they are better than financial creditors in terms of supplying (goods to a company even during distress). This Stage 2 of who gets how much is an integral part of IBC and will be the subject matter of litigation—and as a bidder this is something we always factor into our bids."""
62,2019-03-15,Vedanta,"Pankaj Kumar replaces P. Ramnath, whose eight-year tenure at Sterlite Copper saw the Thoothukudi plant shut down twiceVedanta, which continues to struggle with reopening of the Sterlite copper plant, is estimated to have lost over $200 million since the shutdown in May

New Delhi: Vedanta Ltd on Friday named metals industry veteran Pankaj Kumar as Sterlite Copper CEO, amid struggles to reopen its smelter in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu, that was shut after police killed 13 demonstrators protesting against the plant.
Sterlite Copper, which operates a 400,000-tonne-per-year smelter in Thoothukudi, was forced to shut its plant by Tamil Nadu state in May, and is estimated to have lost more than $200 million since.
Kumar replaces P. Ramnath, who led Sterlite for eight years. Under Ramnath, the smelter was ordered shut at least twice, including for an alleged gas leak in 2013.
Local residents and environmental activists have staged protests against the Sterlite copper plant over allegations of pollution as well as the earlier gas leak. Vedanta says the claims of pollution are false, without any factual basis. It also denied being the source of the gas leak.
The chief executive replacement comes amid a drawn-out legal battle over the smelter that could be complicated further by Lok Sabha elections that start on 11 April. The AIADMK and DMK, the two main political parties in Tamil Nadu, are against reopening of the Sterlite copper plant, increasing the likelihood that the shutdown will continue.
Vedanta won a judgment in December from India's Natural Green Tribunal (NGT) that would have cleared the way to reopen the smelter, but India's Supreme Court ruled in February that the environmental court did not have jurisdiction over the smelter.
""My tenure as CEO has been an eventful journey, and as is the case with any journey, there have been numerous ups and downs,"" Ramnath, who will continue as an adviser to the company, said in a statement.
Kumar, who will also oversee operations at Vedanta's Malco Energy Ltd and Fujairah Gold, has worked at Hindustan Zinc Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd and Adani Ports Ltd, in a career stretching over 29 years.
Kumar was also chief operating officer at Sterlite Copper in the past, the company said.
""It is an honour to be back in a place that feels like home,"" he said."

New Delhi: At least one person died in clashes between police and protesters outside Vedanta Ltd's aluminium plant in Odisha, the company said on Monday.
The incident comes less than a year after police opened fire on demonstrators protesting against the operation of another Vedanta plant, its copper smelter in Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu, killing 13 people.
Vedanta said in a statement to Reuters that one person had died and more people had been injured in the clashes outside its Lanjigarh plant.
""As per the update from the hospital, one of the injured protesters lost his life,"" Vedanta said in a statement to Reuters.
""The local Odisha Industrial Security Force personnel (OISF), who intervened were attacked by the protesters during which some protesters and OISF personnel got injured,"" the company said, referring to a state security force that is under police command.
Vedanta did not comment on what the demands of the protesters were. Media in Odisha reported that they had been agitating for jobs for local people.

The Orissa High Court on Tuesday allowed Vedanta Limited to participate in the tender floated by the National Aluminum Company Ltd (NALCO) for the sale of its 30,000 MT metallurgical grade calcined alumina.
Allowing Vedanta's prayer for only to take part in the tender, a division bench headed by Chief Justice K S Jhaveri observed that since the petitioner did not press for other prayers in the writ petition, it has not been taken for adjudication.
Central public sector enterprise NALCO is a leading producer of low-cost metallurgical grade alumina in the world. The alumina produced is used to meet NALCO's requirements for production of primary aluminium at smelter and the surplus alumina is sold to third parties in the export market.
But NALCO had repeatedly disallowed Vedanta to participate in its tender for the sale of alumina on the ground that Vedanta Limited was established under the SEZ (Special Economic Zone) statute and if Vedanta was interested in the tender, it could do so only through its sister concern based in London.
Vedanta challenged this condition of NALCO in the high court and after hearing both the parties, the bench ordered that the petitioner be considered eligible to participate with all prevailing conditions of the tender floated by NALCO."

New Delhi: Mining baron Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd on Wednesday announced an oil discovery in its Krishna Godavari basin block in the Bay of Bengal.
The block previously had a gas discovery in the very first well drill.
In a statement, Vedanta said ""it has notified the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons and Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas of an oil discovery in the second exploratory well H2, located in the block KG-OSN-2009/3, Krishna-Godavari Basin, East Coast of India"".
Vedanta holds 100% participating interest in the block.
""Multiple reservoir zones were encountered in the well H2 within the Mesozoic sequence between the depths of 3,310 metres to 4,026 metres with hydrocarbon indications during drilling and downhole logging,"" it said.
The zone from 3,403 metres to 3,431 metres was tested through conventional well testing (Drill Stem Test) and flowed oil to the surface.
""Further appraisal will be required to establish the size and commerciality of the oil discovery,"" Vedanta said.
The first exploration well A3-2 drilled in the block was a gas discovery.
""Evaluations are ongoing based on the results of the first well A3-2 and the second well H2 to finalise the forward programme,"" it added.
Cairn India, the company Vedanta bought and merged with itself, had in June 2010 won the KG-OSN-2009/3 block in the 8th round of New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP).
It had committed to drill six exploratory wells on the block. These were expandable to 10.
The KG basin is a proven basin where there have been many hydrocarbon discoveries.
The company acquired around 1,000 square kilometres of 3D seismic data based on which it drilled two wells.
KG-OSN-2009/3 offshore block in the Bay of Bengal was originally spread over in an area of about 1,988 sq km which was later reduced to 1,298 sq km due to exclusion of area within firing range.

57,2019-04-06,Vedanta,"In her quest for mindful living, the co-founder of Nicobar immersed herself in a deeper understanding of ancient Indian wisdom and philosophyLal’s desire to share her experience with people led her to launch Paro, an experiential concept space in Delhi based on the idea of holistic beauty

I find myself in an idyllic campus called the Vedanta Academy, outside Pune, where we all wake up at 4am, study, then practise a few hours of yoga, followed by sports and lectures on Vedanta philosophy. It is almost spartan, but well thought through. I am in a small room with so little around me, and it strikes me that this is truly all one needs for inner happiness.
How did I get here? Around five years ago, on a family holiday in Germany, I asked my father, Vikram Lal, a question: “Pa, if you could choose to be born in any country in the world and everything remains the same—your family, work, etc., which country would that be?"" He closed his eyes, only opening them around half an hour later and saying, “I have finally concluded that the only country I would like to be born again in is India."" I was quite surprised with this response because my father spent a formative part of his life in Germany before he founded Eicher Motors, and keeps going back. We all have grown up highly influenced by Europe and I assumed he would mention one of those countries.
When I asked him why, he said, “Because the level of sophistication of ancient Indian thought, the nuanced philosophy, the heritage of its wisdom along with its richness of culture, craftsmanship and diversity is what shapes me. Everything else feels quite flat in comparison."" That got me thinking. I have always considered myself someone who is rooted in India and is deeply appreciative of our heritage. But I hadn’t spent much time getting to know our philosophical thought.
I lead a rather hectic life—I ran (lifestyle brand) Good Earth for many years, then my husband and I started Nicobar, and, most recently, I launched Paro. I have two young boys and as someone recently told me, this truly is the rush hour of one’s life—with so many different priorities to juggle, all at the same time. Till around two-and-a-half-years ago, I had been squeezing myself dry and not giving back to myself or nourishing my body or soul. I was constantly irritable and on edge.
Every so often, that conversation with my father would float in and out of my head. I started wondering about how I relate to the larger world; I started looking for connections between the mind, body and soul. That was my first moment of pause.
I picked up a book called Absolute Beauty by Pratima Raichur, a book that has been with me for over 20 years. But when I read it this time, it opened up a whole new world for me. It is a book based on Ayurvedic principles and explains how external skin tissue is a reflection of everything that happens within our body: the way we eat and breathe, as well as the thoughts and emotions that fill our mind and colour our spirit. She says: “How we view the world and how we feel about things affects our experience, and experience changes the body. When modern medicine asks where the body is diseased but not why the patient is ill, it ignores the basic truth of our experience. Most disease results from a breakdown in the immune system; immune breakdown results from stress; stress is due to perception; and perception derives from consciousness.""
I was deeply curious about what she called “consciousness"" and how that pervades everything. I joined a short online course at Oxford University on the philosophy of yoga and that gave me an overview of different philosophical thoughts. I bought The Yoga-Sutra Of Patanjali by Chip Hartranft—this one came highly recommended by my friend, Veer Singh, founder of the wellness destination Vana, near Dehradun. It took me deeper into the philosophical aspects of the yoga tradition. I also went through the bibliographies in all these books and bought those that piqued my interest. I re-read Cosmos by Carl Sagan. And, finally, another friend and colleague, Pareina Thapar, recommended the Vedanta Treatise by A. Parthasarathy. It is this book that made a huge impact on me.
Parthasarathy emphasizes that the Vedanta philosophy is a guide for daily living and says: “Living is an art, a skill, a technique. You need to learn and practice it as you would to play a musical instrument or fly an aircraft.""
It is a whole new perspective on life, from our own country. It encourages questioning and experimentation. I always thought of anything to do with our historic texts as something religious and emphasizing faith vs rationality. To my surprise, Vedanta made me look deeper into the nature of things, and, very importantly, the nature of the self through observation and questions.
The main tenets of Vedanta, as I understand them, are a reflective study of yourself (to eventually join with your higher self-consciousness). To quote Parthasarathy again, “It is not the world that distresses you but how you relate to it.""
Another main tenet is the deep connect with, and reverence for, nature. Which means being in sync with the rhythms of nature. I realized that something as basic as being connected to nature, prakriti, expressed through the rhythms of seasons and lunar cycle, is something that we urban Indians are increasingly removed from.
I started creating little daily rituals for myself to be more connected with the rhythms of nature, like going up to my terrace early in the mornings and bowing to the rising sun. It’s amazing what a change that has made: I started noticing the different types of birds that perch regularly on my terrace, I was more aware of the hue of the sun in winter (hemanta) vs spring (basant) vs summer (grishma), the deep fragrance of the mogra at sunrise vs later in the day.
I also started fasting between seasons, an old Indian tradition. This ritual of fasting is like a bridge between seasons, it is a pause: a moment to reflect, acknowledge the transition between seasons, a time to give your body and even the mind a break from the daily routine. I realized I was falling ill much less and feeling a lot more energetic.
That moment of pause, when we take in a deep breath, in that very moment we have a choice to see things for what they truly are: to readjust our perception, to respond rather than react. And that little moment of pause, if done mindfully and regularly, can be, and has been, life changing for me.
For me, it has been so powerful that I felt the deep desire to share this experience with people who may benefit. It is why I launched Paro (which in Sanskrit means the sharing of special knowledge), an offering for anyone who is intrigued and curious about this holistic approach to well-being.
Paro, which I intend to restrict to one space in Delhi’s Chanakya Mall, is an experiential concept space based on the idea of holistic beauty, which we define as inner and outer beauty (shringar) and deep comfort and well-being (saukhya). It has been quite a challenge because it is not a typical store. It leads with experience and sometimes leaves people with more questions than answers.
The idea is to give people the tools to create personal rituals of saukhya and shringar through workshops in our Shanti Space, a library of books that I have personally read and loved, special treatment rooms, the Botanica space built like an apothecary where an aroma therapist personalizes and blends the purest oils, and more.
I hope it will nudge people on to a journey, their own journey, that incorporates precious moments of pause.
Simran Lal is the CEO of Good Earth and co-founder of Nicobar and Paro."

NEW DELHI :
Vedanta group firm Sterlite Copper has approached the Supreme Court, seeking access to its closed smelter in Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu to carry out maintenance.
The firm said it had pressed for the hearing of its interim applications and had also sought expeditious hearing of its main petitions but the Madras High Court expressed its inability to hear the matter due to paucity of time.
The plant was ordered shut after 13 people protesting against the plant died in police firing in May last year. The local people were protesting against the environment pollution caused by the plant when the incident happened in May last year.
Vendanta has denied the allegations that its plant caused the pollution.
The firm has said that its ""intention was solely to preserve its assets"" and for such purpose alone, commence repair and maintenance activities.
It added that lack of maintenance of assets has resulted in a loss of over  ₹100 crore.
The apex court earlier this year directed the company to move the Madras High Court against a Tamil Nadu State Pollution Control Board order shutting the plant down.
The firm said the value of the Tuticorin plant was around  ₹3,000 crore and if the high court did not eventually allow it to restart operations, it would need to transport and assemble equipment to another location.
On 27 March, the high court adjourned the matter till April 23, after MDMK leader Vaiko, said that it be listed after the assembly polls in the state.
The firm said it had objected to the same as the last working day of the high court before the summer vacations is 30 April.
Sterlite in its petition, filed in line with the Supreme Court's recent suggestion, has challenged the 23 May, 2018 orders of TNPCB refusing renewal of consent to the plant as well as permanent closure, terming them as wholly illegal, unconstitutional and ultra vires.
The apex court on February 18 set aside the order of the NGT allowing opening of the copper unit but gave the liberty to the company to approach the high court against the closure order.

55,2019-04-12,Vedanta,"Ajay Dixit, who was CEO of aluminum and power divisions of Vedanta, is likely to take over from Sudhir MathurSudhir Mathur is the 4th CEO to quit the firm since it was taken over by Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Group 7 years back

New Delhi: Cairn India chief executive Sudhir Mathur has resigned from the company, the fourth CEO to quit the firm since it was taken over by mining billionaire Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Group seven years back.
Along with Mathur, Pankaj Kalra, the chief financial officer of Cairn India, which is now a part of Vedanta Ltd after its merger with the parent, has also resigned, sources privy to the development said.
Mathur resigned about a month back and his resignation was made public only last week, the sources said. He is currently serving notice period which is technically up to May-end, but may leave the company by the end of April.
Kalra quit a couple of months back.
Prior to these resignations, Suniti Bhat, Director Oil & Gas and Member – Executive Committee at the company, resigned about six months back which was followed by the firm's chief internal audit and risk assurance director Arup Chakraborty quitting the company.
A company spokesperson confirming the resignations said: ""Such movements in management are part of natural evolution in any organization, and are in line with career aspirations and personal priorities of individuals.
""Having a strong and healthy leadership pipeline is the key in a high growth organisation like ours. We want to emphasise here that these movements are unconnected and have been spread over a period of time.""
Mathur did not answer phone calls made to seek his comments.
Mathur, 58, joined Cairn India in January 2013 and was named interim CEO when Mayank Ashar resigned as the chief executive of the company in May 2016.
He continued as interim CEO till the time Cairn India remained a separate listed company under Vedanta Ltd. He was elevated as chief executive officer of oil and gas business at Vedanta Ltd last year when Cairn India was merged with its parent Vedanta Ltd.
Sources said the company has named Ajay Dixit, who was CEO of aluminum and power divisions of Vedanta, to take over from Mathur in the interim period after his exit.
The resignations came within months of Vedanta winning 41 out of the 55 exploration blocks bid out in India's first bid round under open acreage licensing policy.
Some in the industry saw its bids as an attempt to please the establishment as the bid round would have collapsed with state-owned explorers like ONGC and Oil India Ltd (OIL) putting limited bids and other private and foreign players staying out of the bid round.
They felt Vedanta had over-committed itself to not so prospective blocks and with a limited team.
Mathur is the fourth CEO to have quit the company since Vedanta completed the acquisition of Cairn India in December 2011.
Rahul Dhir, the company's first CEO who oversaw its listing and development of India's biggest oil discovery in Rajasthan, quit the company in August 2012. His successor P Elango resigned in May 2014, while the third CEO Mayank Ashar resigned in May 2016.
Elango's exit in 2014 had completed the exodus of the entire top management of Cairn India since Vedanta announced its intention in 2010 to buy a majority stake in the company from Scottish explorer Cairn Energy Plc.
Rick Bott, who was the executive director and the chief operating officer of Cairn India, quit on June 15, 2011. Indrajit Banerjee, executive director and chief financial officer, resigned with effect from August 23, 2011.
David Ginger, Cairn India's director of exploration and new ventures, quit shortly after that. Dhir put in his paper after the Cairn-Vedanta deal was completed.
Director, Commercial and New Business Ajay Gupta quit the firm in January 2013.
In February 2014, Sundeep Bhandari, the man credited with laying the foundation and then building what is now Cairn India, quit the company. He along with Dhir, Bott, Banerjee and Ginger ran the firm before Vedanta took over.
Vedanta had bought 58.8% stake in Cairn India from British explorer Cairn Energy for $.67 billion in August 2010 and the acquisition was completed in December 2011.
In April 2017, Cairn India was merged with Vedanta and delisted from the stock exchanges."
54,2019-04-12,Vedanta,"Cairn India is in the midst of finalizing E&P plans for 41 oil and gas blocks it won last yearCairn India has witnessed the exit of four CEOs in the last seven years, since Vedanta took charge

Mumbai: The resignations by Cairn India’s chief executive officer (CEO) Sudhir Mathur and chief financial officer Pankaj Kalra last week, come as a setback for the Vedanta Ltd subsidiary, which is in the midst of finalizing the exploration and production (E&P) plans for the 41 hydrocarbon blocks it had won last year.
In January 2018, Cairn Oil and Gas was prepared to bid for a dozen of 55 hydrocarbon blocks that the government had put on offer under its maiden Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP). But when the idea was proposed to mining baron and Cairn India’s promoter Anil Agarwal, he directed them to bid for all the blocks. And, Cairn India came home with 41 of the 55 blocks.
“It is not easy to work for Cairn. Continuous interference from the promoters makes it difficult to work. Mathur and Kalra quit due to ideological differences,"" said an official aware of the developments, requesting anonymity.
Cairn India has, in fact, witnessed the exit of four CEOs in the last seven years, since Vedanta took charge.
The other three CEOs who left the company include Rahul Dhir, who stepped down in August 2012, interim CEO P. Elango left in May 2014, and Mayank Ashar put in his papers in June 2016.
“It’s not a routine exit. Both officials left in a week’s time. Kalra has worked for Mathur in his previous assignments and they are close friends, too. Mathur brought Kalra to Cairn India,"" added a second official with direct knowledge of the matter, also requesting anonymity.
When contacted, in an emailed response, Vedanta said: “Such movements in management are part of natural evolution in any organization, and are in line with career aspirations and personal priorities of individuals. Having a strong and healthy leadership pipeline is the key in a high-growth organization like ours. We want to emphasize here that these movements are unconnected and have been spread over a period of time.""
Vedanta’s shares, however, bore the brunt of the exits, trading 3.72% lower at  ₹181.30 apiece on Thursday. Though Cairn India was delisted from the BSE in April 2017, after its merger with Vedanta, the latter failed to inform the stock exchanges about the exit of the CEO and the CFO of its subsidiary.
In its producing blocks, Cairn India has already planned investments worth $4 billion, $2.5 billion of which have already been awarded in large contracts with global partners, significantly for new oil wells in Barmer.
And, with the latest acreage win, Cairn India’s portfolio expands from five onshore blocks to 48 offshore and onshore blocks pushing its proven and probable reserves and resources from about 1.3 bboe (billion barrels of oil equivalent) to 4.2 bboe.
So far, Cairn’s key producing assets are in Rajasthan (Mangala, Bhagyam, and Aishwariya fields), Andhra Pradesh (Ravva) and Gujarat (Cambay).
In the new blocks, the initial work plan alone is worth $500 million, and will go up manifold should there be a discovery, Sudhir Mathur had said in an interview last month.
But in the wake of the resignations and given the lack of exploration and production service providers in the country, industry experts said it would be tough for Cairn to meet deadlines, despite long-term strategic partnerships with global firms such as Baker Hughes LLC, Halliburton Co., and Schlumberger Ltd.
“Cairn has appointed an interim chief executive officer. It will have to outsource everything to third-party service provider and may need someone to manage the outsourcing,"" added the second official quoted above.
In its most recent partnership meeting in November 2018, more than 200 oil and gas specialists from 50-plus companies had participated. One-on-one discussions with bidders are ongoing until bid-submission time,"" Mathur had said in March."

NEW DELHI :
The value of India's copper products exports declined 70% in the year ended in March 2019 primarily due to the shutdown of Vedanta Ltd's copper smelter, an industry association said on Wednesday.
Exports of copper and copper products, including cathodes, were $1.07 billion in the period from April 2018 to March 2019, down from $3.48 billion in the 2017/18 fiscal year, according to data from the India's Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC), which is supported by the country's trade ministry.
The government of the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu in May ordered Vedanta to shut its smelter in the city of Thoothukudi, the country's second-largest, after police killed 13 demonstrators during protests against alleged pollution at the plant. The site is operated by Sterlite Copper, a subsidiary of Vedanta.
""Sterlite alone accounts for about 40 percent of the country's production. So exports fell due to their shutdown,"" said Suranjan Gupta, the executive director of EEPC India.
Overall copper exports from India during the April 2018 to March 2019 period were down 70% from the fiscal year 2017/18, Gupta said.
Exports to China, one of the biggest importers of copper products from India, fell over 80%  in 2018/19 from the previous year, he said.
Shreegopal Kabra, managing director of RR Global, a wire manufacturing firm that is one of the largest consumers of copper in India, said he is optimistic about the export potential of products such as cables and wires from India.
""Copper cathode and rod exports have fallen because of the Vedanta shutdown, but the future of exports of products such as wires and cables looks bright,"" Kabra said, adding that his company saw increased exports of wires in 2018/19.
India has an installed copper refining capacity of 1 million tonnes. Vedanta's Thoothukudi copper smelter has an annual refining capacity of over 400,000 tonnes.
The company is in the middle of a legal battle over the closure of the plant, which has disrupted Asia's copper market.
The two main political parties in Tamil Nadu are against reopening the smelter, increasing the likelihood that the shutdown will continue.
Copper production by major companies including Hindalco Industries Ltd and Hindustan Copper Ltd was about 457,000 tonnes in 2018/19, down 40% from about 766,000 tonnes a year earlier, according to government data released earlier this month."

48,2019-05-07,Vedanta,"Shutdown of the copper smelter at Thoothukudi weighed on its revenue, shrinking 15% year-on-year to  ₹23,092 crore in Q4For FY20, Vedanta’s management outlined a capital expenditure plan of $1.4 billion

MUMBAI :
Mining and metals giant Vedanta Ltd reported a net profit of  ₹2615 crore, down 46% from  ₹4802 crore in the year-ago period. While the March quarter's performance was better than expected driven by higher volumes in sales of metals and better cost management, the net profit was lower because of a one-time reversal in impairment gain, it had recorded last year.
However, the shutdown of the copper smelter at Thoothukudi weighed on its revenue, shrinking 15% year-on-year to  ₹23,092 crore in the March quarter from  ₹27,311 crore in the same period a year ago. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) stood at  ₹6,330 crore for the quarter, lower by 19% from the March 2018 quarter which had reported  ₹7,767 crore. The company’s EBITDA was affected by lower commodity prices, rupee appreciation, and lower volumes at Zinc India.
For the full year, net profit after exceptional items stood at  ₹7,065 crore for the full fiscal year 2019, falling 32% year-on-year from  ₹10,342 crore in FY18 while revenue for the same period reduced by 1% to  ₹90,901 crore in FY19 from  ₹92,011 crore.
For FY20, Vedanta’s management outlined a capital expenditure plan of $1.4 billion.
Gross debt was at  ₹66,225 crore on 31 March 2019, an increase of  ₹8,066 crore year-on-year. This was mainly due to the acquisition of Electrosteel Steels Ltd and temporary borrowing at Zinc India. Net debt was at  ₹26,956 crore, higher by  ₹4,998 crore year-on-year.
In operations, for the year, Vedanta achieved record mined metal production, with zinc from underground mines growing 29%, lead up 18% and silver up 22%. With silver, the company produced 700 tonnes during the year, placing it among the top 10 silver producers in the world, the company said. In oil and gas, the average gross production of 189,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for FY19, up 2% year-on-year. Aluminium production rose to the highest ever at 2 million tonnes (mt), up 17% year-on-year. Iron ore production of saleable ore at Karnataka stood at 4.1mt, up 89% y-o-y while operations in Goa are still shuttered by a state-wide ban. With the acquisition of Electrosteel Steels Ltd last year, steel production stood at 1.2mt, with an exit production run-rate of 1.5mtpa. The company targets to double capacity at the plant to 3mt in the coming year.
Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, CEO, Vedanta, said: “New production records were set this year, a new Zinc mine with huge potential being commissioned, efficiencies to mitigate cost pressures, growth projects being on track and increasing our mineral and oil resources. Looking ahead, FY2020 will be an exciting year of growth in our key businesses – Zinc-Lead-Silver, Oil & Gas and Aluminium, being pursued with a strict capital allocation framework.""
Sterlite Copper, a unit of billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta group runs a 400,000 tonne-capacity copper plant in Thoothukudi. The company’s plans to expand capacity at the plant attracted criticism in May when local protests broke out against the plant’s alleged pollution of local water and land resources. Eleven protestors were shot and killed by the police. On 28 May, the Tamil Nadu government ordered the plant be closed permanently. The shutdown is being contested in court. Venkatakrishnan said in a call with journalists that Vedanta is optimistic that the smelter will be reopened during FY20."
47,2019-05-12,Vedanta,"Part of stock’s fall can be attributed to the subdued guidance on production and concerns about earnings growthLower-than-expected volume guidance for the zinc, and oil and gas businesses came as a setback as well

Evaluating a conglomerate’s performance is tricky as it is. In the case of Vedanta Ltd, which consists of several commodity businesses, things have become even more complicated for investors lately, thanks to the company’s large investment in a promoter group firm. The stock has lost 21% since January, when Vedanta announced the investment plan.
Despite this dull backdrop, the company’s operating profit for the March quarter increased 6% sequentially and exceeded analysts’ estimates. The earnings beat was driven by higher volumes and reduction in costs. Production cost at the aluminium business dropped 12% sequentially.
Still, the Vedanta stock has lost 7.4% since it announced the March quarter results—more than the 3.7% fall in the Nifty Metal index.
Part of the fall can be attributed to the company’s subdued guidance on production and concerns about earnings growth. Headwinds to the global economy and moderate demand conditions are weighing on metal prices. Aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange dropped 4.5% last month. The aluminium business generates close to one-third (32%) of Vedanta’s revenues.
Lower-than-expected volume guidance for the zinc, and oil and gas businesses came as a setback as well. “Management’s volume guidance for FY20E was lower than our expectations for the two key growth divisions, i.e., Zinc International and oil division. Guidance of 360,000 tonnes at Zinc International and 210 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day at oil division in FY20E leads to a 4-5% cut in our estimates,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities research said in a note.
“A gradual ramp-up at the Gamsberg mine and delays in project awarding at the oil division is leading to slower than anticipated volume growth,"" they added.
As pointed out earlier, the company’s plan to invest $500 million in Anglo American Plc, which is controlled by a promoter group firm, has led to concerns among investors. Vedanta has paid $270 million, with the balance expected to be paid in the coming quarters. It is a structured investment, wherein Vedanta will only have economic interest with ownership lying with Volcan Investments Ltd, the promoter firm.
The management defended the decision citing downside protection, even as investors have continued to struggle to understand the rationale behind the investment.
According to SBICAP Securities Ltd, Vedanta will receive the money back once the instrument unwinds in two tranches in April and October 2020. Even then, funding an external investment when the company’s own divisions are seeing capital expenditure is difficult to fathom.
“Although this transaction appears at an arm’s length, the counter-party risk is high because the parent drives its value from Vedanta itself and is highly leveraged. Investors are concerned about future capital allocation,"" Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd said in a note."

The block they bid for possibly is the one which BP had demarcated during the expression of interest (EoI) stage.
India had in July 2017 allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice with a view to bringing about 2.8 million sq km of unexplored area in the country under exploration.
Under this policy, called open acreage licensing policy or OALP, companies are allowed to put in an EoI for prospecting of oil and gas in any area that is presently not under any production or exploration licence. The EoIs can be put in at any time of the year but they are accumulated twice annually.
The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area getting a 5-mark advantage.
The two window of accumulating EoIs end on May 15 and November 15 every year. EoIs accumulated till May 15 are supposed to be put on auction by June 30 and those in the second window by December 31.
Sources said EoIs accumulated till May 15, 2018 were offered in OALP-II and those that came in by November 15, 2018 in OALP-III. The two rounds ran concurrently.
The government had in January offered 14 blocks in OALP-II bid round and a month later offered another 23 oil and gas blocks and CBM blocks in third round.
Bids for the 14 blocks offered in OALP-II bid round, covering an area of 29,333 square kilometers, were to close on March 12 but the deadline was extended to April 10 and then again to May 15, according to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbon (DGH).
April 10 was also the bid deadline for the 23 oil and gas and CBM blocks offered in the third round, which was launched on February 10. Its bid deadline too was extended to May 15.
OALP-II bid round was delayed by six months and its launch came barely a month before the third round.
Sources said OALP-II and OALP-III ran concurrently.
Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had at the time of launch of OALP-II bid round on January 7 stated that an investment of about  ₹40,000 crore is expected in the prospecting of oil and gas in blocks offered.
In the first round of OALP last year, as much as  ₹60,000 crore was committed in the exploration of oil and gas in 55 blocks or areas.
In the third round, the government is expecting up to $700 million (about  ₹49,000 crore) of investment that it hopes will help raise domestic output and cut imports.
The first OALP round was launched in 2017 and bids came in by May 2018. EoIs for second round closed on May 15, 2018, and the blocks were supposed to be put for auction by June but the round was delayed for unknown reasons. OALP-II was finally launched on January 7.
In the meanwhile, EoIs in the third window also closed on November 15, 2018 with as many as 18 blocks and five CBM blocks, measuring 31,722 sq km, being sought for. OALP-III bid round was launched on February 10 with April 10 as the last date for bidding.
Officials said the 14 blocks in OALP-II are estimated to hold in-place resource of 12,609 million tonne oil and oil equivalent gas.
In OALP-1, mining mogul Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta walked away with 41 out of 55 blocks bid out. State-owned Oil India won nine blocks while ONGC managed to win just two.
The 55 blocks have a total area of 59,282 sq km. This compares to about 1,02,000 sq km being under exploration prior to OALP.
Blocks are awarded to the company which offers the highest share of oil and gas to the government as well as commits to do maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic survey and drilling exploration wells.
Increased exploration will lead to more oil and gas production, helping the world's third largest oil importer to cut import dependence.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of cutting oil import bill by 10% to 67% by 2022 and to half by 2030.
Import dependence has increased since 2015 when Modi had set the target. India imports nearly 84 per cent of its oil needs.
The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from production sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue-sharing model, where companies offering the maximum share of oil and gas to the government are awarded the block.

Eurasian Resources Group and China Non-Ferrous Metals Co. expressed interest in buying Konkola Copper Mines, should the Zambian government succeed in seizing it from Vedanta Resources Ltd, people familiar with the situation said.
Eurasian Resources, owned by three Kazakh billionaires, approached the government about two months ago, according to the people, who declined to be identified by name. CNMC also wanted to buy the assets, they said. The Chinese company offered to spend $2.5 billion on development, one person said.
At stake are copper mines and resources in one of the world’s richest deposits, which stretches from Zambia’s Copperbelt region into southern Democratic Republic of Congo. Zambia, cash-strapped and struggling to contain debt, says that Vedanta hasn’t met its investment promises and paid too little tax, while the company says it is a “loyal investor"" that’s spent more than $3 billion in the country since 2004.
Eurasian Resources and CNMC declined to comment. Richard Musukwa, Zambia’s mines minister, wouldn’t immediately comment.
“KCM isn’t for sale from our perspective,"" a spokesperson for Vedanta said by email. “While we remain open to dialog with the Zambian government, we will consider all options to preserve our legal rights.""
State-owned ZCCM Investments Holdings, which owns 20.6% of KCM, asked the Lusaka High Court on 20 May to liquidate the company because it hasn’t met the conditions of its license.
The case, which is being challenged by Vedanta, was postponed to 4 June.
Vedanta, majority owned by Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal, says the deposits could be mined for another 50 years. The company valued the assets at $1.6 billion in its last annual report. Agarwal, in a “personal message"" published in the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper today, said the attempted liquidation of KCM “can only hurt the country’s hard-earned democracy and investor-friendly status.""
KCM’s flagship operation is Konkola Deep, which extends almost a mile underground and is one of the world’s wettest mines, with 140 Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of water having to be pumped to the surface daily. The ore bodies also contain cobalt, a prized metal that’s used in rechargeable batteries that power mobile phones and electric cars.
Both Eurasian Resources and CNMC already have copper assets in Zambia and Congo."
42,2019-06-09,Vedanta,"As per the bid evaluation, ONGC and Vedanta are top bidders in nine blocks eachThe winners of the auction will be announced after the approval of the CCEA headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi

New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and mining billionaire Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd are set to win nine oil and gas blocks each in the latest auction while Reliance Industries and its British partner BP Plc is set to retain a block that contains gas discoveries they had previously made.
Sources said the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) has completed the evaluation of the bids received for 32 oil and gas exploration blocks that were auctioned in the latest licensing round.
As per the bid evaluation, ONGC and Vedanta Ltd are top bidders in nine blocks each and state-owned Oil India Ltd (OIL) in 12 areas.
Reliance-BP combine outbid ONGC in one Krishna Godavari basin block in the Bay of Bengal.
The winners of the auction will be announced after the approval of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sources added.
Bidding for 14 blocks on offer in the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) round-II and another 18 oil and gas blocks and five coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks on offer in OALP-III closed on 15 May.
Reliance-BP had made their first bid in eight years when they sought an area that contained natural gas discoveries they had previously made, sources said.
The partners had to relinquish more than half of their eastern offshore KG-D6 area in 2013 after failing to meet government timelines. The area given away contained three-four natural gas discoveries.
So, when the government in July 2017 allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice with a view to bring about 2.8 million sq km of unexplored area in the country under exploration, Reliance-BP sought the KG area containing the discoveries.
Under the new policy, areas sought by any company are put on auction with the initiator or the company that originally carved out the block, getting a 5 point advantage.
Sources said Reliance-BP managed to get the coveted KG block in the latest auction by a small margin that possibly came from the originator marks and a commitment to do a shale core exploration.
Reliance-BP had last jointly bid for a KG deep water block in the 8th bid round under previous licensing policy in 2008. They, however, gave up the block after not finding any commercially exploitable oil and gas reserves.
In the following year, Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance on its own bid for six blocks in the ninth round of New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) but did not win any block.
Sources said at the close of bidding for the current round on 15 May, ONGC had put in bids for 20 out of the 32 blocks on offer, while OIL made bids for 16 blocks.
Vedanta, which had walked away with 41 out of the 55 blocks offered in OALP-I last year, bid for 30 areas.
Indian Oil Corp (IOC), GAIL (India) and SunPetro bid for two blocks each, they said.
BP had more than a decade back entered the country buying 30% stake in Reliance's 21 oil and gas exploration blocks for USD 7.2 billion. All but a couple of blocks have since been relinquished.
NELP has since been replaced by Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy (HELP) under which OALP bids round have been held.
Under the new policy, called open acreage licensing policy, companies are allowed to put in an expression of interest or EoI for prospecting of oil and gas in any area that is presently not under any production or exploration licence.
The EoIs can be put in at any time of the year but they are accumulated twice annually.
The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area getting a 5-mark advantage.
The two windows of accumulating EoIs end on May 15 and November 15 every year. EoIs accumulated till 15 May are supposed to be put on auction by June 30 and those in the second window by 31 December.
But a delay in offering of blocks meant that OALP-II and OALP-III ran concurrently.
While the OALP-I round saw an investment commitment of about  ₹60,000 crore, the government is expecting about 90,000 crore of investment in the latest round.
In OALP-1, Vedanta walked away with 41 out of 55 blocks bid out. Oil India won nine blocks while ONGC managed to win just two.
Blocks are awarded to the company which offers the highest share of oil and gas to the government as well as commits to do maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic survey and drilling exploration wells.
The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from production sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue-sharing model, where companies offering the maximum share of oil and gas to the government are awarded the block.

41,2019-06-11,Vedanta,"Vedanta Resources, part-owner of the Mumbai-listed Vedanta group of companies, is KCM's majority shareholderThe Zambian government says KCM has breached the terms of its licence

LUSAKA: Vedanta Resources on Tuesday plans to challenge the appointment of a provisional liquidator and the intended winding up of its Zambian business without the chance to be heard through lawyers of its choice, documents filed in court show.
According to a notice filed in court on June 6, Vedanta wants to be represented by lawyers Nchito & Nchito and not those appointed by the provisional liquidator.
A court hearing following Zambia's decision to name the provisional liquidator to run Vedanta's Konkola Copper Mines (KCM) business was adjourned until Tuesday without tackling the company's demands to be involved, Vedanta said last week.
Vedanta Resources, part-owner of the Mumbai-listed Vedanta group of companies, is KCM's majority shareholder, while Zambian state mining company ZCCM-IH holds a stake of about 20%.
Vedanta wants the court to determine ""whether a confirmation of the provisional liquidator and the compulsory liquidation can be conducted without the company or its directors being heard through lawyers of their choice,"" the notice reads.
Vedanta also wants the court to determine whether the lawyers appointed by the provisional liquidator on its behalf can appear in court to represent it.
""It is illogical to expect that lawyers appointed by the provisional liquidator can oppose his appointment and present an independent case in opposition of the liquidation,"" it says.
Zambia's decision to name a provisional liquidator to run KCM, one of the country's biggest employers, has unnerved international miners concerned about rising resource nationalism in Zambia and neighbouring countries.
The Zambian government says KCM has breached the terms of its licence.

40,2019-06-16,Vedanta,"Agarwal added that the stoppage of production at the Tuticorin plant of the firm's unit Sterlite led to the country having to import copperThe Tamil Nadu government had in May last year ordered permanent shutdown of the copper smelter after bloody protests at the plant in Thoothukudi

NEW DELHI :
Vedanta Ltd has lost about $200 million in profits ever since its copper smelter plant in Tamil Nadu was shut more than a year back after police fired on protesters and killed 13 people, Group Chairman Anil Agarwal said.
Agarwal added that the stoppage of production at the Tuticorin plant of the firm's unit Sterlite led to the country having to import copper, spending precious foreign exchange.
""We have lost about USD 200 million in bottomline (profits),"" he told PTI in an interview. ""Forget about bottomline. How can you stop production and start importing? After all, what we did at Tuticorin was import substitution.""
The Tamil Nadu government had in May last year ordered permanent shutdown of the copper smelter after bloody protests at the plant in Thoothukudi culminated in police opening fire on demonstrators.
Vedanta wants the plant to be reopened, pointing to the economic pressures from the closure. As many as 20,000 direct and indirect jobs have been lost due to the shutting of the smelter and about 98,400 more were affected in the consumer or downstream industries.
""It is a bread and butter issue for Tuticorin,"" he said. ""What happened (in police firing) was very unfortunate and our thoughts and sympathies are with the victims. But what is now happening is equally unfortunate.""
The Vedanta plant in the Thoothukudi district produced about 40 per cent of India's copper output.
The company had announced a plan to expand capacity, leading to protests on concerns about pollution. Vedanta denies that the factory has been a polluter.
He sought to draw a parallel between Tuticorin and Singur in West Bengal which was abandoned by Tata Motors in 2008 after protests over its Nano car factory.
""Nobody can (afford to) make another Singur,"" he said without elaborating.
In 2008, Tata Motors abandoned plans to build a factory to make the world's cheapest car after protests led by politicians over land acquisition. That pullout was said to have deterred many manufacturers from investing in new plants in the state.
Tamil Nadu, one of the most industrialised states in India, is home to factories of companies like Hyundai Motor and Caterpillar. But it has in recent months seen a decline in foreign investment, leading to concerns about job creation.
""I have been saying and will repeat again - the world does not want us to produce. World wants us to import,"" he said, adding the shutting down of Tuticorin plant has led to India importing copper.
Agarwal hoped that a solution will be found soon.
According to Vedanta Ltd's latest annual report, the Tuticorin copper smelter, operated by its Sterlite Copper business, ranks as one of the largest custom copper smelters in India.
With a design capacity of 400,000 tonnes, the business held 33 per cent market share of the country's refined copper demand of around 675,000 tonnes in FY2018, it said.
The company challenged the closure order through an appeal before the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which in December 2018 ruled that the Tamil Nadu government's order was ""nonsustainable"" and ""unjustified"".
However, in February 2019, the Supreme Court set aside the NGT's order on the grounds of maintainability and directed Vedanta to file a writ petition before the Madras High Court.
The company has filed a petition in the high court and ""the matter is likely to come up after the summer vacation break,"" Agarwal said.
Vedanta Ltd in its annual report for 2018-19 said: ""India faced a crunch in the availability of refined copper due to Vedanta's Tuticorin smelter closure. Chinese smelter output increased by 4.2 per cent in 2018, despite the closure of some smelters for maintenance during Q4.""
Refined copper consumption in India grew by 2.9 per cent in 2018 while demand in China, the largest consumer of copper, increased by 4.9 per cent, it said.
Refined copper is predominantly used in manufacturing cables, transformers and motors as well as castings and alloy-based products.
""In the coming year, copper consumption in India and China is expected to increase by 11.8 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively. This rise is driven by population growth, urbanisation, the rise of the middle class and the evolution of electric vehicles (EVs),"" it said.
On the supply side, there could be further disruptions in copper production due to the smelter upgrades in Chile following the introduction of new environmental regulations.
""Our ability to take advantage of these opportunities is largely dependent on the re-opening of our smelter at Tuticorin,"" it said.
Data from the International Copper Study Group showed refined output and demand growth estimates for 2019 indicating a market deficit of 280-kilo tonnes, it added.

NEW DELHI :
Vedanta Monday said its first pilot floating solar plant will be completed in the next two to three months.
In an investor brief, the company said it is focussing on renewable energy and its group firm Hindustan Zinc plans its ""first pilot floating solar to be completed in next 2-3 months"".
Vikram Solar, module manufacturer and rooftop solar and EPC solutions provider, had earlier in the year announced that it bagged the project order for a 1-MW floating solar plant for Hindustan Zinc Ltd, a Vedanta Group firm.
The plant will be located at Ghosunda Dam, near Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, it said.
The floating plant, Vikram Solar said, will contribute to saving water evaporation loss, thus resulting in conservation of water, reduce the development of algae, maintaining cleanliness of the water and will obviously save land space.
The solar plant is expected to have an energy yield of 1,993 MWh a year and will be able to power 1,400 houses a year.
Vedanta Ltd in the investor brief said Talwandi Sabo Power Ltd (TSPL), its wholly-owned arm, has achieved record plant availability of 97 per cent in April.

Moody's Investors Service Tuesday said the credit profile of Vedanta Resources Ltd could weaken if there is further flow of resources to its parent company Volcan Investments.
Moody's Investors Service said in a report said that Vedanta Resources' investment in December 2018, in a structured product issued by its parent, Volcan Investments Ltd, indicates a willingness to deploy funds to its parent that, if repeated, could weaken its credit profile.
""This willingness to deploy funds and Volcan's probable cash-flow shortfall by March 2020, support Moody's expectation that Volcan will likely tap on Vedanta's liquidity again when needed,"" it said.
The $561 million investment by Vedanta's wholly owned subsidiary, Cairn India Holdings Limited, resulted in Moody's changing its outlook on Vedanta's ratings to negative in February.
Vedanta Resources Limited currently has a Ba3 negative rating.
""We assess Vedanta's credit profile on a standalone basis without influence from its parent, but in light of the investment, Vedanta's separation from Volcan could become blurred,"" says Kaustubh Chaubal, a Moody's Vice President and Senior Credit Officer.
Volcan has a $900 million loan repayable over the next three years, and if this repayment responsibility falls to Vedanta, Moody's expects its liquidity to weaken.
""The transaction was not what we typically expect of high-profile Ba-rated issuers such as Vedanta, and further similar transactions could cause us to review Vedanta's governance and pressure its Ba3 rating,"" says Chaubal.
Moody's noted that ""the high-yield lite covenant package for its outstanding USD 4.2 billion bonds does not restrict similar related party investments in the future, exposing Vedanta's creditors to significant cash leakage risk"".
The company's cash holdings of $5.7 billion as of March 31, 2019 and the headroom under its debt incurrence covenant also reflect its capacity for further related party investments, if required by Volcan, it added.

PANAJI :
After mining operations in Goa came to a standstill in March 2018, the companies have come under intense pressure and are offering various financial options to their employees, including VRS, industry body GMOEA has said.
""Between 2012-2015, majority of the companies gave no lay offs. I mean it was very minimum. And the pressure from last year is building on day to day basis that companies are offering financial options to their employees to either take VRS or settlement,"" Goa Mineral Ore Exporters' Association (GMOEA) President Ambar Timblo told reporters here.
The mining sector has been defunct in Goa since March last year following a Supreme Court order quashing 88 mining leases.
Replying to a question Timblo said that in case of layoffs, the direct or confirmed employees of the mining companies will come in the last round.
Big mining companies like Vedanta would be the last one to do layoffs, he added.
He also said that the first round of layoffs will affect labourers that come into Goa from outside.
Vedanta - a leading iron ore miner is Goa - has asked a chunk of its employees in the iron ore business of the state to sit at home in the absence of any work, as per an industry source said.
""We have a total strength of direct employees of around 1,500 people for this (iron ore business)....Lion share of these people are sitting at home,"" the source said.

35,2019-06-23,Vedanta,"Vedanta Resources chairman says privatisation without job loss can help boost the economy by bringing in efficiency and raising domestic outputAgarwal says India's import bill of $400 billion will soon be $1 trillion if it does not ramp up production of oil and gas, minerals and metals such as gold

NEW DELHI :
Anil Agarwal, the scrap metal dealer turned billionaire metals tycoon, has told Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the Centre should privatise five mining firms including NMDC to save some of the $400 billion that India spends annually on imports, saying the government has no business to be in the business.
The Vedanta Resources chairman, who was one of the three industrialists invited for a pre-Budget meeting that Modi had with over 40 economists and sectoral experts Saturday, also said privatisation without job loss can help boost the economy by bringing in efficiency and raising domestic output.
The other two corporate honchos invited to the interaction were Tata Group Chairman N. Chandrasekaran, who gave recommendations on manufacturing and services sectors, and ITC Chairman Sanjiv Puri, who spoke on value addition in the economy.
Agarwal gave suggestions on mining and natural resources.
""I was honoured to be part of the interaction organised by Niti Aayog on Saturday and in my humble submission I told the Prime Minister that the government has no business to be in the business. It should divest its stake in at least five PSUs such as Hindustan Zinc, Hindustan Copper, Kolar Gold, Uranium Corporation, Shipping Corporation of India and NMDC,"" he told PTI in an interview.
Privatisation without job loss is good, he said.
""When we bought majority stake in Hindustan Zinc Ltd, it had 5,000 employees. Today it has 25,000 employees,"" he added.
Vedanta had acquired 64.9% government stake in Hindustan Zinc Ltd (HZL) during 2002-2003. The government continues to hold 29.5% stake in HZL, which the company wants to buy.
Agarwal said India's import bill of $400 billion will soon be $1 trillion if it does not ramp up production of oil and gas, minerals and metals such as gold.
""If we can double the oil production and raise gold output to 300 tonnes, the entire current account deficit (CAD) will be wiped out,"" he said.
His other suggestions included giving autonomy to public sector companies and banks by bringing down government holding to 50 per cent and making them board-run just like Petronet LNG Ltd, the nation's biggest natural gas importer.
Mining in 200 blocks should be approved immediately and big blocks of coal, bauxite, copper and iron ore should be auctioned, he said, adding there should be no production cap such as ones existing in Goa and Karnataka on iron ore.
Increased mining can add $500 billion to the economy and create two crore jobs, he emphasised.
Existing oil block contracts should be extended on the same terms and no retrospective tax should be imposed. Also, all forest and environment clearances should come in 60 days and corporate tax should be reduced to 20% from current 30 per cent, Agarwal said.
Natural resources and electronics hold massive potential to create jobs, he said, adding India should focus on sustainable exploitation of underground resources.
Agarwal, the founder and majority-owner of Vedanta Resources, said the government should make public sector companies and banks independent by making them board-run just like British Airways and GE.
""All PSUs and PSBs can perform three times better if autonomy is given to them,"" he said. ""PSUs have huge potential and immense talent pool. But the executives are afraid to take decisions because of fear of inquiries. They should be empowered to take decisions."" Agarwal, whose journey from scrap metal dealer to metals tycoon started in 1979 when he bought a company, said the government should trust entrepreneurs and support their spirit to boost the economy and create jobs.
Characterised by rapid growth and bold deal-making, Agarwal is one of India's most prominent self-made industrialists with his group having interests in sectors ranging from iron ore and copper to oil and gas, with operations across Australia and Zambia, as well as his home country.
In the meeting on Saturday, experts shared their views, in five distinct groups, on the themes of macro-economy and employment, agriculture and water resources, exports, education, and health.
The meeting came in the backdrop of India's economic growth slowing to a five-year low on a dip in industrial and manufacturing output numbers, falling automobiles sales and reduced domestic oil consumption.
Agrarian crisis and unemployment are some other challenges that the government is widely expected to confront through policy initiatives in the Budget to be presented on July 5."

NEW DELHI :
Vedanta Ltd on Wednesday said it will invest $245 million for finding oil and natural gas over the next 3-4 years in the 10 areas it won in the latest licensing round.
The firm won 10 blocks - 7 onshore and 3 offshore, in the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) Round-II and III, winners of which were announced on Tuesday.
Vedanta had won 41 out of the 55 blocks in OALP-1 bid round and committed to invest $551 million.
""Vedanta Ltd has been successfully awarded 10 exploration blocks in sedimentary basins throughout India pursuant to the OALP at a total bid cost of USD 245 million,"" the firm said in a statement.
The company will enter into 10 revenue sharing contracts (RSCs) with the government.
""Following the signing of the RSCs, a licence permitting exploration, development and production operations of all types of hydrocarbons will be granted pursuant to the terms of the relevant RSC in relation to each Block,"" it said.
The exploration period shall consist of two phases -- the initial exploration phase and the subsequent exploration phase. In total, the exploration period will be a duration of six years for all Blocks, subject to any extension granted.
The development and production period of each contract will be a maximum of 20 years from the date of grant of the petroleum mining lease following discovery of previously unknown deposits of hydrocarbons and approval of the relevant field development plan, subject to any extension granted.
""The group believes that the transaction complements its existing strategy to focus on production growth. These blocks awarded under OALP bid round II & III, complement the 41 blocks secured in OALP bid round I. The OALP bid rounds provide an opportunity for the Group to acquire new acreages from additional sedimentary basins of India and utilize synergies from the Blocks already secured,"" the statement said.
The objective of licensing the Blocks is to acquire fresh seismic data and drill exploration wells to establish resources and reserves of oil and/or gas.
""The bid cost of $245 million represents the company's total committed capital expenditure on the Blocks during the exploration phase and will be met by using the Group's existing cash resources. It is expected that this capital expenditure will occur over a period of approximately three to four years,"" it said."
32,2019-07-08,Vedanta,"We hope govt will take steps to safeguard local industries such as aluminium, copper, iron ore

The Union Budget 2019 delivered by India’s first full-time woman finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman promises to be an all-round budget with a focus on rural as well as urban India. The budget not only aims at economic growth but also focuses on modernizing the country, developing infrastructure, providing the appropriate platforms for the youth and making things more convenient for the common citizens of our country.
The steps planned to ensure a hassle-free experience for foreign portfolio investors will create a well-founded platform to encourage more foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country and create a more conducive environment for foreign players looking to invest in our country.
Schemes such as Har Ghar Jal, Housing for All, Swachh Bharat Mission for solid waste management in every village and providing electricity connection with clean cooking facility by 2022 will not only help in developing rural India but also go a long way in alleviating poverty from our country, which has been a constant problem for decades now.
The fact that the government plans to bring in a new national education policy to transform India’s higher education system to one of the best education systems in the world, is a welcome initiative that has been long overdue. The youth of our country urgently need guidance and appropriate platforms to help them explore unconventional career opportunities.
Job creation has been an issue and the government has realized the need to look beyond traditional avenues of employment. Our country has an enormous potential for tourism and the government’s plans to develop 17 iconic tourist sites into world class tourist destinations, is a brilliant move. These iconic sites would enhance visitor experience, leading to an increase in domestic and international tourist visits. This will ultimately lead to a boost in employment opportunities.
Our country, by tradition, has been an agrarian economy and our farmers need to be protected. The government’s intent of going back to “zero budget farming"" and setting up of new farmer producer organizations will help ease the highly stressed farming sector. The ease of doing business and ease of living for farmers are laudable initiatives, and should be taken further.
With an equal focus on urban India, the budget also aims at boosting infrastructure by increasing the connectivity of roads, water, air and railways.
The government also plans to create gas grids, water grids, i-ways and regional airports, which are urgently needed to boost trade and transport within the country.
Climate change continues to pose a huge risk to the planet. The budget has looked upon this aspect as well, by giving a boost to electric vehicles (EVs) with lower goods and services tax (GST) and tax incentives for purchase of EVs. The government’s aim to make the country a global hub of manufacturing of EVs is commendable. Increase in custom duty on gold and other precious metals from 10% to 12.5% is a step in the right direction to curb imports. We are hopeful that similar steps will also be taken to safeguard domestic industries such as aluminium, copper, iron ore and coal by raising import duties or correcting the inverted duty structure. The government also needs to focus more on under-the-ground exploration, not only to drive self-sufficiency and cut dependence on imports but also to propel the Indian economy towards the $10 trillion mark.
All in all, this has been a well-balanced, pragmatic and result-oriented budget with an aim to take our economy to $5 trillion in the next few years.

Bengaluru: Financial technology solutions provider MonetaGo said on Thursday it had digitally issued a commercial paper (CP) for the first time in Asia using blockchain technology. It had tied-up with YES Bank and issuer Vedanta, a natural resources conglomerate, for the same.
India’s highly-regulated commercial paper (CP) market involves huge amount of paperwork to be prepared by the issuer for every transaction. The transaction was delivered using Corda Enterprise technology from R3, along with a robust set of standardized workflows to deliver a solution that will rapidly scale across markets and geographies, MonetaGo said in a statement.
MonetaGo moved to Corda Enterprise this February, joining R3’s growing ecosystem of over 300 diverse companies utilising Corda to build applications for a range of uses across different industries.
According to Asit Oberoi, senior group president and chief experience officer of YES Bank, ""Apart from reducing operational risk and costs, this technology solution lays the foundation for a more transparent and efficient process to cater to India’s growing Commercial Paper market."" G.R. Arun Kumar, Group CFO of Vedanta, noted that his company will benefit from the digitized and simplified workflow, ""which shortens the laborious process running into hours to just few minutes and complete transparency that this platform offers to all stakeholders"".
Jesse Chenard, CEO of MonetaGo, believes ""these (companies like YES Bank) are big corporations with the ability to move like start-ups, something very rare indeed especially when dealing with a market this size"".
It was in November 2018 that in a first for India, HSBC Holdings Plc executed a trade finance transaction using blockchain for an export by Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) to US-based Tricon Energy. The blockchain-enabled letter of credit (LC) transaction substantially reduced the time taken for such deals (from 7-10 days to just a day), RIL had then said in a press release. The transaction allowed a digital transfer of the title of goods from the seller to the buyer. The LC was issued by ING Bank for Tricon Energy USA (importer) with HSBC India as the advising and negotiating bank for RIL.
Reliance said at present, buyers and sellers use paper-based letter of credits to underpin transactions and physical documents are sent to each party in the transaction by post, courier or fax. While the current system provides a high level of certainty, the time and cost involved in processing the documents are deterrents for exporters.
A blockchain network can either be public (permissionless) or private (permissioned), based on who is authorised to participate. One may liken it to the difference between an intranet and the internet. In India, though, most pilots are being done with private blockchains. Moreover, while the Indian government remains skeptical about crytocurrencies like bitcoin (and now Facebook's Libra), it is clearly bullish on blockchain as these instances will reveal."
31,2019-07-11,Vedanta,"Firm eyes up to 70% growth in revenue, plans  ₹55,000 crore capex in 3 yearsOF this,  ₹25,000 cr is in base metals,  ₹20,000 cr in oil and gas, and  ₹10,000 cr in aluminium

MUMBAI :
Natural resources conglomerate Vedanta Ltd will invest nearly half of its three-year capital expenditure plan of  ₹55,000 crore in its metals business, chairman Navin Agarwal said, undaunted by the decline in their prices over the past year.
According to Agarwal, in a world looking to India as its next growth engine, there is immense demand potential for the company’s products.
Prices of base metals have declined in the last fiscal year. Copper prices fell 2.89%, aluminium 4.72%, lead 16.41% and zinc 8.66%. Vedanta, however, has had “a strong year of performance"", Agarwal said at the company’s 54th annual general meeting in Mumbai on Thursday.
“We are in a sweet spot. We have a capex programme of  ₹55,000 crore in the next three years. Of this,  ₹25,000 crore is in base metals, primarily in zinc, another  ₹20,000 crore in oil and gas, and  ₹10,000 crore in aluminium,"" Agarwal said. “As we complete this, we expect our revenue to grow 60-70% across businesses and at least 50% in volumes. The capex will be almost entirely funded from internal accruals."" During FY19, the company spent  ₹10,000 crore on capex.
Vedanta, India’s biggest aluminium producer, plans to raise production by 50% to up to three million tonnes of integrated aluminium. It also aspires to become the world’s top zinc producer and among the top three silver producers.
“Vedanta’s capital allocation policy is decided based on very conservative estimates of base metal prices and the minimum hurdle rate for internal rate of return is 20%. The company is focusing on reducing its cost of production,"" Agarwal said. “Looking ahead, we are excited by the prospects in our businesses which include: ramp-up in zinc, lead and especially silver production from Hindustan Zinc and the benefit of a full year’s production from our Gamsberg Zinc mine in South Africa; increased production from our oil and gas business as the first phase of our projects comes on stream, and continued structural changes to our cost structure in the aluminium business while increasing volumes,"" Agarwal said.
Vedanta expects that the Union budget’s target of investing  ₹100 trillion in infrastructure over the next five years will aid urbanization and industrialization, with significant demand for natural resources. In 2018-19, Vedanta posted revenue of  ₹93,373 crore with an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin of 31% at  ₹24,961 crore. Free cash flow increased 47% to  ₹11,553 crore.
“As against a global economic growth at a steady 3%, our country’s gross domestic product is estimated to grow by 7.3% in 2019 and 7.5% in 2020, making us one of the few large emerging economies. The world is looking at India to play the role of the lead growth engine, a role China played for almost three decades. The demand potential for our resources such as oil and gas, zinc-lead, silver, aluminium, iron ore and steel, and copper is immense. Your company will be instrumental in addressing the growing demand in India and the region,"" said Agarwal.
kalpana.p@livemint.com
India currently has a resources import bill of $465 billion. Agarwal said India’s geology is similar to that of Brazil, Australia and South Africa, where the natural resources sector contributes 8-10% of the gross domestic product (GDP). In India, the corresponding figure is around 4%.
At present, India imports around 80% of its oil & gas requirements amounting to $150 billion. As India’s largest private oil and gas producer, Agarwal said, Vedanta aims to double its current contribution of 27% of nation’s production. Currently, Vedanta is also the largest private acreage holder in the country with the acquisition of 53 new blocks under the new licensing policy. The company is investing around $3 billion for an expansion programme in Rajasthan’s Barmer block, largely focused on increasing recoveries.
Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, CEO, Vedanta Resources said the company will see an uptick in oil output this year. “Last year, it went up by 2%. This year, we are guiding between 200,000-220,000 barrels of oil and gas per day. And that will stretch to 450,000 barrels per day with our existing concessions in the Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwarya fields. That’s a 7-8% growth this year. The 450,000 barrels target will be reached progressively from onshore, offshore and oil and gas,"" said Venkatakrishnan.
The company plans to re-open the Thoothukudi copper smelter in Tamil Nadu because, Agarwal said, it’s much-needed for the local economy. The plant which generated about $200-250 million in profit was shut more than a year back after police firing on protesters killed 13 people.
Commenting on Vedanta’s share prices falling by 33% in one year, Agarwal said, “We are focusing on our performance, which is in our hands."" Vedanta shares closed at  ₹163.70 on the BSE on Thursday, up 2.31% ."

Indian markets are expected to be wobbly today, bogged down by weak corporate earnings by key companies like Tata Motors. Asian shares opened a tad lower today on mixed US earnings reports and the euro held above two-year lows struck overnight after the European Central Bank held interest rates steady, though officials said a cut was certain in September.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.15% while Japan's Nikkei dipped 0.3%.
Wall Street shares fell from record highs on Thursday, with the S&P 500 losing 0.53%, following a flurry of downbeat quarterly results from Ford Motor and other companies.
Back home, shares of Tata Motors Ltd are likely to be in focus on Friday as it has nearly doubled its consolidated net loss in the June quarter, weighed down by woes at its Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) unit and a slowdown in the automobile industry in India. It posted a net loss of  ₹3,680 crore in the three months ended 30 June, compared with a year-earlier loss of  ₹1,863 crore. Consolidated revenue from operations fell 8% year-on-year (y-o-y) and 29% sequentially to  ₹60,830 crore.
TPG Capital’s Indian private equity arm and buyout firm Advent International Corp. are among institutional investors that will infuse fresh capital into Yes Bank Ltd, according to a Mint report.
Key companies which are going to announce June quarter earnings today are Maruti Suzuki India, Bajaj Auto, Punjab National Bank, Vedanta, JSW Steel, ABB India, Vodafone Idea, Bajaj Holdings and Mahindra Lifespace Developers.
Meanwhile, a rally in global bonds ran out of steam after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi cautioned about pulling the trigger too quickly even though he signaled another round of monetary easing.
The 10-year German government bond yield initially hit a record low of minus 0.463% but ended the day up slightly at minus 0.407 percent.
The U.S. 10-year Treasuries yield also rose 3 basis points to 2.079% on Thursday and traded at 2.107% in the following Asian session. Also helping to stem falls in bond yields, new orders for key US-made capital goods surged in June, suggesting some improvement in business investment.
In the currency market, the euro bounced back to at $1.11465 in Asian trade, after sinking to $1.1101 on Thursday, its lowest since May 2017. The yen was little changed against the dollar at 108.67 yen per dollar.
Oil prices held firm on rising tensions between the West and Iran and a big decline in US crude stockpiles, though gains were held in check by worries about slowing growth in major economies.

Mumbai: Cairn India Holdings Limited (CIHL), an overseas subsidiary of Vedanta Ltd, will exit its investments in Anglo American Plc, Vedanta said today.
In December 2018, Cairn India Holdings purchased an economic interest through a structured investment in equity shares of Anglo-American Plc, from Volcan Investments for a total consideration of  ₹3,812 crore. ""As of March 31, 2019, the transaction was positively marked to market by  ₹1,041 crore,"" Vedanta had said in its latest annual report.
This structure was to mature in parts in April 2020 and October 2020 but Cairn is exiting the same ahead of the originally envisaged schedule.
""With this, Volcan will exercise the early exchange option available to it on 26 July 2019 and consequent to this the full exchange of its two issues of mandatory exchangeable bonds secured by shares in Anglo American plc, will settle on 12 August 2019. The share price of Anglo American has close to doubled, since Volcan invested, delivering attractive gains to all investors,"" Vedanta said.
Vedanta said that the investment by CIHL, which was entered into as part of its cash management activities, has delivered a net gain of over $100 million in the eight-month period it was held. Cash proceeds from the settlement of the transaction will be paid to CIHL on 13 August 2019.
Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, CEO of Vedanta Ltd, said: “We are pleased this structured investment has achieved a superior return for CIHL, as we expected when it was entered into. Our strategy continues to be to focus on our existing businesses, where we believe that there are significant opportunities to unlock their full potential. The unwinding reflects our disciplined approach to treasury management and capital allocation together with our commitment at all times to act in the interests of all shareholders.""
Following the redemption of the structured instrument, completed with due Board approvals, CIHL will have no further economic exposure to Anglo American plc shares, added Vedanta.
India Ratings in May had flagged the issue of voting rights and the option to buy the underlying shares with Volcan in the deal that implied a risk of further “leveraging at the parent entities or a likely corporate event"".
Vedanta Ltd had said that it followed all prescribed procedures in undertaking the funding of parent Volcan’s acquisition of Anglo American Plc through a structured deal by its wholly-owned subsidiary Cairn India Holdings Ltd.

Mumbai: Mining major Vedanta Ltd on Friday posted 12% decline in consolidated profit at  ₹1,351 crore for the quarter ended 30 June, led by falling commodity prices. It had posted consolidated profit of  ₹1,533 crore in the year-ago period. During the quarter, consolidated income dropped to  ₹21,754 crore from  ₹22,624 crore in the year earlier.

25,2019-07-30,Vedanta,"Vedanta’s revenues in Q1 fell about 3.5% y-o-y to  ₹21,167 croreUnwinding of its Anglo stake in parent entity Vedanta Plc did little to cheer equity investors

Mumbai: Shares of Vedanta Ltd slipped 3.6% in early trade on Monday due to tepid first quarter performance that fell short of analysts’ expectation.
Vedanta’s revenues in the June quarter fell about 3.5% year-on-year to  ₹21,167 crore. Softer realisations in key product segments led to a lower growth in revenues.
Analysts expected a far better show on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) front. But this too disappointed. Ebitda fell 20% on year to  ₹5,188 crore in the first quarter.
Some of the disappointment on the Ebitda front has been due to lower production. For instance, oil production fell 11% y-o-y in the first quarter, with output declining in most of its oil fields. To top it, average realisations fell a marginal 1% y-o-y in US dollar per barrel.
A positive has been the significant fall in cost of aluminium production, thanks to higher coal linkage and utilisation of captive coal mines. Cost of production in the business was at $284 per tonne, the lowest in the last two years.
But much of this cost saving did not translate into better margins from this business as prices on the London Metal Exchange remained subdued.
Its steel business is also feeling the pinch of lower prices. Besides, some of its business is exposed to the spot market where weak prices hurt more. As a result, Ebitda margin in the steel business fell 14.75% year-on-year to $104 per tonne.
Unwinding of its Anglo stake in parent entity Vedanta Plc did little to cheer equity investors. The management assured its minority shareholders it will not undertake transactions in structured products where the underlying is equity and derivatives going forward. While this has removed the uncertainty, the market seems to remain unimpressed.
Global uncertainties could continue to keep commodity prices weak. “We believe that non-ferrous commodities outlook remains clouded with the US-China trade war,"" analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd said in a note to clients.
Much depends on whether the company can improve its operating performance and further cut costs in a low realisation environment."
24,2019-08-06,Vedanta,"Metal producers in India have taken a hit to their earningsVedanta plans to double alumina capacity at its refinery in the eastern state of Odisha

Mumbai: India’s biggest aluminum producer Vedanta Ltd. is prioritizing controlling costs as it embarks on expanding capacity, according to the chief executive officer.
“Any expansion plans, we will do it with the strictest capital discipline and balance sheet focus,"" according to Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, who was the CEO of Johannesburg-based AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. for five years before taking the helm at Vedanta in 2018. “We will control the purse strings quite tightly.""
Vedanta plans to double alumina capacity at its refinery in the eastern state of Odisha to 4 million tons over the next 2.5 years and raise aluminum smelter production capability by 30% to 3 million tons “at an all-in cost of less than $1,500 a ton,"" Venkatakrishnan said in an interview.
“Every business has to earn its right to spend the capital before we spend the capital ,"" he said. “Hence, we said let’s first drive the cost down before we actually go ahead with the expansion.""
Owned by billionaire Anil Agarwal, Vedanta plans to spend  ₹55,000 crore ($7.8 billion) to boost output across its businesses as it seeks to tap into the demand created by India’s ambitions of upgrading its infrastructure. Capital expenditure for the aluminum unit is estimated at $100 million in the year ending March, Venkatakrishnan said.
The company has been able to bring aluminum production expenses from $2,200 a ton last year to about $1,764 largely due to lower alumina prices and higher coal supply security, he said. “We are targeting coal security of around 90% of our requirement from around 72% now and that would see our cost come down.""
Metal producers in India have taken a hit to their earnings as consumption in the South Asian nation slows and companies face mounting strain from a liquidity crisis. That’s been compounded by the impact of the bitter and protracted the US-China trade war on commodities globally. Vedanta reported a slump in profit in the April-June quarter, while net income more than halved at India’s second-biggest steel mill, JSW Steel Ltd.
“I see the current slowdown as an opportunity,"" Venkatakrishnan said. “We will use this opportunity to pull the costs down even further, improve efficiencies and widen margins, so that when the prices start to rally, you can actually cream the extra benefit that comes in and apply a fat chunk of it for a larger purpose.""
The company produces not only aluminum, but also copper, zinc, iron ore, oil and gas, silver and steel. It directly contributed about 0.4% to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal 2017-18 through revenues from its operations, according to the Institute for Competitiveness.

22,2019-08-11,Vedanta,"The bankrupt airline has received expressions of interest (EoIs) from three interested partiesEtihad Airways PJSC, which owns a 24% stake in Jet Airways, is not among the bidders.

MUMBAI :
Lenders to grounded Jet Airways (India) Ltd have received expressions of interest (EoIs) from Anil Agarwal’s family trust, Panama-based fund Avantulo Group and a Russian firm, two people aware of the development said on the condition of anonymity.
The identity of the Russian firm couldn’t be ascertained.
“Volcan Investment, an investment company for Anil Agarwal, in an exploratory move, has sought an EoI for Jet Airways, to understand the business scenario for the company and the industry,"" the company said in a statement.
The bankrupt airline has received expressions of interest (EoIs) from three interested parties—two financial investors and a global company—Mint had reported earlier.
Etihad Airways PJSC, which owns a 24% stake in Jet Airways, is not among the bidders.
The EoIs are technically not bids, but they have helped lenders sense the level of interest in the airline. However, lenders are expecting these entities to put in bids, as the deadline was extended to accommodate EOIs from some of them.
Access to prime slots at key airports, a stake in a profitable frequent flyer programme and a few relatively old planes appear to be the only assets before potential bidders of grounded Jet Airways (India) Ltd.
“Jet’s only value at this point remains its slots at key airports like New Delhi and Mumbai, stake in its frequent flyer programme and a few old wide-bodies that it owns, though most of these planes are technically owned by the banks,"" said an executive of a rival domestic airline, who didn’t want to be named. Jet Airways, which was until a few months ago India’s second-largest airline, operated about 106 departure and arrival slots each daily at Mumbai. In New Delhi, it operated about 79 departure and arrival slots each daily.
Slots at the busy Mumbai and Delhi airports are considered highly valuable since they allow an airline to operate these trunk flights. Airlines submit their schedules to authorities before summer and winter seasons as per International Air Transport Association norms.
Slots are allocated based on various factors including the number of aircraft operated by an airline. According to a June report by Elara Capital, SpiceJet was given 43% of Jet Airways’ slots in the March-June period at Mumbai and Delhi airports, followed by IndiGo (32%), GoAir (13%), Vistara (7%) and AirAsia India (4%). “Given Delhi and Mumbai airports comprised 60% of domestic passenger movement during FY19, we believe these two airports are proxy of all-India market share gain by carriers at the expense of Jet Airways,"" Elara Capital said in its report."
21,2019-08-21,Vedanta,"In the last month, the Nifty Metal index lost 14.3%, which was among the highest in the sectoral indicesSAIL has lost as much as 55% this past year, JSPL 49%, Tata Steel 40% and Vedanta 36%

Amber signs continue to flash for metal companies. Rising inventory levels in China and subdued metal prices are driving metal stocks south, which could drag the downturn for a long time.
In the last month, the Nifty Metal index lost 14.3%, which was among the highest in the sectoral indices. In the past year, against a fall of about 9% in the Nifty 500 index, the Nifty Metal index lost a whopping 32%. Stocks of Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) Ltd, Jindal Stainless (Hisar) Ltd, Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL), Hindustan Copper Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd and Vedanta Ltd figure among the top losers in the metal index. SAIL has lost as much as 55% this past year, JSPL 49%, Tata Steel 40% and Vedanta 36%.
Low global prices have hit domestic revenues. To top it, the slowdown in domestic demand further played truant, taking a toll on net profits. “Metal companies under our coverage exhibited muted performance in 1QFY20 with EBITDA/PAT declining 18% & 43% YoY. The subdued results were driven by lower prices amid global uncertainty, weak demand in India and lower to broadly steady volumes,"" said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd in a client note. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, and PAT is profit after tax.
For now, the recovery could take longer than anticipated. The auto sector continues to grapple with the slowdown, rising inventory and lower sales. Government spends on infrastructure have yet to show signs of improvement. Barring JSPL, other large companies have either reported lower or flat steel volume growth. In fact, steel makers are expecting prices to slip further by about  ₹3,000 per tonne.
Recovery could take as long as the second half to materialize. Production cuts, for now, are resulting in increasing working capital and costs. Additionally, a Chinese inventory build-up means prices will remain flat or lower for some time. Many metal firms have also expanded their capacities. That would translate into cost increases against a backdrop of lower volumes.
A few firms face the prospect of weakening debt servicing capabilities if the metal prices don’t improve. “Despite management guiding for debt to stay below  ₹44,000 crore, as at Q1FY20 end it stands at  ₹48,500 crore—the highest-ever level for SAIL,"" said analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd in a note on 14 August.
A good thing is that iron ore prices eased this past month by about 26% to about $89 per tonne, which can reduce costs for steel makers. However, the management commentary on the demand outlook continues to show weakness for most metal firms. Both prices and volume offtake are important for a full-fledged recovery. From the looks of it, both are some time away— which means the Nifty Metal index may remain subdued for some time."

19,2019-09-04,Vedanta,"'India is going through a change. The way, we used to do business before must change,' says Anil AgarwalIn order to create more jobs, we need production to increase, more startups and innovation and more mining opportunities, says chairman of Vedanta Group

Anil Agarwal, chairman of Vedanta Resources Limited, in a frank dialogue with Mint’s Associate Editor Shrija Agrawal, opens up on wide range of topics - from impact of US-China trade war on India and future of Indian economy to efficacy of insolvency process (IBC). Speaking on current economic slowdown and India’s $ 5 trillion ambitions, Mr. Agarwal is quite optimistic that economy will rebound, and he is confident of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to deliver. He also reveals his dream to be able to produce 50% of our oil demand in India, and firmly believes that even though India will and should adopt cleaner technologies, oil will continue to play a dominant role in our economy and industrial growth. Edited excerpts :
China, in the past has been able to monopolize the price and supply curve. Amidst global trade war between US and China, how do you think companies, outside US and China, will be impacted; how will the commodity price and supply be impacted?
We (India) do not want to be a dumping ground for the Chinese. And between them, we should look for opportunities that could benefit India. We are close to 140 crores (population), and no one can afford to ignore us; we are one of the largest market.
What do you feel is the long-term implication of this trade war?
Goods, that are not going to America, is being diverted to India. As a result, we see Indian ports flooded with scrap – electronics and other goods. However, Modi Government is quite strong in decision making, and they will take corrective measures to ensure this doesn’t impact us.
Watch:
Scenario is gloom right now, and there are a lot of sound-bytes coming on ‘economic slowdown.’ What are your views about the macro-economic environment?
India is going through a change. The way, we used to do business before must change. However, I agree that now there is economic slowdown but I am very optimistic. The way Prime Minister Narendra Modi was able to transform Gujarat, I am sure he will do the same for India. Fundamentally, we want more industries, more reforms, ease of doing business and eradication of corruption: these things are in their Government mind. We have to have some patience, and results will come. In the meantime, the kind of companies that have gone down, it breaks my heart.
What are the major reforms that you expect Government to do – in terms of a mega bailout – to tide over the slowdown, we are seeing right now?
World has been developed based on leverage. And as long as promoters have not siphoned money and has used the money to build business, Government and banks should support them. I have seen China and other countries, and I do not believe that any entrepreneur/ industrialist is capable to build business on their own (without Government and Bank’s support).
We have seen a major reform in the country in form of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), you also acquired one of the large 12 accounts, Electrosteel, and people think that you will create another ‘Bokaro’ out of it. How do you look at the IBC phenomena?
IBC process, that has been brought in, is good but I believe it needs to be relooked to ensure that things happen on time. It is taking very long (to complete). Competent people must come and contribute to make sure that the process is completed on time. And this (reducing delays) is very important because banks, promoters and bidders – everyone – are suffering. IBC, as a system very good, but it needs to be relooked to ensure it is crisp and delivers result.
Tell us about the Electrosteel acquisition? How has benefits of synergy accrued to you?
Electrosteel is a very small acquisition for us. We are already in iron-ore business and the Government was expecting for us to do value-added investments. We got this opportunity, and acquired Electrosteel.
Mr. Raghubar Das, Chief Minister of Jharkhand, often tells me that he wants to leave behind a legacy, and can we (Vedanta) create another ‘Bokaro.’ I come from Bihar, and I understand him, reflect his views and appreciate his enthusiasm. And at the moment we are working on doubling the capacity of Electrosteel, and at the same time exploring how to create a world class company out of it. There is nothing on the cards, immediately, but in times to come, we will look at how we can create another ‘Bokaro’ out of Electrosteel.
Are there any other acquisitions on the cards right now through the IBC process for you?
No, at the moment our hands are full. I will like to share with you - IFC has done an independent report that shows we (Vedanta) contribute to 1% GDP of the country. And the Tax Transparency Report shows that over Rs. 2 lac crores of tax has been paid by Vedanta in the last 5-6 years. I feel very proud of this. We have always said, “Please do not under-estimate India."" No other country in the world has the kind of human-resource, natural-resource, climate-resource and location (ports on 3 sides) as we do.
We have nothing on cards to acquire, but we have big plans. We will invest Rs. 60,000 crores in the country. I am very passionate to produce oil in the country, which everybody said was not possible, but we did. We will invest Rs. 25,000 crores in oil & gas, Rs. 15,000 crores in silver and zinc, Rs. 15,000 crores in aluminium.
Interesting, you mentioned about investing Rs. 60,000 crores in India. Government has a vision to become $ 5 trillion economy by 2030. If you were to reflect on 3 or 4 key steps/ measures on how we could achieve that, what will those be?
I was in Delhi, and I told them (Government) that public sector is still the backbone of India. I come from Bihar, and we grew up in public sector environment – be it Sindhri, Bokaro and Baurani. I think, we must move on; today, Government should have no business to be in business. I am not saying it has to be privatised but it has be made independent (autonomous or corporatized). At present 70-80% of our economy is from public sector. And if the public sector is made independent, based on my experience in Hindustan Zinc and Balco, production will increase by at least 3 times. And that itself will help the GDP growth. I urge the unions in public sector enterprises, be in Coal India or ONGC, even though they are doing well, to continue ramping up production. This is one way that will help creating a $5 trillion economy.
We have done enough above the ground – we have done a good job in agriculture – but below the ground (mining) not so well. Why do we need to import? We have $400-450 billion of import - such as in copper, oil and gold - and if we could produce these in India, it can create millions of jobs. Forest and environment clearances are the biggest challenge for us. We maintain our environment in the best possible way, the world is watching us, but beyond that Government should not be ‘revenue mined.’ Government’s nature is to be ‘revenue minded,’ and that’s the reason we do not get enough revenue, rather it should be ‘production minded.’
There is an old tale – Goddess Lakshmi had to put a garland around someone and choose him as her husband. And everyone was excited and wanted Lakshmi to garland them. Afterall, she is Lakshmi (Goddess of Wealth). But she choose Vishnu, who was carefree and sitting far away in Sheersagar. Moral is that Lakshmi (Wealth) chooses the one, who doesn’t care.
You have this major desire to produce 50% of oil or hydro-carbon in India. Are we seeing the end of hydro-carbon super-cycle? We are seeing large corporates diversifying from this space.
I do agree that issues such as climate change and global warming are very important for us, clean technologies such as electric cars will come. In fact, we should be well ahead of these issues, but oil is not going away. Oil continue to be used in ships, heavy vehicles and machines. In India, we continue to import 85% of our oil requirements. And most of our revenues goes towards oil and gold imports; both of which, I believe we have abundant.
Taking about the Reliance transaction, as Reliance and Aramco are exploring a possible deal in Reliance’s refinery business. There are speculations raised that Reliance is exiting its core business. Being a seasoned entrepreneur, what is your sense about this deal?
I am unaware of the specifics of the deal, so I can talk from a general viewpoint. I respect Reliance in terms of what they have been able to achieve. I am sure Reliance has capability to pull British Petroleum and Saudi Aramco (as partners), so hats off to them.
This entire decision to de-list from LSE, was this a painful decision. What was in your mind? And do you believe that corporates are at times unfairly targeted?
I have raised $ 32 billion in the last 15 years, and every investor, who has put in money in Vedanta, has benefited. We have never defaulted on any of our liabilities. It was just time to move on.
So how do you think can job creation be increased? Do you believe ‘Make in India’ was a right step in the right direction, even though it hasn’t translated into a lot of jobs?
In order to create more jobs, we need production to increase, more startups and innovation and more mining opportunities. I have no doubt that in time, may be 1-1 ½ years, things will improve.
What are the 2-3 specific challenges you faced while building up Vedanta?
Sure, we will like Government to open-up more but most importantly, Government to start trusting businessmen. Whenever, in past, Government has trusted the private sector, we have delivered: be it airport, airline, steel plants and telecom.
As far as Vedanta is concerned, our Tuticorin plant has been closed. The last 20 years, we have been serving the country by producing copper in India, and now that is being imported. We have invested in aluminum plant in India, but half the aluminum is being imported because of variety of reasons: trade relationships and price wars. We are working with the Government on these issues and all we want is quick decisions.
You mentioned previously that in 10 years, Vedanta can be the next ‘Exxon.’ Where are you in that journey?

I always believe that oil is not in the ground, it’s in our minds. And in my mind, there is huge determination that we have oil and we will produce it in India.

18,2019-09-15,Vedanta,"Mining industry had sought extension of leases of all operational non-captive mines for a period of 10 years beyond 2020The move will impact about 334 mines belonging to companies such as Tata Steel, Vedanta Limited and others

New Delhi: In a setback for the mining industry, the government is set to reject a proposal to extend non-captive mining leases of companies that are expiring after completing 50 year period in March, 2020.
The move will impact about 334 mines belonging to companies such as Tata Steel, Vedanta Limited, Essel Mining, V.M. Salgaocar and Rungta Mines in 10 states that are facing expiry of lease and closure by March next year under current regulations. Of these 46 working mining leases have a significant contribution to the production of iron ore, manganese ore and chromite ore in the country.
Sources said a high level committee (HLC) set upon by Niti Aayog to identify key challenges of the sector and negate their impact has recommended that all existing mining lease of companies that have completed 50 years of operation will expire on March 31, 2020 and these would then be allocated through an auction process to be conducted in the January-March. Government is set to implement these recommendations, sources said.
""The committee took note of the fact that these mines have known reserves and their period of lease will come to an end on 31-03-2020 as per MMDR (Amendment) Act, 2015 was also known. The legislature had already given a time of 5 years to ward off any situation causing disruption in supplies to local industry. Therefore, extension of time for continued operation of these mines is not desirable,"" the committee has said in its report.
The mining industry had sought extension of leases of all operational non-captive mines for a period of 10 years beyond 2020 with another 20 years extension to be considered beyond this period. This, they felt, was necessary to prevent disruption in production while allowing full exploitation of resource available in a mine.
""Non-extension of lease of non-captive mines is a setback for the industry that is already facing a slowdown in demand and lower prices. This would also disrupt existing mining operations and put jobs of lakhs of workers under risk,"" said an executive of a private sector miner asking not to be named.
While disallowing extension of mining leases, the HLC has said that post auction new leaseholders could continue operating on approved mining plan of previous leaseholders and environment clearance (EC) for an initial period of 2 years.
This will help in preventing disruption in mineral production during the period of transition from one leaseholder to other. Moreover, this would provide time to new leaseholder to apply for fresh environment and forestry clearance without facing delays.
The government is studying the recommendations of the HLC and will soon come up with an action plan including further amendments to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act. The HLC is chaired by Niti Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar and consists of the cabinet secretary and secretaries of mines, steel, coal, revenue and finance. The committee was set up in April on mines, minerals and coal sectors to identify key challenges and negate their impact. It has given its report to the Centre.

The summit was scheduled for 16-17 November in Santiago.
The US is the world’s largest steel importer, importing more than 25 million tonne of the alloy. Though India is a minor exporter of steel to the US, a higher tariff is likely to have affected 50% of total imports to the US, triggering a global glut and slump in prices.
In the case of China, the largest producer and exporter of steel in the world, investors fear that the Asian nation would end up having excess capacity that would need a new market.
The US and China are the world’s largest economies and hence also the largest consumers. A protracted trade war between the two have already dented outlook for most commodities, including metals, and hence any likelihood of a breakthrough in talks is a welcome sign.
In July 2018, tensions between Washington and Beijing came to the fore when Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China for its alleged unfair trade practices. The US so far has slapped tariffs on $550 billion worth of Chinese products. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on $185 billion worth of US goods.
Both sides have also threatened qualitative measures that affect US businesses operating in China. Leaders of the two nations, in various attempts, have tried negotiating and reaching a common ground but have so far failed."

Key insights
Prices of most commodities produced by Vedanta such as zinc, aluminum, copper and crude oil were lower during the quarter.

The company saw a tax gain of  ₹1,610 crore compared with an expense of  ₹718 crore during the same period a year earlier.
Tax gains lifted quarterly net income by 15% at unit Hindustan Zinc Ltd., which contributed more than half of Vedanta’s profit in the year ended March.

3,2019-12-16,Vedanta,"Anil Agarwal further said the government is sitting with the largest and best reserves of oil and gas and coal along with gold and diamondAnil Agarwal emphasised on the need for reduction of bureaucratic interference in the functioning of the businesses

MUMBAI :
Vedanta Resources Chairman Anil Agarwal on Monday said if the government reduces its stake in public sector companies and banks to 50 per cent, they will work more efficiently.
Currently there are 14-15 banks and around 40-45 companies in the country where government has a significant stake.
""Government has no business to be in the business,"" Agarwal said during a fire chat at the india economic conclave 2019.
He said his company acquired four government companies and all of them are three times more productive.
""Today government holds on an average 87 per cent stake in these companies including banks. If they bring down their holding to 50 per cent they will get $1 trillion and become much bigger,"" Agarwal added.
He further said even if they (government) give up 5-10 per cent stake in each of the companies to the private sector, it will do much better.
""When we talk to the government (regarding stake sale) they say we will sell the asset. But what I feel is government should not be revenue minded and should go in a very simple manner and let wealth be created,"" he added.
Agarwal further said the government is sitting with the largest and best reserves of oil and gas and coal along with gold and diamond and the country is spending around $500 billion for import of resources, which will go up to $1 trillion.
""It is not that the government company can't function very well but it is important that they make them free. So companies that are into oil and gas or those like Coal India can be given to someone else.
""Even government law says if the government control or holding is reduced to 50 per cent then CAG and all other extra audit goes away and the CEO can work independently. Even the stock markets will appreciate such a move. If we can free all our natural resources companies and even the banks, India will have a positive repercussion of this "" Agarwal said.
He emphasised on the need for reduction of bureaucratic interference in the functioning of the businesses.
""Bureaucracy still has an interference and that should be reduced. Their job is make policy and not execution. They should only make strategy,"" Agarwal said.
He further said the government's role is to govern and have a regulator.
On the issue of environmental concerns, he said, ""we are not even 4.5 per cent of what the US is. We are not even polluting as much as they are. I believe self certification is important. We don't want to go to the government but we should self certify ourselves and if the industry violates any norm then we can be penalised for that,"" he noted.
Agarwal further added that whenever the government has entrusted the private sector with any responsibility, they have delivered the best be it in case of airports, telecom or even power."
2,2019-12-20,Vedanta,"Anil Agarwal, executive chairman of Vedanta Resources Ltd, tells Tanya Thomas the need of the hour is formulation of a comprehensive policy for responsible exploration of natural resources

As 2019 draws to a close, Mint invites thought leaders, heads of corporates and policymakers to share their vision for the decade ahead. Anil Agarwal, executive chairman of Vedanta Resources Ltd, tells Tanya Thomas the need of the hour is formulation of a comprehensive policy for responsible exploration of natural resources.
Leave business to businesses
Public sector units (PSUs), including state-owned banks, are the backbone of our country. In a democratic country like ours, entrepreneurs and private entities should run businesses with the government functioning as the regulator. The revenue should be used to provide infrastructure. PSUs should be autonomous and empowered with strong and independent boards with the power to make their own decisions.
Curb snowballing import bill
India is blessed with a rich reserve of natural resources, yet the country is becoming a dumping ground and is flooded with cheap imports. The need of the hour is the formulation of a comprehensive policy for responsible exploration of natural resources. Encouragement to explore natural resources will lead to self-reliance, save billions of dollars in imports and generate jobs, paving way for development.
Encourage liberal arts, create jobs
More than 65% of the population is below the age of 35, and the country is known for its young and intellectual workforce. The key focus of the government should be job creation and proposing a technology-driven curriculum to prepare youth for the future. India needs to take a cue from the Western world, where liberal arts universities help 35% of the population explore other career opportunities.
Quick clearance and self-certification
The biggest issue hampering the growth of industries is the time taken for clearances. The solution is simple—put them in self-certification. You must start trusting people, and heavy penalties should be levied if they don’t comply. With our government’s interventions, a lot of procedures are on self-certification mode—income tax, sales tax, excise are initiated through self-certification and assessed later.
Sustainable development
Development cannot be at the cost of the earth, it has to be sustainable. We need to take care of the environment. Great strides and advancements in technologies have made everything possible and efficiently utilizing these technologies can not only enhance growth but conserve the environment as well."

NEW DELHI :
In a candid discussion at an industry event, Vedanta Resources founder chairman Anil Agarwal quipped that the company is less reliant on borrowing from Indian banks on fear of action by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and other corporate policing agencies.
""From here (India), I have taken less money. Borrowed mostly in foreign countries. If i had borrowed from India, I would be under probe by ED and other organisations. Maybe they would have even put me in jail,"" Agarwal said at Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry's (FICCI) 92nd Annual Convention.
Vedanta Resources operates in India through its subsidiaries Vedanta Ltd, Hindustan Zinc Ltd and Bharat Aluminium Company (BALCO).
Agarwal, however, said that the environment (mahaul) for doing business in India is good due to lower corporate tax rate, lesser government interference, among others.

Vedanta had acquired BALCO from former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government in 2001."
