373,2018-01-10,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Bank said a normal monsoon will support rural consumption and additionally, help will also come from farm loan waivers

Mumbai: Second largest private sector lender HDFC Bank expects an uptick in gross domestic product (GDP) growth in FY19 to 7.3% from the 6.5% estimated for FY18, expecting a rural push by government and rise in consumption.  
Mumbai: Second largest private sector lender HDFC Bank expects an uptick in gross domestic product (GDP) growth in FY19 to 7.3% from the 6.5% estimated for FY18, expecting a rural push by government and rise in consumption. 
“We expect GDP growth to pick up to 7.3 per cent in FY19 and the gross value added growth to stand at 7.1 per cent,"" its economists said in a note. The government’s official estimate for FY18 growth stands at 6.5%, much lower than what experts would call as the potential, and restricted by the goods and services tax (GST) implementation and effects of the note ban. 
HDFC Bank said a normal monsoon will support rural consumption and additionally, help will also come from farm loan waivers. A surge in salaries for government servants through the implementation of the seventh pay commission will also help. The government will focus on rural sector and infrastructure, including road, railways and affordable housing, it said. 
Efficiency gains from GST roll out and a disappearance of the demonetisation reverses will give a positive base effect for the growth, it said. On the negative side, it warned of a surge in oil prices causing the ‘twin deficit’ problem with a surge in fiscal and current account gaps, sluggish global growth and a rise in consumption restricting the consumption. 
Even as it put governments at the centre and states adopting fiscal consolidation path as one of the factors which can negatively impact growth, it estimated the central government to not narrow the FY19 fiscal deficit to the targeted level of 3% under an adopted path. 
It said the fiscal deficit for FY19 will come at 3.2%. The bank economists also expect the current account deficit to widen to 2.5% for FY19, from the 1.5% expected for FY18. On the inflation front, it said price-rise will peak to 6% by mid-2018 on a low base and cool-off in the second half of the fiscal. 
It expects a hike of 0.25% in the policy rate by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) during the fiscal year 2018-19. Even as the Central Statistics Office (CSO) data estimated an uptick in gross fixed capital formation, HDFC Bank said this is due to a very low base in FY17. The capacity utilisation rates in the economy continue to be low, impeding the private capex cycle, it said."

Mumbai: India’s most-valued lender HDFC Bank Ltd on Thursday crossed Rs5 trillion market capitalisation for the first time, making it only the third Indian company to achieve this milestone.
In intraday trade, the stock touched a fresh record high of Rs1,53.75 on the BSE, up 3.31% from its previous close. The scrip closed at Rs1,931.80, up 2.15% with a market cap of Rs5 trillion. The Sensex index closed higher by 0.51% to 35,260.29 points.
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) are the other two companies which crossed market capitalisation of Rs5 trillion. RIL remained the most-valued company with a market cap of Rs5.82 trillion, followed by TCS with a market cap of Rs5.57 trillion.
HDFC Bank’s steady 20% profit growth quarter-after-quarter as well as its immunity to the bad loans crises has helped the stock.
The bank also reports bad loan ratio below 1%, the lowest among Indian lenders. Thus, investors continued to buy the stocks despite high valuation of close to 4.8 times its expected book value for this fiscal.
The recent gains in the stock along with other banking shares was due to news report on government mulling 100% foreign direct investment in the banking sector.
Brokerage firm Jefferies India expects that the this is sentiment positive, but the magnitude of impact should be marginal as the gap between current foreign institutional investor (FII) shareholding and upper limit is wide for most banks barring HDFC Bank.
In the last 12 months, the stock has gained 42.34%, while the S&P Bankex, the broader gauge of banking stocks, advanced 36.62%.
The bank will report its December quarter earnings on 19 January. According to 16 Bloomberg analysts’ estimates, the bank may report a net profit of Rs4,652.90 crore.
“HDFC Bank’s earnings growth should get a boost from recovering loan demand as disruption from the 2017 implementation of India’s goods and services tax wanes,"" said a 16 January Bloomberg Intelligence report.
“Strong exposure to retail should promote loan growth. Margin may struggle to expand further, but should stay above 4%. Credit costs could rise from last year’s low base, but will still stay under control, as HDFC Bank has lower exposure to stressed borrowers than other corporate lenders. Investors may closely monitor digital banking initiatives,"" the report added.
Among the analysts covering the HDFC Bank stock, 50 have a “buy"" rating, three have a “hold"" rating, while two has a “sell"" rating, according to Bloomberg data."

Mumbai: HDFC Bank Ltd on Friday reported a 20.1% rise in Q3 profit on higher net interest income (NII) and other income.
HDFC Bank’s net profit rose to Rs4,642.60 crore for the quarter ended 31 December from Rs3,865.33 crore a year ago. 
According to 17 Bloomberg analysts’ estimates, the bank was expected to post a net profit of Rs4,706.90 crore.
Net interest income, or the core income a bank earns by giving loans, increased 24.1% to Rs10,314.34 crore compared with Rs8,309.09 crore last year. Other income was at Rs3,869.17 crore, up 23.12% from Rs3,142.67 crore a year ago.
Provisions and contingencies jumped 88.81% to Rs715.78 crore from Rs115.38 crore a year ago. On quarter-on-quarter basis, it fell 8.45% from Rs1,476.19 crore.
Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) advanced 57.4% to Rs8,234.88 crore at the end of the December quarter from Rs5,232.27 crore in the same quarter last year.
The rise in bad loans was due to an annual exercise conducted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that pointed out divergence in asset classification for fiscal 2017.
For HDFC Bank, the divergence in gross bad loans, the difference between RBI’s assessment and that reported by the lender, stood at around Rs2,051.76 crore at end March 2017, while divergence in provisions was at Rs793.39 crore.
As a percentage of total loans, gross NPAs stood at 1.29% as compared to 1.26% in the previous quarter and 1.05% in the year-ago quarter. Net NPAs were at 0.44% in the December quarter compared to 0.43% in the previous quarter and 0.32% in the same quarter last year.
Advances rose 27.51% from a year ago to Rs6.31 trillion. Deposits rose 10.1% to Rs6.99 trillion.

The hubris among investors of HDFC Bank Ltd is evident. After all, India’s most valued lender has delivered another stellar quarter in terms of profitability and growth. 
The hubris among investors of HDFC Bank Ltd is evident. After all, India’s most valued lender has delivered another stellar quarter in terms of profitability and growth.
The bank reported a 20% rise in net profit to Rs4,642.6 crore for the December quarter backed by an impressive 24.1% growth in net interest income and an eye-popping 27.5% expansion in advances.
If that doesn’t dazzle, the 4.3% net interest margin will surely do. Deposits grew at 10% despite it being over the bloated base of demonetisation a year ago.
Let’s rewind again to advances. The surge in loans is also because HDFC Bank didn’t lend much in the December quarter. To its credit, the management of the bank mentioned that, but said that quarterly momentum in loan growth is still intact.
Notwithstanding the base effect from demonetisation, a 27% loan growth should not be sneezed at.
It would be futile to question why HDFC Bank is the only lender and also only the third Indian company to cross a market capitalization of Rs5 trillion (read more here). The love from investors is indeed evident. Add a gross bad loan ratio of 1.29% and it looks like there’s reason enough for this love.
But perhaps investors are getting blindsided by these percentages. HDFC Bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs) stock rose 57% from a year ago period. What used to be an accretion of just about 20% two years back is now almost 60%. For a lender of HDFC Bank’s size, this is disturbing.
Also, notwithstanding the base effect on loan growth, as a percentage of the loan book, bad loans have increased sharply. In the September 2017 quarter, the gross NPA ratio was 1.26% while in December the previous year, the bad loan ratio was 1.05%.
Another fact that cannot be ignored is that the bank under-reported its bad loans for fiscal year 2017 by about 25%. To its credit, the lender has made adequate provisioning towards all risky assets including those thrown up by the Reserve Bank of India’s inspection.
HDFC Bank investors are used to consistent double-digit profit growth, industry-beating credit growth and margins that put even some non-banking finance companies to shame. What they haven’t seen before is a faster increase in bad loans and that is yet to reflect into the bank’s valuations. After all future profits are projected based on benchmarking the past. The stock trades at a rich multiple of 4.1 times its estimated book value for fiscal year 2019.
HDFC Bank is no longer what it was in the past as far as bad loans are concerned. The hubris needs to be tempered.

367,2018-01-26,HDFC Bank,"Five of the top 10 holdings of MFs were financials, ruled by private lenders HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, according to data from Morningstar

Financial stocks, led by top private lender ICICI Bank Ltd, were the most bought by mutual funds (MFs) in 2017, as fund managers placed their bets on a recovery in Asia’s third-largest economy.  
Financial stocks, led by top private lender ICICI Bank Ltd, were the most bought by mutual funds (MFs) in 2017, as fund managers placed their bets on a recovery in Asia’s third-largest economy. 
Domestic MFs pumped in a record Rs1.2 trillion in Indian shares in 2017, when BSE’s 30-share Sensex delivered 27.91% returns.
Five of the top 10 holdings of MFs were financials, ruled by private lenders HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, according to data from Morningstar Inc. The five accounted for 58.9% of the top 10 MFs’ holdings at the end of 2017.
Banking and financial services stocks also made up more than 34% of the top 20 stocks bought by mutual funds in 2017, which included ICICI Bank, Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd, State Bank of India, HDFC Bank Ltd, and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.
“Cyclical story of recovery in economy made lenders attractive collectively,"" said Kaustubh Belapurkar, director of fund research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India Pvt. Ltd, the India unit of Morningstar Inc.
Ritesh Jain, chief investment officer at BNP Paribas Mutual Fund, pointed out that financials have huge weightage and constitute 40% of benchmark indices, and added that portfolios largely mirror that weightage of financials.
“The sector though is expanding—we now have insurance companies, mutual fund companies, brokerage firms that have become diversified financial services companies, and small finance banks,"" Jain said.
Since September, as many as five insurance firms have been listed, namely SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Ltd, HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company Ltd, New India Assurance Company Ltd and General Insurance Corporation of India, along with Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd, a mutual fund. 
ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd was listed in 2016.
“So, options are more for asset managers in the financial space,"" Jain said.
Mutual funds stocked up on ICICI Bank shares to the tune of Rs9,928 crore. Mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp. was a new entrant to the top 10 holdings list of mutual funds as the second most-bought stock. Mutual funds collectively bought Rs8,889 crore worth of the company’s stock.
“ICICI Bank was available at good value early in 2017. HDFC was preferred heavily in 2017 due to the government’s low-cost housing push,"" Belapurkar said.
Surprisingly, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd was the most sold stock by asset managers as they dumped Rs2,410 crore of the stock that slipped two positions to become the eighth-most held stock by domestic MFs. 
“Fund managers locked in gains in Maruti after the sharp rally,"" Belapurkar added."
366,2018-02-08,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Bank raises lending rates by 10 basis points even as RBI holds rates, other major banks are likely to follow suit

New Delhi/Mumbai: India’s struggling economy is facing a new challenge: banks are raising interest rates even though the central bank is leaving its rates unchanged, as risks such as surging bond yields and more provisioning requirements erode their profit. 
New Delhi/Mumbai: India’s struggling economy is facing a new challenge: banks are raising interest rates even though the central bank is leaving its rates unchanged, as risks such as surging bond yields and more provisioning requirements erode their profit.
HDFC Bank, India’s second-biggest bank by assets, on Wednesday became the latest to raise some rates by 10 basis points. The same day, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept its policy rate unchanged, to “carefully"" nurture economic growth .
Other major banks are likely to follow suit, raising concerns of de facto rate increases in an economy that is growing at its slowest pace in three years and needs private investment.
An RBI staff study showed every 100 bps increase in borrowing costs lowers the investment rate by as much as 91 bps.
“Lending rates will move up. We cannot avoid that from happening,"" the chief of a large state-run bank told Reuters.
Banks are facing a number of threats. Chief among them is that rising inflation has hurt bonds, driving benchmark 10-year yields up more than 100 bps since July, a big concern for banks, which are the biggest buyers of the debt.
Banks are also facing a higher cost of funds, a key expense for the lenders, and more stringent regulatory requirements for their liquidity coverage ratios, according to Ashish Parthasarthy, treasurer at HDFC Bank.
Banks are also being forced to raise deposit rates so they can attract more funds, and they continue to set aside more capital as they clear a near-record $147 billion in soured debt.
Economists see little relief in sight, but are calling on the RBI to step in to support debt markets, including through debt purchases, thus easing at least one of the major challenges banks face.
In a measure of how much margins are being hit, the spread between the 10-year bond yield and a key lending rate, the median one-year marginal cost-based lending rate, has narrowed to only 80 bps from 200 bps in July.
“Lending rates might go up with such a large increase in bond yields,"" said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economist at State Bank of India.
“Under such circumstances, it is important to help cool off bond yields to protect the overall interest rates from going up and hurting incipient signs of growth."" Reuters"

Mumbai: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Friday directed HDFC Bank Ltd to strengthen its existing systems and controls to prevent any leakage of unpublished price-sensitive information so that no entity is able to breach Sebi’s insider trading norms and make illegitimate gains.
Sebi ordered the country’s largest private sector lender to submit a report on its present systems and controls and the details of the entities responsible for monitoring such systems.
The bank has been ordered by the market regulator to conduct an internal inquiry into the leakage of unpublished price-sensitive information relating to its financial figures, including non-performing assets (NPAs), and take appropriate action against those responsible for the same.
Sebi has also ordered HDFC Bank to find out the possible role of certain persons in relation to the recent leakage of unpublished price-sensitive information (UPSI) with regards to the bank’s 2017-2018 June quarter results.
When contacted, an HDFC bank spokesperson said: “We have so far not read the order but it goes without saying that we will comply with the order as we are a very compliance- and regulations-driven organization.""
This is the second order from Sebi with regard to cases relating to leakage of sensitive company-related information through private digital messaging applications such as WhatsApp, ahead of the official announcement on stock exchanges by the concerned company.
On 28 December, Sebi had passed a similar order against Axis Bank Ltd, another privately held lender. Axis Bank was asked by Sebi to conduct an internal inquiry into the suspected leak of its June quarter financial results.
Sebi, in its order against HDFC Bank, said that it had initiated a probe into the lender after certain newspaper articles referred to circulation of UPSI in various private WhatsApp groups about certain companies ahead of their official announcements to stock exchanges.
During the course of preliminary examination, Sebi observed that the messages circulated on WhatsApp closely matched the HDFC Bank results for the April-June quarter, which were published subsequently.
The actual results of HDFC Bank were announced on 24 July 2017 at 12.12 pm.
However, as per the Sebi probe, some WhatsApp messages mentioning certain key numbers from HDFC Bank’s Q1FY18 results started circulating from 21 July 2017.
The probe found that a WhatsApp post stated HDFC Bank’s gross NPA figure at 1.25% on 21 July, while the actual results showed this figure as 1.24% on 24 July. Similarly, a WhatsApp post ahead of the official announcement of the results stated the bank’s net profit at Rs3,900 crore while the actual net profit as per the official announcement stood at Rs3,893.84 crore.
Sebi found that a similar incident took place during the time of announcement of the bank’s December 2015 quarterly results as well.
Sebi found that a WhatsApp post at 0951 hours on 25 January 2016 stated HDFC Bank’s net interest income (NII) for the quarter ended December 2015 at Rs.7,050 crore while the official announcement at 1407 hours on the same day showed this number at Rs7,068 crore.
Similarly, on the same day, the bank’s net profit for the quarter was stated at Rs3,350 crore by a WhatsApp post while the actual profit declared later stood at Rs3,350 crore.
Sebi found that the financial results of HDFC Bank for quarter-ended 30 June 2017 were finalized on or before 19 July 2017, which was right before the beginning of circulation of the WhatsApp message on 21 July 2017.
However, Sebi could not ascertain the source of the WhatsApp earnings leak.
“Such leakage is prima facie attributable to the inadequacy of the processes /controls/ systems that HDFC Bank as a listed company had put in place,"" read the Sebi order.
HDFC Bank, in its reply to Sebi said that the concerned officials had shared the information on unpublished Gross NPA, NPA and profit figures with the concerned employees of the bank and with the statutory auditors, for official purposes and on a need to know basis.
Sebi, in its order, has asked the bank to find out the role of the members of its various committees involved in generation of the original data for the purpose of determination of key figures pertaining to financial figures. The bank is also required to probe the persons involved in the preparation of HDFC Bank’s board notes and presentations.
“The inquiry directed above shall be completed within a period of three months from the date of this order, and within seven days from the completion thereof, HDFC Bank shall file a report to Sebi in that regard,"" said the Sebi order.

Mumbai: Economic growth is on an upward move as the twin impacts of demonetisation and GST implementation wane, and will accelerate to 7.3% next fiscal from 6.5% this year, says a report. 
Mumbai: Economic growth is on an upward move as the twin impacts of demonetisation and GST implementation wane, and will accelerate to 7.3% next fiscal from 6.5% this year, says a report.
Improvement in private consumption, increase in capacity utilization and private capex cycle revival will be driving higher growth,a report by HDFC Bank’s economists said.
“We are optimistic about the growth outlook in FY19 as the recovery gains momentum and the effects of the note-ban shock and GST related disruptions fade... We expect GDP growth to pick up to 7.3% in FY19 from 6.5% in FY18,"" its chief economist Abheek Barua said today, estimating the December quarter growth print to come at 6.9%. Real GDP growth will move upward to 7.2% in the last fiscal of 2017-18, it said.
It can be noted that India GDP growth rate had slipped to a three-year low of 5.7% for the first quarter and climbed up to 6.3% in the succeeding three months.
The report said there will be a slowdown in the agricultural sector growth, but it will be compensated by a faster surge in industries and services sectors. As the impact of GST rollout fades, the industrial sector, especially manufacturing, will see a rebound in activity, he said.
An uptick is expected on the services front as well on factors like a favourable base effect, recovery in most of the lead indicators like deposit and credit for banks, cargo handled at major ports, passengers carried by domestic airlines and foreign tourist arrivals, he said.
Agri growth, however, will be tepid at 1.5% for the third quarter because of a 2.8% dip in Kharif crop output, a lag in area under Rabi cultivation and an unfavourable base effect, it said. However, agriculture growth will accelerate to up to 4% in 2018-19 on a favourable base and assuming a normal monsoon, Barua said.
 Rising farm output, coupled with higher minimum support prices announced by government are likely to improve farm incomes and rural consumption, it said."

Ltd (HDFC AMC) will be filing its draft initial public offer (IPO) papers, said three people aware of the developments. 
In December, HDFC Bank said it is planning to raise up to Rs24,000 crore through a combination of preferential allotment and qualified institutional placement (QIP). The bank said it will be raising nearly one-third (Rs8,500 crore) of the sum from parent Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC). “The bank will be launching its fund-raising very soon, likely around mid-March. They are waiting for regulatory approval, which should come this week,"" said one of the people cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to the media. 
According to the second person cited above, HDFC Bank’s equity fund-raising will be a mix of a domestic qualified institutional placement (QIP) and overseas fund-raising via American depositary receipts/shares (ADR/ADS). 
“Like the last time it raised funds from the markets, the share sale this time, too, would be a mix of a QIP and overseas fund-raising. Majority of the fund-raising will be through the overseas share sale,"" he said. He, too, spoke on condition of anonymity.
In February 2015, HDFC Bank raised Rs10,000 crore through a mix of QIP and ADRs, with around Rs2,000 crore raised through the domestic QIP and the rest through an overseas share sale. “We don’t comment on market speculation/rumours,"" said a spokesperson for HDFC Bank in an email response to Mint’s queries. 
Indian banks have been busy raising funds in the past 12 months, with several large QIP offerings from both private sector and state-owned banks. Last year, State Bank of India raised Rs15,000 crore through a QIP, while private sector lenders Kotak Mahindra Bank raised Rs5,803 crore. 
Another HDFC group firm—HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd (HDFC AMC)—will be filing its so-called draft red herring prospectus for an IPO soon. HDFC AMC is a joint venture between mortgage lender HDFC and Standard Life Investments Ltd.
“HDFC AMC will be filing its DRHP in the next few days. The IPO, a pure offer for sale, will see the two JV partners sell stake worth around $550-600 million,"" said the third person cited above, also requesting anonymity. 
In November, HDFC and Standard Life said they plan to dilute their shareholding to at least 50.01% and 24.99% respectively, through dilution in one or more tranches. As of 30 September, HDFC held a 57.36% stake in the company, while Standard Life held 38.24% stake. 
HDFC AMC manages total assets under management of Rs2,69,781 crore, of which Rs1,19,159 crore is in equity oriented funds, as of 30 September. HDFC AMC is also the second asset management company to go public, following the IPO of Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Co. Ltd, which went public in October.
Transactions at the group follow the recent fund-raisings at the parent company HDFC. 
On Tuesday, HDFC launched its QIP offering to raise Rs1,896 crore. It is also raising another Rs11,104 crore from top institutional investors like KKR, GIC and Premji Invest, among others.
HDFC will be issuing shares to these investors on a preferential allotment basis at a price of Rs1,726.05 a share, raising Rs11,104 crore. The preferential allotment represents 3.87% of HDFC’s enhanced equity share capital post the issue."

Mumbai: India’s HDFC Bank Ltd, the world’s most-expensive lender, has appointed arrangers, including Bank of America Corp, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG, for a Rs15,500 crore ($2.38 billion) planned share sale, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The lender has also appointed JPMorgan Chase & Co., Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd, IIFL Holdings Ltd and JM Financial Ltd for the offering, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. The sale process will begin as soon as the lender gets the required regulatory approvals, they said.
HDFC Bank plans to raise the bulk of the funds from international investors through a sale of American depository receipts, with the rest to come from selling stock in India, the people said. The money will be used to boost the lender’s capital buffers and support its growth plans for several years, Paresh Sukthankar, deputy managing director of HDFC Bank said in January.
Representatives for HDFC Bank, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, IIFL and Edelweiss declined to comment, while Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and JM Financial didn’t immediately respond to emails.
HDFC Bank has a price-to-book multiple of 5.16, making it the most expensive among lenders across the globe with at least $50 billion in market value, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.
The lender’s board approved in December a fund raising of as much as Rs24,000 crore through a share sale. Parent company Housing Development Finance Corp. will invest about Rs8,500 crore, it said at the time.
The Mumbai-based bank, helmed by chief executive officer Aditya Puri, has consistently maintained a low bad-loan ratio by limiting its exposure to heavily-indebted Indian corporates and lending to the country’s growing middle class. The lender, which has the biggest weighting in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex, has climbed 33% in past year.
HDFC Bank had a capital adequacy ratio of 15.5% as of 31 December and a gross bad-loan ratio of 1.3%, exchange filings show. That compares with 13.9% and 10.2%, respectively, for India’s banking system as a whole at end of September. Bloomberg"

Mumbai: After global banks like Citibank, Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase, HDFC Bank Ltd Tuesday barred the use of its credit, debit and prepaid cards to buy or trade in cryptocurrenices like bitcoins, 
In a late evening note to its customers on Tuesday, HDFC Bank said, “You may be aware of the increasing global apprehensions regarding Bitcoins, Cryptocurrencies and virtual currencies. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also cautioned the public regarding the potential economic, operational, legal and security related risks associated in dealing with such currencies. 
“To ensure our customers’ security, we have decided to not permit usage of HDFC Bank Credit, Debit and Prepaid Cards towards purchase or trading of such Bitcoins, Cryptocurrencies and virtual currencies, on merchants suspected to be dealing in cryptocurrency or online foreign exchange trading or both...""
Ever since the price of bitcoins skyrocketed from a little under $1,000 in 2016 to touch nearly $20,000 in 2017, people have been faced with the dilemma of whether or not to buy cryptocurrencies.
On the one hand, there is the fear of losing out on an opportunity to make money, investing in a virtual currency whose price is extremely volatile and whose true value cannot be assessed. It comes with its own risks as well. For instance, the current value of a bitcoin is under $10,000.
Adding to the confusion, most governments remain non-committal on the legality of bitcoins since it is not regulated by central banks. Some governments like that of South Korea and China have explicitly warned investors to exercise caution while those like the Indian government have begun imposing a tax on the gains from the sale of bitcoins.
A bitcoin is an open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that runs on blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger that contains details of every transaction, allowing a user’s computer to verify the validity of each transaction of this virtual currency. Hence, the transactions are transparent to every user. In India, you can buy bitcoins from dedicated exchanges like Unocoin or Zebpay by downloading apps or using websites.
According to a 12 March Bloomberg report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)—a club of the world’s largest central banks—on Monday, “digital currencies are a revolutionary tool that central banks should consider, but they remain far too risky to be used as legal tender any time soon""."

Mumbai: A growing number of private banks and financial services firms are taking advantage of a vibrant primary market in India to unlock value of their diversified subsidiaries. 
Mumbai: A growing number of private banks and financial services firms are taking advantage of a vibrant primary market in India to unlock value of their diversified subsidiaries.
HDFC’s asset management unit, HDFC Asset Management Co. (AMC), is the latest such firm to announce a new share sale.
The HDFC AMC initial public offer (IPO) will offer up to 25.4 million equity shares through an offer for sale of 8.59 million shares by Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC), and up to 16.8 million shares by Standard Life Investments Ltd.
Similarly, ICICI Securities Ltd, the brokerage and investment banking arm of ICICI Bank Ltd, is launching its Rs4,017 crore IPO on Thursday.
“The financial services space has tremendous opportunity for growth. If the offering is coming in from an established house, the investor confidence is high, and it makes sense to tap the market when appetite is strong,"" said Debasis Panigrahi, executive director at Nomura’s India investment banking unit.
ICICI Securities will be the third company from the ICICI group to go public. 
In September 2017, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd raised Rs5,700 crore in the first public offering by an Indian general insurance firm.
In September 2016, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd raised Rs6,000 crore in the first public offering by an Indian life insurance firm.
HDFC AMC is also the second asset management company to go public after Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Co. Ltd, which raised Rs1,542 crore last October.
It follows the listing of HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd, which raised Rs8,695 crore. 
“From an investment banker’s perspective, BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) gives you the size advantage. The overall deal size is much larger and easy to market to tier-1 accounts and is very attractive to investors,"" added Panigrahi.
BFSI companies contribute 28.70% and 21.37%, respectively, of the market capitalization of Sensex and BSE500 companies.
“The appetite is good for quality issues even at comparatively expensive valuations. This trend of value unlocking in BFSI is here to stay,"" he added.
“The common theme is value unlocking from their subsidiaries as for many of these, the subsidiaries have done better than the parent, too,"" said Suresh Ganapathy, director of financial services research at Macquarie Capital Securities India Pvt. Ltd.
“ For e.g., ICICI Prudential Life, ICICI Lombard, and ICICI Securities, have fared better than ICICI Bank. Clearly, there is a lot of value. Markets have been strong for the last couple of years. So, they are banking on the robust demand,"" said Ganapathy.
Ganapathy also pointed out that some banks such as ICICI Bank are also using funds from such listings to provide for provisioning for stressed assets.
Public sector banks, following the government push, have also been offloading non-core assets in a bid to shore up capital levels. 
 “I don’t see any reason why public sector banks cannot do it. I guess they will try, too, in the buoyant market,""said Amar Ambani, partner and head of research at IIFL Wealth Management. 
“However, management of PSU banks are focusing on NPAs (non-performing assets) and ongoing frauds for few of them,"" said Ambani.

Mumbai: India’s banking regulator is delaying year-end bonuses to the heads of top private banks as it questions the size of the payouts citing the lenders’ performance issues, said people familiar with the matter. 
Mumbai: India’s banking regulator is delaying year-end bonuses to the heads of top private banks as it questions the size of the payouts citing the lenders’ performance issues, said people familiar with the matter.
Chief executive officers at HDFC Bank Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd. and Axis Bank Ltd. —the nation’s largest private lenders by assets — are among bankers yet to receive bonuses for the financial year ended 31 March 2017, as the Reserve Bank of India hasn’t signed off on the proposed payments, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. They declined to give further details. Business Standard newspaper had previously reported the delays.
ICICI’s board had approved a bonus of Rs2.2 crore ($340,000) for CEO Chanda Kochhar while Axis Bank’s Shikha Sharma was set to receive Rs1.35 crore and HDFC Bank’s Aditya Puri about Rs2.9 crore, exchange filings show. A spokesman for Axis Bank declined to comment. Spokesmen for HDFC Bank and ICICI didn’t reply to emails and phone calls. An email to the RBI wasn’t immediately answered.
Long considered healthier than their government-run peers, India’s private banks have had a tough time over the past year, plagued by revelations of hidden bad loans and alleged lapses in corporate governance. Rising defaults have enraged the public, piling pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to act against the perpetrators and reinforce his anti-graft image before elections next year.
Going by historical evidence, the RBI should have approved the bonuses well before 31 March 2018, said Asutosh Kumar Mishra, a Mumbai-based banking analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd. “We have never noticed such delay in approving the payouts, but then we haven’t seen a year in which so many skeletons were brought out of the closet — from under-reporting of bad loans to serious governance issues.""
In the year ended March 2017 — for which the bonuses are under contention — an RBI audit showed Axis hadn’t disclosed bad loans worth about Rs5,600 crore. HDFC Bank also reported a divergence and ICICI said it isn’t required to make disclosures on the topic even as provisions for bad loans climbed.
Axis Bank shares rose about 10% and ICICI 17% in Mumbai trading during the year ended March 2017, while the 10-member Bankex Index added 33%. HDFC Bank shares jumped had 35% during the period.
“Private banks will likely report sharp rise in slippages, led by ICICI Bank and Axis Bank,"" said analysts led by M.B. Mahesh at Kotak Institutional Equities, referring to higher delinquent loans. They predict January-March 2018 results would confirm a quarter of “pain"" for Indian lenders. Bloomberg"

The funds will be raised by issuing Perpetual Debt Instruments (part of Additional Tier I capital), Tier II Capital Bonds and Long Term Bonds (Financing of infrastructure and affordable housing) up to a total of Rs50,000 crore in next 12 months through private placement mode, it said.

355,2018-04-23,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Bank's unsecured loans have grown at a rapid pace, and the home loan segment hasn't grown muchtrends that can cause much investor concern

As usual, private sector lender HDFC Bank Ltd’s March quarter (Q4) results met analysts’ expectations.  
As usual, private sector lender HDFC Bank Ltd’s March quarter (Q4) results met analysts’ expectations. 
Net profit in the March quarter stood at Rs4,799 crore, up 20% on a year-on-year basis (y-o-y) and a record high, thanks to robust growth in “other income"".
Net interest margin remained at 4.3% and asset quality too was largely stable. 
Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of gross advances during Q4 marginally deteriorated on a sequential basis, but the net NPA ratio improved.
While HDFC Bank Ltd has remained fairly immune to the corporate bad loan issues faced by other lenders, investors in the stock would need to watch some key trends. 
For instance, its overall loan book, which grew 18.7% y-o-y in Q4, saw its retail loan book rising at a faster pace than the wholesale loan book. It should be noted that its loan book has clocked 20% plus growth in previous quarters (see chart).
“This time the corporate loan book grew at a slower pace and one should bear in mind that could have been a conscious decision by the management to go slow here after the events that unfolded with Punjab National Bank. And in the current environment, we do not expect the bank to aggressively push its corporate loan book,"" said Siddharth Purohit, an analyst at SMC Institutional Equities.
This means for the overall loan book to sustain at healthy levels, retail loan book growth should maintain this momentum. HDFC Bank is better placed than its peers to increase market share, but increasing penetration of small finance banks and NBFCs in this segment would keep competitive intensity high.
The bank’s unsecured loans have grown at a rapid pace, which is a concern because any increase in retail delinquencies could erode the bank’s asset quality going ahead, analysts said. Its home loan segment has also not grown much.
Lastly, analysts should also track the bank’s fund raising plan.
The board approved issue of perpetual debt instruments (part of additional tier I capital), tier II capital bonds and long-term bonds (financing of infrastructure and affordable housing) up to Rs50,000 crore in the next 12 months through private placement, subject to approval of shareholders.
Nitin Aggarwal, vice-president and banking analyst at Motilal Oswal Institutional Equities Ltd, sees the shareholders’ nod as one of the key triggers for the HDFC Bank Ltd stock since it indicates that the bank is focusing on its growth in the next phase."

353,2018-04-30,HDFC Bank,"There has been no change for FDs of tenures longer than 5 years

HDFC Bank Ltd has increased rates for fixed deposits (FDs) below Rs1 crore for most tenures above 1 year, in the range of 10-100 basis points (bps). One bps is one-hundredth of a percentage point. With this, the highest rate for non-bulk FDs (less than Rs1 crore) from HDFC Bank with a tenure of 1 year 17 days to 5 years has reached 7% (see graph). There has been no change for FDs of tenures longer than 5 years.  
HDFC Bank Ltd has increased rates for fixed deposits (FDs) below Rs1 crore for most tenures above 1 year, in the range of 10-100 basis points (bps). One bps is one-hundredth of a percentage point. With this, the highest rate for non-bulk FDs (less than Rs1 crore) from HDFC Bank with a tenure of 1 year 17 days to 5 years has reached 7% (see graph). There has been no change for FDs of tenures longer than 5 years. 
Some customers of HDFC Bank received an email stating that the higher rates were available for just three days. However, the new rates will be applicable till the next revision, HDFC Bank clarified later. 
HDFC Bank is not the first lender to hike FD rates. In February, State Bank of India had increased rates on term deposits by 10-75 bps. 
Banks are increasing deposit rates to deal with the tightening liquidity condition. Banks use the money collected through deposits to lend to borrowers. If the demand for credit from borrowers goes up, more money should flow in, in the form of deposits. 
Data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) suggests that growth in demand for credit is higher than growth in deposits. For instance, for public sector banks, annual growth in aggregate deposits in the quarter ending December was 0.9%, while bank credit growth was 6%. Similarly, for private sector banks, deposits grew 13.5%, but credit growth was 23.6%, in the same period. This creates a mismatch. To rectify the situation, banks try to attract more depositors through higher FD rates. 
This also means that the cost of funds for banks is going up. This will impact the marginal cost of funds-based lending rates (MCLR), making MCLR-linked loans costlier in the next revision cycle. Which explains why interest rates on loans have also been increased by many large banks despite the RBI not having raised the repo rate.
With the interest cycle turning, other banks too could revise their FD rates upwards to boost demand. 
Prakash Praharaj, founder, MaxSecure Financial Planners, said that as people are learning about mutual funds, many of them prefer to invest in them instead of FDs. Mutual funds also have some tax advantages over FDs. For instance, for Section 80C investments, mutual funds have a lock-in of three years, whereas tax-saving FDs have a lock-in of five years. 
Senior citizens too are opting for senior citizen schemes that give a return of 8%, said Praharaj. 
Though banks are increasing their FD rates, returns on an investment should not be the only deciding factor when you invest. You should also keep in mind your risk profile, investment time-frame, related goals and asset allocation. Asset allocation helps in diversifying your risk as well as in achieving financial goals in the most efficient manner; so when one asset goes down, it does not have a drastic impact on the entire portfolio."

Mumbai: Shares of HDFC Bank Ltd jumped to a record high on Thursday, after Macquarie Capital Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said that foreign institutional investors (FIIs) are likely to buy more than $ 1 billion of the stock on Friday when a trading window for them opens for a day.
On Thursday, HDFC Bank shares surged as much as 5.03% to a record high of Rs2,150 in intraday trade on the BSE. The stock closed at Rs2136.15, up .36% from its previous close, while the Sensex ended 1.19% up at 35,322.38 points.
Markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has asked stock exchanges to close the trading window—popularly known as the “6 lakh series"" which allowed FIIs to trade among themselves in stocks where the foreigners’ quota has been exhausted—effective 1 July.
When stocks get into FII restriction, there is a separate window on which only FIIs trade so that they still have the option of buying the stock. Since the buyer will be purchasing from another FII, it ensures that there is no change in FII shareholding. For stocks in demand this usually leads to an FII premium, Macquarie analysts said in the note.
When the stock will be open for FII trading on 1 June—the headroom will be 143 basis points. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
“Now that this will be the last opportunity for FIIs to buy HDFCB (HDFC Bank), we think that the scrapping of FII window will increase the quantum of buying that will come in on 1st June. The buying could be more than $1bn on June 1,"" HDFC Bank analysts Suresh Ganapathy, Nishant Shah and Akash Nainani said in a note on 29 May.
HDFC Bank ADRs (American Depository Receipts) spiked up 8.62% to $105.17 in Wednesday’s trade.
The analysts pointed that HDFC Bank usually has the highest FII premium—it used to be higher than 20% before it came crashing down in Feb 2017 when the stock opened up for FIIs for a day, and premium is now running at around 3.5%."

Mumbai: The cabinet on Wednesday cleared one of the largest foreign direct investment (FDI) proposals before it—a plan by HDFC Bank Ltd to raise  ₹ 24,000 crore. 
The capital infusion will not result in breaching the foreign equity holding cap of 74% in the private sector lender. “The current 72.62% foreign equity holding is being raised to 74% with this  ₹ 24,000 crore FDI,"" said interim finance minister Piyush Goyal.
The bank’s management had made clear its intention to boost corporate lending at a time when other lenders are slowing down. The bank had announced its plans to raise  ₹ 24,000 crore, the largest by any company, through a combination of preferential allotment and qualified institutional placement on 20 December. 
Of this, the bank will raise  ₹ 8,500 crore by selling shares to its parent Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd, India’s largest mortgage lender. 
The home financier owns 21.01% in HDFC Bank and will infuse funds in the bank to maintain its current shareholding.
The remaining  ₹ 15,500 crore will be raised through the sale of shares, convertible securities or depository receipts. 
“Given the high appetite for the bank’s shares among domestic and foreign investors, we don’t see an issue in the subscription of these shares,"" said Ashutosh Mishra, a banking analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd. 
The funds will be used to boost HDFC Bank’s capital adequacy ratio (CAR) and also grow its balance sheet over the next four years. The bank’s CAR, which stood at 14.8% as of 31 March, will cross 18% once the capital infusion is completed.
HDFC Bank’s balance sheet at the end of March stood at  ₹ 10.63 trillion, surpassing ICICI Bank’s balance sheet of  ₹ 8.79 trillion. 
The fund raising will come at a time when markets have been volatile due to foreign outflows, high crude oil price and rupee depreciation. FIIs have pulled out nearly $204.4 million from equity and $4.9 billion from debt this year.

Mumbai: HDFC Bank Ltd, the world’s most expensive major lender, is considering relying entirely on the Indian market for a share sale that could raise as much as  ₹ 15,500 crore ($2.3 billion), people with knowledge of the matter said.
The Mumbai-based bank is weighing seeking all the capital through a qualified institutional placement in India, rather than its usual practice of splitting the fund-raising between an offering of local stock and a sale of American depositary receipts, according to the people. HDFC Bank aims to start taking investor orders within the next couple of weeks, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
HDFC Bank is focusing on an offering in India because it hasn’t finished preparing its latest financial statements under U.S. accounting standards, which it would need for an American depositary receipt (ADR) sale, according to the people.
It wants to proceed with the fund-raising soon in order to take advantage of the current market sentiment, the people said. India’s benchmark stock index has posted four straight weeks of gains, the longest stretch since April, amid optimism that economic growth will be boosted by good monsoon rainfall.
The planned share sale would rank as one of the biggest-ever Indian equity offerings in local-currency terms, data compiled by Bloomberg show. HDFC Bank, helmed by chief executive officer Aditya Puri, has consistently maintained a low bad-loan ratio by limiting its exposure to heavily indebted Indian companies and lending to the country’s growing middle class.
HDFC Bank said in December its board had approved a potential equity offering of as much as  ₹ 24,000 crore, with its parent company Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd planning to invest  ₹ 8,500 crore. It will use the money to boost its capital buffers and support its growth plans for several years, deputy managing director Paresh Sukthankar said last week.
The lender is still waiting on some regulatory approvals before launching the share sale, the people said. The timeline could slip, and details of the offering may still change, according to the people.
A representative for HDFC Bank said he couldn’t immediately comment.
HDFC Bank appointed arrangers including Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG for the offering, Bloomberg News reported in March. It also appointed JPMorgan Chase & Co., Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd., IIFL Holdings Ltd. and JM Financial Ltd., people with knowledge of the matter said at the time.
The lender has the biggest weighting in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex. HDFC Bank trades in Mumbai at about 4.8 times book value, making it the most expensive among lenders across the globe with at least $50 billion in market value, data compiled by Bloomberg show."

Year to date, ICICI Bank shares have shed 8.28%.
On 18 June, ICICI Bank’s board said that CEO Chanda Kochhar, who is facing conflict-of-interest allegations, will go on leave until a committee investigating allegations of impropriety completes its work.

338,2018-07-17,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Bank also figures among the top 5 holdings for 133 funds. What makes the stock so popular?

HDFC Bank seems to be the most preferred stock to own in equity diversified portfolios. HDFC Bank is the top holding for at least 43% of the funds across nine equity diversified categories or 107 schemes and is among the top 5 holdings of 53% or 133 funds, as on 31 May 2018.  
HDFC Bank seems to be the most preferred stock to own in equity diversified portfolios. HDFC Bank is the top holding for at least 43% of the funds across nine equity diversified categories or 107 schemes and is among the top 5 holdings of 53% or 133 funds, as on 31 May 2018. 
If you compare this to fund holdings, say, a year ago, in June 2017, HDFC Bank was the top holding in 73 funds and three years ago it featured as the top holding in 68 schemes among diversified equity categories. 
The data throws two questions: what makes HDFC Bank stock such a consensus pick across funds and if most of the funds behave so similarly, then where is the distinction that active management ought to bring to the table? 
Consistent performance 
Out of 55 equity analysts listed on Bloomberg who track this stock, 50 have given it a buy, three recommend hold and two sell. It’s no wonder that mutual fund houses, that along with their own research also rely on these reports, are lapping it up. But that’s not the only reason, it’s also a lack of options. 
According to the equity head of a mid-sized fund house, who did not want be identified, “The bank has delivered consistent earnings for two decades and probably has disappointed the least in earnings season. Its weight in the index has gone up over the years and being underweight means taking a performance risk."" HDFC Bank is 10.25% of Nifty 50 and roughly 12.25% in Sensex. 
There is a lot of market uncertainty owing to both global and local factors. While the headline index value is moving up, rise in earnings growth in individual stocks has been selective. As a result, while some stocks are trading at very high or premium valuations, others don’t find enough demand. In a narrow market like this, replacing an 8-10% invested in a high-quality, high-earnings stock like HDFC Bank would mean finding at least 2-3 other stocks with similar performance expectation. 
“There is a willingness to hold HDFC Bank even at a slightly higher PE multiple as funds are evaluated on relative performance. It’s not just this stock, but if you see the top 10 holdings of schemes with large size, the list will look a lot like Nifty top 10 stocks. The choice is limited, no one has the courage to be under-allocated to HDFC Bank,"" said Vikas Gupta, founder and chief investment strategist – OmniScience Capital, an investment management firm. 
Experts suggest that HDFC Bank is a safe stock and under-allocation to it can lead to risk of under-performance in the short term. “For many it is a cyclical choice now. One wants to be comfortable in this market, which means owning stocks which are favourable today. With PSU banks suffering and Axis and ICICI Bank being out of favour, the options are limited in the sector,"" said another senior fund manager who did not want to be named. 
Active management alpha 
If many funds, despite their separate investment objectives and strategies, rely so heavily on allocating to one or even just a handful of similar stocks for 30-40% of the portfolio, then what value does that add for investors? 
Munish Randev, chief investment officer, Waterfield Advisors, a multi-family office and advisory firm, said, “Our analysis shows that the more diversified your fund portfolio is the closer you get to index-like holdings. The top 10 stocks from Nifty are available across MF and PMS (portfolio management services) portfolios. When you add up the overlapping stocks, single company exposure gets much larger in individual portfolios."" 
Individual client portfolios are analysed for stocks that unintentionally get too high an allocation and schemes which contribute more of that stock are replaced with other good schemes, he added. 
While such an approach reduces the risk of over allocation, it is not something that many retail investors can do. Often, investors rely on the stated fund strategy to choose differentiated schemes to benefit from excess return, thanks to the fund manager’s stock selection. 
If so many of them choose the same stock as the top holding of their portfolio or similar stocks form their top 5-10 holdings, that too mirroring holdings of popular indices, where is the excess return from active stock selection? According to one of the fund managers quoted above, “Being close to the index on one security can’t be the sole contributor to alpha, there will always be other stocks which do that. However, deviation from the index can take away alpha. The industry’s problem is that consensus stocks find favour. It is the job of advisors, distributors and industry analysts to bring this out and hold fund managers responsible."" 
Randev agreed that differentiation among schemes is reducing and exchange-traded funds can be a better option in categories where correlation in portfolios of active managers is high. However, there is comfort in consensus. “If your fund underperforms with HDFC Bank as a top holding you are less likely to be questioned and held responsible, than if it was a lesser known mid-cap stock as a top holding,"" said Gupta. 
It is not the stock you hold that matters, but how precisely you follow the investment strategy. A focused buy-and-hold strategy may have more merit than jumping into short-term opportunities and following the herd. Ajay Tyagi, executive vice president and fund manager, UTI Asset Management Co. Ltd, said, “Consistency in stock selection and staying for the long term is important. This might mean you stand out in certain market periods, but that discipline is important. Index funds have the benefit of being disciplined in a sense as index composition changes only once or twice a year. If active fund managers had that same discipline with better stock selection ability, it can work very well."" 
What should you do? 
While many funds having overlapping top holdings may appear as lazy investing, it is hard for an average investor to judge a portfolio at an individual stock level. Ultimately investors want outperformance. 
The overall risk-adjusted returns of the scheme is important. Over time, however, if the fund manager doesn’t differentiate the portfolio reasonably compared to the benchmark and others, it will get reflected in returns converging or even underperforming. If that happens consistently, the fund can fall out of favour."

Mumbai: The Rs24,000-crore capital raising will increase HDFC Bank’s capital buffers by 3 percentage points and help support the lender’s over 20% loan growth for the next few years, says a report.
The Rs8,500-crore infusion last week through a preferential allotment to parent HDFC will increase the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio by about 1 percentage points to 13.3% from 12.3 reported in March 2018, global rating agency Moody’s Investor Service said in a report on Monday. 
This is the first tranche of the Rs24,000-crore capital raising plan announced last December. “If the bank manages to raise the remaining planned capital, its CET1 ratio will increase by a total of 3 percentage points to 15.2%,"" it added. 
The capital infusion is “credit positive"" as it will strengthen its loss-absorbing buffers, while supporting balance-sheet expansion, the agency said. 
Moody’s vice-president for financial institutions group, Alka Anbarasu, further said even though HDFC Bank is more profitable than its peers, the internal capital generation “has lagged its risk-weighted assets growth"" in the past five years. 
The preferential share sale to the parent is part of a Rs24,000-crore capital raising plan announced earlier. The remaining money will be raised from overseas investors, for which the bank has got necessary government approvals. 
The bank has not yet revealed the exact timeline for raising the second tranche and the agency says it will not be difficult for the bank to raise the money from equity markets. 
“We expect that the capital raise will support HDFC Banks credit growth of 20-25% over the next few years. 
HDFC Bank is growing at a faster pace than other banks: its average loan growth has been 22% over the past three years, versus the average of 6.5% for the system,"" Anbarasu said."

Sticking with financial stocks and not chasing returns has helped Axis Asset Management Co. to ride the wave of volatility in Indian markets that has hammered many of its competitors.
The Axis Bluechip Fund is up 25% over the past year, beating nine index funds and 35 other actively managed portfolios to the mantle of India’s top performing large-cap fund, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its biggest holdings - HDFC Bank Ltd., Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. Housing Development Finance Corp. and Tata Consultancy Services - have contributed more than three quarters of gains on the S&P BSE Sensex Index this year.
“Our portfolio tilt toward very high-quality stocks has helped us ride out the market volatility,"" Shreyash Devalkar, senior fund manager at Axis, which has $12 billion in assets, said in an interview. The fund exited some smaller companies in December after a gush of inflows lifted valuations, he said.
Gains in Indian equities this year have been lopsided as investors sought safety in the biggest stocks amid headwinds from a brewing trade conflict and elevated prices of oil, India’s top import. A selloff in stocks of medium and smaller-sized companies was made worse by stringent margins requirements imposed in June. That’s left those smaller firms trading near the biggest discount to the Sensex in two years, according to Bloomberg data.
Axis expects a boost in government spending in India’s countryside ahead of next year’s general elections to benefit companies able to capture improved consumer demand. The government this month raised minimum assured prices for crops like cotton and rice to boost rural incomes and spending. “We are tracking earnings closely to see how consumer demand is panning out,"" he said, without naming the stocks he’s watching.
New Record
The Sensex is up more than 8% this year, surpassing a previous all-time high reached in January, after turmoil in the first quarter dragged equities into a correction. Despite the rebound, volatility may remain elevated amid uncertainty over international politics and in the run up to next year’s national ballot, Devalkar said.
Rising crude prices and its impact on public finances remains a cause for concern, he said. Brent oil held above $72 per barrel, up about 45% from a year ago, fueling concern inflation will quicken. India is the world’s third-biggest oil user and relies on imports to meet about two-thirds of its fuel requirements.
Prior to his fund’s outperformance over the past 12 months, Devalkar’s fund lost about 3.6% in 2016 compared with a 3% gain in the NSE Nifty 50 Index that year."

Mumbai: Bank stocks slipped today after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised interest rates on expected lines. The central bank has hiked the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.5% due to inflationary pressures arising from a hike in minimum support prices of crops. State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank fell 1-3% during the day. The BSE Bankex was down nearly 1%.

One basis point in one-hundredth of a percentage point.
According to Mint, the six-member monetary policy committee voted to keep its policy stance neutral, thus keeping the door open for future rate hikes. RBI also raised the average inflation projection for the second half of the year to 4.8% from 4.7% in June. The central bank expects inflation to edge higher to 5% in the first quarter of next fiscal year.
The monetary policy statement also cited the MSP hike for kharif crops as the primary factor stoking inflation this year. The government has fixed the MSP at 150% of the cost of production of all kharif crops.
According to a Mint poll of economists, a rate hike was expected in the monetary policy today.
Earlier Suvodeep Rakshit, senior economist with Kotak Institutional Equities, said: “We pencil in a repo rate of 25 bps in the August policy. Even as we call for a rate hike, the RBI may pause mainly to wait-and-watch if MSP hikes start to percolate to food prices and how inflationary expectations have evolved over the last quarter.""
Crude oil prices have declined from $75.3 per barrel to $74.2 per barrel from the last monetary policy in June. An agreement between OPEC members to increase oil production, concerns over global demand amid worsening global trade relations and increased production in the US have led to a decline in oil prices. However, sustained supply disruptions in Libya, Venezuela and Iran have capped the declines."

Mumbai: Paresh Sukthankar, deputy managing director (MD) and founding member of HDFC Bank Ltd has resigned, the private sector lender said in a regulatory filing on Friday. 
“Mr Paresh Sukthankar has tendered his resignation as deputy managing director of the Bank, to be effective 90 days from the close of business hours of today (Friday),"" it said.
Sukthankar’s resignation comes as a surprise as he was considered one of the front-runners to succeed MD and chief executive officer (CEO) Aditya Puri, who is set to retire in October 2020. 
At an analyst meet in May this year, Puri had laid down a road map for leadership transition at the bank. The bank will look at both internal and external candidates and will announce the name 12 months before the retirement deadline, he had said."

HDFC Bank Ltd’s managing director Aditya Puri Monday said that the bank will find a replacement for deputy managing director Paresh Sukthankar before the end of the month. 
In a call with analysts, Puri also said the position of deputy managing director will cease to exist after Sukthankar leaves. “That was recognition to the contribution Paresh made to the bank,"" said Puri.
Puri also denied rumours of any differences with Sukthankar and that the decision to leave was his personal choice. “It has been the most graceful exit. There is no acrimony, no differences of opinion,"" said Puri. 
Puri also assured analysts the functioning of the bank was not linked to any individual.
Sukthankar has been with the bank since its inception in 1994. 
He has been responsible for risk management, financial control and human resources. He was also one of the front-runners for the post of managing director after Puri’s retirement in October 2020.
“Paresh was a contender. But there would also be a search to find the next CEO,"" he added.
Puri also said the process of selecting his successor will start from March and that a new CEO will be in place 12 months before his retirement. 
“I don’t see any challenge to the bank’s fundamentals from a management transition or operations perspective. Considering Puri will be in charge at the bank for a couple of more years, he will ensure that it will be a smooth transition,"" said Suresh Ganapathy, director of financial services research at Macquarie Capital Securities India Pvt. Ltd.
Analysts say HDFC Bank may look at appointing an internal candidate as an executive director to replace Sukthankar. Currently, Kaizad Bharucha is the only executive director on the bank’s board.

Once users holding accounts with these banks accept the bank’s terms, the money will be transferred to their accounts.
“We have learnt that when we build for India, we build for the world, and we believe that many of the innovations and features we have pioneered with Tez will work globally,"" Caesar Sengupta said.
Google Tez, which was launched in September, will also expand services for merchants and retailers. About 15,000 retail stores in India will have Google Pay enabled by Diwali 2018, Caesar Sengupta said.
Google claims that over 1.2 million small businesses in India are already using Google Pay. In a bid to help their business grow further, Google is building a dedicated merchant experience where they will be discovered through Google Search and Maps, and communicate with their customers through messages and offers.
“We are testing these features with merchants in Bangalore and Delhi, and on-boarding more neighbourhoods in the following months,"" said Sengupta.
Google Pay has rivals in Paytm and Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp targeting the Indian payments market. On Tuesday, Mint reported that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has sealed a deal with Paytm, marking the legendary investor’s first investment in the country. A string of other big-name players are also expanding in India’s digital payments market including its banks, India Post Payments Bank, and Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio.
“The real competition is actually user habits and cash,"" said Sengupta. “So, all of us (referring to the other players) are all in many ways brothers-in-arms who are trying to move people’s habits away from cash to digital so that we can move India to a digital economy. At Google, we focus on the users so we don’t think so much of the competition.""
Since its launch, over 55 million people have downloaded Google Tez and more than 22 million people and businesses actively use the app for digital transactions every month, according to company data and figures quoted by Sengupta. Collectively, they have made more than 750 million transactions, with an annual run rate of over $30 billion.
The search giant also announced other initiatives including expanding its Google Station internet access programme to 12,000 villages and cities across Andhra Pradesh, potentially reaching 10 million people; the launch of Project Navlekha, where Google will work with Indian publishers to bring more relevant content online; and a new feature in Google Go app that can pull up any webpage and let users listen to it with each word lighting up as it is read."

Realme 2’s first sale in India will go live today at 12 pm. The budget phone by Oppo’s ex sub-brand was launched in India last week at a starting price of  ₹ 8,990 and available for purchase exclusively through Flipkart.
Realme 2: Price and offers
The Realme 2 is priced at  ₹ 8,990 for the 3GB RAM/32GB ROM version and  ₹ 10,990 for the 4GB RAM/64GB ROM version. The smartphone will be available on sale today from 12 pm. The offers on the phone include  ₹ 750 off on HDFC Bank debit and credit card,  ₹ 4,200 instant benefits from Reliance Jio along with 120GB additional data and no cost EMI.
Realme 2: Quick review
When the Realme 1 was launched, it garnered praised from a lot of critics for offering a great design and even better specifications at a starting price of  ₹ 8,990. However, it did cut a few corners to get everything in a rather well rounded package. For instance, the only biometric option available on the Realme 1 is face-unlocking, as it skips the fingerprint scanner. Face-unlocking, as we are all warned, isn’t the most secure way of unlocking your device. The second area it left us hoping for more was the dual camera setup, which allows for better portrait imagery.
However, its successor — the Realme 2 — has got us thinking about the whole point of letting out an “upgrade"" and that too, in such a hurry. Most phone upgrades are offered in an attempt to end a product’s life cycle, which ranges between a year and two. For instance, the Xiaomi’s Note and Samsung’s Galaxy S series are given a refresh after nearly every 12 months. A new upgrade is also announced when a product is not selling well.
The Realme 1 was launched three months ago, it is still selling particularly well and it is still not obsolete in any sense. So what has the now-independent brand packed in the Realme 2, that justifies such a quick succession?
Design and display:
To begin with, the design has remained largely unchanged – it features the same diamond cut back with a plastic coating and glossy metal railings on the side. The tendency of the phone to catch scratches on the back will make you put on a case or skin, which ultimately renders that rather unique diamond cut back useless.
The front of the Realme 2 features a notched display unlike its predecessor, which still provided an 18:9 display. The display size also received a bump, from 6-inches diagonally on the Realme 1 to 6.2-inches on the Realme 2. However, the overall resolution and hence the pixel density takes a hit here – the Realme 2 featuring a 1520x720 screen with a pixel density of ~241 ppi as compared to the 2160x1080 screen with a pixel density of ~402 ppi on the Realme 1. This means the Realme 1 has a superior screen overall, keeping aside the size part of the equation.
Hardware and performance:
The same story follows in the chipset area, which also happens to be my biggest annoyance. The refreshed Realme 2 features a Snapdragon 450, which is a step back from the Mediatek Helio P60 on the Realme 1. The P60 on the Realme 1 offered a higher clock speed and a higher RAM speed than the Snapdragon 450. To offer a worthy “upgrade"", the Realme 2 should have at least featured a Snapdragon 625, which still wouldn’t be enough to beat the P60.
Realme 2's performance while running Asphalt 9 pic.twitter.com/vJWeAub4H3
You wouldn’t notice the difference while performing casual tasks like web browsing, but as soon as you hit a snag on Facebook or Instagram, you’ll notice some serious lag. This also holds true for the gaming experience. I tried Asphalt 9 on the handset and I could immediately notice frame drops, which made handling my car extremely difficult. And to add insult to injury, this wasn’t even the highest graphics setting. Couple that with the RAM woes, and you’ve a couple of seconds of suspended animation while switching apps from the multi tasking window. It is important to notice that a model with higher RAM and internal storage might be on its way — at the end of the launch event it was announced that Realme has a surprise for us. Realme 1’s top-of-the-line model featuring 6GB RAM and 128GB variant was also launched this way.
Camera:
The camera is package is an upgrade from the previous model though. It now features a secondary 2MP depth sensor alongside the 13MP primary sensor, something that the previous variant lacked. I could only try the camera indoors on inanimate objects, but you can see that the portrait mode did a pretty decent job of defocusing the background from my pair of headphones. The selfies are also good for a phone this price. They are adequately bright and don’t have a lot of noise, even when clicking photos indoors.
The camera app, however, has quite a bit of lag. It takes a hiccup or two to get me to the photo gallery after I am done clicking a picture.
Connectivity and other features:
The new fingerprint scanner is great. It never misses a fingerprint and unlocks the phone in a jiffy.
Realme has skipped the USB Type-C port on this phone and I think it is not a decision that people might mind, as Micro-USB ports are nearly ubiquitous. It also comes with the headphone jack.
Price:
The Realme 2 costs nearly the same as the Realme 1 — starting at  ₹ 8,990 for the 3GB RAM/32GB ROM version and going up to  ₹ 10,990 for the 4GB RAM/64GB ROM version.
Verdict:
We feel that Realme 2 should be considered as a variant of the Realme 1, featuring a better camera, a fingerprint reader and a Snapdragon chipset which suits people who want those features instead of a faster chipset and a single way to unlock the phone."

The accused Sarfaraz Shaikh, alias Rais, has confessed before the police that robbery was the motive of killing the 39-year-old senior bank executive.
According to the police, Sarfaraz, who also worked as a cab driver, was desperately seeking to arrange  ₹ 30,000 to pay EMI for his bike loan. He tracked Sanghvi’s movements for a few days and found him to be a good target. Both of them worked in the same building.
Last Wednesday after Sanghvi left office, Sarfaraz attacked him with a knife in the parking bay with the intention of robbing him. A scuffle broke out between the two and eventually the bank executive lost his life.
The accused then stuffed the victim’s body in his car and disposed it at Kalyan in the neighbouring Thane district and dumped the car in Navi Mumbai.
As Sanghvi, a resident of upscale Malabar Hills area in south Mumbai, went missing after leaving office, his family lodged a police complaint. His phone was switched off by the accused. Three days later, Sanghvi’s father received a call from an unknown person trying to convince him that his son was safe and he need not worry.
His car, which was found by the police on Friday, had blood stains. On Monday, his corpse was recovered in a decomposed condition.
The cabbie was caught after police traced the phone call made to Sanghvi’s father. Sarfaraz changed the SIM card while making the phone call but used the same mobile phone handset while making the call.
He was interrogated by the police and then taken into custody during which he is alleged to have confessed to the crime."

Sanghvi, a vice-president of HDFC Bank, was killed on September 5 when he was about to get into his car to drive home after work. The cabbie said he wanted  ₹ 30,000 to clear his EMI for a bike loan.
On the fateful night, Shaikh was prowling with a knife in the parking lot to attack any of his three targets, whoever turned up first. It was Sanghvi’s bad luck that he was the one. “He (Sanghvi) just happened to be at that place when Sheikh was on the prowl.... It was sheer bad luck for Sanghvi,"" the police told HT.
When Shaikh got hold of Sanghvi in the deserted parking lot, the banker tried to resist, but by then a knife was already at his throat. Refusing to surrender, Sanghvi moved his head and his neck was slit. Police said the assailant then panicked and went on to stab the banker 14 times.
After Shaikh’s version was found to be the same by three different teams of interrogators, the police was convinced that he was the solitary assassin."

The NCD issuance is part of IL&FS’s  ₹ 9,000 crore capital raising programme for the current fiscal year.
Two persons directly aware of LIC’s investment plans confirmed this on condition of anonymity.
Debt-laden IL&FS, which is promoted by LIC, State Bank of India and a few other private and state-run lenders, is holding a crucial board meeting on Saturday to decide on capital raising needs, especially to avoid more defaults on repayments and rating downgrades.
The first of the two people cited above said that LIC is also willing to subscribe to a large part of the  ₹ 4,500 crore rights issue to be launched by IL&FS a few weeks later.
“IL&FS is looking to raise a total of at least  ₹ 9,000 crore through rights issue and loans. SBI Capital Markets Ltd is working as the investment banker-cum-advisor for IL&FS’ capital raising programme,"" said this person.
Emails sent to LIC, SBI Capital Markets and IL&FS on Thursday remained unanswered.
LIC holds 25.34% in IL&FS, while HDFC Ltd has 9.02%, Central Bank of India holds 7.67% and State Bank of India owns 6.42%. ORIX Corp. of Japan and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority have 23.54% and 12.56% stake in IL&FS, respectively.
The liquidity infusion by LIC, through NCD purchases and rights issue subscription, will be crucial for the country’s largest infrastructure development and finance company, which is in the process of building the country’s longest tunnel—the Chenani-Nashri tunnel (9.2 km) in Jammu and Kashmir—but is struggling to repay its debt.
According to its annual report, around  ₹ 5,756 crore worth of debt is coming up for repayment in the next one year for IL&FS.
As of 31 March, IL&FS’ total outstanding loans stood at  ₹ 91,091.31 crore, according to the annual report. This is about 14% more than its fiscal 2017 end borrowings outstanding at  ₹ 80,017.72 crore. Most of the debts arise from loans given by the group’s subsidiaries IL&FS Financial Services Ltd, IL&FS Energy Development Co. Ltd, IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd and IL&FS Maritime Infrastructure Co. Ltd. IL&FS has 24 direct and 135 indirect subsidiaries.
Of the total outstanding debt,  ₹ 57,322.15 crore is in bank loans (term loans and cash credit from banks) alone, mostly from state-run banks.
IL&FS Transport Network, the holding firm of the group’s road assets, alone has consolidated debt of Rs35,000 crore. IL&FS Financial Services has Rs17,000 crore of debt, classified as standard asset for most banks, according to a Nomura India report.
On Friday, The Economic Times reported that IL&FS will sell its corporate headquarters in Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex to raise funds. It is expected to fetch Rs1,300-1,500 crore, said the report.

The official said over 60 lakh cheque bounce cases are pending in the country and HDFC Bank has taken a lead by requesting the courts to use digital means to issue summons.
“We have been sending summons through e-mail, on WhatsApp. In many cases, we have seen that customers deny having received any summon at all if sent through post. “It also happens that people change residence more often but their e-mail IDs and mobile phone number do not change in general, so we thought this is an effective means of communication,"" the official said.
The bank has been adopting this method after a Supreme Court appointed amicus curiae recommended closure of proceedings in all cheque bounce cases through digital means. The offence falls under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act which defines and amend the law relating to promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques.
HDFC Bank has sent nearly 250 summons through digital means so far and hopes to settle the cases falling under the Act in a speedy manner, said the official. The summons sent digitally so far by the bank are mainly concentrated in Maharashtra, Gujarat, West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh. A few cases are related to accounts in Delhi, Chandigarh, Rajasthan and Jammu & Kashmir.
Majority of these summons have been sent on e-mail, a significant on WhatsApp while others have been sent on both platforms. Sending digital summon assumes significance as the pending cheque bounce cases in various lower courts is clogging the criminal justice system, the bank official said.
There are over 1.93 crore criminal cases pending across the country, as per the latest data of National Judicial Data Grid."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them.
For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help.

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow’s income today, and unlike other loan products such as to buy a house or pay for an education, the process involved is simple.
But you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan. This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset.
The loan amount and interest rate depend on parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others. As personal loans come with high interest rates, continuous default will put you on a downward spiral.
Here are some of the lowest personal loan interest rates offered by various banks."

Mumbai: Ahead of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) bi-monthly monetary policy announcement, top banks and housing finance companies, including State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank Ltd, Punjab National Bank and Housing Development Finance Company (HDFC) have increased their marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) and retail prime lending rate (RPLR) by 5-10 basis points. MCLR is the benchmark lending rate used to lend by banks and RPLR is used by non-banking finance companies. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point (bps).

MCLR is the benchmark lending rate used to lend by banks and RPLR is used by non-banking finance companies. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point (bps).
Rising interest rate regime
SBI, the country’s largest lender, increased its one-year MCLR from 8.45% to 8.50%. For an amount of  ₹ 30 lakh, the bank will now provide home loan at 8.70-8.85%, up from 8.65%-8.80%. 
ICICI Bank Ltd has increased its six-month MCLR from 8.50% to 8.60% and one-year MCLR to 8.65% from 8.55%. The bank offers home loan on both six-month and one-year MCLR. The spread on the home loan from the bank ranges between 30-90 bps depending on the type of loan, type of borrower and the loan amount. A spread is a margin that is above MCLR, which adds up to your overall home loan amount. 
HDFC is providing home loan at 8.80-8.85% for loan amount up to  ₹ 30 lakh, up from 8.70-8.75%.
In the last two policy reviews, the central bank increased repo rate by 25 bps each. According to banking analysts, RBI is likely to increase the rate during the Friday review as well. “We expect a 25 bps hike in repo rate in October policy and it may not be the last in the financial year. We rule out a hike of 50 bps, as it may spook the market. However, there is an outside probability of change in neutral stance too, as three successive rate hikes, with a neutral stance could contradict RBI’s message,"" said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser, State Bank of India, in a note.
What should you do?
If you are planning to take a home loan, you need to know that there are two types of loan options—fixed rate loan and floating rate loan. In a fixed rate loan, the bank gives you a fixed rate for a particular tenure. In case of floating rate loan, the interest rate will change depending on the interest rate cycle. Financial planners suggest that one should opt for floating rate loans. 
“No one can time the interest rates while taking a home loan. Moreover, housing loan lasts for a longer duration loan—over 20-year period. Hence, since there will be changing interest rate cycles, it is better to have a floating rate,"" said Suresh Sadagopan, a Mumbai-based financial planner. 
“Again, if you look at a typical home loan borrower, most of them end up prepaying the loan. Hence, there is no need to block it at a fixed rate loan,"" he added.
Remember that usually fixed rate loans are priced higher than home loan rates. Also, when it comes to prepayment, you may have to pay a prepayment penalty for a fixed rate loan. In case of floating rate loans, there is no prepayment penalty.
Besides the interest rate, you also need look at other charges when you opt for a home loan. 
Home loans usually have charges such as processing fee, administrative cost and franking charges. You need to factor in these costs and the interest rate before taking a loan.
As a borrower, you can also negotiate with a bank or housing finance company to waive off the charges if you have a good credit score. If you are an existing home loan borrower, you need to check your interest rate. If it is too high, try to convert into a lower rate through balance transfer. 
“It will make sense only if the new interest rate is lower by over 75 bps. However, if your home loan rate difference is say around 100 bps, in a competitive scenario, these do get corrected. If you are looking to do a balance transfer of your home loan, other than interest rate also check for the charges,"" said Sadagopan. 
Usually balance transfer works if your remaining home loan tenure is over 10 years."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow’s income today, and unlike other loan products such as to buy a house or pay for an education, the process involved is simple.
But you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan. This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset.
The loan amount and interest rate depend on parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others. As personal loans come with high interest rates, continuous default will put you on a downward spiral.
Here are some of the lowest personal loan interest rates offered by various banks."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

The Sensex extended Wednesday’s monstrous 600-point rally by rising for the third day.

Acting swiftly, the government on Tuesday appointed Shaktikanta Das, a former finance secretary, as new RBI chief, calming a jittery market.
Here are 10 updates from the stock market
1) In his first public comment after assuming the charge of RBI, Shaktikanta Das struck a dovish tone on prospects for inflation and also hinted that the RBI might adopt a more growth-friendly monetary framework under his watch. He also said that banking sector would be his key focus and more measures were needed to revive lenders. 
2) Financial stocks have led this round of rally on Dalal Street. Today, HDFC Bank, HDFC, Yes Bank, and SBI were among the top Sensex gainers. 
3) Adding to stock market rally, bonds also rose today after inflation eased sharply in November, bolstering expectations of a RBI rate cut sooner than expected. The 10-year benchmark bond yield fell to 7.38% in early trade from 7.41% in the previous session. Markets also hope for liquidity easing measures from the new RBI chief, who said that there was a need to interact with stakeholders on liquidity issues.
4) The rupee also strengthened as US-China trade tensions eased. The rupee also strengthened to 71.70 a dollar, compared with previous close of 72.01.
5) Data released yesterday after market hours showed consumer inflation falling to a 17-month low of 2.33%, driven by falling food prices, and below the RBI’s medium term target of 4%.
6) Falling oil prices in recent months have eased inflationary pressure on India, a major fuel importer. Since early October, Brent crude prices have dropped by nearly 30% to about $60 per barrel. This has also helped the rupee rebound from October lows of 74.48 a dollar.
7) Separately, data released yesterday also showed India’s industrial output expanded at an annual 8.1% pace in November, the highest in 11 months, compared with a forecast of 5.7%.
8) Some economists expect the RBI will change their monetary policy stance to ‘neutral’ in February from ‘calibrated tightening’ currently, making a rate rise less likely. The RBI may even ease monetary policy to support growth, they say. 
9) Global markets have also rallied on signs of easing China-US trade tensions and expectations that China will step up efforts soon to support its cooling economy. US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said trade talks were under way with China. A Reuters report said that China made the first major purchase of US soybeans since Washington and Beijing agreed to a temporary trade truce this month.
10) Trump also said he would intervene in a case against a top executive at Huawei Technologies if it would help secure a trade deal.

5 things to know about Dena Bank, Vijaya Bank’s merger with Bank of Baroda:
1. If total advances are taken into account, SBI has a 21.8% market share, HDFC Bank 8.4% and the merged entity of Bank of Baroda will have a 6.9% share. ICICI Bank will be relegated to fourth position with a 6.1% market share.
2. According to the share swap ratio, shareholders will receive 402 equity shares of Bank of Baroda for every 1,000 equity shares held of Vijaya Bank. For every 1,000 shares of Dena Bank held, investors will receive 110 equity shares of Bank of Baroda.

3. According to market analysts, the merged Bank of Baroda will have the second largest number of branches in India at 9,511. While BoB already has a widespread network, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank are more regional-focused banks. This will help BoB to strengthen its presence in the western, southern and north-eastern regions. Following the merger, the number of state-run banks will come down to 19 from 21.
4. The finance ministry says the amalgamation will help create a “strong globally competitive bank"" in the form of Bank of Baroda by utilising economies of scale and wide-ranging synergies of Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank. BoB will take over all businesses, assets, rights, titles, claims, licenses, approvals and other privileges and all property, borrowings, liabilities and obligations of the other two banks.
5. “The bailout of Dena Bank comes at a cost, and the swap ratio reflects adjustments for net NPA; and, hence, we conclude banks with stronger balance sheet are likely to fetch better value for their businesses (in this case Vijaya Bank) while weaker franchises, which are struggling with stressed loans and provisioning burden, are likely to be bailed out at a discount,"" Elara Capital said.
According to market analysts, while typical merger issues like cultural and social, network overlaps, relocations, and business team integration are likely to be an overhang on the near-term performance of Bank of Baroda, the back-end technology integration will be relatively smooth as all three banks operate on the Finacle CBS Platform."

276,2019-01-08,HDFC Bank,"That Bandhan Bank is paying top dollar for Gruh Finance has to do with the latter's parentage: HDFC owns 57.8% of the company

News of Bandhan Bank Ltd’s purchase of Gruh Finance Ltd sent the former’s shares crashing over 6% on Monday. From Bandhan Bank’s perspective, the merger share swap ratio of 2.84:5 is slightly better than what news reports had suggested. The dilution in its equity will be about 1.5% lower compared to a scenario where the share swap ratio was set at 3:5, which isn’t much to celebrate. 
News of Bandhan Bank Ltd’s purchase of Gruh Finance Ltd sent the former’s shares crashing over 6% on Monday. From Bandhan Bank’s perspective, the merger share swap ratio of 2.84:5 is slightly better than what news reports had suggested. The dilution in its equity will be about 1.5% lower compared to a scenario where the share swap ratio was set at 3:5, which isn’t much to celebrate.
Investors are seeing this as a desperate attempt by Bandhan Bank to reduce its promoters’ stake and meet the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) shareholding norms. If the deal materializes, Bandhan Bank’s promoters will own 61% in the bank, down from 82.3% currently. It still needs to do more to reduce promoter holding to 40%, to meet RBI’s rules.
This is particularly worrisome because coming to the halfway mark of the target has itself been an extremely expensive affair. For the deal, Gruh Finance has been valued at an exorbitant valuation of 13.6 times its net worth as on September 2018, while Bandhan Bank’s price-book valuation was pegged at less than half those levels at 6.45 times. This isn’t very far from the average share price of the two companies in the past six months.
Ironically, one of the reasons Gruh Finance enjoys such a high valuation is on account of its parentage. Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) owns 57.8% in the company. With the deal, Gruh Finance will actually lose this exalted status; although Bandhan Bank has ended up buying the whole company at high valuations.
HDFC, on the other hand, gets to sell its stake at a premium valuation. The actual monetization may happen at a later stage, although the share swap ratio ensures it has got itself a sweet deal. In fact, this gives it the best of both worlds, since it can freely pursue the low-income segment without worrying about overlaps with subsidiary, Gruh Finance. HDFC said that 18% of its lending in the first half of this year has been towards the low-income group and economically-weak sections of society, where the loan value is between  ₹ 8 lakh and  ₹ 10 lakh.
But it is not all thorns for Bandhan Bank. The lender is keen to grow its non-microloan book and what better way to do than grow low-risk housing loans. The merged entity would have the twin coveted markets of microloans and affordable housing loans.
And Gruh Finance has been reporting a reasonably strong performance. In the September quarter, the lender reported a neat 20% increase in profits and 18% growth in disbursements. It has the lowest proportion of developer loans, currently the pain point for housing finance companies. The stock has steadily risen and even managed to largely escape the meltdown in financial stocks during September.
And if the move helps Bandhan Bank get some leeway from the regulator, it may get some freedom to open new branches.
That said, the Bandhan-Gruh Finance deal alone is not enough to meet norms. The fact that Bandhan Bank promoters need to lower their stake further, coupled with a possible stake sale by HDFC, may act as an overhang on the stock."
277,2019-01-09,HDFC Bank,"The Bandhan-Gruh merger will result in HDFC's shareholding falling to around 15.44% in Gruh Finance and Bandhan Financial's shareholding will come down to around 60.27% in its bank

Mumbai: Bandhan Bank Ltd on Monday evening announced the acquisition of HDFC Ltd-owned Gruh Finance Ltd through a share swap ratio, in a deal effective 1 January 2019. Earlier on Monday, Mint had reported that Bandhan Bank and Gruh Finance were in advanced talks to merge the two firms, primarily with an objective to lower the bank’s promoter holding and expand its housing finance portfolio. 
Mumbai: Bandhan Bank Ltd on Monday evening announced the acquisition of HDFC Ltd-owned Gruh Finance Ltd through a share swap ratio, in a deal effective 1 January 2019. Earlier on Monday, Mint had reported that Bandhan Bank and Gruh Finance were in advanced talks to merge the two firms, primarily with an objective to lower the bank’s promoter holding and expand its housing finance portfolio.
Following board meetings of the two firms on Monday, Bandhan Bank in a stock exchange filing said the share swap ratio for the amalgamation will be 568 shares of Bandhan Bank for every 1,000 shares of Gruh Finance. This essentially means a share swap ratio of 0.6, or 3:5, between Bandhan Bank and Gruh Finance.
The Mint report on Monday mentioned that the merger will be consummated through a share swap deal in the ratio of 3:5 between Bandhan Bank and Gruh Finance, which means for every three shares of Bandhan Bank, shareholders of the bank will receive five shares of Gruh Finance.
Anup Kumar Sinha will be appointed as part-time chairman of Bandhan Bank post the merger with Gruh Finance, the company said.
The share swap ratio implies that the pricing for the Badhan-Gruh merger is in line with the six-month weighted average price of the two companies. HDFC and Bandhan Financial Holding Ltd’s (promoter of Bandhan Bank) stakes will come down after the merger.
On Monday, shares of Bandhan Bank tanked 5.21%, or  ₹ 27.55, to  ₹ 501.10 apiece on the BSE in a positive market. Gruh Finance shares lost 3.86% to close at  ₹ 306.20 apiece.
Bandhan Bank’s market cap stands at around  ₹ 60,000 crore while Gruh Finance has a market valuation of around  ₹ 22,436 crore. At these valuations, the combined entity will have a total market cap of around  ₹ 83,000 crore. The six-month weighted average prices of Bandhan Bank and Gruh Finance are at  ₹ 552.64 and  ₹ 318.50 apiece, respectively, on the BSE.
HDFC holds 57.83%, or 423.8 million shares, in Gruh Finance as the promoter, while Bandhan Financial holds around 82.28%, or 981.4 million shares, in Bandhan Bank. 
Since the merger is being carried out on the basis of six-month weighted average price, the Bandhan-Gruh merger will result in HDFC’s holding falling to around 15.44% in the holding company and Bandhan Financial’s holding will come down to around 60.27%. This final shareholding structure was formally confirmed by the bank on Monday evening.
“The share swap ratio has been arrived at based on the joint valuation report…by SRB & Associates and Desai Haribhakti & Co…supported by fairness opinion submitted by Kotak Mahindra Capital Co. Ltd,"" said the bank in the exchange filing. JM Financial Ltd gave the fairness opinion for Gruh Finance.
The loan book of the combined lending entity will have 58% micro loans, 28% retail home loans and 14% other loans, the company said in a release.
Sameer Kalra, equity research analyst and founder of Target Investing, feels that the merger with Bandhan Bank will negatively impact the business of Gruh Finance since synergies are low because of the firm’s average loan size of  ₹ 9.5 lakh and HDFC Ltd emerging as a strong competitor rather than support of the company, post the merger.
Since the proposed deal entails HDFC emerging as a co-promoter for Bandhan Bank, apart from being the promoter of India’s largest private lender HDFC Bank Ltd, HDFC will have to trim its stake further in the merged entity. RBI does not allow the promoter of one bank to hold more than 10% in another bank as a co-promoter.
To meet this requirement, HDFC is in talks with a clutch of institutional investors to offload at least 5.5% in the combined entity, according to the Mint report on Monday.
HDFC has a direct holding of 2.08% in RBL Bank Ltd, according to per BSE records, at the end of September quarter.
However, the Bandhan-Gruh merger won’t really solve the core problem for Bandhan Bank. To meet the bank ownership norms, Bandhan Financial will have lower its stake further from 60.27% to 40%.
In September, RBI restricted Bandhan Bank from opening new branches and ordered a freeze on the remuneration of its managing director and CEO Chandra Shekhar Ghosh for not meeting the bank promoter shareholding norms, which require Bandhan Financial to reduce its stake from 82.3% to 40%. The deadline to dilute the promoter holding was August-end.
Gruh Finance has total assets of  ₹ 15,970.97 crore, turnover of  ₹ 1,687.19 crore and a net worth of  ₹ 1,380.92 crore, as on 31 March, 2018. The home finance company, which is primarily focused on retail segment, recorded a net profit of  ₹ 220 crore in the first half of the ongoing fiscal.
Bandhan Bank has total assets of  ₹ 44,310.06 crore, turnover of  ₹ 5,508.48 crore and a net worth of  ₹ 9,382 crore as on 31 March 2018, the exchange filing mentioned.
The bank said the Bandhan-Gruh merger will result in enhancement of shareholders’ value, new product development, integration of technology platforms, enabling the two firms to further their socio-economic objectives.
The merger will also help the bank strengthen its housing loan portfolio and increase cash management efficiency, said the exchange filing."

Mumbai: Bandhan Bank Ltd’s merger with Gruh Finance Ltd appears to be a deal that was born out of compulsion and is anything but sweet for minority shareholders of the bank and the mortgage lender, analysts said.
The crash in share prices of Bandhan Bank and Gruh Finance following the merger announcement points to that effect. In the past two days, Bandhan Bank has dropped by around 10% to  ₹ 477.05 on BSE, while Gruh Finance, controlled by Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC), has plunged by around 20% to  ₹ 256.
The deal favours HDFC more than the shareholders of Bandhan Bank and Gruh Finance, according to five people that Mint spoke to.
For the Gruh Finance management, the merger discussions came as a surprise, said two of the five people directly aware of the Bandhan-Gruh Finance deal.
“There was never a talk about monetizing Gruh Finance. The discussion with Gruh (management) happened just two weeks back. The firm would have preferred to continue as a stand-alone entity. There was no reason for merging with anyone,"" said the first person, who is close to HDFC Group. “HDFC was getting a good valuation for selling Gruh Finance stake and therefore wanted to monetize the business. They were also entering the same business portfolio and would have been finding it difficult to explain to their stakeholders.""
Yes Securities (India) Ltd called the merger “a complementary but expensive fit for Bandhan"", referring to the price paid by the bank to acquire Gruh Finance."

HDFC Bank Ltd has a reputation of being a consistent performer and its third quarter results were no different.
The private sector lender reported a 20% year-on-year growth in net profit to  ₹585.85 crore for the quarter ended 31 December, in line with analysts’ estimate of  ₹5,605.70 crore in a Bloomberg survey of 19 brokerage firms.
The fact that profits came on the back of a 22% core income growth and a 4.3% net interest margin should please investors. Non-interest income also grew at a fast clip of 28% from a year earlier, aided by higher fee income.
But strong growth and profitability have become a given in HDFC Bank’s performance. In that, these metrics are hardly surprising for investors. What analysts were looking for is whether the lender has continued to weather the bad loan crisis that hit its peers, and whether it has managed to escape the impact of the strain in small businesses.
It certainly dodged the crisis triggered by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd, as it had negligible exposure to the beleaguered company. And the quality of its loans to non-banking financial companies remain pristine.
At the aggregate level, HDFC Bank continues to report enviable gross and net bad loan ratios. Gross non-performing assets for the December quarter were 1.38% of its loan book, slightly higher than 1.29% a year earlier. But ratios can reduce simply because of fast growth in total assets, which has been the case with the bank.
The lender’s loan book has been growing at a brisk pace of more than 20% and the third quarter was no different.
In the December quarter, the bank made 28% more provisions towards bad loans than it did a year earlier, which helped keep the net bad loan ratio at less than 1%.
That said, HDFC Bank has faced some heat on its agricultural lending and while loans to small businesses have also seen some strain, the management assured analysts in an earnings conference call that there is no material deterioration.
Either way, investors don’t seem to be too worried on asset quality as the HDFC Bank stock has gained more than 8% in the past one year and has outperformed the benchmark Nifty index, which has marginally declined. The stock trades at a multiple of a little over three times its estimated book value for fiscal year 2020, which doesn’t make it the most expensive among banks."

268,2019-01-28,HDFC Bank,"Debt repayments are becoming increasingly uncertain for the IL&FS GroupThe six funds include HDFC Short Term Debt Fund, UTI Banking and PSU Debt Fund and UTI Bond Fund among others

New Delhi: Credit rating agency ICRA has placed the ratings of six mutual fund schemes under watch with negative implications because of their exposure to special purpose vehicles of the IL&FS group where debt repayments are becoming increasingly uncertain, the agency said in a press release.
The funds are HDFC Short Term Debt Fund, HDFC Banking and PSU Debt Fund, UTI Banking and PSU Debt Fund, UTI Bond Fund, UTI Dynamic Bond Fund, and Aditya Birla Sun Life Short Term Opportunities Fund.
""The rating action takes into account the deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying investments of these schemes driven by their exposure to special purpose vehicles (SPVs) of IL&FS Limited. ICRA notes that the above schemes have exposures to IL&FS SPV, namely, Hazaribagh Ranchi Expressway Limited (HREL) or Jharkhand Road Projects Implementation Company Limited (JRPICL) or Jorabat Shillong Expressway Limited (JSEL),"" the note said. ""The default risks by various SPVs of IL&FS have increased given the recent communication by their management to trustees expressing to stop future repayments citing their interpretation of an order given by National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on October 15, 2018. Further, in January 2019, two SPVs of IL&FS demanded a refund of the debt payment executed by them post October 15, 2018, from their trustees. Despite a ring-fenced structure and adequate cash flows to service the debt obligations, the SPVs have asked the trustees to stop debiting the SPVs’ escrow account towards future obligations.""
Mint reported last week on IL&FS informing certain creditors that it does not intend to continue debt repayment, armed with an interim order from the NCLT.
As on December 31, 2018, the exposure of HDFC-STDF and HDFC-BPSU to HREL stood at 0.55% and 0.29% of assets under management of the schemes (AUMs), respectively. The exposure of UTI Banking and PSU Debt Fund, UTI BF and UTI DBF to JSEL stood at 6.87%, 5.98% and 6.25% of AUMs of the schemes, respectively.
The exposure of Aditya Birla Sun Life Short Term Opportunities Fund to JRPICL stood at 1.15% of AUM."
265,2019-01-29,HDFC Bank,"Your credit card is your boarding pass to first classYour bank may perhaps not have the best fit for you to maximize your spending

I have been using credit cards since 2001. My first credit card, from Citibank, landed in my snail mail. Many years later, that credit card was converted to a Jet Airways Citibank co-branded credit card (now discontinued), and this was where my journey of using miles for (almost) free air travel began.
A business-class ticket between Mumbai and New York’s JFK airport on Jet Airways, roughly about 16,000 miles flown, cost all of  ₹23,000 and 188,000 JPMiles back in 2011 instead of  ₹3 lakh when paid in cash. The best part is, most of those JPMiles for my ticket came from my credit card, and not from actual flying.
Credit cards today make it very easy for everyone to collect frequent-flyer miles. And yet, a lot of people I know are usually looking out for the cheapest credit cards, rather than ones that will get them the most miles and benefits they or their families can use.
When looking for options, look at the offerings across the market rather than just looking at the bank you have an existing relationship with—your bank may perhaps not have the best fit for you to maximize your spending. Moreover, private and foreign banks are going to have much better options than the PSU banks.
Another decision would be about what kind of rewards you want to collect. For instance, you could collect credit card points which can be transferred to different airlines or hotels, or you could go with credit cards known as co-brand cards, which transfer to one airline only.
JetPrivilege, India’s largest frequent-flyer programme, has a co-brand tie-up with four banks to help you earn JPMiles. Between HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank and American Express, they have 15 credit cards with fees to suit all budgets. ICICI Bank and American Express even have corporate credit cards for earning JPMiles. If you are a JetPrivilege Platinum tier, fees are waived on most JetPrivilege co-brand cards. JPMiles earned can then be used for redemption tickets on Jet Airways (even upgrades), Etihad, KLM, Air France and at least 20 other airlines that Jet Airways partners with.
At the top end, you can have the Jet Airways HDFC Bank Diners Club Black credit card, which would give you 24 JPMiles/ ₹150 spent booking Jet Airways tickets directly with the airline. HDFC Bank’s tie-up with JetPrivilege means you also get tier points in the JetPrivilege programme as you spend on their co-brand cards, making it easier to upgrade or retain your JetPrivilege status.
Vistara, on the other hand, has a co-brand tie-up with Axis Bank to issue credit cards. Each card comes with free tickets on payment of annual fees, and, if you opt for the highest variant, the Axis Bank Vistara Infinite Credit Card, you get Vistara Gold status and up to four free business-class tickets, one on payment of annual fees and one every time you cumulatively spend  ₹2.5 lakh on the card (up to  ₹7.5 lakh). On everyday spending, you earn Vistara points, which can then be redeemed for tickets on Vistara or Singapore Airlines.
In the case of Air India, SBI Card offers you a couple of options too. You can earn up to 100,000 bonus Flying Returns miles every year on spending on their co-brand card, which can then be used for redemptions or upgrades on Air India and Star Alliance member airlines.
However, if you are looking for an all-round product which helps you meet your travel and lifestyle needs and does not tie you down to one airline, there are some great options out there. Citibank issues the PremierMiles (entry level) and Prestige credit cards, both of which allow you to earn points which can be transferred to 14 airline partners and two hotel programmes. If you are a CitiGold member, you could get a 30% bonus on rewards earned through the year on your CitiPrestige Card.
American Express Platinum Charge Cards allow you to move Membership Rewards points to 10 airlines and a couple of marquee hotel chains such as Marriott and Hilton. HDFC Bank issues Diners Club cards in India, and it has been offering a lucrative promotion for many years now: You get up to 33% of your money spent as points at specific merchants, which can then be used to buy travel or transfer to partners such as British Airways, Jet Airways, Singapore Airlines, Trident Hotels and others.
To sum up, even if you don’t care about them, those reward points are piling up on your credit card. And you would perhaps be better off using them for a life experience (think flying your better half to Australia in first class!) rather than buying a toaster.

Property developer Rustomjee group of Mumbai will borrow up to  ₹1,100 crore from HDFC Ltd in construction finance to complete a luxury housing project that it took over from DB Realty last year.
Rustomjee has entered into an agreement with HDFC Ltd as strategic financial partner to finance a five-year-old project in Prabhadevi, which DB Realty had exited early last year due to funding issues. 
“Our arrangement with HDFC is for about  ₹1,100 crore. HDFC will be providing all the capital required for this development. Of course, sales will continue to support as well,"" Boman R. Irani, chairman and managing director, Rustomjee group said in an interview, adding the funds will be disbursed “as and when it is required"". 
The project, now called Rustomjee Crown, will have around 700 units of three to five bedroom luxury flats and is estimated to fetch  ₹5,800 crore. 
The apartments ranging between 1,330-2,528 sq.ft will be sold at  ₹8-18 crore. 
In 2009, DB entered into a joint development agreement with Bhishma Realty, a unit of the Thackersey family which owns the 5.75 acre mill land where the project is coming up. 
“Going forward, we will be responsible for everything. All decisions will be made by us. We will take control over the project right from funding to execution of the project,"" Irani said. 
Rustomjee on Tuesday relaunched the project that had stalled over the last one year.
As part of its marketing efforts, DB Realty had offered helicopter rides to its clients over the project site in 2016. The project later stalled due to various reasons, mainly lack of funding. 
DB Realty had invested  ₹1,200-1,500 crore through debt into the project, said a person, who did not want to be identified. 
The project has been conceptualized by leading architect Hafeez Contractor. Rustomjee has hired Bangkok-based interior design firm PIA as well.
“It gives me immense pleasure to be part of the launch of South Mumbai’s gated estate. HDFC Ltd is the strategic finance partner for Ruistomjee Crown and we are confident this project will refine the way homes and living spaces are imagined in this part of the city,"" HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said in the statement. 
Of the total 700 flats, around 250 have been sold. Rustomjee expects to complete the whole project by December 2022. 
Mint reported in November that more than half of upcoming luxury skyscrapers in Mumbai’s Worli and Prabhadevi are struggling to find buyers. 
Lower Parel, also in the vicinity, is facing similar problems as several residential high-rises have mushroomed in the midst of office towers in the last few years."

I am 40 years old and want to build a retirement corpus. I invest  ₹6,000 each in Franklin India Focused Equity Fund, ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund, ICICI Prudential Value Discovery Fund and Quantum Long Term Equity Value Fund. I intended to invest equally in large-cap, multi-cap, mid-cap and small-cap categories. However, over a period of time, the nature of these funds has changed. Please suggest one fund in each category (or new suggested categories) for 15-20 years, assuming a high risk-taking capacity. Also, I would be redeeming my 15-year PPF corpus next year. Please suggest ways to add the proceeds to funds.
—S.K. Abraham
While putting together a portfolio, it is not enough to picks funds from different categories—one must ensure diversity of investment styles among the funds chosen. In your current portfolio, three of funds follow a value investing strategy (of picking good companies at a fair or lower price). It would be better if you have one or maximum two out of the four funds following such a strategy, while the others can look for growth in the market. I would recommend you keep the ICICI Prudential Bluechip fund, and choose between Quantum Long Term Equity fund and Franklin India Focused Equity fund (both in the diversified category). For a mid-cap fund, you can go with L&T Mid-cap fund, and for a small-cap fund, you can choose Franklin India Smaller Companies fund.
Regarding deployment of PPF corpus that you will redeem next year, it would be easy to invest the proceeds in your four funds using systematic transfer plan (STP). Please divide the corpus into four parts and invest them in liquid funds in ICICI Prudential, Franklin Templeton (or Quantum), L&T, and (again) Franklin Templeton AMC. From there, you can set up STPs to your equity funds on a monthly basis. Please ensure that the quantum of money you transfer every month is such that the entire STP schedule gets completed in 12 months from the date of start.
I invest around  ₹33,000 in about nine funds, with 80% in equity and 20% in debt. During review, I noticed that a HDFC Midcap fund went down by 10% overall. Now that the markets are flat, should I remain invested in it or should I exit and book a loss because of poor performance?
—Abhishek Gupta
I assume you are referring to the HDFC Mid-Cap Opportunities fund. This is a stellar fund in this category and you should continue investing in it. Although this fund has gone down in the past year, that negative performance happened during a very bad time in the markets for mid-cap stocks. To compare, the benchmark Nifty Midcap 100 TRI went down by close to 15% in the same period. Even the peer funds in this category went down by close to 13%. Such is the nature of the mid-cap segment. If such volatility makes you contemplate selling, then you should consider lowering the overall risk profile of your portfolio.
Also, I note that you have nine funds for a  ₹33,000 portfolio—that is a lot of funds and you will do well to consolidate your holdings to 5-6 funds. You can use this consolidation exercise to wean yourself off high-risk funds such as mid- or small-cap funds.

260,2019-02-12,HDFC Bank,"City Union Bank Ltd., a small lender based in Kumbakonam, has risen more than 27% over the last twelve monthsCity Union had gross bad loans of 2.9 percent for the quarter ending December

Mumbai: A policy of cautious lending to the silk weavers and shopkeepers of Tamil Nadu has allowed a small local bank to outpace the largest Indian banks in terms of share price performance.
City Union Bank Ltd., a small lender based in Kumbakonam, has risen more than 27 percent over the last twelve months, the best performance of any Indian lender in the Bankex index after Axis Bank Ltd. It has beaten out larger rivals such as HDFC Bank Ltd. and State Bank of India thanks to its successful record in lending to small and medium sized enterprises, or SME sector, while keeping a lid on bad loans.
“They are the gold standard in SME lending,"" said Yuvraj Choudhary, an analyst at Anand Rathi Financial Services. “They have very good insight into how small industries work in their region.""
SME lending in India tends to be a higher margin business, because banks can charge hefty interest rates, but many avoid the segment because of the difficulty in assessing risks and the danger of piling on bad loans. Many of the country’s banks are struggling under the weight of a mountain of problem assets, denting their share prices and posing a threat to the wider Indian economy.
In addition, SMEs have been especially vulnerable to recent economic upheavals such as the temporary ban on high-valued currency notes in 2016, and the introduction of a nationwide goods and services tax the following year.
City Union had gross bad loans of 2.9 percent for the quarter ending December, below its regional peers and its larger Mumbai-based rivals. Meanwhile, its net interest margin of 4.4 percent puts it in the top quartile of India’s banking system.
Many of City Union’s customers are small businesses in Tamil Nadu’s textile industry, working on different parts of the supply chain from spinning and weaving to garment manufacture. The bank also lends to the retail and wholesale dealers selling anything from toothpaste to spare parts for trucks, whose shops line the streets of towns across the state.
“Unlike larger lenders, City Union does more relationship-based lending, catering to the needs of the SME borrower, which can be quite volatile,"" said Pankaj Agarwal, an analyst at Ambit Capital. “That’s why they can charge a premium in this relatively untapped segment.""
Another positive is City Union’s relatively stable history at a time when faster growing lenders with similar profit numbers have sprung unpleasant surprises. Yes Bank Ltd., whose shares have dropped 47 percent over the past 12 months, has only recently resolved a leadership crisis. IndusInd Bank Ltd., down nearly 9 percent, last year disclosed significant exposure to the troubled infrastructure lender IL&FS.
Still, a smaller ratio of low-cost deposits in City Union’s liabilities compared with its peers could weigh on profits at a time when money market rates are tightening. The bank’s cost of funds rose by eight basis points in the last quarter.
But the bank has never reported a loss and has always announced a dividend in each of the previous 115 years, according to Chief Executive Officer N Kamakodi. He said the bank insists on collateral in the form of land or buildings when it lends to Tamil Nadu’s SMEs, ensuring it nearly always gets its money back.
“By nature we are a conservative bank,"" Kamakodi said in an interview. “We run marathons and not 100 meter sprints.""

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help.
Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to Rs. 1 crore over various tenures."

255,2019-02-22,HDFC Bank,"IDBI Bank sees wilful defaults more than double—from  ₹3,600 to  ₹7,381 crore—between Decembers of 2017 and 2018Govt has asked all banks to set up a separate fraud prevention wing to detect potential wilful defaults at an early stage

Mumbai: Despite lenders using the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and other means to recover loans and check defaults, most of them have seen a substantial jump in wilful defaults in 2018, shows data from Cibil.
Lenders were told by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2017 to refer more than three dozen defaulting companies to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). According to data from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), 1,484 cases have been admitted to the bankruptcy court between January 2017 and December 2018. These include referrals by financial creditors and operational creditors, besides the defaulting companies themselves.
The sharpest increase in wilful defaults among public sector banks was at loss-making IDBI Bank, which saw wilful defaults more than double—from  ₹3,660 crore to  ₹7,381 crore—between December 2017 and December 2018. This is more than 13% of the bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs).
Other public sector banks, such as Bank of India (BOI) and Bank of Maharashtra (BOM), are not too far behind. While BOI has seen 60% year-on-year (y-o-y) jump in wilful defaults to  ₹9,785 crore, BOM witnessed a 41% increase to  ₹1,385 crore. While data for State Bank of India (SBI) and its associates was not available as on 31 December 2018, they had the largest chunk of wilful defaults till September at  ₹37,250 crore.
A senior banker at one of India’s largest public sector banks, requesting anonymity, said lenders have been recognizing several large defaults over the last year and the process could have led to figuring out which ones have wilfully defaulted. “Moreover, after the finance ministry asked us to probe all bad loans above  ₹50 crore for fraud, we did forensic audits for all. The ones showing traces of fraudulent activity have been classified as wilful defaulters.""
Among private sector banks whose December 2018 data is available, Kotak Mahindra Bank stands out with wilful defaults of  ₹8,757 crore, 22% higher on a y-o-y basis. HDFC Bank has seen little change in the past one year with wilful defaults at  ₹465 crore in December 2018.
Another banker who did not want to be named said the government has asked all banks to set up a separate fraud prevention wing to detect these cases at an early stage. “We are in discussions with the Indian Banks’ Association to form common guidelines with regard to fraud and wilful defaults so that banks do not follow different procedures.""
A borrower is tagged a wilful defaulter if he/she fails to meet repayment obligations despite having the capacity to repay. Other instances include not utilizing the loan for the specific purpose for which it was taken, and instead, diverting it for other purposes.
The RBI has also mandated banks to submit a list of suit-filed accounts and non-suit filed accounts of wilful defaulters of  ₹25 lakh or more at least every month to credit information firms like Cibil.
The evidence of wilful default is examined by a committee of high ranking bank executives. If the committee concludes that wilful default has happened, it issues a show cause notice to the borrower, and after considering their submissions, issues an order, which is reviewed by another committee comprising the managing director or the chief executive officer, and two independent directors. The order becomes final only after it is confirmed by this review committee."

252,2019-03-09,HDFC Bank,"At present some banks pay higher interest to the tune of 5-6 % on savings depositsThe bank has also linked all cash credit accounts and overdrafts with limits above  ₹1 lakh to the repo rate plus a spread of 2.25 %

MUMBAI :
A day after State Bank decided to link its short-term loans and large savings deposits rates to the repo rate, chairman Rajnish Kumar Saturday said loans and deposits below  ₹1 lakh will continue to be linked to the present MCLR to protect retail customers from market vagaries.
In a first, the nations largest lender had Friday said from May 1, it would link its savings accounts with deposits over  ₹1 lakh and all cash credit accounts and overdrafts or short term loans with limits above  ₹1 lakh or short-term loans, to the repo rate, which currently is at 6.25 %.
At present some banks like Kotak Mahindra, Yes Bank, RBL Bank and Singaporean lender DBS Bank pay higher interest to the tune of 5-6 % on savings deposits regardless of the balance, while large players like SBI and other state-run lenders, and private players like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and others pay 4 % per annum.
From May 1, the savings bank deposits with balance above  ₹1 lakh will earn an interest of 3.5 %, 2.75 % lower than the repo rate and lower amounts in balance will earn 4 %.
The bank has also linked all cash credit accounts and overdrafts with limits above  ₹1 lakh to the repo rate plus a spread of 2.25 %.
""The category which we have linked to the external benchmark is the best category--all cash credits and overdrafts above  ₹1 lakh. Here also, for accounts with  ₹1 lakh and below, we've kept out of the purview as we believe that retail customers should not be forced to suffer from the market vagaries,"" Kumar told reporters on the sidelines on event organised by Indian Chamber of Commerce.
He also said, across the world, retail loans are not left to the market forces alone when it comes to pricing and that it is mostly corporate accounts that are left to the market conditions.
He also said the move is in accordance with the RBI guidelines on the MCLR (marginal cost of fund-based lending rates) and other loan pricing norms.
Kumar said SBIs retail loans are currently priced as per MCLR and the system is working well and will continue to be remain so.
""Retail loans will continue to be linked to MCLR for the time being. If the loan is long-term in nature, you cannot re-price it very frequently...that way MCLR is a good solution,"" Kumar said.
He said by linking savings bank deposits rate to the repo rate, MCLR will get adjusted automatically as and when there is a change in the repo rate.
He, however, said MCLR will not move by 25 bps if there is a similar reduction by the RBI in the repo rate.
""It will depend on what portion of our savings banks gets repriced and its consequent impact on MCLR. To that extent the MCLR will get repriced,"" Kumar said.
Currently, the bank is offering a rate of 3.50 % for savings bank deposit rates up to  ₹1 crore, and 4 % above  ₹1 crore.
As much as 33 % of its savings account-holders will get the benefit of the new pricing system, the bank said.
On the thorny issue of swift monetary transmission, Kumar said liabilities are mostly fixed for banks and transmission on the asset side alone cannot happen.
""Transmission cannot happen only on one side. If transmission has to happen it has to happen on both sides and that is why SBI came out with this solution that the deposits savings bank account with 1 lakh and above, we will link it to repo rate and all the working capital loans which are theoretically payable on demand.
Talking about NCLT clearing ArcelorMittal's  ₹42,000-crore bid for Essar Steel rejecting the  ₹54,389 crore offered by a company run by the Ruias of Essar group, Kumar said they are awaiting the final order.
""The written order is yet to come. But our stand as well as that of the committee of creditors is that we abide by the order. The final process of the resolution of Essar Steel began with the NCLT order yesterday,"" he said.
Kumar said in the case of Jet Airways, whatever is the resolution plan, it will be implemented if all the conditions by all stakeholders--Naresh Goyal, lenders, Etihad and approval from the government, are met.

HDFC Bank’s steady 20% profit growth quarter-after-quarter as well as its immunity to the bad loans crisis have helped the stock. Investors continued to remain buyers in the stock due to its healthy asset quality, superior deposit franchise credit underwriting and structurally better net interest margin.

MUMBAI :
The Reserve Bank on Thursday said SBI, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank will have to comply with additional capital requirement norms by April 1 as the banks continue to remain 'too big to fail' lenders, referred to as D-SIB or domestic systemically important bank.
SIBs are subjected to higher levels of supervision so as to prevent disruption in financial services in the event of any failure.
""The additional Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) requirement for D-SIBs has already been phased-in from April 1, 2016 and will become fully effective from April 1, 2019. The additional CET1 requirement will be in addition to the capital conservation buffer,"" the central bank said.
The additional CET1 core capital requirement in case of the State Bank of India applicable from April 1 has been prescribed at 0.6% of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) while for the other two banks it is 0.4%.
The Reserve Bank had issued the Framework for dealing with D-SIBs in July 22, 2014. The D-SIB framework requires the RBI to disclose the names of banks designated as D-SIBs starting from 2015 and place these banks in appropriate buckets depending upon their Systemic Importance Scores (SISs).
Based on the bucket in which a D-SIB is placed, an additional common equity requirement has to be applied to it.
SIBs are seen as 'too big to fail (TBTF)', creating expectation of government support for them in times of financial distress. These banks also enjoy certain advantages in funding markets.

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow’s income today, and the process involved is simple. But you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan. This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset. The loan amount and interest rate depend on parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others. As personal loans come with high interest rates, continuous default will put you on a downward spiral.

246,2019-03-20,HDFC Bank,"In the eighth episode of Brand Studio Live—a series that gets the brains behind India’s top brands to decode marketing innovations and more—seven brand custodians established that transparency and customer-centricity play an important role in fostering brand trust

A brand is simply trust, proclaimed Steve Jobs once.
The statement has gathered huge momentum today, when more and more consumers engage with brands on the internet. Although the internet has its own set of perks when it comes to reaching out to customers, it also raises a question mark on brand authenticity.
How, then, do brands go about gaining customers’ trust in the digital era?
The same was taken up for discussion at the eighth edition of HT Brand Studio Live—a series that gets the brains behind India’s top brands to decode marketing innovations and more.
This episode marked the Mumbai Chapter of Brand Studio Live, where the show was webcast from the iconic BSE instead of the HT newsroom.
Speaking at the session on Tuesday, Pankaj Gupta, chief marketing officer and head of strategic alliances, credit life, speciality sales and government business, HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd, said: “There are three trust elements that every brand needs—transparency, customer-centricity, and reliability.""
Trust is especially crucial in the financial services sector because of the monetary and emotional investments involved. According to the 2015 Edelman Trust Barometer, banking and financial services are the least trusted of industries, compared to technology, consumer electronics, or food/beverages.
“If people trust you with their savings of a lifetime, then your responsibility level automatically goes up several notches,"" said Asha Kharga, chief marketing officer at Axis Bank.
For Kharga, the “human quotient"" also plays an important role in gaining a customer’s trust. “Always humanize a brand. In the banking industry, the human touch is still important,"" the ace marketer said.
Shankar Jadhav, managing director, BSE Investments Ltd, highlighted how “timeliness"" also matters in the financial services sector.
“Trust is built in the financial services sector if you are prompt in letting people know of all developments,"" he said, while also outlining how BSE—which is the world’s fastest stock exchange—contributed towards the growth of the Indian economy.
Venkat Mallik, co-founder and chief strategy officer at Tidal7 Brand Digital, however, pointed out that brand relevance matters as much as brand trust in the digital era.
“A lot of brands have lost value not because people lost their trust in them, but because they have lost relevance,"" he said, adding that brand relevance begins with “making conversations with people that matter.""
In the same vein, Sharad Mathur, head (sales and distribution) at SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd, said: “Today, customers are well-informed and intelligent; they expect as well as cherish interactions with a brand. They leave queries for companies online, and expect them to be answered immediately.""
Discussing how trust is built in the mutual funds space, Balaji Vaidyanathan, marketing director at Franklin Templeton Investments, said: “Trust is closely linked to transparency in the mutual funds space. In other words, customers must not be in the dark about where their money is being invested.""
The show ended with HT Digital Streams CEO Rajiv Bansal shedding light on how trust is fostered in the news industry. “Timeliness is of essence in the digital newsroom. You cannot build brand trust without it,"" he said. Bansal also emphasized that customer loyalty is a byproduct of brand trust.

245,2019-03-26,HDFC Bank,"Axis Bank CEO Amitabh Chaudhry is making all the right noises on strategy, RoE target of 18% by FY22 now seems achievable Axis Bank shares have risen 20% so far this year, while stocks of larger rivals HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank have grown 9% each

Investors can’t stop piling up on the stock of Axis Bank Ltd, India’s third-largest private sector lender. Part of this is driven by the hope that the bank’s new CEO will narrow the gap with the top private sector lender, HDFC Bank Ltd.
Axis Bank’s stock has risen 20% so far this year, while HDFC Bank and second-ranked ICICI Bank Ltd haven’t managed to notch up more than 9% increase, each. Axis Bank’s new managing director and chief executive officer (CEO), Amitabh Chaudhry, is making all the right noises on strategy, and analysts seem to have bought the idea that the bank’s return on equity target of 18% by 2021-22 is achievable. 
The bank’s management made a presentation to analysts last week, wherein Chaudhry outlined a cautious game plan, which was laced with enough aggression.
“I did not come here and appear for the interview to remain No. 3. Let me put it that way,"" Chaudhry told The Hindu Business Line newspaper. This reveals much about his aggression. But he is not willing to compromise on the quality of the assets either, which is a heartening sign.
Especially so, since the lender saw its worst year in FY18, which ended with a massive loss of  ₹2,188 core for the March 2018 quarter. This was a direct fallout of its past mistakes of taking on too much risk. Axis Bank has been on the mend ever since, consciously hacking off the dodgy BB-rated loans and bringing down the share of even loans rated BBB. Its slippages have been on the decline, and it has built a reasonable insurance against risk, with a provision coverage ratio of 75%.
Under the new leadership, the lender is clear that project financing is a strict no-no and new borrowers need to be strong, if not pristine, on credit quality. At the same time, the bank is firing on all cylinders to grab retail business as well as growth in working capital financing.
But falling risk tempers returns. Axis Bank is chasing good credit and more retail loans at a time when interest rates are poised to slip. Ergo, analysts are expecting margins to compress going forward.
Besides, a superior performance under the new leadership has already been factored in by the Axis Bank stock when Chaudhry took over in January. In fact, the recent surge in the stock price looks like an overkill. The stock trades at 2.5 times its estimated book value for FY20, more expensive than ICICI Bank’s 2.1 valuation. This is beginning to make some investors edgy.
Also, not all analysts believe that Axis Bank’s performance would improve markedly from previous quarters. Citing that the stock is priced to perfection, Centrum Broking Ltd said, “While we are optimistic that management will deliver on guidance for the long term, we remain circumspect about the near to mid-term outlook."""
244,2019-03-29,HDFC Bank,"The ED told the special court that it had no objection to allowing banks to sell Mallya properties provided they gave an undertaking The special PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) court did not take up the petition and fixed 2 April for the next date of hearing

MUMBAI :
A day after the SBI-led bankers consortium raised  ₹1,008 crore by selling 7.4 million pledged shares of United Breweries, their bid to recover more money by liquidating shares of United Spirits faced opposition from HDFC Bank which moved the special PMLA court here against it.
The special PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) court did not take up the petition and fixed 2 April for the next date of hearing.
At Thursday's closing price of  ₹532.20 on the BSE, these 6.6 million shares could fetch the banks over  ₹350 crore.
Banks are seeking court permission to liquidate 65.85 lakh shares of United Spirits which were pledged by two Vijay Mallya companies -- United Breweries Holdings (UBHL) and Kingfisher Finvest, the holding company of the defunct Kingfisher Airlines -- as collateral for loans from HDFC Bank.
The banks are trying to part-recover the  ₹6,203.35 crore of dues along with annualized interest of 11.5 per cent payable since 2013, by liquidating the confiscated assets of Mallya, who is awaiting an extradition case at the London High Court now.
In its application moved before MS Azmi, the judge of the PMLA court, HDFC Bank said as part of its business operations it's been extending loans to United Breweries since 1980. Similarly, in 2010 various loans were given and these were secured by shares and various immovable properties.
United Spirits (USL) is majority owned by British spirits major Diageo since 2013 after Mallya sold controlling stake in the country's largest spirits maker.
Under the share pledge agreement for the loan from HDFC Bank, UBHL and Kingfisher Finvest had pledged a total of 65.85 lakh shares of United Spirits in favour of HDFC Bank, the application noted.
HDFC Bank further claimed that the exclusive charge over the attached shares, especially USL shares, was disclosed in the 2011-12 annual report of UBHL.
The application states that it is not the case of consortium of banks that UBHL or Kingfisher Finvest had created a pledge in their favour, prior to creation of pledge in favour HDFC Bank.
The contention that dues of HDFC Bank are not adjudicated and hence they cannot claim right over the pledged share of USL is 'baseless' and 'unfounded', the HDFC Bank said.
Earlier, a 12-bank consortium led by State Bank had moved the PMLA court seeking release of Mallya's assets that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had attached.
The banks claimed ""legitimate interests"" in all the properties belonging to Mallya, Kingfisher Airlines, UBHL and Kingfisher Finvest including movable and immovable properties.
The ED told the special court that it had no objection to allowing banks to sell Mallya properties provided they gave an undertaking that they would return the money later. But this was opposed by the official liquidator appointed by the Karnataka High Court.
Later in January this year, Mallya, who owes over  ₹9,900 crore to banks, was declared as an fugitive economic offender under the provisions of the new Fugitive Economic Offenders Act which came into existence last August. This facilitated the PMLA court to allow banks to sell the stocks.
It can be noted that the official liquidator of the Bengaluru Debt Recovery Tribunal had Wednesday sold 74 million pledged shares of United Breweries, currently owned by beer major Heineken, for  ₹1,008 crore on behalf of the ED.
The proceeds would go to the banks. This is among the big recovery action taken by the authorities since Mallya left the country in March 2016.
These shares, which were pledged with Yes Bank, were attached by the ED in connection with money laundering probe involving Mallya and debt-laden Kingfisher Airlines.
The sale could go on after the PMLA court had last month directed Yes Bank to surrender these in favour of the recovery officer in Bengaluru within three weeks.
Mallya personally held 7.91% in UBHL as of December 2016, while total promoter holdings stood at 52%. UBHL is now facing liquidation. The ED attachment included 41.3 million UB shares or almost 15 per cent held by Mallya and his group companies.
Currently Heineken holds about 44% in UB, once controlled by Mallya, while 23% with UB promoters and promoter groups are pledged.
So far, the ED has attached assets of Mallya worth  ₹9,700 crore in connection with an alleged IDBI Bank loan fraud case registered by the CBI.

MUMBAI :
Bank of Baroda on Monday said the amalgamation of Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank it from Monday is unlikely to bring in much changes in the financials of the combined entity, including non-performing assets.
The three-way merger, the first in the country, makes BoB the third largest lender after State Bank of India and HDFC Bank, and the second largest among state-run banks, with a combined business of  ₹15 lakh crore, of which deposits are  ₹8.75 lakh crore and advances are at  ₹6.25 lakh crore.
""Looking at capital adequacy ratio for December 2018 quarter, the numbers don't change magically as the pluses of one (Vijaya) are offsetting the minuses of the other (Dena). So net numbers of the combined entity is close to where BoB has been in terms of core capital,"" managing director & chief executive PS Jayakumar told PTI in an interaction.
He said as of the December quarter, CET1 of BoB was 8.65% and on a consolidated level it would be 8.67 percent. Of this, on a standalone basis, BoB's tier 1 capital stood at 9.86 %  and at the combined level it would also be 9.86% .
As far as net NPA is concerned, for BoB it was 4.26% in the December quarter. Given the fact that Dena has much higher NPAs, the new NPA numbers for the combined entity is marginally higher at 4.80%, he said.
""Yes, net NPA has increased but it is not a blow up by any means, and at 4.8% but this is something that we can address over the next two quarters,"" Jayakumar said.
He said in absolute terms, net NPA of BoB stood at around  ₹19,000 crore and this would move to  ₹30,000 crore on a combined basis and he hopes to see improvement in the combined numbers from the first quarter of FY20.
""We are at the end phase of NPA-related challenges. In general, everybody is expecting the recovery cycle to begin from now on. I'd think that positive movement should start from the March quarter itself,"" he said.
Ahead of the merger, government had infused  ₹5,042 crore capital into the bank, and he said he will not require any immediate capital.
From now on, all customers of Dena Bank, which is under prompt corrective action of the RBI, will have renewed access to credit facilities immediately, he said, adding credit growth of BoB and Vijay have been at 15-18% and it will continue to grow at the same pace.
Jayakumar said plans are also afoot to build on the strengths of individual banks and their gain from their synergies and scale up operations by deepening relationships with a wider customer base.
By the end of this month, BoB will bring in interoperability of the key banking services at all the 9,500 branches of the combined entities which would now be known as BoB also the 13,400 ATMs.
He said IT integration is expected to be completed over the next 12-18 months when accounts of all three banks will be migrated to single core-banking system. BoB is now on the version 10 of Finnacle, while Dena and Vijaya are on a different versions of Finnacle.
Ruling out a massive branch mergers, Jayakumar said in rural areas the overlaps are very thin, but in around 1,000 urban centres, the bank will be looking at relocating branches to areas.
Similarly, he also ruled out retrenchment as he does not see redundancy in extra-staff as there are many sectors where BoB is not present and would now focus on those areas. The combined entity will have a workforce of over 85,000.
""Our total number of employees is not going to shrink. We will, in fact, be in an expansionary mode as we need different kind of talents such as a larger outbound sales force, more competencies in analytics and artificial intelligence,"" he said, adding so there is not plan on the table to bring in a voluntary retirement scheme.
Amalgamation of Dena and Vijaya with BoB is the second merger during the past five years. The State Bank had merged five of its associate banks--that of Patiala, Bikaner & Jaipur, Mysore, Travancore and Hyderabad as also the Bhartiya Mahila--in April 2017, making SBI the 48th largest lender in the world with a balance sheet of USD 500 billion.

A subsidiary of RPG Group, KEC International, is one of the leading engineering, procurement and construction companies in India. Its ability to estimate project cost at the time of bidding helped it win projects, deliver margins and mitigate risks. These estimates were based on the analysis of contour maps and physical surveys, which was both time-taking and prone to human errors. After trying out several alternatives, KEC decided to go with autonomous surveys using drones. Once the data was captured, it used image analytics, computer visions, and machine learning models to calculate excavation and backfilling of land. This allowed its bidding team to estimate project costs more accurately and this improved its bid-to-win ratio significantly. In terms of cost savings, the spending on excavation and backfilling quantity was reduced by up to 30%. Now KEC can survey 250 acres in five hours, which earlier took more than five days. This has also allowed it to build a repository of data in digital format for future use.
Internet of Things (IoT): Voltas Ltd
Voltas has seen immense benefits by using IoT to gather data to perform preventive and predictive maintenance of its cooling equipment. Providing services to a fragmented enterprise customer base of 3,500 across 45 locations in the country was proving to be a major challenge for the company. That is when it decided to turn away from a reactive after-sales service, where it had to be informed by the customer of the breakdown, to an I-T-based predictive and preventive maintenance system where all connected Voltas equipment share real-time data with their engineers, allowing them to remotely keep track of the equipment’s health. This not only helped them prevent failures but also ensured customers’ business remained unaffected by breakdowns. According to Voltas, the general turnaround time is 10-12 days, but with the help of IoT, it has managed to bring it down to three days. In terms of cost savings, this has allowed the company to reduce raw material and overhead rationalization by 10% and has led to revenue growth of 15% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) since deployment.
Robotic process automation (RPA): HDFC Bank Ltd
HDFC Bank processes around five million loan applications across multiple locations every year. The average processing time for each loan request was over 45 minutes as everything from application indexing, data entry, document verification and underwriting forward was being done manually. By using RPA, HDFC Bank has automated the data capturing process. Loan processing across all locations is now placed in a centralized server where real-time loan processing status would be visible to all credit administrators. It has also allowed the bank to allocate the cases to credit managers based on the nature of loan, location and eligibility.
This has reduced the turnaround time for processing loan requests by 50%, offering the bank the opportunity to scale up and handle more customers. The tangible benefits of RPA have been the improvement in productivity of data entry staff by 40% and decision-making staff by up to 12%. This has also minimized the scope for manual errors, resulting in better credit quality decisions.
Blockchain: ICICI Bank Ltd
ICICI Bank has emerged as one of the first banks in India to use blockchain for paperless trade process that is safe and secure. The platform is being used for exchange and authentication of overseas transactions and international trade documents. The switch to blockchain has helped the bank reduce the turnaround time of trade cycles, leading to better management of cash flow and inventories. It has also made transactions more transparent as auditing and tracing of blockchain transactions is a lot easier.
The bank hopes this will bring in new asset classes and open up new revenue generation opportunities for it. On a daily basis, the bank is processing all overseas transactions between India and Canada via blockchain. So far, it has processed Canadian $32 million on the platform. Another area where the technology has helped the bank is in trade, which is a paper-intensive process. The bank is looking at how to create a digital letter of credit within 10 minutes.
Augmented reality (AR)/Virtual reality (VR): Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd
In the intermediate commercial vehicles industry, most customers are single vehicle owners or driver owners, who usually rely on feedback or advice of friends and peers when it comes to buying new vehicles, since most original equipment manufacturers in the industry do not provide ownership experiences to them. Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) is using VR to provide individual buyers a more personalized experience.
The automaker’s VR platform provides 360-degree videos of the working of its Furio trucks in real-life environment. It puts the customer in the co-passenger seat while the driver can explain the various features of the truck. It includes a VR headset developed by Procus and a Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro smartphone that comes preloaded with a Furio VR App and mobile device management service.
It is being used for customer/driver meets or local events and during individual customer showroom/office visits. M&M is hoping the use of Furio VR will help improve the conversion ratio of leads to sales and save around  ₹15-30 lakh per dealership."

Corporate earnings for the March quarter and elections are expected to be key drivers of equity markets in this truncated week. Indian markets are shut for trading on Wednesday and Friday. Most analysts expect volatility in the markets is likely to continue till general elections are over.
Jimeet Modi, Founder and CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote, said the current corrective phase in the markets has just begun and it may last till the middle of May, however, the undertone of the market will not be weak. ""The amount of price correction would be difficult to estimate but the markets will take their own time till May to correct. The markets are witnessing a whipsaw phase where neither the bulls nor the bears could make headway during the week. This is typically a corrective phase which the markets are undergoing after witnessing a strong rally. Statistically, similar such corrections in the past have taken around a month’s time.""
As India is set to see a new government post elections, analysts and investors will be keenly watching out for commentary and guidance by companies, which are expected to be indicative of economic and business growth. The surge in crude oil prices in the January-March period is expected to further delay a recovery in corporate earnings.
While private banks, cement and utilities, which have been a drag on earnings, are likely to post good numbers, the performance of former champions such as metals, auto, retail, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) is likely to moderate in Q4FY19, Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a 5 April note.
Major companies that will declare Q4 earnings this week are Reliance Industries, Wipro, HDFC Bank, RBL Bank, Mindtree and ICICI Lombard General Insurance.
This week investors are likely to react to TCS and Infosys stocks as the IT majors announced their March quarter earnings after market hours on Friday.

For the full year FY19, Infosys has posted 9% revenue growth in constant currency terms versus a guidance of 8.5- 9% and EBIT margin of 22.8% versus guidance of 22-24%. It has provided 7.5-9.5% growth guidance and has lowered its margin guidance by 100 basis points (bps) to 21-23% for FY20 – both lower than the street’s expectations. Analysts believe that lower-than-expected growth and margin guidance may lead to a cut in street’s earnings estimates.
“We believe Infosys is being conservative in terms of its revenue guidance for FY19, given that YoY constant currency growth was 11.7% in Q4FY19, with robust order wins also reflecting underlying revenue strength,"" Reliance Securities Ltd said.
TCS ended FY19 with full-year constant currency (CC) revenue growth of 11.4% YoY, EBIT margin of 25.6% and net income growth of 22.5% YoY.

Consumer inflation rose at a faster pace than anticipated in March, but remained below the central bank's target for an eighth straight month, increasing the chances for a key interest rate cut in June.

The private sector lender, which focuses on retail consumers and has a relatively small exposure to the troubled infrastructure sector, has been able to tame its bad loans and stay profitable at a time when high levels of soured assets have swept the sector.
HDFC Bank is the first major Indian lender to report results for the final quarter of the year.
Overall its loans grew 24.5 % as of end-March, of which domestic retail loans climbed 19 %.

229,2019-04-22,HDFC Bank,"Puri may have to hang up his boots in FY21 as the age limit for top banking executives to hold office is 70 yearsIts March quarter and full-year earnings released on Saturday show that its bad loan stock is under 2% of its loans and its net interest margin remained at 4.4%

MUMBAI :
What happens to a bank with a stellar performance if the leader behind the strong run has to leave? Investors of HDFC Bank Ltd have a year and a half to find the answer.
HDFC Bank’s chief Aditya Puri may have to hang up his boots midway in FY21 due to a rule that sets 70 years as the maximum age for top banking executives to hold office.
Some analysts fear that Puri’s shoes are too large to fill, and a fitting successor is yet to emerge after his deputy Paresh Sukthankar left last year. Under Puri’s watch, HDFC Bank became the largest lender and even the most valued. It has consistently bucked the broad sector trend for many years now.
Even in FY19, when most other lenders had a troublesome run, HDFC Bank reported profit growth of 20.5%, something investors have taken for granted now.
Its March quarter and full-year results released on Saturday show that its bad loan stock is under 2% of its loans and its net interest margin remained at 4.4%. Its comparable private peers are likely to report ratios far worse and public sector lenders even more so.
It is no surprise there is a view that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should perhaps look at the age limit again. Ashvin Parekh, an independent banking expert, says that since public sector lenders are still not out of the woods, chiefs of private lenders should be allowed to continue, simply because continuity is critical for sustained balance sheet performance.
After all, a moot point in the dismal performance of public sector lenders is that their chiefs have short tenures. But tenures too long haven’t gone without their issues too. A case in point is ICICI Bank, the head of which is under investigation for violation of lending norms. Chanda Kochhar was chief of the lender for a decade before she quit against the backdrop of allegations of granting loans to the Videocon group as a quid pro quo for the business group’s dealings with her husband Deepak Kochhar.
But the biggest challenge in allowing bank chiefs to serve too long is succession planning.
“Extending is just postponing the issue for some future date. Succession planning is more critical. There is no point in having a dilemma over a successor, especially if you are a listed company,"" said Abizer Diwanji, partner and national leader of financial services at EY India.
A sense of continuity can be given to investors through succession planning. Parekh says talent always emerges either from within or outside the organization and succession planning isn’t a make-or-break event. For instance, both ICICI Bank and Axis Bank found new chiefs despite sudden departures. Investors have taken a sanguine view on the lenders after the new executives took over. In that regard, HDFC Bank is in a far better place as Puri’s exit date is known.
To be sure, HDFC Bank has kick-started the process to find a successor to Puri.
But talk that RBI should consider extending the tenure of bank CEOs must be nipped in the bud. As Chuck Noll, the famous coach who won a record four Super Bowl titles once said, “Everyone’s job is important, but no one is indispensable.""
HDFC Bank’s rich valuations on the Street also show that investors aren’t worried too much about its prospects despite the impending change of guard."

March quarter earnings and elections are going to drive markets movement this week. In the global markets too, earnings will be key for equities. This week will go a long way in determining whether investors should be concerned about the dawning of an earnings recession or whether back-to-back quarters of negative growth can be avoided in what is the heaviest week for profit reporting by US companies.

On Monday, HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries stocks will be in focus after posting their quarterly earnings.
Net profit of Reliance Industries rose 9.79% to  ₹10,362 crore for the quarter ended 31 March while revenue rose 19.4% to  ₹1.54 trillion in the same period. This is the second straight quarter when the Mukesh Ambani-led company has reported a quarterly profit of more than  ₹10,000 crore.
RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM), or the amount a refiner earns by refining one barrel of crude oil, narrowed to a 17-quarter low at $8.2 per barrel. On a sequential basis, GRM declined 7%.
“Management is constructive about refining margins as diesel spreads are likely to get a boost from implementation of IMO 2020, as 3.5mbpd marine fuel Sulphur standards are likely to come down. RIL is well positioned to benefit given their high complexity. However, gasoline spreads are likely to be under pressure from high new refinery capacity addition of 2mbpd against demand growth of 1.3mbpd,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher in a note on 19 April.

A savings account is one of the basic financial products that everyone must have. All the major banks including State Bank of India (SBI), Bank Of Baroda (BoB), Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC and ICICI Bank offer their customers several variations of savings accounts. These are just basic savings accounts where you can leave your money and earn an interest in the range of 3.5-6%, depending on the amount and the bank. The interest amount then gets credited to the customer on a quarterly basis, according to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rules.
Here are the savings account interest rates for major Indian banks:
SBI: The State Bank of India, the largest one, offers its customers 3.50% interest rates on savings deposit balance of up to  ₹1 crore. Above  ₹1 crore, the interest rate levied on savings balance is 4% per annum. Following the 25bps reduction in repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 4 April, SBI’s cash credit and overdraft rate will be reduced by 25bps with effect from 1 May. The savings bank rate also stands revised to 3.5% for balances up to  ₹1 lakh and 3.25% for above  ₹1 lakh.
Kotak Mahindra Bank: Private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank has cut the interest rate on savings account deposits of up to  ₹1 lakh.

The dollar was down at 111.51 yen, after shedding 0.5% overnight, but was buoyed elsewhere by solid data on US capital goods orders.

Tata Steel will be in focus after it posted a 84% drop in fiscal fourth quarter consolidated net profit mainly because the year-earlier profit was boosted by a one-time gain. Tata Steel’s consolidated net profit figure for Q4 FY19 is not directly comparable to Q4 FY18 as it does not include NATSteel Holding and Tata Steel Thailand as they are classified as Asset Held For Sales. Net profit in the quarter ended 31 March fell to  ₹2,295 crore, from  ₹14,688 crore a year earlier. Consolidated net profit for 2018-19 declined 49% to  ₹9,098 crore.
Private sector lender Axis Bank on Thursday reported a net profit of  ₹1,505 crore in the March quarter of FY19, as against a loss of  ₹2,188.7 crore in the same period last year.The rise in profit was aided by a fall in total provisions, which more than halved on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis to  ₹2,711.4 crore in Q4 FY19.
In commodity markets, spot gold was idling at $1,278.26 per ounce. Brent crude ran into profit-taking after hitting $75 per barrel on Thursday for the first time in nearly six months following the suspension of some Russian crude exports to Europe.

HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd’s profitability metrics for FY19 outshone those of its closest rivals SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd.
HDFC Life reported growth of 13% in annualized premium equivalent (APE), slower than its past performance. But its rival ICICI PruLife reported no growth at all. SBI Life did marginally better with 14% growth in APE.
But its value of new business margin of 24.6% was superior compared with SBI Life’s 17.7% and ICICI PruLife’s 17%. But there is no secret sauce here. All insurers have realized that growing the margin-friendly protection business is key to better profitability.
HDFC Life has just been more successful than others in pushing plain term plans. In FY19, more than a quarter of its new business came from selling plain protection products. ICICI PruLife is far behind with a share of 9.3%, while SBI Life had 12% of new business coming from term plans.
So, why are analysts wary on HDFC Life and prefer to be bullish on SBI Life and even ICICI PruLife? Nomura Securities India Pvt. Ltd has a neutral rating on HDFC Life, while Deutsche Bank recommends hold. Both have a buy rating on SBI Life and ICICI PruLife.
According to analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd, SBI Life has the muscle for distribution compared with others as it has exclusive access to parent State Bank of India’s (SBI’s) branches. It has also shown superior traction in its protection business and its persistency ratios outshine those of peers.
“(SBI’s) management is confident of growing protection faster than the overall annual premium equivalent. Persistency trends and surrender ratio of SBI Life remains favourable,"" noted analysts at Deutsche Bank.
However, a large part of analysts’ stock preferences within the life insurance space has to do with the valuations of the three companies. HDFC Life has run up 13% over the last two months and trades at a multiple of more than four times its embedded value for FY19.
Compare this to SBI Life’s multiple of about three times and ICICI PruLife at about two times, HDFC Life indeed looks richly valued."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk or simply don’t have the wherewithal to invest in other asset classes like mutual funds. In a sense, FDs are simple comfort food on a menu comprising investment products with complicate recipes.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years and want to park your savings in a safe investment avenue, an FD can help.
Remember that interest earned from FDs gets added to your total income and is accordingly taxed at your slab rate. Usually, banks you already have a relationship with allow you to open an FD through your netbanking account.
But how do you pick the right FD? FD rates vary across banks, tenure and the amount you need to invest. You should compare the interest rates on offer before investing your money. Here is a list of some of the popular banks and the rates they currently offer for deposits up to Rs1 crore over various tenures."
218,2019-05-02,HDFC Bank,"Out of the entire pool of government bonds, MFs owned 0.64% in December 2018, down from 1.41% three months agoR. Sivakumar of Axis Mutual Fund said the switch to SDLs may also indicate the flow of funds favouring it

Mumbai: A few months after the liquidity crisis erupted in September, mutual funds switched a chunk of their sovereign bond holdings from central government securities to state development loans (SDLs), showed data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
According to the data, mutual funds held  ₹36,851 crore worth government securities (G-Sec) in December 2018, against  ₹78,999 crore in September 2018, and  ₹70,241 crore in December 2017. Out of the entire pool of government bonds, MFs owned 0.64% in December 2018, down from 1.41% three months ago. This data is typically released with a lag of four months. The December data is the latest available so far.
Following a series of defaults by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) last year, mutual funds with exposure to debt papers of the company had to write off a chunk of their holdings. This, and the ensuing defaults by some non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), had led to the liquidity crisis.
Interestingly, in the same period, mutual funds bought SDLs issued by state governments. They increased their holding in SDLs to  ₹32,833 crore in December 2018, from  ₹26,951 crore in September 2018. Of the total base of SDLs, mutual funds had a share of 1.23% in December, against 1.05% in September.
States raise money from the market through SDLs, which are dated securities issued through auctions similar to those conducted for those issued by the central government. Interest on SDLs is paid every six months and the principal is repaid on the maturity date. SDLs are backed by the sovereign and acknowledge the government’s debt obligation.
According to a treasurer at a mid-sized public sector bank, G-sec yields dropped in the last quarter of 2018, and liquidated some of their holdings. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions. “The spread between the G-sec and SDLs is typically 50-100 basis points (bps), and while SDLs are not very liquid compared to G-secs, they have the same sovereign backing,"" the banker said, asking not to be identified.
The yield on the 10-year G-sec fell to 7.283% on 31 December, from 8.024% on 29 September.
R. Sivakumar, head-fixed income, Axis Mutual Fund said the switch to SDLs may also indicate the flow of funds favouring it.
The central bank’s holding of G-secs rose 205 bps between September and December 2018, as it conducted open market operations (OMO) to infuse liquidity. In December alone, the RBI had announced OMOs of  ₹50,000 crore.
Lakshmi Iyer, chief investment officer (debt) and head (products), Kotak AMC, attributed the uncertainty on the fiscal front to mutual funds reducing exposure to government securities. “Given that there is a question mark over the pace and quantum of OMOs, one is not sure of the demand levers. Besides, the FPI continues to be net negative sales in debt.""
Iyer added that until clarity emerges on the fiscal front, this situation may continue. “The market also needs clarity on the political outcome, which is a month away. Hence, near-term uncertainty may not abate anytime soon.""
Others said that if inflation measured on the consumer price index (CPI) pans out as per the RBI’s projections, room for further easing of monetary policy and liquidity should open up.
Murthy Nagarajan, head, fixed income, Tata Mutual Fund, said that supply of state government papers is the highest in the third and fourth quarter of the financial year.
“The supply tapers off in the first and second quarter of the financial year. The spread between government securities and state government papers tends to widen in the third and fourth quarter, and comes down when supply reduces in the first and second quarter,"" said Nagarajan.
Meanwhile, the central bank announced on Tuesday that it will inject  ₹25,000-crore liquidity through open market operations (OMOs) in May. The RBI also conducted its second successful dollar swap auction of $5 billion, receiving bids worth $18.65 billion, or more than three times what was on offer, besides injecting  ₹34,874 crore liquidity into the system.
To be sure, debt mutual funds witnessed outflows last December. Data from industry body, Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi), showed that there was a net outflow of  ₹3,387.5 crore in debt mutual funds in December 2018, while there was a net inflow of  ₹12,939.70 crore in March."

216,2019-05-03,HDFC Bank,"It’s not a Lehman-like thing, resolution of liquidity issues will take another 12 to 18 months: Aditya PuriThe banking industry has made substantial progress in dealing with its non-performing loan problem, he says

Troubles among India’s non-bank financiers will persist for at least a year even if the danger of a full-blown financial crisis has passed, according to the head of the nation’s most valuable bank.
Tighter regulatory oversight and asset sales have staved off the worst of the problems afflicting India’s non-bank financial firms following last year’s defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd., according to HDFC Bank Ltd.’s Managing Director Aditya Puri. Even so, it will be another 12 to 18 months before the liquidity issues in the wider sector are resolved, Puri added in an interview with Bloomberg in Mumbai on Thursday.
“It’s not a Lehman-like thing that comes and then there is contagion across the system,"" Puri said, referring to the US firm that collapsed a decade ago and plunged the global economy into a downturn. “The crisis is over, the problem remains.""
Last year’s defaults by IL&FS exposed fault lines among India’s shadow lenders, which had grown rapidly to account for a third of all new loans over the previous three years. Though the government’s decision to seize the company helped contain the crisis, a lingering credit crunch has led to reduced demand for goods like automobiles and triggered investor concerns about Indian mutual funds that hold debt issued by non-bank finance companies.
Shadow banks are still struggling to raise funds, including from the mutual funds which already hold about $46 billion of the sector’s debt, according to an estimate by Credit Suisse Group AG. Those that can tap the markets are paying about 30 basis points more than other top-rated corporates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
HDFC Bank had an exposure of $7 billion to non-bank finance companies and related firms as of December, compared with $11 billion for its nearest private-sector rival ICICI Bank Ltd., filings show. The exposure of the wider Indian banking industry was about $92 billion in March, according to an estimate from the ratings firm ICRA Ltd. Puri said HDFC Bank has no exposure to IL&FS.
Substantial Progress
Under Puri, HDFC Bank has also skirted India’s bad-loan crisis, which hurt many of the country’s other lenders. That has helped its shares outperform the broader banking index each year since 2014, boosting its market capitalization to more than double that of State Bank of India, the nation’s largest lender by assets.
Though India still has among the world’s worst stressed asset ratios, soured credit as a share of total loans is estimated to have shrunk to 10.3% by March from 10.8% in September, according to the central bank.
The banking industry has made “substantial progress"" in dealing with its non-performing loan problem, Puri said. He pointed to better recognition of soured debt, closer central bank inspections and more disciplined behavior by borrowers after the implementation of the nation’s new bankruptcy law.
This gives the government a window to add fresh capital into struggling state-run banks, Puri said. Government-controlled lenders account for about 90% of bad debt and Moody’s Investors Service estimates they will probably need some $3.5 billion to bridge capital needs this financial year, on top of the $28 billion the government has injected over the past two years.
For now though there is an adequate amount of money in the system to fund India’s economic growth, Puri said. “When new capital investment comes into the private sector, the demand could possibly be slightly more than what the capability is, by which time I hope they would have infused the capital.""

Private lender YES Bank Ltd has slipped three notches to 10th spot, in terms of market valuation, for the first time, as its shares slumped over 30% in the last four sessions after the bank reported a surprise net loss in its March quarter earnings.
YES Bank is now the 10th most valued bank from seventh earlier, slipping below market valuation of state-run lenders - Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank.
HDFC Bank Ltd is the most valued Indian bank with a market cap of  ₹6.34 trillion, followed by State Bank of India and Kotak Mahindra Bank with market cap of  ₹2.76 trillion and 2.68 trillion, respectively.
Data from BSE showed that Bank of Baroda (BoB) and Punjab National Bank (PNB) have a market capitalization of Rs.39,720 crore each. Shares of BoB traded at  ₹116.20 on BSE, down 2.31% from previous close, while those of PNB were down 1.03% at  ₹86.30. So far this year, BoB has declined 2.6%, while PNB has risen 9%.

Its market capitalization stood at Rs. 38,515.71 crore. The shares were also under pressure after BloombergQuint reported that the lender may see pain emerging from its exposure to the Anil Ambani Group companies.

ICRA downgraded Yes Bank’s Tier 2, lower Tier 2, infrastructure bonds to AA- from AA, and cut upper Tier 2, Tier 1 notes to A+ from AA-, citing an increase in its lower-rated advances. ICRA also cited further weakening in the bank’s capital buffers following voluntary provisions and losses in fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.

""New management will aim for full blown kitchen sinking along with realignment of its business towards more granular business with focus on retail segment. Shift in accounting policies for recognition of fee income will take a toll on medium term earnings. Indicated stressed book will keep credit cost higher. Also its immediate need on raising capital will be an overhang on the stock"", said IDBI Capital in a note.

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk or simply don’t have the wherewithal to invest in other asset classes like mutual funds. In a sense, FDs are simple comfort food on a menu comprising investment products with complicate recipes.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years and want to park your savings in a safe investment avenue, an FD can help.
Remember that interest earned from FDs gets added to your total income and is accordingly taxed at your slab rate. Usually, banks you already have a relationship with allow you to open an FD through your netbanking account.
But how do you pick the right FD? FD rates vary across banks, tenure and the amount you need to invest. You should compare the interest rates on offer before investing your money. Here is a list of some of the popular banks and the rates they currently offer for deposits up to Rs1 crore over various tenures."

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow's income today, and unlike other loan products that are used for buying a house or paying for an education, the process involved is simple. In fact, if you already have an account with a bank, you would have come across many offers for a personal loan. While these are easy to get, and offer almost instant gratification, you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan.
This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset; you don’t have to put up any asset like property or gold to be able to get the loan. However, the loan amount on offer and its interest rate depend on a few parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others.
There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loans. These are pre-approved loans—the lender has already looked at your information, based on which it is offering this loan.
Easy to get, but not so easy to pay back. One must remember that personal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral. Here are some personal loan rates and other costs of the top private and public sector banks in India."

Among large-caps, Adani Enterprises Ltd jumped 27%, with the forecast of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s win and the re-election of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
Morrison’s re-election is seen as a positive for the Adani group’s mining operations in Australia, as he is widely expected to ease restrictions on its mega coal mines in Queensland, facing protests over concerns of environmental impact.
“Adani group shares rallied on exit polls’ prediction that Narendra Modi-led BJP would come back to power. The rally was further fuelled by Australian poll results, which too augurs well for the business interests of Adani group,"" an analyst said on condition of anonymity. “We expect the positive momentum to continue in the coming trading session in view of the positive political development.""

Tech Mahindra shares fell 3% after March-quarter profit dropped 7.4% and missed estimates. Shares of DHFL, one of India's biggest home loan lenders, fell 9%, after it stopped taking new deposits and blocked premature withdrawals following a credit rating downgrade.
However, analysts predict that the markets will quickly discount the election results. ""Going forward in the medium term...we expect the markets to consolidate post the election outcome as focus would shift back to fundamentals and global cues which have been volatile due to re-escalation of US-China trade tensions,"" said Jayant Manglik, president - retail distribution at Religare Broking.

MUMBAI :
The largest private sector lender HDFC Bank has decided to begin a global search to find a successor to the founding-chief executive Aditya Puri, who retires in October 2020.
Meanwhile, Puri, the managing director and chief executive since 1994 when the bank was set up, has seen a whopping 41% increase in total remuneration in FY19 to  ₹13.67 crore.
""The nomination and remuneration committee of the board will constitute a search committee to undertake a global search of both internal and external candidates,"" the second largest bank said in FY19 annual report.
Puri turns 70 next year and has been instrumental in getting the bank to its current stature as one of the most valued banks globally in terms of price to earnings ratio. There are reports that Puri, an ex-Citibanker, may continue as the non-executive chairman post retirement.
His salary grew to  ₹10.73 crore from  ₹7.26 crore in the previous fiscal, while the value of his perquisites grew to  ₹2.26 crore from  ₹1.82 crore.
Stock options exercised by Puri amounted to  ₹42.20 crore as against  ₹31.41 crore, as per the annual report.
Puri's long-time colleague and deputy managing director Paresh Sukthankar, who left office last November in a hurry citing ""personal reasons"", drew a salary of  ₹6.33 crore during the year as against  ₹5.30 crore in FY18.
Sukthankar exercised  ₹137.46 crore worth of stock options during the year, up from  ₹20.60 crore.
However, the median remuneration increase per employee of the bank stood at 10.31 percent, which is marginally down from 11.17% in the previous fiscal.
There was a big jump in the overall employee base to 98,061 in the year, up from 88,253. It can be noted that the lender made headlines a few years ago for a decline in staffing as it adopted more and more technology.
Puri's salary was 248 times higher than the average employee salary in FY19, which is a jump from FY18, when his salary was 209 times higher.
The bank's chairperson Shyamala Gopinath said FY19 was a ""challenging"" year for the economy but said bank is ""well- poised"" to tap the opportunities of what is still an under- penetrated market by leveraging its strong balance-sheet and retail franchise. The bank will focus on customer focus, operational excellence, product leadership, people and sustainability, she added.

MUMBAI :
Mortgage lender HDFC has sold 31 million shares or 4.23% stake in its subsidiary Gruh Finance, to comply with the RBI requirement for facilitating the proposed merger of the housing finance arm with Bandhan Bank.
According to Bulk deal data from exchange, Soeiete Generale bought 4.19 million shares valued at  ₹121.51 crore for  ₹290 a piece. Other Buyers were not known.
The stock hit an intraday low of  ₹285.30 and fell as much as 7.5%. However, they later recouped some losses and the shares closed 5.40% lower to  ₹291.85, while the benchmark BSE Sensex lost 0.73% to close at 39452.07 points.
Housing Development Finance Corp. offered 31 million shares of Gruh Finance Ltd. in a placement worth $129 million based on floor price of  ₹290 a share, according to terms for the deal obtained by Bloomberg. Citigroup is the banker to the deal.
Last month, Gruh Finance Ltd stock fell after 32.59 million shares, or 4.44% stake of the company, changed hands in a series of block deals. Soeiete Generale and Nomura India Investment Fund Mother Fund bought 5.19 million and 8.95 million respectively. In March, Gruh Finance sold 12.2 million shares.

189,2019-06-17,HDFC Bank,"Investors are like doctors and a small cut on the balance sheet would prompt them to check for trouble elsewhereWith their trust on asset quality blown by Yes Bank Ltd recently, investors are not willing to bestow faith on IndusInd Bank yet

There were pristinely priced private sector bank stocks and then there was IndusInd Bank Ltd.
Just about a year back, the lender’s stock was priced to perfection, and a darling of both foreign and domestic investors. At that time, it traded at nearly four times its estimated book value for FY19, which was higher than larger-sized HDFC Bank Ltd. The latter, seen as the benchmark for the sector, traded at 3.5 times FY19 book value then.
But IndusInd Bank has fallen out of favour now. Its shares have lost more than 28% in the past year and the lender now trades at a far more modest valuation multiple of 2.7 times estimated book value for FY20. In comparison, HDFC Bank trades at 3.9 times its estimated FY20 book value.
Some analysts see more downside. Last week, UBS Securities India Pvt. Ltd downgraded IndusInd Bank to sell from neutral, and even cut its target price by a steep 17%. The step by UBS comes a month after the bank reported one of its worst performances in the March quarter. Its exposure to stressed infra financier, Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS), had caused a 62% drop in net profit.
Investors are like doctors and a small cut on the balance sheet would prompt them to check for incipient trouble elsewhere on the books.
In IndusInd Bank’s case, UBS found out that the lender could be at risk given its retail deposits are just 20% of its external liabilities. “It is a structural issue and often manifests in credit quality surprises,"" the firm said in its note.
UBS was also bothered by the fact that 1.9% of the lender’s loan book comprises loans to conglomerates that are no longer able to pay back lenders.
The bank’s chief Romesh Sobti said the lender has provided for all possible stress in the March quarter.
With their trust on asset quality blown by Yes Bank Ltd recently, investors are not willing to bestow faith on IndusInd Bank yet.
Ergo, the question asked is whether there are more skeletons in the bank’s closet. IndusInd Bank’s total fund-based exposure to non-bank lenders including housing finance companies is 4.38% as of March. This could be a potential pain point as well.
Since credit costs are going to be high, the bank no longer deserves a lofty premium on its stock, according to analysts. Analysts at JM Financial noted that much of the bad news is already priced in the stock and the management has assured investors on earnings. To be sure, the stock still has numerous buy ratings, according to Bloomberg data.
That said, some analysts are concerned that the current valuations too could be challenged, depending on how slippages pan out."

183,2019-06-26,HDFC Bank,"HDB Financial Services’ share sale likely in the current fiscal yearHDFC Bank has reportedly appointed Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley to manage the initial share sale of HDB Financial

Mumbai: India’s largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank Ltd, is eyeing an initial public offering (IPO) of its non-bank lending unit, HDB Financial Services, that could see the company raise more than $1 billion, said two people aware of the development.
HDB, founded in 2007, offers various products such as personal loans, commercial vehicle loans, gold loans, and loans against property.
“They have been engaging with various investment banks over the last one month regarding their plans to list HDB Financial Services. They are likely to raise around  ₹7,000-8,000 crore or more through the IPO. While the IPO is expected to be a mix of primary and secondary share sale, it will largely be a primary capital raising exercise given the current market conditions,"" said the first person cited above. HDFC Bank is likely to target the IPO of the non-bank arm within this fiscal, he added.
Earlier on Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that HDFC Bank had appointed investment banks Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley to manage the initial share sale of HDB Financial.
HDFC Bank held a 95.53% stake in HDB Financial Services as of 31 March. The rest is held by individual shareholders and employee trusts.
A spokesperson for HDFC Bank declined to comment on the development.
The plan to list HDB Financial comes at a time when non-banking financial companies (NBFC) are facing a liquidity crunch owing to defaults by the Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) group in September 2018.
The liquidity crunch has forced several non-bank lenders to seek alternative sources of capital through divestment of various assets.
Lenders such as Dewan Housing Finance Ltd, which has found itself in the eye of the storm, has sold various subsidiaries including its affordable home finance arm Aadhar Housing Finance, which was acquired by private equity firm Blackstone, and the group’s education financing arm Avanse Financial Services, which was bought by Warburg Pincus.
The liquidity crunch has also meant that several non-bank lenders have gone slow on fresh loan disbursals.
An IPO will make HDB Financial the fifth HDFC group company to be listed on stock exchanges, following the listing of HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd in 2018 and the listing of HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd in 2017. HDFC Bank and Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd are the other listed entities of the group.
HDB reported a rise 25% rise in assets under management to  ₹55,425 crore in fiscal 2019, up from  ₹44,268 crore in the previous fiscal. Net profit rose to  ₹1,153 crore in fiscal 2019 from a profit of  ₹933 crore a year ago."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

NEW DELHI :
Asset restructuring firm JM Financial ARC Wednesday said it had taken over Unitech's loan from a financial institution in November 2016 and no new debt of the realty firm has been acquired thereafter by it.
The company disbursed some funds over a period of time to help Unitech restart/complete certain projects, JM Financial ARC said in a statement.
""JM Financial ARC had taken over debts pertaining to Unitech Group from a financial institution in November 2016. As part of restructuring of the debts so taken over, some funds were provided to them to help them restart/complete certain of their projects,"" the statement said.
The funds were disbursed by JM Financial ARC over a period of time from the date of taking over their debts, it further said.
JM Financial ARC has taken over debts and provided additional loans as a lender and has not taken over projects, it said adding that the asset restructuring firm does not control or manage the projects.
The Gurugram-based developer had 74 pending real estate projects, comprising 16,500 housing units, in August 2017, when its two managing directors Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra were arrested.
In the last two years, the company has completed about 22 projects comprising 4,000 units, while 52 projects are still incomplete, according to sources.
Chandra brothers were arrested after some homebuyers dragged the company and its directors to court for non-delivery of their apartments and sought refund.
A bail application was filed before the Supreme Court, but the apex court had directed Unitech to first deposit  ₹750 crore in the registry. The realty firm has so far deposited about  ₹480 crore.
To secure bail of its two directors, Unitech is in process of monetising its land bank to raise funds and deposit the same with the registry, they added."

MUMBAI :
Mortgage lender HDFC on Thursday moved the NCLT seeking to keep the Jet Airways headquarters in the city out of the bankruptcy process.
The HDFC counsel told the National Company Law Tribunal that three floors of the building are mortgaged with the lender.
The tribunal will hear HDFC's plea on Friday along with the main petition.
Last month, NCLT had admitted the insolvency petition filed by the lenders' consortium led by State Bank against Jet Airways which stopped operations on April 17 after running out of cash.
The tribunal has also appointed Ashish Chhauchharia of Grant Thornton as the resolution professional and asked him to submit a progress report by July 5.
The consortium of 26 bankers led by State Bank took the grounded Jet Airways to NCLT to recover their dues of over  ₹8,500 crore.
The lenders have been trying to sell the airline as a going concern since the past five months, but failed due to many a reason.
Apart from banks, the airline also owes over  ₹10,000 crore to its hundreds of vendors, primarily aircraft lessors and over  ₹3,000 crore to its employees who have not been paid since March.
The airline has been having negative networth for long and has run a loss of over  ₹13,000 crore in the past few year. Thus it has over  ₹36,500 crore of dues and being a services company negligible assets to recover."

Mumbai: Investors and the market should not expect any big surprises from the first Budget by the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman today, economists at largest private sector lender HDFC Bank have said.
Citing ""time constraint"", they said finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman's first budget will ""broadly be a replication"" of the interim budget, with some action on the election promises and some tweaks on the tax and expenditure figures.
The room for a fiscal stimulus is ""constrained"" considering that achieving the interim budget's target of 3.4% can in itself be a ""tall order"", they said in a note penciled Thursday.
Follow Budget 2019 LIVE updates here
Stating that fiscal deficit assumptions in the interim budget rested on a higher nominal growth of 11.5%, it warned that if the slowdown and low inflation spill into the first half, nominal growth can be much lower than what is being currently assumed.
There can be some revisions on the revenue side as the interim budget implied a robust 34% growth in tax collections, but such a buoyancy is not possible even in a good growth year, they said.
There are bigger constraints on the expenditure side, it said, adding the fiscal commitments to the ongoing schemes are already high and financing for them can be an issue.
However, the report noted that in FY19, government had cut expenditure by a whopping  ₹1.45 trillion, resorted to off-budget borrowings and transferred its expenditure to central enterprises to meet the fiscal deficit target.
The ""key issue"" in the budget will be the quantum of ""surplus"" that the RBI will transfer, it said, adding the most optimistic of the figures in this is  ₹3 trillion and this can open up space for expansionary fiscal policy.
However, the economists said their baseline scenario is for a staggered payout of any money ""given the clear lack of consensus"" in the Bimal Jalan panel that has been formed to decide this amount and the signal of erosion of the RBI's independence.

172,2019-07-06,HDFC Bank,"This exclusive excerpt from a new book tells the story of HDFC Bank’s digital journey Author Tamal Bandyopadhyay recounts how the bank disrupted itself to protect its turf

After an 18-hour flight back, Aditya Puri (the managing director of HDFC Bank) went straight to his office to hold a meeting as he wanted to “kick everyone’s ass"" and prepare them for disruption.
Around 20 people—senior management and business heads—were in the boardroom on the sixth floor of HDFC Bank’s headquarters in central Mumbai, Bank House. A bleary-eyed, jet-lagged Aditya said there were four kinds of fintech companies responsible for disruptions in the financial services space—loan dotcom companies processing loan approvals at the speed of light; payment companies such as Alipay and ApplePay; wealth advisories using mathematical algorithms to advise customers based on their risk profiles; and finally, the payment wallets.
Aditya said that all the hype over fintech or tech companies taking over the business could be true but they would still have to ride on top of a banking network. If a bank owned the network, how could a third party viably sell OTT products on that network? The network, merchant and customer belonged to the bank. Could somebody take away their business by merely promising a good payment experience? He also believed that HDFC Bank had all the elements and the right technology in place and should rapidly transform itself into a digital bank....
Aditya’s message was clear: Why don’t we disrupt ourselves, instead of allowing a third party to do that? He told the group heads that they would have to look at changes, absorb them and strategize on their businesses.
He was clinical in his approach, asking everyone to set a date for conceptualization and implementation of action plans. No one should be living in a cocoon, he said, with typical Punjabi bluntness....
Missed Call Banking
The focus was to understand customer behaviour and come up with innovative ideas. By November 2013, the team came up with their first product—‘missed call banking’.
The focus of the bank at that time was on the rural markets where customers were not using internet banking, mobile banking or apps. Analysing their behaviour, it was found that much like people around the world, rural customers want to just reassure themselves that their money is safe in the bank; for this purpose, the customers keep on checking their balance every now and then.
Checking the balance is a global phenomenon. Bankers across the world try to simplify the process. This was the first item on the team’s agenda.
They introduced a series of services that could be invoked by calling a toll-free number. 1800 270 3333: Checking the balance. A text message would be sent with the balance. There were other numbers for the rest of the services.
The service, initially meant for the rural population, was soon offered to all. Though it was not new or technologically advanced (it required a simple interface for the registered number to connect to the bank and retrieve the balance) and had already been introduced by a few government-owned banks, HDFC Bank was the first to implement it at such a scale.
It was an effective marketing tool for inducing customers to open accounts. Branch staff prepared stickers and pasted them on the back of customers’ handsets so they could remember the number. Almost one million people started using it within three months of introduction.
The team initially didn’t want to call it ‘missed call banking’. After much research, they had come up with ‘toll free mobile banking’ but found it too long. It was never officially named but the informal name stuck. About 4 million people use ‘missed call banking’ every month.
Bank Aapki Mutthi Mein
Aditya wanted a digital strategy rather than just introducing digital products and services. Being a life cycle bank, it wanted to start early with customers through a careful onboarding process, get them to start using products and services, build capabilities around intelligent marketing analytics and then, over a period of time, do much of their banking with it.
The meeting after Aditya’s Silicon Valley trip was a turning point, which Nitin (Chugh, Country Head, Digital Banking) calls the ‘Muhurtam’. Once he and Corporate Communications Chief, Neeraj Jha, were in Aditya’s cabin discussing a possible tagline for the digital bank. While they all agreed that digital banking would empower the customers, Aditya liked a line in the press release, ‘Bank Aapki Mutthi Mein’. One of Nitin’s team members had used the term ‘Go Digital’ as the subject of an email. They combined the two and found the tagline—‘Go Digital: Bank Aapki Mutthi Mein’.
The campaign was launched in Varanasi. Perhaps, because it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency. Nitin said it has been an old market for the bank and also a melting pot for all segments of customers, including traders and weavers. There were six branches in Varanasi and all of them had high transaction volumes. At the annual dinner in December at his Lonavala bungalow, Aditya announced that Nitin would go to Varanasi on 16 December 2014, to launch the digital bank.
Nitin bought an iPhone 6 to display the applications at the first-ever press conference that he would address on a boat on the Ganges. It was to be followed by another meet with the media at the Gateway Hotel Ganges.
He was nervous but Aditya, who was in Delhi at that time, sought to put him at ease over the phone. Nitin, the Corporate Communications team, a local branch manager and the media boarded the boat, which was decked up with helium balloons that were to be released at the time of the launch. There were also a few customers, representing different segments of business and trade.
Nitin was supposed to hold the placard with the tagline and then the balloons were to be released. Everything went as per the schedule and he started speaking in a mix of Hindi and English, when one of the housekeeping staff on the boat used a lighter to free a bunch of helium balloons that hadn’t got released along with the others. There was a minor explosion, leading to mild panic when it seemed that the boat was on fire.
Back at the hotel, Nitin made his presentation and demonstrated the services on his new iPhone. The launch received some attention from the national media but, for the local papers, it was a big hit.
In retrospect, Nitin feels the minor explosion at the launch was a good omen. From 44% of overall transactions in March 2013, digital transactions grew to 55% in March 2014, 63% in March 2015, 71% in March 2016, 80% in March 2017 and 85% in March 2018. HDFC Bank has successfully transformed itself into a digital bank—transactions via phone banking have been reduced to 1%, while the share of branch banking is at 8% and Automated Teller Machine (ATM) transactions are at 6%.

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

168,2019-07-12,HDFC Bank,"Of DHFL’s  ₹1 trillion debt,  ₹38,000 crore has been raised from banks. The rest was raised by selling debt securitiesDHFL will submit the resolution plan next week after a board meeting scheduled for 13 July

Mumbai: Lenders to Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL) are planning to ask the company’s 86,000 non-convertible debenture holders to be part of the inter-creditor agreement to pre-empt likely litigation over dues, three bankers aware of the matter said.
Seven state-run lenders to DHFL, including State Bank of India and Union Bank of India, met 300 institutional bondholders comprising mutual funds, provident funds and pension funds on Thursday to explore options of working together to restructure DHFL’s  ₹1 trillion debt. DHFL’s chairman Kapil Wadhawan was also part of the meeting.
“We are looking at restructuring the company as a going concern. Lenders will work with NCD holders, shoulder-to-shoulder, to realize the maximum value,"" said a senior banker, one of the three cited above, on the condition of anonymity. “It’s not mandatory on the part of NCD holders to sign the ICA.""
Of DHFL’s total  ₹1 trillion debt as of February,  ₹38,000 crore has been borrowed from banks. The remaining amount was raised by selling debt securities. On 5 July, close to 30 banks signed the ICA to restructure the debt of the home financier.
The decision to include these investors as part of ICA is mainly to prevent NCD holders from moving the Debt Recovery Tribunal to recover outstanding dues, stalling the restructuring process. Currently, financial institutions cannot be referred to the National Company’s Law Tribunal for insolvency proceedings.
The Indian Banks’ Association, on behalf of lenders, has already written to the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India to permit investors to participate in the ICA. Under the Reserve Bank of India’s guidelines on resolution of stressed assets released on 7 June, only banks and non-banking financial companies are allowed to be part of the ICA.
However, in the case of DHFL, as the number of debenture holders is large, lenders say that the debenture trustees can seek permission from these holders before signing the ICA. This involves going through a voting process and giving the holders 21 days’ time to exercise their vote.
Catalyst Trusteeship Ltd and IDBI Trusteeship Services Ltd act as the debenture trustees for the NCDs issued by the housing company.
“This is the first time that NCD holders could be part of a restructuring process. There are not too many cases where such a large portion of debt is being held by NCD holders,"" said the second banker, also requesting anonymity. “DRT is equipped to handle these cases. Hence it’s necessary that it goes through restructuring,"" he added.
Meanwhile, DHFL will submit the resolution plan next week after a board meeting scheduled for 13 July.
The restructuring plan, which is being prepared under RBI’s 7 June circular, could include extension of the tenure of loans, conversion of debt into equity, infusion of fresh working capital and induction of a new management team and financial investors.
Currently, DHFL is a “special mention account-zero"", indicating an asset where interest and principal is not overdue for more than 30 days and the account exhibits signs of incipient stress. Lenders have to ensure the restructuring is completed by end-September in order to avoid the account being classified as non-performing.
Under RBI’s new framework, lenders have 30 days to decide on a resolution plan. The decision of lenders who constitute 75% by value of total outstanding facilities (fund-based as well non-fund based) and 60% by number shall be binding on all other lenders.
DHFL’s consortium of lenders also includes Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. SBI has the largest exposure of around  ₹10,000 crore.
Over the past few months, DHFL has sold retail loans worth ₹30,000 crore. It has also sold several of its strategic assets, including affordable housing arm Aadhar Housing Finance Ltd, educational loan business Avanse and DHFL Pramerica Asset Managers. In January, DHFL sold wholesale loans worth  ₹1,375 crore to alternative investment management fund Oaktree Capital, which buys distressed loan portfolios at a discount."

164,2019-07-16,HDFC Bank,"Asian shares inched up on Tuesday as traders awaited US retail sales dataHDFC AMC, DCB and Federal Bank among others will announce their Q1 result today

Mumbai: Indian equities are likely to rise on global support. Asian shares inched up on Tuesday as traders awaited US retail sales data and more corporate earnings to gauge the health of the world’s biggest economy, with markets remaining focused on a likely US rate cut by the end of the month.
Investors were relieved by encouraging Chinese economic data on the previous day, though broad pressure across global business and investment from Sino-US trade frictions and slowing world growth reinforced expectations of policy easing by major central banks.
The US data on Tuesday is expected to show that retail sales gained 0.1% in June, according to the median estimate of economists polled by Reuters. But a decline in net interest margin reported by Citigroup in its mixed quarterly report underlined risks for financial firms in a lower interest rate environment.
Signs of trade tensions weighing on corporate profits and the fading impact of tax cuts would underscore the US Federal Reserve’s concerns over slowing business investment, he said. Markets are fully priced for a 25-basis point cut by the Fed at its meeting at the end of this month.
Early in the Asian trading day, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.04%. That followed small gains on Wall Street overnight, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.1%, the S&P 500 gaining 0.02% and the Nasdaq Composite adding 0.17%. Australian shares were up 0.1% and Japan’s Nikkei stock index dipped 0.36%.
Back home, India’s imports declined to their lowest level in four months in June to $40.29 billion, down 9% from a year ago, indicating weakening consumption in Asia’s third largest economy, economists said. The Indian economy grew at 5.8% in the January-March period, a five-year low, hurt by weak consumption and tepid private investment. The latest data added to fears that the economy may have slowed further in April-June.
Meanwhile, mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd (DHFL) needs between  ₹2,500 crore and  ₹3,000 crore of fresh equity investments to sustain lending operations, according to a Mint report.
Key companies that will release June quarter earnings on Tuesday are HDFC Asset Management Company, DCB and Federal Bank among others.
Ahead of the release of US retail sales figures, signs of an improving economic situation in the United States have led to a steepening of the US yield curve, led by higher longer-dated yields. On Tuesday, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes turned down slightly to 2.087% compared with its US close of 2.092% on Monday.
The two-year yield, closely watched as a gauge of traders’ expectations for Fed fund rates, extended its falls to 1.829% compared with a US close of 1.833%.
In the currency market, the dollar was up 0.12% against the yen at 108.03, and the euro was flat, buying $1.1255. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was largely unchanged at 96.957.
Oil prices, which had risen amid concerns over the impact of a tropical storm on US Gulf Coast production, eased on signs any impact would be short lived, and as slowing Chinese growth drove a reassessment of the outlook for crude demand. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, fell 0.18% to $59.36 a barrel and Brent crude, the global benchmark, dipped to $66.36 per barrel.
Gold was slightly higher, with spot gold trading at $1,414.32 per ounce.

MUMBAI :
Ajay Piramal-controlled Piramal Enterprises Ltd has raised  ₹1,500 crore from Standard Chartered Bank through non-convertible debentures (NCD), said two people aware of the development.
The money will be used to meet working capital requirements of the group, including for the lending business Piramal Capital and Housing Finance and for upcoming debt-related payment obligations, said the first person cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak with the media.
“The financing from Standard Chartered will go towards meeting near-term needs and has a repayment date in January 2020,"" he said.
According to Piramal Enterprises’ regulatory filings, in the past week, the company has made principal and coupon payments on outstanding debt worth around  ₹1,700 crore. These comprised large loans from HDFC Bank and Deutsche Bank, which had subscribed to NCDs worth  ₹1,000 crore and  ₹590 crore respectively in 2016, the filings showed.
An email sent to Piramal Group on 19 June did not elicit any response. A spokesperson for Standard Chartered declined to comment.
The financing from Standard Chartered is part of the group’s plans to raise more debt financing from long-term sources of funds, said the second person cited above.
“They (Piramal Enterprises) have significantly improved their borrowing mix towards long-term sources of funds. The company has raised nearly  ₹16,500 crore of bank loans and NCDs during the second half of fiscal 2019 and has reduced its exposure of commercial paper to  ₹8,900 crore from  ₹18,000 crore, in the same period,"" he said.
The company’s latest investor presentation says banks contributed 71% of its total borrowing mix as of 31 March, up from 49% at September end.
The group is also planning to tap foreign currency borrowings and further increase borrowing from banks, the presentation said.
On 9 July, rating agency Crisil reaffirmed a rating of A1+ on the commercial paper programme of Piramal Enterprises, followed by a reaffirmation of Piramal Capital and Housing Finance Ltd’s A1+ rating for its commercial paper programme worth  ₹10,500 crore."
159,2019-07-22,HDFC Bank,"Aditya Puri’s shoes are too big to fill, considering that he has steered HDFC Bank since the beginningAnalysts believe that in the next few quarters too, loan growth could be moderate compared with the bank’s historic performance

Silver jubilee years could bring a sense of satisfaction or even a quarter-life crisis.
For HDFC Bank investors, it brings both.
The private lender reported stellar profitability metrics yet again and decided to distribute an interim dividend to mark its 25th year of operations. Net profit grew 21% and toxic levels for the loan book remained at one of the lowest in the industry.
HDFC Bank’s secret sauce for its pristine balance sheet is no secret at all. The bank has been a retail lender for long, with corporate loans accounting for less than half of its portfolio, unlike its peers where these loans dominate.
That and the fact that loan growth has been over 20% consistently have helped keep bad loan ratios at low levels.
But there is more to it than meets the eye.
As the chart above shows, HDFC Bank’s bad loan stockpile has been volatile and so have been its provisions in recent years.
This shows that even the strongest player is not immune to the headwinds of a slowing economy and overleveraged industry.
For the June quarter, it had to increase provisions by 60% as stress from agriculture loans rose as also stress emerged on its exposure to non-bank lenders. Given the consumption slowdown, HDFC Bank doesn’t want to take a chance on its unsecured loans either. The management, in a conference call with analysts, said that it is cautious about lending to non-banks and has ramped up provisioning for unsecured loans.
Moreover, its loan growth has decelerated sharply to 17.1%, led by a slowdown in vehicle loans. This was expected as Indians haven’t been buying cars and bikes at a rate their makers wanted in the last two years at least. “HDFC Bank is most dominant in two-wheeler financing within the private banks, two-wheeler book constituting 8% of its vehicle finance book,"" analysts at brokerage firm Jefferies had noted in April.
For the June quarter, vehicle loans grew just 8% compared with 12% in the previous quarter.
Analysts believe that in the next few quarters too, loan growth could be moderate compared with the bank’s historic performance. That said, analysts are hopeful the bank will continue growing its core income at historic trend. “We expect company to grow its NII (net interest income) at a CAGR of 20% over the next two financial years. Healthy advances growth and cross sell opportunities in the existing high quality deposit franchise will help in delivering strong NII going forward,"" brokerage firm Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers Ltd said in a note.
Even so, the slowdown in loan growth comes at a time when the bank is staring at a top management change. This is a key overhang for the stock.
Managing director Aditya Puri will exit halfway through FY21, given that service age for bank executives is capped at 70 years. Puri’s shoes are too big to fill, considering he steered the bank since the beginning. It is searching for a successor, a task that got tougher after deputy Paresh Sukthankar left last year.
HDFC Bank’s 25 years have been marked with a balance sheet built out by avoiding loans to infrastructure and other dodgy borrowers. Investors have a year and a half to find out whether the successor will take decisions similar to Puri’s.
Meanwhile, the stock trades at a multiple of 3.3 times its estimated book value for FY21, cheaper than that of Kotak Mahindra Bank, another lender with enviable asset quality."

Mumbai: The Indian equity markets are expected to be wobbly amidst weak global peers. Asia stocks eased on Monday as investors reduced expectations of an aggressive interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, while heightened Middle East tensions following an Iranian seizure of a British tanker lifted crude oil prices.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.1%. South Korea's KOSPI shed 0.3%, Australian stocks lost 0.2% and Japan's Nikkei fell 0.5%.
Global equity markets had risen briefly towards the end of last week after dovish comments by New York Fed President John Williams boosted the prospect of the central bank lowering rates by 50 basis points at its 30-31 July meeting.
But the stock markets gave back those gains on Friday, with Wall Street shares ending in negative territory, after the New York Fed walked back Williams’ comments by saying his speech was not about potential policy action at the upcoming Fed meeting.
Expectations for a 50 basis points cut were scaled back further after the Wall Street Journal reported the Fed was likely to cut rates by 25 bps when it meets later this month, and may make further cuts in the future given global growth and trade uncertainties.
Back home, key companies which will announce their June quarter results on Monday are Kotak Mahindra Bank, United Spirits, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL), Oriental Bank of Commerce, TVS Motor Company, ICICI Securities, Just Dial, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals and Mastek.
Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL)and HDFC Bank are likely to be in focus on Monday after they announced their June quarter earnings after markets closed for trading last week. Reliance Industries Ltd on Friday reported a 6.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) increase in net profit for the June quarter, beating Street estimates on the back of strong performances by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Reliance Retail. RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM), or the amount a refiner earns by refining one barrel of crude oil, narrowed to $8.1 a barrel—an 18-quarter-low for the company.
HDFC Bank Ltd on Saturday said its first quarter net profit rose 21% on account of higher provisions and other income. Asset quality deteriorated marginally as gross non-performing assets (NPAs), as a percentage of total advances, rose to 1.4% in the June quarter compared to 1.33% in the year-ago period.
Meanwhile, the dollar and US Treasury yields rose on the greater likelihood of a shallower 25 bps rate cut.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 97.152 after rising 0.4% on Friday. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield stretched Friday’s rise and climbed to 2.058%.
The greenback was nearly flat at 107.830 yen after adding 0.4% on Friday thanks to the rise in US yields. The euro was little changed at $1.1218 after shedding 0.5% on Friday.
In commodities, Brent crude futures were up 1.26% at $63.26 per barrel following a gain of about 0.9% on Friday. Crude was buoyant after Iran’s Revolutionary Guards on Friday captured a British-flagged oil tanker in the Gulf after Britain seized an Iranian vessel earlier this month, further raising tensions along a vital international oil shipping route.
Gold slipped from a six-year high as the dollar firmed and as expectations for a deep rate cut by the Fed were dialed back.
Spot gold traded at $1,425.82 an ounce after going as high as $1,452.60 on Friday, its strongest since May 2013.

Mumbai: Investors of HDFC twins -- HDFC Bank Ltd and HDFC Ltd, on Monday lost nearly $6.40 billion of its market value tracking a fall in the local equity markets.
HDFC Bank slipped 3.5% to  ₹2,294 with erasing over  ₹25,000 crore market value while HDFC Ltd slumped 5.01% to  ₹2,188.50 with eroding  ₹20,000 crore of its market capitalisation.

Local equity markets fell for third sessions with dropping nearly 3.3% or erased 1,300 points after the government refused any respite to foreign investors registered as trusts from proposed super rich tax.
On Saturday, HDFC Bank Ltd reported 20% year on year its June quarter earnings on the back of robust net interest income of 23% driven by 15% loan growth and 10 basis points improvement in margin to 4.3%.
Provisions grew 23% quarter on quarter to  ₹2,610 crore. Provision numbers were higher on account of Contingent provision of  ₹165 crore, bank has stepped up its provisioning rate for unsecured book, higher provisions in Agri portfolio and general provision of  ₹85 crore for HFC/NBFC sector.
Kotak Institutional Equities in a 21 July note believe that there are a few risks emerging – a few risks that we have highlighted in the past: Revenue growth could be slower from here as NIM, which is at peak levels, could decline on slower unsecured loan growth as well as slower than loan growth of CASA deposits and fee income has a high share coming from the cards business, which is slowing down, management is guiding for an improvement in cost-income ratio but a rising deterioration, if any from unsecured loans, could result in higher investments for collection efforts and gross NPL in retail is growing steadily, which implies that we are already past the best in the retail cycle. Credit costs have risen in recent years to 100 bps from 60 bps a few years earlier and a pullback in credit costs, looks a bit challenging.
""The balance sheet has started to slow and we need to see if there is any impact on earnings and asset quality. Despite a slowdown in the balance sheet, the share of unsecured loans continues to increase and is relatively high at 18% of loans. Any sharp slowdown in the high-yielding segment can impact operating profits while provisions could rise reflecting this change. Early warning NPL indicators are still stable,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities."

At 9.37 am, the benchmark Sensex index fell 0.2% to 37953.78 while Nifty lost 0.24% or 27.15 points to 11319.05.
Losses in private banks were also after Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor said it is seeing signs of fragility in some lenders. The RBI is monitoring non-banking finance companies amid signs of stress to prevent another potential surge in soured debt. Since last week analyst were cautious due to higher taxes on wealthy and few foreign funds in budget.
Of the seven Nifty companies that have announced earnings so far, five have either met or exceeded analyst estimates.
HDFC Bank Ltd fell another 2% while HDFC Ltd down 2.1%. According to Prabhudas Lilladher report HDFC Bank escalated provisions on certain segments of unsecured retail & housing finance companies and non banking finance companies along with other sectors on caution from slowing economy.
Bank cautiously has slowed parts of retail (especially unsecured) to take cognizance of slowing economy and the same also has slowed certain segments of retail (vehicle/business banking). Wholesale loans also saw slower growth on repayments and run-off in short term loans. Hence overall loan grew only by 17.0% year on year.

Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd reported a 32.7% jump in its first-quarter profit on Monday, but its results fell marginally shy of estimates and it became the third private-sector Indian bank in a row to sound a cautionary note about the slowing pace of domestic growth.
The lender, helmed by billionaire Uday Kotak who is one of Asia's richest bankers, said its advances in the June quarter rose 18%, compared with a rise of 24% a year ago.
""The corporate loan book grew slowly in the June quarter,"" said Jaimin Bhatt, chief financial officer of Kotak Mahindra Bank, at a press briefing following the bank's results. ""And on the retail front, we've seen negative growth in auto loans both on a year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter basis.""
A series of factors from distress in the rural economy due to a run of droughts in key agricultural belts, to a liquidity crunch in the shadow banking sector following the collapse of infrastructure lender IL&FS, has led to a rapid cooling in the domestic economy, presenting a challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government as it begins its second term.
Dipak Gupta, joint managing director at Kotak Mahindra Bank, warned the small and medium enterprises segment continued to be a pain point.
""We've been cautious about the slowdown for some six to nine months and will continue to remain cautious,"" said Gupta, adding that the bank was seeing some stress in its unsecured loan book, but this was ""not at alarming levels"".
HDFC Bank, the largest private bank in the country, also warned of slower retail loan growth, in an analyst call on Saturday after announcing its results. The bank stated that the slowdown in the auto sector and stress in the agricultural space were hurting growth.
Following the warning, HDFC Bank's stock on Monday closed at an over two-month low. Its warning came close of the heels of one from smaller rival RBL Bank, which also saw its stock plunge after it flagged risks to its asset quality and warned of a rise in bad loans.
Meanwhile, Kotak's gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans came in slightly higher at 2.19% by the end of June, versus 2.14% at the end of the March quarter and 2.17% in the same period a year ago. The bank said it expected its credit cost to remain in the range of 50-60 basis points, as guided earlier.

On July 4, the mortgage lender HDFC had moved the NCLT seeking to keep the airline's BKC property out of the bankruptcy process saying three floors of the BKC property are mortgaged with it as collateral for over  ₹400 crore loan.

Significantly, he rejected a claim of  ₹229 crore from JetAir, the privately held company of founder Naresh Goyal, which was the general sales agent of Jet Airways and the holding company the Goyals's stake in the airline.
The lenders, who control 50%ownership of the airline, after failing to get a buyer, was forced to sent it for bankruptcy on June 17, and on the 20th of the month the Mumbai NCLT admitted the plea.
Last Saturday, the lenders in renewed bid to sell the remaining assets invited expression of interest from interested parties with a deadline of August 3.
Financial creditors, who also include banks, have made 37 claims worth  ₹10,231 crore as of July 4, he said. The list of financial creditors, whose claims have been admitted include 14 domestic banks and financial institutions, 12 foreign banks and eight lessors, the RP said.
State Bank has made a claim of  ₹1,644 crore, including cash credit inclusive of interest, term loans and bank guarantees issued but not invoked, it said, adding its claims worth  ₹19 crore were rejected. Private sector lender Yes Bank has claimed  ₹1,084 crore, followed by PNB's  ₹963 crore and IDBI Bank's  ₹594 crore.
Operational creditors excluding workmen and employees have made a claim of  ₹12,372 crore, with the entire amount being under verification, while the workmen and employees have made a claim of  ₹443 crore which is also under verification, Chhawchharia said.
Apart from this, authorised representatives of workmen and employees have made 11,965 claims of  ₹735 crore, he said, adding other creditors, including other financial creditors and operational creditors, have made 121 claims amounting to  ₹1,105 crore."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk.

Indian stock market index had its best day in three months as a number of government measures to revive economic growth and hopes of progress in China-US trade talks helped boost sentiment. After volatile trading through most of the session, Sensex climbed 2.16% or 793 points to 37,494 while the broader Nifty settled 2.08% higher at 11,057.25. On Friday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, outlined a raft of measures in an attempt to lift consumer sentiment and promised more actions soon to revive slowing economic growth.

7) ""Nifty has immediate hurdle near 11,100-11,180 zone. Any decisive break above 11,180 can push index towards 11,350 zone in near term and support for index is coming near 11,000-10,930 zone,"" says Rohit Singre, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities.
8) Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday announced a rollback of tax surcharge on equity investments (both short term and long term gain) on foreign and domestic equity investors. She also announced upfront capital infusion of  ₹70,000 crore into state-run banks.
9) US stock index futures futures reversed losses after President Donald Trump said that China wants to re-start trade talks, erasing a slump earlier.
10) Stocks had fallen sharply in Asia before Trump spoke as investors panicked that the latest tit-for-tat tariffs would damage global growth.

126,2019-09-03,HDFC Bank,"The PSU banking index on NSE fell 5%, with PNB shares slumping 9%Both BSE midcap and smallcap indices also fell sharply

Indian stock market indices Sensex and Nifty fell sharply today while the rupee also suffered a big loss against the US dollar. At the day’s low, the Sensex fell over 850 points to 36,466 after data released last week showed GDP grew at its weakest pace in over six years as consumption demand weakened. A separate private sector survey indicated that expansion in the country's manufacturing sector hit its slowest in 15 months in August. The Sensex finished 2% lower at 36,562 - its biggest one-day fall since October last year - while Nifty settled 2% lower at 10,797.
Here are 10 updates from today’s stock markets:
1) The decline was led by banking stocks with the Nifty bank index falling 2.2%. Among financials, PNB fell 9%, ICICI Bank 4%, HDFC 4%, RBL 4% and Axis Bank 3%.
2) The PSU banking index on the NSE fell 5% after the government announced a series of mergers involving 10 such banks to boost the struggling sector and revive economic growth. Indian Bank, Canara Bank, Union Bank and Oriental Bank slumped between 10% and 12%.
""Market slid as deceleration in economic growth due to fall in consumption and subdued manufacturing activity diminished the scope for a turnaround in the near-term. The consolidation of PSU banks is a step in right direction however, they may take more time before earning benefits from synergy. Additionally, weak monthly auto sales and outflow from foreign investors added volatility to rupee,"" said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.
3) Among auto stocks, Tata Motors, Bosch, Motherson Sumi and Eicher Motors fell between 3% and 4% after top automakers reported a slump in August sales over the weekend. Another market heavyweight Reliance Industries fell over 3%.
4) Many analysts have revised lower their growth estimates for the year after GDP growth decelerated sharply to 5% on the back of weakness in private consumption and investment. “With a deeper-than-estimated trough and lack of significant impetus to the growth drivers in the near term, we further revise down our FY20 GDP growth estimate by 50 bps to 5.8%,"" Kotak Securities said in a note.
The Nifty is down about 10% from its June highs. And market analysts remain cautious. Ajit Mishra, vice president for research at Religare Broking, said: ""In the near term, weak domestic sentiments and uncertain global cues may continue to have negative impact on the Indian markets. Hence, we continue to remain cautious until there are meaningful signs of revival in the economy. Further, falling rupee (vs US dollar) is a key concern which could negatively impact the sentiments. On global front, trade tension between US-China is likely to induce volatility across markets.""
5) The broader markets were also weak today with the BSE midcap and smallcap indices falling 1.6% and 1.3% respectively.
6) Shares of ONGC fell 3% today after a fire broke out in a storm water drainage network at the company's oil and gas processing plant in Uran, Navi Mumbai.
7) ONGC said there has been no impact on oil processing and gas from Bombay High has been diverted to its Hazira plant. Reliance Securities does not see a major impact of the fire incident at the Uran plant on ONGC gas sales in the second quarter of FY19. ""A fall in oil prices can impact earnings in FY20 while the target for disinvestment receipts has increased to  ₹1.05 lakh crore for FY20 from  ₹90,000 crore in the interim Budget. This is a key overhang on the stock as the government holds a 64.25% stake in ONGC,"" said Reliance Securities, which maintains a positive view on the stock.
8) The rupee slumped 100 paise to 72.40 against the US dollar today, as compared to the previous close of 71.40.
9) Indian markets continue to be hurt by selling pressure from foreign investors, which sold a net $2.3 billion worth of Indian stocks last month.
10) Asian markets ended mixed today while European equity markets struggled as investors waited to see if Chinese and American officials can schedule a planned meeting this month to continue trade talks."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

123,2019-09-08,HDFC Bank,"Sebi's board in March approved a proposal to allow mutual funds and portfolio managers to trade in this segmentMany custodians have been sceptical about managing the physical delivery of commodities

New Delhi: Markets regulator Sebi is likely to give approval to Deutsche Bank by next month to operate as a custodian in the commodities space, a move which will enable participation from institutional investors, including mutual funds and portfolio management service providers, in such segment.
To help broaden the commodity derivatives market, Sebi's board in March this year approved a proposal to allow mutual funds and portfolio managers to trade in this segment. Moreover, the regulator made necessary amendments in the custodian regulations so as to provide for requisite custodial services.
The regulator in May came out with guidelines allowing mutual funds and portfolio managers to invest in commodity derivatives.
However, institutional investors have been staying away from the segment and experts believe lack of custodial services has been a key deterrent to institutional participation in the commodity derivatives markets.
Many custodians have been sceptical about managing the physical delivery of commodities as they lack domain expertise with regard to agricultural commodities and warehousing.
Now, sources privy to the development expect some participation from institutional investors in the commodities derivatives market from this year which will deepen the market.
""Deutsche Bank is expected to get a green signal from Sebi by October to provide custodial services and once the custodian thing will happen, we will see some participation from institutional investors in the commodities derivatives market this year,"" a source close to the development said.
Besides, HDFC Bank and Stock Holding Corporation of India among others have approached the capital markets regulator to provide custodial services, he added.
Under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) guidelines, mutual funds need to appoint a registered custodian for underlying goods, in view of the physical settlement of contracts.
The issue of lack of participation from mutual funds in the commodity derivatives segment was discussed in the Sebi's commodity derivatives advisory committee late August, sources said.
Apart from this, issues including Options offered by stock exchanges and gold spot exchange were also discussed, they added.
A committee, under the leadership of NITI Aayog member Ramesh Chand, had pointed out the importance of regulation in the spot market after  ₹5,600-crore National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) fraud was revealed 2013.
The committee appointed by the Finance Ministry submitted its report in February 2018 suggesting that Sebi should regulate the new gold spot exchange.
Earlier Sebi was believed to have told the government that it did not have the skill set to regulate a spot market. Instead, it had suggested that regulation of commodity spot exchanges should be vested in a separate sectoral regulator.

116,2019-09-17,HDFC Bank,"Altico’s unraveling shows that an end to credit woes is not yet in sightAt more than $200 billion, India’s world-beating pile of bad loans is bigger than Italy’s

India’s fragile financial system is swinging between despair and hope. Two separate incidents — both featuring the lender Yes Bank Ltd. — recently underscored the drag of past underwriting follies as well as the lift from a digital reset. It will take time, but good things will come to Indian banking as a result of the present crisis.
Start with the sudden default by financier Altico Capital India Ltd. on a  ₹1,997 crore ($2.8-million) interest payment to Abu Dhabi-based Mashreqbank PSC. Clearwater Capital Partners-backed Altico, which borrows money from banks and mutual funds to make loans to property developers, called the situation a “liquidity crisis."" And that made Yes Bank investors gloomy.
Based on January data, the midsize Indian bank had a  ₹450 crore exposure to Altico, the third-highest after Mashreq and HDFC Bank Ltd. While HDFC Bank, the country’s most valuable lender, has the capital — and current profit — to take the occasional credit hit, Yes’s capital cushion is already frayed by dodgy loans to beleaguered shadow banks and troubled tycoons. Both these borrower groups have found it hard to refinance debt since the collapse last year of IL&FS Group, a large Indian infrastructure financier and operator. Altico’s unraveling shows that an end to credit woes is not yet in sight.
A Darkening Shadow
At more than $200 billion, India’s world-beating pile of bad loans is bigger than Italy’s. State-run Indian banks are carrying the bulk of the burden, but at least they’re getting dollops of taxpayers’ money and being merged into fewer banking groups. A private-sector lender like Yes doesn’t have a formal public backstop. If it can’t fend for itself, the central bank could step in and force an arranged match with a better-run bank. The terms won’t be favorable to Yes shareholders.
To avoid such a fate, Yes needs to raise growth capital by convincing new investors that the worst is over. And that brings us to the week’s other big incident. Yes shares jumped 13.5% after reports that One97 Communications Ltd., which owns the Indian digital payments network Paytm, may buy out a 9.6% stake in Yes from Rana Kapoor, the lender’s co-founder. Kapoor was forced to step down as CEO early this year by the Reserve Bank of India amid a controversy over bad-debt accounting. New CEO Ravneet Gill, brought in to clean up the mess, told Reuters last week that Yes was looking to sell a minority stake to “one of the world’s top three technology companies that had not previously invested in a bank.""
Investors pushed the stock higher despite their many misgivings. Only two years ago, Yes had a high price-to-book multiple and an even bigger price-to-truth ratio, a term I’d coined to describe shareholders’ refusal to question the subterfuge at India’s private-sector banks. Although the banking regulator had found bad loans to be four times what Yes had disclosed in audited results, very few analysts believed something could go seriously wrong given Kapoor’s substantial stake — his skin in the game.
Stuck in a Rut
That was then. Now, Yes is a battered lender gasping for capital. Despite the many regulatory hurdles on the way to a possible alignment with Paytm, which the latter hasn’t confirmed, a deal could help the bank break free of its checkered past — and reemerge as a digital lender.
If Paytm can monetize the data of its 350 million mobile wallet users by giving them point-of-sale loans using the balance sheet of a bank — whether Yes or someone else — the payment firm will get a second wind. Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma had an early advantage as India’s mobile payments pioneer, but Walmart Inc.-owned PhonePe as well as Alphabet Inc.’s Google Pay are giving him stiff competition. Paytm’s losses are ballooning and it’s becoming evident that without old-fashioned lending, there may be no other path to profitability for a pure payments business. Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest tycoon, plans to use his rapidly growing Jio telecom network to offer customers discounts and vouchers that would be honored even by neighborhood stores. But for extending point-of-sale credit, Ambani would also need to borrow the balance sheet of a bank.
For Yes, point-of-sale financing could be a growth avenue at a time when the turmoil in India’s formal and shadow banking sectors refuses to end. It’s put the brakes on what authorities were until recently claiming to be the world’s fastest-growing major economy.
But alongside the despair, hope is building for a new model led by supply-chain credit, asset securitization, digital lending, and joint underwriting by finance companies (which know their borrowers) and banks (which have stable deposits). The tug of war between the past and the future of banking in India is getting interesting. What happens to Yes could be a gauge of which way the balance of power is shifting."

Indian stock market indices Sensex and Nifty today jumped over 3%, extending Friday’s gains as the sentiment turned positive after the government last week cut effective corporate tax rate. The Sensex today rose 1,075 points to settle at 39,090, adding to Friday’s 1,921-point gain. The two-day gain has pushed up investor wealth by over  ₹10 lakh crore.

1) Banking stocks have outperformed in the two sessions with Nifty Bank index rising 14% during this period. Banking heavyweights ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank today hit new 52-week highs.
2) FMCG heavyweights HUL (+3.5%) and ITC (7%) also rose today with analysts saying that financials and FMCG sectors will be one of the key beneficiaries of corporate tax rate cut.
3) IT stocks however saw some profit-taking today with Infosys losing 5% and TCS 2.5%.
4) ""The 10% corporate tax reset has witnessed frantic buying across high tax paying entities in the last two trading sessions.

5) Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO (Equity) at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company, said: “The decision to lower corporate taxes meaningfully is a key structural measure to support India's growth outlook.

CHANDIGARH :
HDFC Bank in partnership with Indian Oil on Wednesday launched a co-branded fuel card for users from non-metro cities and towns, which will be available on both RuPay and Visa platforms.
The card was launched at an event here by IOCL's Executive Director (Retail Sales) Vigyan Kumar and HDFC Bank's Country Head, Payments Business and Marketing, Parag Rao.
The card offers customers highest rewards and benefits on fuel consumption and will be available on both RuPay and Visa platforms, it was informed on the occasion by the bank and IOC officials.
Customers earn reward points known as 'fuel points' at over 27,000 IOCL outlets. They also earn 'fuel points' on all other spends such as groceries, bill payments, utilities and other shopping. These points can be redeemed for up to 50 litres of fuel annually.
To apply for the card, the customers can visit the bank website or walk into the nearest bank branch, Rao said.
The card was also simultaneously launched across 135 Indian oil outlets in Bhopal, Lucknow, Indore, Ranchi, Kochi, Vishakapatnam, Guwahati, Nagpur, Shillong, Varanasi, Jalandhar and Panjim, among others.
Speaking on the occasion, Vigyan Kumar said that Indian Oil has been a pioneer in promoting digital cashless and digital transactions with more than 98 per cent of the company's network of 27,000 plus retail outlets capable of accepting credit/debit card payments.
""In fact, more than 27% of all transactions at our petrol stations are through various digital modes. We are confident that this collaboration with HDFC Bank today shall give a boost to digital payments and cashless transactions in the country, in line with the Digital India vision of the prime minister,"" he said.
Rao said it is their endeavour to take digital forms of payments to the smaller towns and cities.
He said fuel consumption in India is rising and smaller cities and towns are major drivers of this growth.
""With more than 75% of our total branch network in such non-metro cities, we want to empower our customers in these locations by providing a product that is specifically designed for their changing needs and aspirations,"" he said.
Rao, who is the brain behind this card, said, ""Our philosophy in terms of offering products across HDFC Bank is very simple. We try to see the primary top two needs of an individual and try to design a product which is focused on these needs of the customer.""
""Also, one of our and IOC's objectives in launching this card is to assist in this whole digital mission of saying how do you reduce cash. We have lot of other initiatives with IOC in terms of digitisation.
""Simultaneously, as a bank, we are also expanding our merchant network everywhere so that a merchant in the rural area, either through a POS (a point of sale machine, which is an electronic device used to process card payments) machine or an app, we have a merchant app, could start accepting digital payments, which could be a card, other wallets etc"".
""In India, the penetration of electronic spends at customer level, I am not talking of institutions and businesses, is only about 10-12%, rest is still cash and cheque, so we have got a lot of space to grow...,"" Rao said."

Axis Bank raised a massive  ₹12,500 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) without breaking a sweat and investors who made that happen deserve good news.
To make them happy, the third largest private lender will have to show an improvement in asset quality and convince the market that its balance sheet growth will trump that of rivals.
Improving asset quality won’t be easy and that could make balance sheet growth a challenge, too. “The QIP is a positive for the bank and the funds will be obviously used for more provisioning and even growth,"" said Suresh Ganapathy, analyst, Macquarie Capital Securities. “But asset quality is still unresolved and fresh stress has emerged,"" he added.
Moreover, since it is de-risking its portfolio, margins are going to be under pressure. So, there isn’t much earnings upside for the stock to price in.
Axis Bank has exposure to a handful of stressed companies that have of late shown deeper troubles. Some of these, such as companies belonging to Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group and Essel Group, are yet to see some resolution.
Axis Bank also has exposure to real estate developers that were downgraded by rating agencies due to stress. Its exposure to small and medium enterprises (SME) stands at 12% and the increased stress on small businesses due to the economic slowdown has increased risk on this portfolio.
To be sure, the bank showed improvement on asset quality in the June quarter with a 10% year-on-year drop in its bad loan stock. That said, the lender also reported an increase in fresh slippages.
Analysts said some of the newer stressed exposures are not included in the watch list and so could throw a negative surprise for the lender.
To be fair, the bank has made it clear that it will have enough insurance against fresh risk. It has beefed up provisions and is likely to continue doing so.
That brings us back to the fact that if more money is set aside for provisions, less is available for growth.
Even so, the QIP money will increase its Tier-I capital by over two percentage points, which should bring some cheer.
Also, much of the negatives seem to be priced into the stock, given that it is down 3.4% over the past two months despite the 10% rise post the corporate tax cut announcement by the government on Friday.
“Our analysis shows the potential stress at Axis Bank is only marginally higher on corporate assets than at ICICI Bank, and given its underperformance, we believe it presents a good buying opportunity,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
The stock trades at a modest multiple of two times its estimated book value for FY21, lower than rivals such as HDFC Bank and even ICICI Bank."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

Banking and financial stocks were under severe selling pressure on Wednesday. The BSE Bankex has declined 1.7% so far today after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) put curbs on Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank. The central bank’s restrictions include limits on cash withdrawals amid a probe into accounting lapses, sparking speculation that the regulator may force a management change at the cooperative bank through a merger, according to a Mint report.
Shares of Housing Development & Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) fell 4% on news report that the RBI’s action on the PMC Bank was the result of a loan of  ₹2,500 crore to the now bankrupt real estate firm.
Among banking stocks, shares of State Bank of India fell the most--down over 4%--following a rating downgrade by brokerage firm Morgan Stanley. Other banking stocks such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Axis Bank were down 1-2% each.
India Ratings and Research has placed ratings of most of the public sector banks (PSBs) on ‘rating watch evolving (RWE)’, maintain a stable outlook for private banks. The rating agency believes banks have been facing the double whammy of absorbing aging provisions on corporate stressed assets and growing their balance sheets, while on-boarding minimum incremental stress.
“Post announcements of amalgamations, the anchor banks may deliver credit growth, although management bandwidth could be diverted towards the amalgamation process. Credit growth and asset recovery may not receive adequate attention in the short term as focus is also diverted towards asset quality harmonisation, human resource integration and other challenges,"" India Ratings and Research said in a report on 24 September.
It added that some of the banks excluded from the amalgamation process are likely to continue to shrink their balance sheets and may also require additional capital in FY20-FY21. It estimates that among its rated banks, the return on assets (RoA) of PSBs and private banks is expected to increase by up to 10 basis points (bps) and 30 bps (10%-15% higher than base case), respectively, as a result of the lowering of the corporate tax rate by government.
It said public sector banks may not see a material impact in FY20, especially given that many of them would be making net losses.
Others concur.
Kotak Institutional Equities expects the revised lower tax rate to have negligible impact on banks with high DTA (deferred tax asset). “We expect a positive impact on loan growth and provisions but offset by lower treasury. We maintain estimates but the long-term impact of return on equity (RoE) improvement is debatable. The impact on non-banks is mixed with lower tax rates (for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), negligible impact on housing finance companies (HFCs) that already enjoy 26-27% tax rates,"" it said in a report on 22 September."
106,2019-09-25,HDFC Bank,"The finding is part of a report titled 'BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands of 2019'This is the sixth consecutive year in which HDFC Bank continued to dominate the ranking

New Delhi: India's largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank, topped the list of the country’s top 70 most valuable brands, according to a report released by marketing and advertising conglomerate WPP Plc and Kantar.
This is the sixth consecutive year in which HDFC Bank continued to dominate the ranking owing to its forward-thinking outlook, new financial products, an ongoing drive towards digital banking and new branches set-up throughout the country. The bank grew 5% in brand value to $22.7 billion, which is a positive contrast to the 8% decline in value of the top 20 global banks.
The 2019 edition of the ranking revealed a 6% rise in overall brand value to $228.2 billion, a moderate pace compared to previous years, given India’s recent macroeconomic challenges. Despite that, such growth is still in line with that of the BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands, as India steadily rises in global economic rankings. The BrandZ study combine companies’ financial data with consumer insight and opinion shows that trust is a key to develop the stability required for long-term success; highly trusted brands in the Top 75 are worth 129% more than less trusted ones.
""For the last five to six quarters our growth rates have been tanking. We are perhaps at our lowest point in the last two decades and these are the reasons why growth has been a challenge this year. Having said that, brands have grown because they had the right conversation with the consumer and offered them the right kind of products/services,"" said Vishikh Talwar, chief client officer, Kantar Insights Division.
Trusted brands include many of the consumer-facing technology platforms and service providers. With a 30% increase in value, this sector was the fastest growing group of brands in the ranking. Some of the notable brands include e-commerce site Flipkart (which occupied 12th spot), which increased its brand value 14% to $4.7 billion, while unicorn brands hotel booking site Oyo ($2 billion), online food ordering service Swiggy ($1.6 billion) and online restaurant marketplace Zomato ($1 billion) are newcomers to the ranking at 30, 39 and 61 ranks respectively.
The fastest riser in the 2019 ranking is telecom provider, Jio, which climbed one place to number ninth spot with a 34% increase in brand value to $5.5 billion. Its disruptive business model has made internet access available to many Indians who were previously unable to afford it, thereby opening up access to digital platforms and services. Vodafone ($2.5 billion) was the top-ranked newcomer at 24th spot.
Both digital and offline brands such as D-Mart (No. 25, $2.4 billion) have found success as a result of the rise of ‘middle India’; the growing number of people in the country’s second, third and fourth-tier cities and towns that are changing India’s traditional urban-rural divide. These previously poorly-served segments increasingly have access to a variety of online services, with Swiggy and Zomato building much of their growth on this shift.
With an expanding choice of offerings to buy, Indian consumers increasingly care more about the quality of service than whether a brand originates in India, as long as it demonstrates that it understands what it means to be Indian. That insight is reflected in the decision by Amazon to launch itself a year ago as India’s ‘neighbourhood shop’.
""Brands should stick to the fundamentals of marketing in the tough times. They should continue to invest, drive innovation, stay connected with the consumer, be authentic and earn their trust. For a corporate firm good brands, built over a period of time, become an insurance against bad times,"" said Preeti Reddy, chief executive, South Asia, Insights Division, Kantar.
Some of the key trends highlighted in the report include increased mobile internet penetration because of Jio phenomenon and renewed competition, retail being the second fastest growing category, with online and offline both growing strongly. New entrant Reliance Retail (No. 55, $1.1 billion) opened nearly 500 new stores and used Jio’s service to connect retail shops with grocery deliveries, while D-Mart ($2.4 billion) focused predominantly on offline, rising two places to No. 25.
Amazon and Flipkart compete with many Indian brands across several sectors, with Amazon also opening its largest campus yet in India. The success of unicorn brands such as Swiggy, Zomato and Oyo is fostering a new-found confidence in India as they look to expand their operations globally."

NEW DELHI :
Private sector lender HDFC Bank on Monday took the battle on consumption straight to e-commerce majors with a three-month long campaign offering best deals on transactions through its platform.
The bank also listed out targets for merchant acquisitions and said it is aiming for a 5 percentage points reduction in its cost-to-income ratio as a result of the digital push.
The aggressive posturing comes at a time when the massive slump in consumption is being blamed for the overall economic gloom pulling down GDP to a six-year low in the June quarter at a 5 percent.
The bank announced major discounts tying up with more than 1,000 major brands such as Reliance Digital, Samsung, Apple etc and also featuring offers on all banking products. The discounts will be available on both its debit and credit cards, the bank said.
""You get mega offers on Flipkart and Amazon for three-four days alone. We are launching this campaign for three months,"" managing director and chief executive Aditya Puri said.
Puri said the bank is going through a major transformation to re-define it altogether and will compete to garner as wide a share of a customer's wallet as possible.
He said the bank will aggregate offers from across merchants and present its users with the best offers on its website. It is targeting to have a complete omnichannel presence which will help a user do banking transactions, loans and shopping across channels like net banking and mobile app by March, he said.
The bank is also adding 1 million merchant touch points this fiscal and aiming for a similar number next fiscal to have up to 5 million merchant touch points by 2021.
This is possible largely through digital solutions like QR codes and smartphone-based apps, he said, adding using this also helps drive down the costs compared to the expensive card swipe machines.
Through a variety of initiatives pivoted around digitisation, the bank is targeting to decrease its cost to income ratio by 5 percentage points to the 35 percent in the next five years, Puri said, adding however, that the bank will continue to hire people and also open branches, which will be smaller in size and will act primarily like a sales and service outlet for customers.

Altico’s troubles started when it missed an interest payment to Dubai-based Mashreq Bank on 12 September. On 20 September, Mint reported that Altico has told its lenders that as part of a resolution plan, it is in talks to sell some assets and infuse fresh funds from new shareholders. For this, Altico said it is working alongside turnaround advisory firm Alvarez and Marsal and legal advisory firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. It also sought a moratorium on further repayments from its lenders.
Apollo Global and Cerberus are among the few private equity firms which Altico is in a serious conversation with, the second person said, adding the investors have proposed a 30-40% haircut on the debt owed to the lenders, as part of the deal to infuse fresh capital into the lender.
Mint could not ascertain the quantum of the stake or capital that Altico is looking to raise from these investors. At present, Altico’s total outstanding debt stands at  ₹4,361.55 crore, from 27 lenders including Yes Bank, State Bank of India and HDFC Bank, among others.
Email queries sent to a spokesperson of Cerberus Capital remained unanswered till the time of going to press. Nipun Sahni, head of Apollo Global’s real estate arm in India, did not respond to calls and text messages seeking comment on the development. Altico Capital’s chief operating officer (COO) Sanjeev Agrawal too did not respond to calls and email queries.
Altico is one of the many shadow banks affected by the souring of market sentiment, following defaults by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS).
“A significant strain in short-term financing markets precipitated by the September 2018 default by IL&FS created a knock-on impact on other NBFCs and the real estate sector in general,"" Altico Capital said in a statement earlier this month.
Mint reported on 23 September that Altico’s three shareholders—private equity firms Varde Partners, Clearwater Capital Partners and Abu Dhabi Investment Council—had initiated negotiations with its lenders for a debt restructuring while also planning to either offload their stakes or sell a large portion of the portfolio.
On 22 September, the lender asked its chief operating officer Agrawal to take charge of the company following the sudden resignation of its CEO Sanjay Grewal."
97,2019-10-01,HDFC Bank,"The bank had reported a 1.40% gross non- performing assets ratio in June quarterGrowth slipping to six-year low primarily on a slip in consumption has raised concerns on the way forward for banking

MUMBAI :
HDFC Bank on Monday asserted there is no stress on its credit portfolio because of the slowdown and it sees the current phase as an opportunity to grow its book.
Its managing director and chief executive Aditya Puri also informed that a search panel of the board announced earlier will be formed by January, to ensure the chosen successor to lead the bank can work with him for 1-2 months.
The bank had reported a 1.40 per cent gross non- performing assets ratio in June quarter. Growth slipping to six-year low primarily on a slip in consumption has raised concerns on the way forward for banking.
""We will grow, our assets will grow, our liabilities will grow, our swipes will grow, our number of customers will grow and we are very confident,"" Puri told reporters here, replying to questions around the economic slowdown.
He said that there have not been retrenchments in the industry which should make a lender wary and employment is growing overall, and added that auto majors may have retrenched some temporary workers.
Listing out positives which will work in the economy's favour like the good monsoon, expectations of more divestments and the sentiment turning positive with the tax cuts, he said the bank sees this as a ""major opportunity"" to grow.
""We see this as a major opportunity as a bank and we see no strain on our credit portfolio,"" he said, adding it has not compromised on its credit standards and is not lending to over-leveraged persons.
Puri said the bank is looking at semi-urban and rural areas as a major opportunity to grow from here on and underlined that one will be amazed to see the kind of inherent demand that exists.
When asked about his successors, amid a media report saying that the RBI is unlikely to relent on the 70 years retirement age for bank CXOs, Puri said a search panel of the board will be formed by January.
The panel will hire a search agency and a successor will be chosen in such a way that he or she gets to spend at least one or two months with him, Puri, who turns 70 in October next year, said.
The bank is not looking at any acquisition at present and may only look at it in the future if something gets available at the right price, Puri said.
The veteran banker said there is a need for better corporate governance at the co-operative banks, in comments that comes in the wake of issues at PMC Bank, among the largest such lenders.
HDFC Bank regularly has dealings with cooperative banks but did not have any dealing with PMC Bank, he said.
Seeking to assuage concerns, Puri said there is no scope to have system-wide concerns on banking at present."
95,2019-10-03,HDFC Bank,"Bond purchases under OMOs was the tool RBI used for two years to keep the government borrowing from disrupting yields in the marketIn the past, the bond market has looked at the Centre’s market borrowing plan with suspicion

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) seems to be back as the godfather to the bond market, this time invisibly.
On Monday, the government announced it would borrow  ₹2.68 trillion from the bond market in the second half, in line with expectations. This means full-year gross borrowing remains unchanged at  ₹7.1 trillion.
In the past, the bond market has looked at the Centre’s market borrowing plan with suspicion.
The reasons to suspect the government’s borrowing numbers are more this time around than in previous years. Just two weeks ago, the finance minister announced a big cut in corporate tax rate and said that the revenue forgone would be  ₹1.45 trillion. The loss of future revenue would be felt even as growth in indirect tax collections have disappointed. Analysts have indicated that the fiscal deficit of the government would widen to 3.5-3.8% of gross domestic product from the budgeted 3.3%, owing to the revenue shortfall.
Surely if the deficit rises, the government will have to borrow more from the bond market. But this time, investors have taken the Centre on its word and the 10-year benchmark sovereign bond yield fell marginally on Tuesday. There is reason for this faith.
The government has got a one-time bonanza of  ₹1.76 trillion from RBI through a surplus transfer and it may get an interim dividend transfer as well. In August, the central bank’s board had approved transferring the surplus in FY20. Abheek Barua, chief economist at HDFC Bank, estimates the interim dividend to be  ₹28,000 crore. This windfall will go a long way in filling the enlarged hole of fiscal deficit. Otherwise, the government risks increasing its borrowing cost and by extension, making it costly for the private sector to borrow as well. After all, risk-free yield is the basis on which lenders add a credit risk premium in giving private companies loans.
This is the invisible hand of RBI that could make it easy for the government to avoid dumping extra bonds on investors. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts have gone a step ahead and suggested that RBI continue with its open market operations (OMOs) to take some load off the market and keep yields in check. “We thus suggest that a large part of this additional borrowing (by the Centre) can be absorbed through higher OMO purchases by the RBI, or using the additional dividend transferred by the RBI, or through drawing down the surplus balances the centre has with the RBI,"" the bank said in a note last week.
Bond purchases under OMOs was the tool RBI used for two years to keep the government borrowing from disrupting yields in the market. It absorbed nearly 70% of the government borrowing in FY19 by buying close to  ₹3 trillion worth of bonds from the market during that year.
One way or the other, RBI has come to the aid of the bond market. In the past, it was to keep liquidity tightness from choking banks. This time, it has come indirectly and perhaps not entirely out of free will."

93,2019-10-04,HDFC Bank,"Bank stocks came under pressure in the past 10 days owing to renewed concerns over asset qualityMarket cap of HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra now tops that of other 10 banks in Nifty Bank by 10%

Indian banks have faced rough weather in the past two weeks and investors are rediscovering stocks that act as lifeboats in choppy waters.
HDFC Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd have emerged as these lifeboats over the last 10 days. Ergo, while the Nifty Bank index lost over 6% since 23 September, these stocks have weathered the selling pressure.
As the adjoining chart shows, the market capitalization of the two private sector lenders now exceeds that of the other 10 banks in the Nifty banking sector index by about 10%. Just three months ago, the combined value of the two banks was about 10% lower than the other 10 lenders, which include State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank Ltd, Axis Bank Ltd and seven of the remaining largest lenders in the country.
So what transpired in the last 10 days to drive investors away from other banks and towards HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank?
The collapse of Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank Ltd, which had an absurdly high exposure to real estate developers, brought to the fore the vulnerabilities of Indian banks in general.
Investors realized that Indian banks have an uncomfortable exposure to non-banking financial companies (NBFC) that finance real estate developers (HFCs). “Negative news flow around HFCs/NBFCs and banks has overshadowed the recent tax cut tailwind, bringing focus back on sector issues: liquidity issues and contagion risks,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd wrote in a note.
The result was a massive fall in stock prices, and banks such as Yes Bank Ltd and RBL Bank Ltd saw their valuation erode sharply. According to Jefferies India, Yes Bank has an exposure of more than  ₹10,000 crore to troubled companies it terms as “high risk"".
Even the more stronger and larger balance sheets such as SBI and ICICI Bank weren’t spared by investors.
In addition to the resurgence of stress, concerns that the current slowdown would affect the loan growth of banks also weighed in. Analysts at Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said banks are not likely to grow their loans as most companies would use savings from tax cuts to boost profits.
Analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd wrote in note, “We expect overall system credit to see 10-12% growth, but near-term growth trajectory depends on pick-up in consumer sentiment in this festive season.""
Investors flocked to HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank as they showed a track record of pristine asset quality. Moreover, both lenders have negligible exposure to troubled NBFCs. Lower stressed assets would mean lower provisioning for the two lenders and, therefore, the banks would have more free capital to lend. Ergo, their loan growth is likely to be superior to others.
Even so, the consumption slowdown is likely to affect all lenders. Investors know this. While HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank may have been spared in the recent rout in bank shares, investors await the quarterly performance for clarity."

Mumbai: Investors on Wednesday cheered the government’s decision to raise dearness allowance (DA) in the middle of the festival season, driving Indian markets up nearly 2% in a rally led by financial sector stocks.
The benchmark 30-share BSE Sensex closed 1.72% or 645.97 points higher at 38,177.95, while the 50-share Nifty closed at 11,313.30, up 186.90 points or 1.68%.
The five percentage point increase in DA to 17% will put more money in the hands of at least 5 million government employees and 6.5 million pensioners. The hike, which will cost the exchequer  ₹16,000 crore, will be effective from July.
Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities Ltd, attributed Wednesday’s rebound to bargain hunting as well, coming after six straight days of losses. “Sentiments also turned positive after the government hiked dearness allowance. Most emerging market stocks were headed lower for a third day on Wednesday as the US and China showed little signs of backing off from their trade dispute ahead of a crucial round of negotiations. However, later, European shares moved sharply higher and the Chinese currency in the offshore market jumped on Wednesday after a Bloomberg report said China was still open to agreeing a partial trade deal with the United States,"" he said.
The Bankex rose 3.67%, with State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank rising 3-5%.
According to Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services, banking stocks rallied on hopes of greater liquidity and consumption, as the plunge in bond yields indicates further room for rate cuts. “Further, the hike in DA will add impetus to festival demand. Going forward, the results season will dictate the market direction and investors are expecting some green shoots on account of festival demand and good monsoon,"" he said. The 10-year bond yield jumped 22 basis points to 6.45% on Wednesday.
After a bumper rally triggered by corporate tax cuts on 20 September, the markets had turned volatile ahead of second quarter earnings. Analysts said the tax cuts are a pro-investment stimulus, but will take time to show results, given the nature of the ongoing economic slowdown.
Rahul Singh, chief investment officer-equities at Tata Mutual Fund, said the 8-9% lift in Nifty earnings per share after the corporate tax cuts will provide support to stock valuations, in addition to the fact that India’s valuation premium to other emerging markets is at a more acceptable level now. “The recent privatization initiative indicates the government’s seriousness in tackling the economic slowdown and we believe that there is more to come in the coming weeks and months,"" he said.
Indian companies are set to report a drop in revenue and profit for the second straight quarter amid a slump in consumer demand that sent the government scrambling to boost investment and consumption through a raft of measures, including tax cuts for companies.
“It has been a year since the IL&FS crisis erupted and the repercussions of the same are still being felt, especially in financials. Besides NBFCs, banks too have started facing asset quality concerns now,"" Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a note.
The brokerage firm said the earnings season will be more of the same—tepid and uneventful. The underlying demand slowdown in the domestic economy and weak global commodities prices are expected to take a toll on earnings with very few bright spots, if any, it said."

88,2019-10-10,HDFC Bank,"Growth in overall loan book for the Sep quarter was 19%, higher than 17% of Jun quarter but lower than 22% a year agoInvestors have to realize that HDFC Bank is not immune to the broad-based slowdown, especially when a consumption slowdown is under way

There is no doubt that investors love HDFC Bank Ltd. The island of safety the stock offered during the past three volatile weeks is a reflection of the private sector lender’s strong balance sheet.
Its exposures to major troubled assets are a shadow of its peers and it seems HDFC Bank made all the right decisions in lending. After all, its gross bad loans totalled just  ₹11,769 crore as of June quarter. Its closest competitor in size, ICICI Bank Ltd has a bad loan stock nearly four times that of HDFC Bank even though its balance sheet is smaller.
Public sector banks of similar size fare worse on their asset quality metrics. According to Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd, HDFC Bank’s exposure to high-risk stressed loans was just 0.9% of its FY19 net worth, the lowest among banks. To the several defaulting companies that have cropped up in the last three months, HDFC Bank has the lowest exposure among peer banks.
Ergo, the bank’s valuations have only soared even after its stock is trading at a multiple of more than three times its estimated FY21 book value, deemed expensive by some analysts.
In all this, investors have to realize that HDFC Bank is not immune to the broad-based slowdown, especially when a consumption slowdown is under way. Indeed, the private sector lender’s large retail portfolio is making it run countercyclical to the rest of the banking system.
The deep slowdown in the automobile sector is weighing down HDFC Bank’s commercial vehicle loan growth. Even growth in unsecured personal loans have decelerated for the lender as of the June quarter. That said, the bank told the exchanges that its overall loan book grew a healthy 19% in the September quarter. That is higher than the 17% growth in the previous quarter but lower than the 22% growth a year ago.
But a bank can be profitable despite lack of growth if its operations are cost-efficient.
Hemindra Hazari, an independent research analyst, pointed out that the private sector bank has managed to give high return on assets to investors simply because it runs its shop efficiently and is able to keep a lid on operating costs.
“In the current faltering economy, the bank is unlikely to increase its net interest margin and its fees to compensate for the expected higher credit costs and if it is unable to continue with its earlier strategy, shareholders should expect a decline in its profitability,"" Hazari wrote in a note on research website Smartkarma.
Notwithstanding the pressure on its profitability, HDFC Bank in all likelihood may look better than its peers, which are still saddled with dud loans. But it sure is a duller version of its illustrious past."

85,2019-10-13,HDFC Bank,"Investors pile into HDFC Bank’s stock, convinced it will emerge winner from India’s financial woesAmong the 25 biggest lenders globally, no other stock commands a higher price relative to earnings or net assets

All around HDFC Bank Ltd., India’s biggest lender by market value, the news seems to be bad and getting worse: economic growth is slowing, loan losses are rising and shadow banks are mired in crisis.
And yet investors keep piling into HDFC Bank’s stock, convinced it will emerge a winner from India’s financial woes. The lender's market value has surged by $21 billion over the past year, more than any other bank worldwide. Among the 25 biggest lenders globally, no other stock commands a higher price relative to earnings or net assets.
Bulls say they have good reasons to be optimistic: HDFC Bank will grab market share from embattled shadow lenders and benefit from a flight to quality by investors who’ve grown wary of smaller competitors. While skeptics argue that the bank is vulnerable to India’s economic challenges -- pointing to its large consumer loan exposure and the looming retirement of its longtime leader -- even they say betting against HDFC Bank is risky. Among 54 analysts who cover the stock, only one has the equivalent of a sell rating.
“The business continues to perform very well,"" said Nick Payne, the London-based head of global emerging markets at Merian Global Investors (U.K.) Ltd., which oversees about $33 billion and has been adding to its holdings of HDFC Bank shares. “Strong banks and franchises tend to get stronger when times get tough, as the weak fall by the wayside.""
India’s shadow banks, until recently a growing competitive threat to HDFC Bank and its peers, have been reeling since the latter half of 2018, when a group company of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. defaulted on its debt and triggered an industrywide credit squeeze. Mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Corp Ltd. has missed debt payments since June, while firms including Reliance Capital Ltd. and Piramal Capital & Housing Finance Ltd. have had their credit ratings cut on liquidity concerns.
The turmoil has come against a backdrop of five straight quarters of slowing economic growth, the highest unemployment rate in 45 years, and predictions that bad loans at Indian banks will jump to a record 12% by early next year.
All the while, HDFC Bank’s stock price has marched higher. Now valued at about $92 billion, the company trades for 24 times projected earnings over the next 12 months. That’s almost three times more expensive than the Bloomberg World Banks Index, within a hair’s breadth of the biggest valuation premium on record. The company’s price-to-book ratio of 4.3 compares with 1.5 at JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest U.S. lender by market capitalization.
Not everyone is convinced the outsized gains will continue. Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., downgraded HDFC Bank to market perform from outperform on Sept. 9. He cited succession risks around next year’s planned departure of Aditya Puri, who has led the company since 1994, as well as the potential for deteriorating asset quality in the bank’s  ₹4.43-trillion ($62.5 billion) retail lending portfolio.
While HDFC Bank has said loan losses in its retail business have been stable and within expectations, that could change if India’s economic growth and employment trends continue to worsen.
Retail credit costs “are unlikely to remain benign over the medium term,"" Chhugani said.
HDFC Bank didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Optimists draw comfort from the firm’s nearly unmatched track record of keeping loan losses in check throughout multiple economic cycles. HDFC Bank’s per-share book value has grown at a compound annual rate of more than 20% over the past decade, while its gross nonperforming loan ratio of 1.4% at the end of June was the lowest among Indian peers.
HDFC Bank is likely to report “strong’"" profit growth and stable asset quality for the quarter ended September, Diksha Gera, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a report on Friday. As shadow lenders retrench, the bank will pick up market share, said Ross Cameron, the head of Northcape Capital Ltd.’s Japan office. It should also get a boost from a recently announced cut to India’s corporate tax rate.
“HDFC Bank’s share price is underpinned by its strong earnings growth, which has proven thus far to be fairly resilient"" to India’s economic headwinds, said Will Malcolm, a fund manager for emerging market equities at Aviva Investors Asia Pte. He called the stock a “core holding.""
“Nothing is forever and we expect volatility in the market,"" said Kristy Fong, an Asian equities investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Singapore. “HDFC Bank, however, should continue to be a long-term compounder.""

84,2019-10-13,HDFC Bank,"There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loansPersonal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow's income today, and unlike other loan products that are used for buying a house or paying for an education, the process involved is simple. In fact, if you already have an account with a bank, you would have come across many offers for a personal loan. While these are easy to get, and offer almost instant gratification, you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan.
This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset; you don’t have to put up any asset like property or gold to be able to get the loan. However, the loan amount on offer and its interest rate depend on a few parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others.
There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loans. These are pre-approved loans—the lender has already looked at your information, based on which it is offering this loan.
Easy to get, but not so easy to pay back. One must remember that personal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral. Here are some personal loan rates and other costs of the top private and public sector banks in India.

83,2019-10-14,HDFC Bank,"Before IRCTC, Avenue Supermarts Ltd more than doubled on listing in March 2017 after the company’s IPO got bids for 106 times the quantity offered

IRCTC more than doubled on the first day of listing, the best debut for a local company since 2017, after its public float emerged as the most sought after for the nation’s state-run firms. Lured by IRCTC’s monopoly status, investor demand exceeded shares on offer by 112 times, eclipsing the government-owned Housing & Urban Development Corp. and Cochin Shipyard Ltd., whose maiden offerings were oversubscribed more than 75 times in 2017, a record year for Indian IPOs.
The company garnered  ₹643 crore ($91 million) for the government, which sold 20.1 million shares, or a 12.5% stake, in a price band of  ₹315-320 apiece. IRCTC’s IPO is also the biggest and the most successful among the four companies from the Indian Railways stable that have gone public.
Key Insights
The company’s core business is spread across four verticals -- railway catering, tourism services, online ticketing and packaged drinking water. It is the only authorized firm by the Indian Railways to provide these services in trains.
Catering service is the largest contributor to IRCTC’s top line and the company controls about half the bottled water sold on stations.
Even so, it is internet ticketing that adds the most to its bottomline. About three-quarters of 1.4 million people who traveled by train daily in the April-to-August period booked tickets online.
“It is a unique IPO as most of IRCTC’s businesses are a monopoly,"" said Abhimanyu Sofat, head of research at Mumbai-based IIFL Securities Ltd. “There are future levers of growth in terms of the fee charged on the ticket booking and packaged drinking water.""
Starting Sept. 1, the company has resumed charging a fee on tickets booked online, which is expected to add 4.5 billion rupees to revenue annually, said Arafat Saiyed, analyst at Mumbai-based brokerage Reliance Securities Ltd.
Market Reaction
IRCTC’s shares surged as high as  ₹698 versus the sale price of  ₹320, the best performance by a debutante since 2017. The premium valued the company at $1.5 billion at 10:52 a.m. in Mumbai
Before IRCTC, Avenue Supermarts Ltd., owned by Indian billionaire Radhakishan Damani, more than doubled on listing in March 2017 after the company’s IPO got bids for 106 times the quantity offered.
Some of the top gainers among mainboard IPOs since January 2017 are:
Company	Offer Price (Rs.) Debut Gains (%)
Avenue Supermarts	Rs 299 114%
Central Depository	Rs 149 75%
HDFC AMC	Rs 1,100 65%
Dixon Technologies	Rs 1,766 64%
AU Small Finance Bank	Rs 358 51%
The stellar response may help bolster the government’s drive to raise a record  ₹1.1 trillion ($14.8 billion) selling state firms this financial year, though not all share sales will elicit a resounding response.
“IRCTC is an exception because of the quality of businesses it offers,"" IIFL’s Sofat said. “This can’t be said for every government company.""
IRCTC’s debut is a bright spot in India’s IPO market that has seen 11 issuers raise a little over 100 billion rupees in the first nine months of the year, the fewest issuers since 2014, according to PRIME Database. That compares with about 310 billion rupees raised via 24 public floats in 2018.
More than 20 companies shelved IPO plans this year, thanks to the general election in May and as the lingering crisis in the nation’s credit market damped risk appetite.

Current deposit insurance scheme:
The  ₹1 lakh limit covers both principal and interest amount.
All deposits maintained by the depositor across all branches of the failed bank are clubbed. Or in other words, if a person keeps deposits in different branches of a bank, they are paid a maximum of up to Rs. 1 lakh only on the aggregate amount.
However, deposits maintained with different banks are not clubbed.
The deposit insurance scheme covers all banks operating in India including private sector, co-operative and even branches of foreign banks in India. There are some exemptions like deposits of foreign governments, deposits of central/state governments and inter-bank deposits."

""Possibilities of a Brexit deal buoyed the Nifty. The deal, however, needs a stamp of the British Parliament, which is a contingent event. The chatter out of Washington and Beijing has been positive, so the odds of a phase one pact being signed next month at the G7 summit is high,"" says HDFC Securities.

Mumbai: Private sector lender HDFC Bank on Saturday reported a net profit of  ₹6,345 crore for the September quarter of FY20, up 26.7% year-on-year due to higher interest income and other income.
This, despite the bank witnessing a 48% y-o-y jump in total provisions to  ₹2,700 crore. Of the total provisions,  ₹2,038 crore was for loan loss provisions, the bank said in a regulatory filing.
The bank's management told analysts on Saturday that certain provisions made in the quarter were precautionary in nature and not anticipatory. Moreover, the bank also informed that it wrote off loans worth  ₹1,589 crore in the September quarter.
Its asset quality saw a slight deterioration in the September quarter as gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of gross advances rose 5 basis points (bps) year-on-year (y-o-y) to 1.38%. However, on a sequential basis, the bad loan ratio was down 2 bps.
The bank's total income for the quarter ended 30 September stood at  ₹33,755 crore, growing 19.6% from  ₹28,215.2 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.
While the bank’s net interest income (NII) – difference between interest earned and interest expended – rose 14.9% y-o-y to  ₹13,515 crore, its net interest margin (NIM) – a key measure of profitability – stood at 4.2%, down 10 basis points from Q2 of FY19.

The Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy committee favours cutting interest rates and continuing with an accommodative stance until the economy is firmly on a recovery path, its minutes released on Friday said.

Considering the state of the Indian economy, HDFC Bank Ltd’s performance in the second quarter of FY20 was decent. The bank’s provisional figures had indicated that it expected the results to be stable. Its September quarter earnings were largely in line with expectations.
Net profit growth was driven by lower taxation, loan growth and higher profit on sale of investments. The private sector lender’s net profit in the September quarter grew around 27% year-on-year to  ₹6,345 crore. Asset quality, too, was stable, with gross non-performing assets at 1.38%. This stood at 1.33% in the year-ago quarter.
Overall year-on-year loan growth at 25% was driven by home, agricultural and corporate loans. However, the ongoing slump in the automobile sector weighed on its retail loan book, which grew around 15% year-on-year.
In a post-earnings conference call, the management said that vehicle finance disbursal in the second quarter had been better than in the first, and the bank expects a boost around Diwali.
Though a widespread slowdown is evident, the lender has not seen any asset quality deterioration in its retail pool of vehicle finance, said the management.
Analysts say that excluding the vehicle category, the HDFC Bank’s retail loan book grew 19% year-on-year. While the management sounded hopeful, investors in this stock should closely watch for any further deterioration.
Subdued growth in retail loans led to weakness in net interest income growth; the slow balance-sheet growth was also one of the key disappointments. So, improvements there will be looked at.
Other than these, a transition in leadership could also weigh on the stock’s performance. HDFC Bank’s chief Aditya Puri could retire mid-way in FY21 due to a rule that sets 70 years as the maximum age for top banking executives to hold office.
This calendar year, the HDFC Bank stock has gained twice as much as the Nifty Bank Index at 16%, outpacing peers. The Nifty Bank index climbed just 7.22%.
Rewarded for its steady earnings performance, it is one of the most expensive stocks in the banking space. The HDFC Bank stock trades at a one-year-forward price-to-book multiple of 4 times, much higher than ICICI Bank Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd."

Nonetheless we expect the stock to be volatile till the company clarifies on these complaints.

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

The benchmark index BSE Sensex rose 136.93 points or 0.34% to a record closing high of 40,301.96. The Nifty 50 index inched up 50.70 points or 0.43% to close at 11,941.30. Midcap and Smallcap index rose marginally.
Metal and mining stocks supported the bull run, with Nifty 50 companies--JSW Steel Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd, Vedanta Ltd and Hindalco Industries Ltd—being among the top gainers today. JSW Steel climbed up nearly 6% intraday, Tata Steel and Vedanta rose 4.5% and 3.5%, respectively.
Investor sentiment was boosted after the US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross on Sunday said he was “quite optimistic"" that challenges related to the first phase of the US-China trade talks will be resolved soon and the leaders of the two countries are scheduled to meet later this month.
Overall market breadth was positive. On the BSE, 1,429 shares rose, 1,151 shares fell and 175 shares were unchanged. In the Nifty 50 index, 27 stocks moved higher while 23 stocks declined.
Among the Asian markets, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 1.65%, Korea’s Kospi Index rose 1.43%, Taiwan’s Taiex Index was up 1.38%.
Among Indian companies, shares of Infosys surged 6% intraday after the IT major said there is no evidence that supports whistleblower complaints alleging the company’s top management, mainly chief executive Salil Parekh and chief financial officer Nilanjan Roy, were involved in unethical accounting practices. The stock rose 3.05% to close at Rs709 today.
The IT sectoral index followed suit, with shares of HCL Infosystems Ltd gaining 10.29%, Zensar Technologies rising 5.9% and NIIT Technology trading up 1.75%.
Shares of Yes Bank advanced as much as 7.13% intraday, but ended largely flat at Rs66.10, after the bank’s chief Ravneet Gill told news channel CNBC TV18 that the bank is hopeful of receiving a binding bid in a few days to raise $1.2 billion equity capital by the end of December.
Yes Bank had plunged more than 10% in early deals today as the private lender, after market hours on Friday, had reported a net loss of Rs600 crore for July-September due to adjustment of Rs709 crore in one-time deferred tax assets.
Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) Ltd gained 2.48% to close at Rs2,181.35 after it reported an 80.38% jump in consolidated net profit to Rs10,388.61 crore on the back of increase in total income in the quarter-ended September of the current fiscal."
67,2019-11-04,HDFC Bank,"Cards targeting millennials are often enticing due to attractive offers and cashbacks they provide but evaluate carefully if they make sense for youEvaluate how much you’d have to spend in order to avail the offers; stay away if it pushes you into spending more

In August this year, HDFC Bank launched the Millennia cards targeting the country’s millennials. The bank offers a prepaid card, a debit card, a credit card and an EMI card as part of its Millennia range. “I am confident that this unique range of cards will allow us to meet the youth’s evolving needs,"" said Parag Rao, country head-payments business and marketing, HDFC Bank.
At close to 450 million, India has the world’s largest millennial population, making them the top consumers of goods and services. While HDFC Bank and others are trying to leverage this fact, does it really make sense to get these Millennia cards? We help you understand.
Credit card
While the bank claims to offer additional benefits tailored for the millennial spending habit, there’s little distinction between this and other cards available in the market. But, what stands out is the higher cashbacks on online transactions. “As millennials are more comfortable using digital wallets, this card allows cashback on reloading digital wallets which most other cards don’t,"" said Naveen Kukreja, CEO and co-founder, Paisabazaar.com, an online financial services marketplace. The card gives a 2.5% cashback for every online transaction above  ₹2,000 and a 1% cashback on all offline spends and wallet reloads on a minimum transaction size of  ₹100. Note that this is not applicable on fuel spends and there’s a cap on the maximum cashback. “The biggest benefit of this card is that it accrues cashbacks instead of reward points. The cashback is accrued in the form of CashPoints, which can be redeemed against the statement balance or flight and hotel bookings or making purchases from the bank’s SmartBuy rewards portal,"" said Kukreja.
However, these CashPoints come with a short expiry period. The co-founder of an online marketplace who didn’t want to be named said, “While the reward points of most credit cards have an expiry period of 2-3 years, the CashPoints on this credit card expires within one year."" The conversion rate for one CashPoint is  ₹0.30. The renewal fee on this card is waived off only on spending above  ₹1 lakh in the first year and joining fee is waived off on spending more than  ₹30,000 in the first 90 days.
Lovaii Navlakhi, CEO and MD, International Money Matters said, the objective of such products is to get the youth to spend more.“Having a credit card is a plus if you are smart and can take advantage of the credit card billing cycles to avail maximum credit. But if you are unorganized, it can result in overdue charges, which then becomes a vicious cycle,"" said Navlakhi. He said one shouldn’t get tempted looking at the reward points and cashback because no great wealth is created out of them.
Easy EMI card
The feature of this card is nearly the same as the credit card except for the fact that all transactions above  ₹10,000 automatically get converted into EMIs for nine months at an interest rate of 20% per annum. The cardholder also earns cashback on transactions converted into EMI. “The interest rate charged on the EMI is pretty high compared to other options including personal loan and EMI conversion available on regular credit cards. While the rate of interest (ROI) in case of this card is 20% , it starts from 13% in case of EMI conversion on other cards,"" said the co-founder quoted above. Also, this card gives a single choice of a nine-month tenure whereas tenures range anywhere from three to 48 months in other cards.
A processing fee at  ₹99 plus GST is also levied. “The  ₹99 on  ₹10,000 increases the interest rate to 24.90% per annum; even if the amount spent is  ₹40,000, the interest rate is 22.70%. You should just repay it by the due date. Living beyond your means is a habit that is difficult to shake off,"" said Navlakhi. In response to why one should still go for the card, Rao said, customers get up to 5% cashback within the same month on the transaction amount, thereby reducing the ROI impact.
Prepaid and debit cards
Prepaid cards are payment cards with the monetary value stored on the card and not an external bank account. “There are not many comparable products to HDFC Millennia prepaid card in the market. The Axis Bank Gift Card has a loadable limit of  ₹50,000, while the ICICI Bank prepaid card variant offers limit of up to  ₹10,000. On the other hand, the HDFC card comes with a loadable limit of up to  ₹1 lakh, along with insurance cover and exclusive cashback offers,"" said Raj Khosla, founder and MD, MyMoneyMantra, an online financial services marketplace.
The Millennia prepaid card offers a personal accident cover of  ₹1 lakh, which can be availed only if the card is used for shopping at least once in the last 30 days, excluding ATM withdrawals.
For individuals who are just learning to be financially independent, going for a prepaid card is a better option as it allows you to spend only what you have. Khosla said, he recommends a prepaid card for millennials who want to spend on the go. Since you are not obligated to maintain any minimum balance, there are no restrictions on number of transactions.
“Students are one key segment as they may not have a bank account to avail a debit card or credit history to avail a credit card. For regular customers, prepaid cards can be used as a gift for friends and family,"" said Rao. The Millennia debit card comes with features such as daily domestic shopping limit of  ₹3.5 lakh and daily cash withdrawal limit of  ₹50,000, annual cashback up to  ₹4,800 and 1% cashback on reloading wallets. Cardholders can earn 5% cashback on shopping via PayZapp and SmartBuy. Khosla said the annual access to airport lounge is limited to only four on this card whereas there are cards that offer six to eight lounge access each quarter.
Mint take
Though the bank has tried to cater to various spending patterns through the four cards, it’s advisable to compare and understand all the terms and conditions before taking the plunge. The rewards and cashback may seem attractive at first but it’s important to evaluate how much you’d have to spend in order to avail them. If it pushes you into spending more than what you can, it’s best to stay away."
68,2019-11-04,HDFC Bank,"Zee shares jumped over 30% in the past two sessions even as the firm faces growth challengesHDFC will announce its September quarter earnings today

New Delhi: Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Monday:
Yes Bank: The private lender announced its September quarter earnings on Friday after market hours. The bank reported a net loss of  ₹600 crore for July-September due to adjustment of  ₹709 crore in one-time deferred tax asset. It had posted a net profit of  ₹965 crore in the same period last year. The bank also aims to raise $1.2 billion equity capital by the end of December.
Maruti Suzuki: The country's largest car maker remains ‘cautiously optimistic' over sales prospect as many challenges that had led to a slowdown in the industry still exist. According to a PTI report, the company, whose domestic passenger vehicle sales grew after seven months in October, said it would take at least few more months to get clarity on the industry’s revival.
RIL: The company’s telecom arm Reliance Jio said any relief package offered by the government to incumbent telecom operators will go against the Supreme Court verdict on adjusted gross revenue, which requires payment of dues to the department of telecommunications. It also alleged that Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd have enough funds to pay dues.
HDFC: The housing finance company will announce its September quarter earnings today. The company had last week acquired 9.89% stake in Bandhan Bank Ltd as part of the merger of the bank with HDFC Ltd’s subsidiary Gruh Finance Ltd. Separately, state-owned lender Indian Overseas Bank will also report its numbers for July-September today.
Vodafone Idea: India Ratings and Research downgraded non-convertible debentures of the telecom operator and placed them under negative watch citing adverse impact of the SC ruling on the definition of adjusted gross revenue. The ratings agency also noted increasing risk in bank loan payment defaults and delay in asset monetisation by the firm.
Zee Entertainment: Shares jumped over 30% in the past two sessions even as the firm faces growth challenges and is surrounded by concerns over financial stress. Essel Group's company Dish TV India Ltd also shot up nearly 50% in the last two trading sessions on the back of higher volumes.
Thomas Cook: The travel services provider on Sunday clarified that the sale of the UK-based company to China’s Fosun does not include regions in India, Sri Lanka and Mauritius. The British travel group Thomas Cook PLC, which declared bankruptcy in September under piling debt, had sold its stake in Thomas Cook (India) Ltd in 2012 and is not related to the Indian firm.
Central Bank: The public-sector bank released its September quarter earnings after market hours on Friday. The bank posted a net profit of  ₹138.6 crore for the second quarter due to improvement in asset quality. The lender had reported a loss of  ₹935.5 crore in the year-ago period. Separately, it also started taking approvals for raising equity capital by allotting preferential shares to the government.
Lemon Tree Hotels: The company plans to open three more properties under its upscale Aurika Hotels and Resorts brand across the country by the end of 2021. According to a PTI report, the mainly mid-market segment hotels firm has recently entered Udaipur, with its first hotel under the Aurika Hotels and Resorts brand.
Pharma Stocks: The US Food and Drug Administration late on Friday downplayed the risk associated with popular antacid medicine ranitidine, saying that the carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine is not formed after ingestion of the drug and that levels of the contaminant in most samples were similar to those found in common food."
66,2019-11-04,HDFC Bank,"HDFC booked a gain of  ₹1627 crore through its stake sale in erstwhile subsidiary Gruh FinanceInvestors need to watch how long the lender can keep its margins from eroding especially when its developer book is hardly growing

What is the best place to find out the intimately linked story of a troubled real estate sector and the liquidity crunch non-bank finance companies have found themselves in since last year?
The answer is the balance sheet of the largest non-bank lender to housing. The adjoining chart shows how cautious HDFC Ltd has turned on non-individual housing loans. In other words, HDFC has been going slow in lending to real estate developers over the last several quarters. For housing finance companies such as HDFC, it was a question of prudence but for many others it was simply a question of having no money to lend because of funding channels being choked.
Nevertheless, for HDFC the strategy seems to have worked in protecting its balance sheet. HDFC’s asset quality stayed pristine compared with other industry players even though it did not impress compared with its own historic performance. Gross bad loans rose marginally to form 1.33% of total loan book predominantly due to slippages in the non-individual book. Vice chairman and chief executive Keki Mistry said that loan disbursals growth was led by individual borrowers with non-individual book growing by a measly 3%. “97% of incremental growth in loan book was due to individual loans,"" Mistry said.
Of course, the stellar 60% jump in net profit for the September quarter was mainly due to one-time gains and increase in dividends from subsidiaries including the most valued HDFC Bank. HDFC booked a gain of  ₹1627 crore through its stake sale in erstwhile subsidiary Gruh Finance.
But surely there is a flipside to the focus on affordable loans and retail lending. That flipside is the deceleration in its loan book and the contraction in margins. HDFC’s loan book growth was 13%, a far cry from the average of 17% seen in previous years. Indeed, the deceleration is driven by its non-individual loan book. Another factor in turning your back to developers is the sacrifice on margins. But HDFC has managed to keep the margin erosion to the minimum. Spread on loans was 2.26% for the September quarter, marginal erosion from 2.28% a year ago.
Investors need to watch how long the lender can keep its margins from eroding especially when its developer book is hardly growing. HDFC has been able to maintain margins perhaps partly due to the edge it has in borrowing costs. Compared with its peers, HDFC has enjoyed lower cost of borrowing as its bonds are priced aggressively in the market.
Times may be tough but mortgage lender HDFC Ltd has showed it is tougher, at least so far. That said, HDFC needs to pull through a slowing economy the pain point of which is the real estate sector. Success in this will ensure investors maintain the premium on its stock."

Indian markets ended moderately lower today, snapping a seven-day winning run. The Sensex ended 53 points lower at 40,248 while Nifty settled 0.2% lower at 11,917. Yes Bank settled 3.5% higher at  ₹68.35 to be the top gainer among the Sensex stocks.  
Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala on Monday bought nearly 1.3 crore shares of Yes Bank, amounting to 0.5% stake of the private lender, for around  ₹87 crore through open market transactions. 
Some market participants expect Indian markets to consolidate in the near term after the record-setting rally that has seen Sensex hitting new highs. 
""Nifty again took resistance near 12,000 zone for third consecutive session. Now index has good support near 11850-11800 zone any break below 11850 zone can see some more cuts in index and immediate resistance is coming near 11,950-12.000 mark. Bulls will get active again if index manages to breach 12,000 zone,"" says Rohit Singre, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.
Shrikant Chouhan, senior vice-president at equity technical research at Kotak Securities, said:  ""The market has taken a breather. Excitement is missing in the market as majority of the index participants have already declared their Q2 numbers and now traders will wait for either domestic developments or global development on the trade tariff front. Technically, buying zone for the market is around 11,800.""
Apart from Yes Bank, other top gainers in the Sensex pack include Bajaj Finance (2.7%), Bharti Airtel (1.6%), SBI 1.6%, Bajaj Auto 1.4% and ITC 1%.
Among the losers, Kotak Mahindra Bank, M&M, Tata Steel, Infosys, Sun Pharma and IndusInd Bank declined between 1% and 2.4%."
63,2019-11-05,HDFC Bank,"CDSL has a well-diversified business model in which 35% of the revenue is fixed, cushioning it from volatilityShares of BSE have declined 7.8% this year with the exchange continuing to lose market share to its competitor NSE

The market value of Asia’s oldest stock exchange BSE Ltd slipped below that of its depository subsidiary Central Depository Services (India) Ltd (CDSL) for the first time on Tuesday, as its stock fell nearly 8% so far this year.
On Tuesday, the market capitalization of CDSL stood at  ₹2,431 crore, against BSE’s  ₹2,430.31 crore. At the end of September, BSE held 24% stake in CDSL.
Typically, the parent company’s market value should be more than that of its subsidiary, considering the parent may have its own core business in addition to the subsidiary units. However, there are some exceptions where the units are valued higher. For instance, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd and Bajaj Finance Ltd have higher market value than their parent Suzuki Motor Corp., Housing Development Corp Ltd, and Bajaj Finserv Ltd, respectively.
Shares of BSE have declined 7.8% this year with the exchange continuing to lose market share to its competitor National Stock Exchange. BSE went public in February 2017 and its shares have since fallen 31.7% from its issue price of  ₹806 a share.
BSE’s financial performance has been muted over the past several quarters, and this has reflected in its stock price, according to Ajit Mishra, vice president of Religare Broking.
“Despite BSE’s duopoly position, the stock has been on a continuous downtrend ever since its IPO in early 2017. It has been losing market share and the network effect is playing against it, which is why it is a dying business model with no visibility for growth and weak durability and sustainability of earnings,"" said Umesh Mehta, head of research, Samco Securities.
Shares of CDSL, which was listed in June 2017, have surged more than 59% from the issue price of  ₹149 a share. So far this year, they have gained 6%.
CDSL has an asset-light and well-diversified business model in which 35% of the revenue is fixed (annuity-based), which cushions it from market volatility. “CDSL has a more secular business working in a duopoly position where there is high visibility of earnings sustainability and durability. The triggers of the government’s new rule that even unlisted companies will have to dematerialise their shares and the huge untapped potential of investors in India around 10%, which is currently just 2%, have laid the foundation for a rally,"" Mehta said."
62,2019-11-06,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh has sought for a one-time restructuring to kick-start lending to the sectorParekh said that such a regulatory concession was given by the Reserve bank of India in 2008 which helped revive sentiment

MUMBAI :
A day after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman spoke about reforms in the real estate sector, lenders call for government intervention for the ailing sector and sought approval for restructuring of real estate projects without being tagged as non-performing assets. Speaking at the Indian Mortgage Leadership Conclave organised by India Mortgage Guarantee Corporation, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh has sought for a one-time restructuring to kick-start lending to the sector.
“I do believe that we can overcome this crisis of confidence if lenders are allowed a one-time restructuring of certain real estate loans – particularly for stuck projects where building approvals have been delayed. If these restructured accounts are considered as standard assets for a period of say, 12 months, lenders will stop being so diffident,"" Parekh said.
Parekh said that such a regulatory concession was given by the Reserve bank of India in 2008 which helped revive sentiment. According to him, restructuring will enable last mile funding even to assets that have slipped owing to tight funding conditions and ensure that these projects are completed.
Axis Bank managing director and chief executive officer Amitabh Chaudhry too felt that there is a need to help those projects which are stuck in 60% plus construction progress and are not able to carry forward. In such cases, lenders are neither not able to invest more funds nor are the developers able to construct and finish the project without further investments.
“We need to have a mechanism where lenders can look to restructure these assets, lend more with stronger governance, end use monitoring and look to complete the projects. The fine print of the govt schemes on this is awaited, we should be able to see the industry making progress on it once the same gets rolled out,"" said Chaudhry.
According to a Fitch Ratings report in October, around $10 billion of development loans are coming up for repayment in the first half of 2020 and this may impact mainstream banks that have lent money to shadow lenders or invested in their bonds. Sitharaman said the government wants to ensure that the crisis in the real estate sector does not spill over to other industries.
Defaults by Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd and Altico Capital have aggravated the issue, making banks excessively cautious in extending loans to housing finance companies (HFCs) and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).
A study jointly conducted by industry body Ficci, National Real Estate Development Council and consultant Knight Frank has stated that the outlook for the country’s real estate sector in the September quarter has fallen to the level that was recorded during the uncertain times before general elections in 2014.
The number of property developers reporting bankruptcy has doubled during the past nine months, which has added to the woes of NBFCs, according to a 14 October Reuters report.
As of 30 June, 421 developers are under the corporate insolvency resolution process, up from 209 as of September-end of last year, according to data from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India."

58,2019-11-08,HDFC Bank,"The rating actions follow the affirmation of India's Baa2 sovereign rating, and the change in the outlook to negative from stableThe outlook was revised down for EXIM India, HDFC Bank, Hero FinCorp, HUDCO, IRFC, and SBI

Mumbai: Moody's Investor Services on Friday downgraded financial institutions closely linked to the Indian government's sovereign rating from 'stable' to 'negative' after a similar rating action on India's sovereign outlook which elicited a quick response from the government.
Moody's on Friday revised the outlook of six systemically financial institutions including the State Bank of India and HDFC Bank to negative from stable. 
The rating actions follow the affirmation of India's Baa2 sovereign rating, and the change in the outlook to negative from stable a day earlier.
The outlook was revised down for EXIM India, HDFC Bank, Hero FinCorp, HUDCO, IRFC, and SBI but was maintained at stable for Bank of India (BOI), Canara Bank (CAN), Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC), Syndicate Bank (Syndicate) and Union Bank of India (UBI).
Explaining the rational for the downgrade of EXIM India, HUDCO, IRFC, and SBI, Moody's said that their final ratings are at the same level as the sovereign rating because of the uplift to their ratings, based on Moody's assumption that these companies will receive government support in times of need.
""Consequently, if Moody's downgrades the sovereign rating, it will also downgrade these companies' final ratings. The close links between the four companies and the government is the key reason why Moody's has changed the outlooks for these companies to negative from stable, after doing the same for the sovereign rating,"" Moody's said in a statement.
Moody's justified its rating action on the country's largest private bank, HDFC Bank by saying that the bank has large direct exposure to government debt and also as the Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA) of a bank is capped at the sovereign rating of the country that it operates in.
Moody's said it expects that BOI, CAN, OBC, Syndicate and UBI to continue to enjoy a very high level of support from the government. Under these support assumptions, even if the sovereign rating is downgraded by one notch to Baa3, the support uplift should be sufficient to keep the final ratings unchanged at Baa3, it said.
""This situation is the key driver of Moody's affirmation of the five banks' ratings.
Moody's does not have any particular governance concern for all the issuers impacted by today's rating action,"" it added.
Separately, Moody's downgraded the long-term counterparty risk assessment and long-term local currency counterparty risk rating of HDFC Bank's Bahrain branch and ICICI Bank's Bahrain Branch to Ba2(cr) from Ba1(cr) and Ba2 from Ba1 to align these ratings with Bahrain's local currency ceilings.
Also for ICICI Bank Bahrain Branch, Moody's downgraded the long-term foreign currency senior unsecured medium-term note programme rating and subordinate medium-term note programme rating to (P)Ba3 from (P)Ba2 to align these ratings with Bahrain's foreign currency bond ceiling.
There are currently no outstanding bonds issued out of the Bahrain branch, Moody's said in a statement.

57,2019-11-08,HDFC Bank,"The revision may impact the overseas borrowing programmes of the affected banksMoody’s on Friday revised outlook for 6 financial institutions, including SBI, HDFC Bank and Hudco

NEW DELHI :
Moody’s Investors Service’s revision of the outlook for key Indian banks and financial institutions from stable to negative on Friday could make it dearer for them to borrow on international markets in the short term, three analysts said. This could have implications for their lending rates, too.
Moody’s on Friday affirmed the ratings, but revised the outlook for six banks and financial institutions—State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC Bank, Hero FinCorp, EXIM India, Housing and Urban Development Corp. (Hudco) and Indian Railway Finance Corp. (IRFC)—following a similar revision in outlook for India’s Baa2 sovereign rating in light of increasing risks that economic growth will remain lower than in the past.
The outlook revision could impact overseas borrowing programmes of the affected banks, said an analyst with a rating agency in India, adding that the actual quantum of impact may be hard to predict.
“Any rating action will have an impact based on the direction, positive or negative. These are international ratings. Logically, the revision in outlook would have an impact but this depends on whether these institutions are looking at borrowing abroad at this point in time,"" said the analyst, requesting anonymity.
Moody’s said it will downgrade the ratings of SBI, HDFC Bank, EXIM India, Hudco and IRFC if it downgrades India’s sovereign rating. “The close links between the companies and the government of India is the key reason why Moody’s has changed the outlooks for these companies to negative from stable, after doing the same for the sovereign rating,"" said the rating agency statement.
It added that if India’s Baa2 sovereign rating were to be downgraded, HDFC Bank’s rating will also be downgraded in view of the strong linkages between the bank’s business and the sovereign credit profile.“Many financial institutions do raise capital from overseas markets and the outlook revision will obviously have a bearing on cost of borrowing per se in the short term. The government has been taking steps to improve the macroeconomic conditions and once those steps start showing results, the rating outlook will also return to stable,"" said a partner at a consultancy service, who also requested anonymity.
A third analyst, who also asked not to be named, said the outlook revision can have a bearing on borrowing costs, but not as sharply as a ratings downgrade.
Friday’s sovereign rating outlook revision, which financial institutions are also linked with, reflects lower policy effectiveness in addressing long-standing economic and institutional weaknesses, than Moody’s had previously estimated, the rating agency said.
Moody’s has also revised down the outlook of state-run energy companies such as Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltd, which could have an adverse effect on their overseas borrowing costs.
External commercial borrowing (ECB) has been a popular source of capital for Indian businesses. Care Ratings had said on Thursday that there has been a resurgence in ECBs in the past one year, following a decline in the preceding three years, in light of underlying conditions in the domestic economy and financial markets, coupled with the liberalisation of ECB rules.
India has eased ECB rules only when a pressing need is noticed by the government and the Reserve Bank of India, so that cheaper foreign funds do not flood the local economy and create asset bubbles."

MUMBAI :
Indian equity market ended higher on Thursday led by gains in financial services and IT sectors. However, positive investor sentiment was marred by headline inflation rate based on consumer price index (CPI) that breached Reserve Bank of India’s medium-term target of 4% for the first time since July 2018.
The government released CPI inflation data after market hours on Wednesday. Retail Inflation jumped to 4.62% in October from 3.99% in September due to a surge in food inflation.
Contrary to the rise in CPI inflation, wholesale prices based inflation, or WPI, eased further to 0.16% in October from 0.33% in September due to subdued prices of non-food articles and fall in prices of manufactured items, according to the government data released today.
BSE Sensex gained 170.42 points or 0.42% to close at 40,286.48, while the Nifty 50 index climbed up 31.65 points or 0.27% ending at 11,872.10 in today’s trade.
Asian markets were trading mixed. Japan's Nikkei225 lost 0.76% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.93%, whereas China's Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.16% and Korea's Kospi index rose 0.79%.
Among stocks, ICICI Bank Ltd, Bajaj Finance Ltd, HDFC twins—HDFC Bank Ltd and HDFC Ltd, Axis Bank Ltd and Yes Bank were the biggest gainers in the financial services sector. In the tech sector, Infosys Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd gained the most.
Vodafone Idea fell 20.27% to close at  ₹2.95 after news reports suggested that the department of telecommunications (DoT) has asked operators to conduct a self-assessment of pending dues after last month’s Supreme Court verdict that upheld the government’s definition of adjusted gross revenue.
SpiceJet Ltd tumbled 5.94% and closed at  ₹106.95 after the company reported a consolidated net loss of  ₹461.2 crore for the quarter-ended September due to rise in total expenditure. The company had posted a loss of  ₹382.7 crore a year ago. Total expenditure jumped 55% year-on-year to  ₹3,537.5 crore in the September quarter compared with  ₹2,286.7 crore a year ago.
Muthoot Finance Ltd soared 9.54% to close at  ₹707.5 after the company reported a rise of 41% year-on-year growth in profit before tax at  ₹1,047 crore for the September quarter on the back of strong operational income. The stock was the biggest gainer in the BSE's 'A' group.
Shares of Aurobindo Pharma Ltd hit a five-year low today after the drug maker said it received 14 observations from the US Food and Drug Administration for its manufacturing facility at Hyderabad—a move that may disrupt supplies and delay future approvals. The stock ended down 8.73% at  ₹395.55.
Among sectoral Indices, BSE IT was the biggest gainer with a rise of 1.07% followed by BSE Consumer Durables 0.87% and BSE Finance 0.80%. However, BSE Telecom lost the most at 2.76%, BSE Metal was down 1.98% and BSE Capital Goods slipped 0.84%."

New Delhi: HDFC Bank Ltd crossed  ₹7 trillion in market capitalisation for the first time on Friday to become India's third firm and first lender to achieve this milestone. The stock has surged 21% so far this year.
So far today, the lender’s shares touched a fresh record high of  ₹1283.40 on the BSE. At 9.20 am, the scrip traded at  ₹1,280.60, up 0.5% from previous close, with market capitalisation at  ₹7.01 trillion.
The Sensex rose 0.4% to 40,443.96 points.
Earlier, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Reliance Industries Ltd had achieved this landmark. Currently, RIL is the most-valued company with a market capitalisation of  ₹9.32 trillion, followed by TCS with at  ₹8.19 trillion.
The HDFC stock has been popular among investors because of strong growth in profitability, stable bad loan ratio and superior deposit franchise credit underwriting and structurally better net interest margin. The recent liquidity crisis has had little impact on its portfolio.
The bank’s net profit increased 26.8% year-on year to  ₹6,345 crore for September quarter, compared to  ₹6,198 crore consensus estimate of analyst tracked by Bloomberg.
""The Bank continues to deliver consistent performance despite challenging macro environment. We expect the bank to maintain consistency in ROA, with expectations of 2.0% and 2.1% for FY20E and FY21E, respectively,"" said Elara Capital.
The lender’s asset quality remained stable even as the absolute value of bad loans rose 6% to  ₹12,508 crore. Gross non-performing assets ratio stood at 1.38% in Q2 versus 1.4% in the previous quarter. Provisions rose 3% quarter on quarter to  ₹2,700 crore.
""Given the general economic slowdown, near term pressure is evident. However, considering the focus on balance sheet growth maintaining superior asset quality, the bank is well poised to deliver consistently with margin leadership & robust return ratios. The bank remains a portfolio stock with premium valuations,"" said ICICI Direct Research.
HDFC Bank shares are currently trading at a price to book multiple of 4.1x/3.7x on adjusted FY20E/FY21E book value. Analysts expect the premium valuation of the bank to continue owing to its high return on equity, industry leading asset quality metrics and expanding retail franchisee which supports high margin lending opportunities alongside keeping funding costs low.

48,2019-11-20,HDFC Bank,"Vehicles crossing toll plazas without FASTags will be charged double the toll feesYou can buy FASTags online and through branches of several banks like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank

NEW DELHI :
From December 1, expect less traffic at toll plazas across highways in India but also get ready to pay double the toll tax if FASTag is missing from your vehicle. To promote seamless movement of vehicles and minimise traffic congestion at toll plazas, the ministry of road transport and highways has made it mandatory for all vehicles to have FASTags.
What is FASTag
Based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, FASTag is affixed on windscreen of vehicles. FASTag-affixed vehicles do not have to stop at toll gates as charges are deducted from the prepaid or bank account when the vehicle is moving. Drivers do not have to stop their vehicle to make transactions as the toll collection will be done electronically under the National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC) programme.
The new FASTag rule
From December 1, all lanes in all toll fee plazas on national highways across the country will turn into dedicated FASTag lanes. According to the National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008, a FASTag lane in a toll plaza is reserved exclusively for the movement of FASTag users. If you are passing without FASTag, you will be charged double the fee.
One lane has been kept as hybrid where FASTags as well as other modes of payment will be accepted.
How to buy FASTags and recharge it
Besides select bank branches and point-of-sale at toll plazas of national highways, selected bank branches, FASTags can be bought online through e-commerce portal Amazon. After you buy it, you need to activate it by entering details in My FASTag mobile app. After that, you need to link the tag to an existing bank account for deduction of toll tax.
You can recharge your FASTag account using debit card, credit card, netbanking, etc. Otherwise, you can also link it directly to your bank account and thus
A cashback of 2.5% is being offered for 2019-20 in order to incentivise road users for FASTag use. According to the highways ministry, more than 6 million FASTags were issued till September, with overall cumulative ETC collection of over  ₹12,850 crore since inception."
47,2019-11-22,HDFC Bank,"He is overweight financials by two percentage points versus the MSCI India IndexHis top picks include HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank Ltd

India’s banking sector may witness a turnaround, after recent rule changes put banks in a better position to get their money back from insolvent companies, according to Ridham Desai, managing director at Morgan Stanley India Co.
A Supreme Court ruling last week not only paved the way for ArcelorMittal’s purchase of Essar Steel India Ltd., an Indian steel mill, but also allowed banks to set the terms of the distribution of sale proceeds among creditors. The move to empower banks “has settled several disputes"" around India’s bankruptcy law introduced in 2016, Desai said at a conference in Singapore on Thursday.
“Last week’s judgment may well prove to be an inflection point for the sector,"" Desai said, adding that banks previously were not well-placed to recover loans. “I would be fairly optimistic of the banking sector in India.""
Indian lenders, which are saddled with some of the world’s worst bad-loan ratios, are expected to get a boost from increased regulatory oversight of the shadow banking sector as well, he added. The government last week introduced rules to help creditors recover loans due from large shadow lenders.
Meanwhile, authorities have also stepped up surveillance of non-banking financial companies of late, seizing control of another institution, Dewan Housing Finance Corp., which has total debt of about $12.5 billion.
The Mumbai-based analyst is overweight financials by two percentage points versus the MSCI India Index, with a preference for seven financial firms including HDFC Bank Ltd. and ICICI Bank Ltd. The NSE Nifty Bank Index, a gauge of the most liquid and large-cap banking stocks in the country, has risen 15% this year and is near a record high.
Furthermore, the government’s planned capital injection into public sector banks, which account for 65% of the industry, is “the biggest cyclical fix"" that will support the sector, according to Desai. In August, the Indian government announced a series of state-bank mergers and a capital injection of  ₹55,250 ($7.7 billion) -- its most sweeping bank overhaul in decades -- in a bid to revive the economy.
“You should see signs of a new credit cycle in the next 12 months,"" Desai said.

46,2019-11-24,HDFC Bank,"Compare the rates before you apply for a personal loanAllahabad bank offers the most affordable interest rates at 8.40-12.90% and also charges a processing fee of 1.06% of the loan amount

Personal loans are one of the most expensive categories of loans you can avail of. These are unsecured loans that can be easily availed of and banks are eager to offer them. In fact, you might have received a few calls offering instant personal loan because you have been a loyal customer to your bank. However, if you opt for a personal loan, expect to pay an interest rate of anywhere between 9% and 20% per annum. The reason is simple: an unsecured loan means that the lender will not ask for a collateral. This is only feasible for the lender if they have a sense of what your credit history is like and whether you have the capability to repay the loan. But that isn’t enough of a safety net. Hence the high interest rate.
Given that they are expensive, but easily available, personal loans seem like a good option to fund an emergency expense, if you don’t have a contingency fund in place, or if the fund was depleted for some reason. Of course in the absence of emergency money, falling back on taking a personal loan may seem like a feasible solution if say a family member needs to be hospitalized suddenly. But funding lifestyle expenses using debt is a strict no no.
But that doesn’t stop most from borrowing for all the wrong reasons. According to RBI data, personal loans constituted 96 % of new bank loans taken in financial year 2018, according to RBI data. And according to a report by CASHe, a digital lending company, in 2018, 23% salaried millennials took short-term personal loans to refinance individual EMIs and 14% borrowed to pay off their loans.
While it’s not advisable to take a personal loan unless you have an emergency or immediate requirement for funds that can’t be serviced otherwise, if you do want to opt for one, it’s wise to analyse which bank can offer you the lowest interest rates. Allahabad bank offers the most affordable interest rates at 8.40-12.90% and also charges a processing fee of 1.06% of the loan amount. But even among the top 15 banks we have listed, the highest interest rates goes up to 11.25-13.65% offered by Syndicate Bank, with an additional processing charge of 0.50%. Take a look at the list of personal loans available at the best rates before you make your decision.

NEW DELHI :
The board of directors of HDFC Bank at its meeting held on Thursday set up a search committee to identify a successor to managing director Aditya Puri. Puri, MD since the bank was set up in 1994, is one of the longest serving heads of a bank in India’s financial services history. His tenure ends on 26 October 2020. He turns 70 next year.
Puri shall act as an advisor to the committee, the company said in an exchange filing. The committee, over the next few months, shall evaluate internal and external candidates to ensure a smooth transition.
The board of directors also approved the appointment of Sashidhar Jagdishan and Bhavesh Zaver as additional and executive directors both. Their appointments, effectively immediately for three years, are subject to the approval of Reserve Bank of India.
In October 2018, the Reserve Bank of India had approved the re-appointment of Puri as managing director of the bank for another two years.
Puri has been instrumental in making HDFC Bank one of the most valued lenders banks globally.
The HDFC Bank stock has been popular among investors because of strong growth in profitability, stable bad loan ratio and superior deposit franchise credit underwriting and structurally better net interest margin. The recent liquidity crisis has had little impact on its portfolio. The bank informally carries the tag of ‘25% growth engine’ in the stock market for consistently growth its profit by at least that much for several years.
The bank’s net profit rose 26.8% year-on year to  ₹6,345 crore in the September quarter.
Managing director since 1994 when the bank was set up, Puri took home  ₹13.7 crore in total remuneration in FY19.

On 26th November, CARE Ratings downgraded bank facilities worth  ₹10,500 crore and NCDs worth 495 crore issued by Simplex from BBB to BB+. The ratings agency cited lack of infusion of equity capital by the promoters, moderation of profitability, deterioration of working capital cycle and stretched liquidity as reasons for the downgrade.

MUMBAI :
Private sector lender HDFC Bank Ltd on Thursday kick-started the much-awaited process of finding a successor to its longest-serving chief Aditya Puri, whose tenure ends on 26 October 2020.
In a notice to stock exchanges, the bank said that it has set up a six-member committee comprising board members—HDFC Bank chairman Shyamala Gopinath, Sanjiv Sachar, M.D. Ranganathan, Sandeep Parekh, Srikanth Nadhamuni and Keki Mistry—to find the new chief executive officer. Puri will act as an advisor to the search committee.
Over the next few months, the committee will evaluate internal and external candidates to ensure smooth transition, the notice added.
The bank also announced the elevation of Sashidhar Jagdishan and Bhavesh Zaveri as executive directors for a period of three years.
Jagdishan, who was elevated from chief financial officer to the position of a change agent with added responsibilities in August, was being seen as the likely candidate to succeed Puri.
The bank’s number two position fell vacant after Paresh Sukthankar, the deputy managing director who was considered as a front-runner to succeed Puri, put in his papers last year.
In May 2018, Puri had told analysts that the bank will start the process of identifying his successor.
At the annual general meeting this year, Puri had said that his replacement should be better than him and should not require 18 months handholding for the job.
Puri, who turns 70 next year, has been credited with building India’s most valuable bank since its inception in 1994. As on 28 November, the private sector bank’s market capitalization stands at  ₹6.9 trillion.
HDFC Bank reported profit of  ₹6,345 crore for the September quarter, up 26.7% year-on-year on the back of higher interest income and other income.
This, despite witnessing a 48% year-on-year (y-o-y) increase in total provisions to  ₹2,700 crore. Of the total provisions,  ₹2,038 crore was for loan loss, the bank said in a regulatory filing.
Its asset quality saw a slight deterioration in the September quarter with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of gross advances rising 5 basis points (bps) year-on-year to 1.38%.
However, on a sequential basis, the bad loan ratio was down 2bps."
40,2019-11-29,HDFC Bank,"India’s biggest retail lender, HDFC Bank Ltd saw its retail loan book grow by 15% in the September quarter, lower than previous quartersNon-bank retail lender Bajaj Finance Ltd also witnessed a slowdown

Bank credit growth may be at a five-year low, but still hasn’t reached the bottom. It won’t be the corporate loan book, but retail loans that could pull down growth in the coming months.
Indian banks have been chasing the retail customer over a decade now, since businessmen were busy deleveraging their balance sheets. Also, the retail customer turned out to be more disciplined in repayments with delinquencies being low. In the 10 years since 2008, retail loans on an average grew at a breakneck pace of about 20%, in some months even faster.
In fiscal year 2018-19, this fast-paced engine began to slow a bit. As of September, the growth came to about 17%. Part of this is due to banks’ own caution after economic growth data began to show a slowdown in consumption. As the sentiment around future employment and earnings soured, lenders realized that the retail customer could come under stress.
Indeed, delinquency rates have inched up in the unsecured personal loan space, although they are far from raising serious worry. Even so, bankers seem to have taken of note of this. If one pieces together the commentary from big banks during the September quarter, there seems to be a cautionary note setting in.
India’s biggest retail lender, HDFC Bank Ltd saw its retail loan book grow by 15% in the September quarter, lower than previous quarters.
Non-bank retail lender Bajaj Finance Ltd also witnessed a slowdown. In a conversation with Mint post quarterly results, the lender’s managing director Rajeev Jain said that festive season demand was not as good as expected.
Both lenders have tightened their risk filters on retail loans. HDFC Bank in an earnings conference call told analysts that it has tightened its filters and policies to chase better customers and to keep delinquencies in check.
Ergo, the sobering effect on loan growth cannot be ruled out.
“We believe the near-term growth will continue to taper down further and could pull headline banking system loan growth towards demonetization lows,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
During demonetization, credit offtake had halted, as banks were occupied with handling the demonetized currency notes. Recall that during the demonetization quarter, loan growth crashed to 4%.
As of 8 November, credit growth was 8.1%. The drivers of loan growth for banks have been retail and small business loans so far. The corporate loan book has been growing in low single digits.
Given the concerns over consumption demand and employment prospects, banks cannot be faulted for their growing caution on consumer loans. The worst of credit growth deceleration is yet to come."

33,2019-12-03,HDFC Bank,"Sebi has estimated the total exposure of lenders to Karvy at  ₹2,800 croreBajaj Finance is aggrieved by the Sebi order, which prevents it from accessing its pledged shares

Mumbai: The Securities and Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Tuesday gave Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) time till 10 December to pass an order in the plea filed by Bajaj Finance Ltd against the capital market regulator’s move to transfer pledged shares to clients of the troubled Karvy Stock Broking Ltd.
Sebi has estimated the total exposure of lenders to Karvy at  ₹2,800 crore, of which Bajaj Finance has an exposure of  ₹345 crore as per a copy of the petition reviewed by Mint.
Bajaj Finance is aggrieved by the Sebi order, which prevents it from accessing its pledged shares. The firm claimed that it has the right to its pledged securities and that Sebi was wrong in returning the securities to the accounts of Karvy’s clients.
HDFC Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd and some other lenders also joined Bajaj Finance on Tuesday in its plea against the Sebi move. An order in their pleas will be passed later. SAT asked Sebi to hear Bajaj Finance’s plea by Wednesday.
Early on Monday, the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE) and the BSE suspended Karvy’s trading licence for all segments due to non-compliance with the exchange’s and Sebi norms. Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) and MSEI also suspended the licence of the brokerage firm.\
This action follows the 22 November order by Sebi which had said the brokerage firm misused client securities and used it for other purposes. Karvy had sold clients securities and the proceeds were transferred to related party businesses such as Karvy Realty Ltd.
Sebi’s prompt action against Karvy has resulted in nearly 83,000 investors getting back their securities, which were illegally transferred by the brokerage firm to its own account and were even pledged without any authorisation.
With the latest transfer by National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL), nearly 90% investors have got back their securities and the remaining ones will get after clearing their dues.
Karvy took loans to the tune of  ₹600 crore by pledging securities worth more than  ₹2,300 crore of 95,000 clients with lenders. Of these, 95,000 clients, nearly 83,000 of them have got their securities.
On 20 November, Bajaj Finance issued a loan recall notice to Karvy and the pledges against the loan would have been invoked on 23 November. Sebi had on 22 November barred depositories from transferring securities from Karvy’s account except to beneficial owners or clients who had paid in full. The petition also says Karvy had given a false undertaking to Bajaj Finance that these securities belonged to the brokerage."
32,2019-12-03,HDFC Bank,"Lenders move tribunal to recover over  ₹1,000 cr loans from the brokerageSebi’s 22 November order said Karvy had misused client securities, pledging them to raise money

Mumbai: India’s top two private banks, HDFC Bank Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd, on Tuesday fought to lay their hands on client shares that Karvy Stock Broking Ltd had pledged with them, seeking to recover  ₹1,000 crore they had lent to the brokerage.
The case will require the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) to address a core dilemma: who owns these shares — the client who bought the shares, or the lender who advanced money against them without verifying their actual ownership?
At Tuesday’s hearing, the lenders sought to quash a 22 November order by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which prevented them from accessing these shares. They also wanted SAT to set aside the National Securities Depository Ltd’s (NSDL) transfer of these securities to client accounts on Monday. Consequently, they have also made NSDL and the National Stock Exchange parties to the case.
The lenders said in their petitions that following the Sebi order, they had requested the regulator not to initiate any action on transferring these shares to clients as they had bona fide rights to them. The two banks told the tribunal that it was common industry practice to lend against pledged shares (LAS) and there was no reason to suspect Karvy’s claim that it owned these shares.
Sebi’s 22 November order said Karvy had misused client securities, pledging them to raise money, some of which was transferred to related-party businesses such as Karvy Realty Ltd. SAT will rule on the banks’ petition on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, while ruling on a Bajaj Finance Ltd plea of a similar nature, SAT asked Sebi to hear the lender’s representation and pass appropriate orders by 10 December and put a stop to any more transfer of securities to clients’ accounts. A petition by IndusInd Bank was also merged with the petitions by HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. The brokerage firm owes the lender  ₹132.50 crore against pledged shares.
Mint reported on 3 December that NSDL had transferred securities worth  ₹2,013.77 crore to the accounts of 83,306 clients. Karvy owes ICICI Bank  ₹642 crore and HDFC Bank had granted the brokerage a loan facility of  ₹350 crore. Bajaj Finance has an exposure of  ₹345 crore.
In its petition, HDFC Bank claimed that following the Sebi direction, the loan which was earlier secured by pledged shares had suddenly become unsecured as it cannot access those shares.
During the course of arguments, the lenders said LAS facilities are a common market practice and are routinely used by brokers for working capital and margin requirements. The lenders said their loan sanction letters specifically stated that pledged shares belonged to Karvy, its group companies or its promoters.
The Sebi counsel, however, said banks should have ascertained the ownership of these shares and conducted better due diligence. Counsel Rafique Dada said banks remained ignorant despite the Sebi circular of June 2019, which ruled that brokers cannot pledge clients’ securities and starting 1 October, brokers had to unwind such pledges.
HDFC Bank, however, countered that since the shares were from Karvy’s account, it believed that the broker was the owner of the securities and “there was no reason to enquire or ascertain whether these securities belonged to Karvy or any of its clients"".
ICICI Bank said in its petition that such an order without hearing the bankers is detrimental to its 800,000 public shareholders and banking customers. On 5 November, ICICI Bank had issued a notice to Karvy to return all the loans, failing which it would invoke the pledges for recovery.
The lenders also alleged that Sebi and NSDL did not respond to their requests on transfer of securities to clients’ accounts, which would leave them with almost no shares.
NSDL said that it complied with Sebi’s 22 November directions and transferred securities to the beneficial owners, which are the clients. In fact, the depository conducted a board meeting before taking a call as this was not a routine case, but one of alleged fraud."
35,2019-12-03,HDFC Bank,"HDFC Bank Ltd., India’s most valuable lender by market capitalization, sees tentative signs of a revival in rural areas at a time when the wider economy is sputtering

HDFC Bank Ltd., India’s most valuable lender by market capitalization, sees tentative signs of a revival in rural areas at a time when the wider economy is sputtering.
“The recent loan outreach programs underway in rural areas have given us the sense that the consumption in rural and semi-urban areas is turning more positive,"" HDFC Bank Executive Director Kaizad Bharucha said in an interview last week. The rural and semi-urban sector, which accounts for at least half of India’s output, got 48% of the bank’s total loans as of end-September.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has unveiled several steps to boost the economy, which is growing at its weakest pace in more than six years, including a surprise $20 billion corporate tax cut. The Reserve Bank of India is expected to cut interest rates again this week, after Friday’s report that gross domestic product growth slowed to 4.5% in the September quarter.
For HDFC Bank, the weaker economy had led to a slowdown in loan growth, which eased to 15% in the September quarter from 23% a year earlier. But it remained healthy compared with the overall banking system which saw credit growth slowing to a two-year low just above 8%.
“As a bank we are well positioned to offset a slowdown in either the consumption or investment side as we are present across the spectrum,"" Bharucha said. “The demand for credit is not going away. It may just be subdued for a period of time,"" he added.
He’s also cautiously optimistic about the outlook for corporate investment, based on the bank’s soundings with Indian executives.
Muted loan growth has hardly dented the upward march in HDFC Bank’s shares, which are about 20% higher so far this year. Now valued at about $96 billion, the company trades around 26 times projected 12 month earnings. That’s almost three times more expensive than the Bloomberg World Banks Index and is the biggest valuation premium on record.
Meanwhile, non-bank lenders from Dewan Housing Finance Corp Ltd. to Reliance Capital Ltd. have been reeling under a 17-month credit crisis after Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. defaulted on its debt last year. In a further blow to confidence, the Securities and Exchange Board of India placed curbs on operations of Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. after finding evidence it misused client funds.
But Bharucha doesn’t see a wider industry problem.
“There is enough control over stockbrokers and depositories and a default in the segment will not have a systemic impact,"" he said. The central bank “has ensured that there is adequate liquidity in the system and availability of credit is not a problem.""

MUMBAI :
The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Wednesday set 12 December as the deadline for markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to pass the final order in the pleas by ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank against its move transferring pledged shares to clients of the troubled Karvy Stock Broking Ltd.
The appellate body also ruled that it is “untenable"" for the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) to reverse the transfer of securities from clients’ accounts.
“After a due diligence by NSE and NSDL, securities have been transferred to the account of the clients. Therefore, further rights have been created/restored involving more than 80,000 investors. In this context, a prayer to recall the same or to retain the same as frozen accounts of those clients becomes untenable,"" SAT member C.K.G. Nair said in an order on Wednesday.
India’s top two private banks, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, on Tuesday fought to lay their hands on client shares that Karvy Stock Broking had pledged with them, seeking to recover  ₹1,000 crore they had lent the brokerage. IndusInd Bank had also joined the plea, claiming dues of  ₹132.50 crore.
Karvy owes ICICI Bank  ₹642 crore and HDFC Bank had granted the brokerage a loan facility of  ₹350 crore. Another lender, Bajaj Finance, has an exposure of  ₹345 crore, and its plea has already been referred to Sebi for a relook. The total estimated exposure of these four lenders is  ₹1,400 crore, Sebi’s lawyer told Mint. The total misuse of client securities in Karvy’s case is about  ₹2,800 crore.

Total enrolment under the government’s flagship pension scheme Atal Pension Yojana (APY) recently crossed the 2-crore mark after 9 lakh subscribers were added to it in November. PFRDA aims to expand the subscribers base under APY to 2.25 crore by March 2020.
“The primary reason for the uptick in enrolment was due to the creation of awareness among target population regarding its three major benefits--a guaranteed pension for the subscriber, same pension to the spouse after death of the subscriber and return of accumulated corpus to the nominee after death of the both subscriber and the spouse,"" according to a government press release.
Enrolment of first 1 crore subscribers took around 3 years while enrolment of next 1 crore enrolment took only one and a half years, indicating the increased pace of APY enrolment, the release said.
Under the scheme, the government covers workers in unorganised sector between the age of 18 and 40. Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) regulates the scheme that provides minimum guaranteed monthly pension of  ₹1,000 to  ₹5,000 from the age of 60.
Until November of this fiscal, more than 46 lakh APY accounts were added, a growth of around 30% compared with the same period last year. Out of the 46 lakh new APY accounts, more than 36 lakh accounts were sourced from public-sector banks, around 7 lakh accounts from regional rural banks and more than 3 lakh accounts from private sector and payment banks, the release said.
So far in the current financial year ending March 2020, India’s largest public-sector lender, State Bank of India (SBI), accounted for more than 13.5 lakh APY accounts followed by Canara Bank, Bank of Baroda and Bank of India. While in terms of average account per branch or AAPB, Indian Bank sourced highest APY accounts followed by SBI and Bank of India.
In the payments bank category, Airtel Payments Bank got more than 2 lakh APY accounts, while Axis Bank Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd were the top contributors among privates sector banks in terms of number of enrolments.
“There is a long way to go as currently there are around 45 crore people in the unorganised sector. However, the target of providing pension coverage to such people can be achieved with the government’s support,"" the release said."

Indian markets ended almost flat today with some selective buying seen in auto stocks. Maruti Suzuki shares were up nearly 2% while Axis Bank, HDFC and Reliance Industries were the other stocks driving the Sensex.
In a volatile trading session, the Indian benchmark indices swung both ways before closing flat at 11,937 levels. Sensex rose 42.28 points to close at 40,487.43 while Nifty settled above 11,930.
""The broader markets ended on a mixed note with BSE Midcap closing marginally higher and smallcap ending lower by 0.4%. The sectoral indices exhibited mixed trend. While sectors like Auto, Oil & Gas and Metals ended with healthy gains, other indices like Capital Goods, IT and Realty closed with losses,"" Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking Ltd, said.
Going forward, market participants would keep a close watch on CPI, IIP and WPI numbers scheduled to release this week. On the global front, trade deal developments between US-China would be a key determinant in deciding the direction for Indian as well as global markets.
Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said the market was range bound as investors are closely watching the upcoming economic macros like CPI inflation and IIP data for any signs of progress in government's effort to revive the economy. ""FIIs are likely to turn risk averse in domestic market as strong US job data, progress in trade talks & expectation of status quo policy from US FED will add impetus to global market,"" he said.
On the other side, falling interest rate, easy monetary policy across the globe and liquidity is limiting downside for Indian stocks, he said. ""We expect higher volatility and Nifty50 is likely to trade in the range 11750-12100,"" he added.
Markets are expected to remain volatile this week, says Jimeet Modi, CEO of SAMCO Securities.
""US Fed Meeting outcome, advancement in Trump’s impeachment process will be major international events while listing of Ujjivan Small Finance Bank IPO, fundraising by Yes Bank will be some domestic factors traders can keep an eye on,"" he said.
Yes Bank board will meet tomorrow to finalize and approve the details of a preferential allotment and convene an extra-ordinary general meeting subsequently, to obtain the approval of the shareholders.
Ashish Nanda of Kotak Securities says that markets could dip in the near term. ""Technically, the Nifty is heading for 11700 and on the higher side, 11950 and 12000 would be major hurdle zone,"" he said.
Elsewhere, other Asian markets were mostly higher as investors tracked a rally on Wall Street that was fuelled by a better-than-estimated US jobs report, while there was little inspiration from tepid Chinese trade data."
21,2019-12-09,HDFC Bank,"Bank’s lack of communication adds to uncertainty and frustration customers have been facing for a weekThe bank has not notified the stock exchanges, or communicated with its retail customers

MUMBAI :
HDFC Bank Ltd’s credibility as a technology-led bank has taken a beating with its net banking and mobile banking app continuing to face disruptions over the weekend and customers finding it difficult to access their accounts. The bank’s lack of communication has added to the uncertainty and frustration customers have been facing for a week.
The bank assured customers that it had rectified the technical glitch in its online banking facility. “We would like to state that the technical glitch has been rectified. Our NetBanking and MobileBanking App platforms have now stabilized. Once again, we would like to sincerely apologize for all the inconvenience caused,"" HDFC Bank said on December 5.
However, many customers said that they continued to face problems with the bank’s digital banking services on Saturday, which were restored on Sunday.
India’s largest private lender has still to identify the reasons behind the disruption in the services provided by the mobile banking app and net banking. The bank has also failed to not only notify the stock exchanges but also communicate with its 45-million retail customers, barring a few Twitter messages assuring customers that it is working on fixing the outage.
On Thursday, Reserve Bank of India (RBI)) deputy governor M.K. Jain said that the regulator has taken into account the outage and has deployed a team of experts to investigate into the matter. The RBI team will investigate the reasons behind the outage and accordingly give directions to HDFC Bank, Jain said.
The outage has affected scores of HDFC Bank’s customers who complained that they were unable to pay their loan EMIs or settle credit card bills on time. The salaried class was among the worst affected by the glitch as several employers could not transfer salaries into the accounts of their employees, while those who received salaries could not make online transactions. The bank has not yet revealed whether the problem has been caused by a software bug or a systems glitch, or whether it is a case of cyber-security breach.
The outage comes at a time when HDFC Bank is in the process of transitioning from a pure play banking experience to a financial experience. HDFC 2.0, as it is fond of calling the endeavour, is focused on providing customers with a financial marketplace where everything can be done online or through various applications. The execution of digital transformation has resulted in the cost of revenue coming down by 10% over the past two to three years and, HDFC Bank managing director Aditya Puri said, in an interview to YourStory on 17 July, that he expected to bring this figure down by another 5%.
On 22 November, the bank had sent an SMS communication to some customers who were using the old app to download the new version. Last December, the bank faced a similar problem when it replaced its older version of the mobile app with a new one. Customers were unable to use the updated app for more than five days, following which the bank had to revert to the previous version.
HDFC Bank, which bagged the 2019 Best Digital Banking Award from Asiamoney, boasts of 45 million customers with almost 90% of transactions at the bank being digital. The bank does not have anyone heading its digital banking division as the position has been lying vacant since Nitin Chugh, who was driving the digital vision, stepped down early this year and was subsequently appointed as managing director and chief executive at Ujjivan Small Finance Bank."
22,2019-12-09,HDFC Bank,"Lenders have asked brokers to verify the ownership of securitiesSebi is expected to decide on the lenders’ representation on 10 and 12 December, as per the SAT order

Mumbai: The Karvy Stock Broking debacle and the ensuing loss of securities underlying their secured credit have forced lenders, especially banks, to review their exposure to brokerage firms, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Fearing that more secured loans could turn unsecured if the loans are backed by client securities, these lenders have sent out letters to brokers to verify whether these securities belonged to them or to clients, these people said on condition of anonymity.
“We are taking a relook at the documentation and other risk management measures required to ensure that the loan against pledged shares is not misused, like in the case of Karvy,"" said the chief risk management officer of a private sector bank, one of the three people cited above.
Some banks have also begun a review of their exposure to smaller brokers and are considering reducing it by 10%, said the proprietor of a mid-sized brokerage and the second person cited above.
This follows a 22 November notification by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which barred Karvy Stock Broking Ltd from adding new clients or acting on behalf of clients, and ordered depositories to transfer securities only to their beneficial owners.
Karvy is accused of misusing client securities worth  ₹2,800 crore to secure loan facilities from lenders towards working capital. The brokerage also sold off client securities and transferred the proceeds to its real estate group company.
Following the Sebi directive to transfer securities only to beneficial owners, the National Securities Depository Ltd on 2 December transferred  ₹2,013 crore into the accounts of 83,862 Karvy clients, which is almost 90% of the affected clients.
Four lenders then approached the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) saying the shares were pledged with them and therefore they had the right over these shares.
On 4 December, SAT ruled that reversing these transfers was untenable, leaving the lenders with no securities to invoke the pledge.
Karvy owes ICICI Bank  ₹642 crore and HDFC Bank had granted the brokerage a loan facility of  ₹350 crore. IndusInd Bank has an exposure of  ₹132 crore. Another lender, Bajaj Finance Ltd, has an exposure of  ₹345 crore, and its plea has already been referred to Sebi for a relook. The total estimated exposure of these four lenders is  ₹1,400 crore.
The banks were required to file representations with Sebi for redressal of their lost shares. “At least three of the lenders sought that Sebi allow them more time to file representations,"" said a lawyer representing the lenders.
Sebi is expected to decide on the lenders’ representations on 10 and 12 December, as per the SAT order.
“We have received letters this week from bankers trying to verify that the securities belong to us and not to the clients,"" the second person said. “In the Karvy issue, Bajaj Finance had, in fact, relied on the brokerage firm’s assertion that securities belonged to it and not clients.""
While the banks have increased their due diligence on broker exposures, a Sebi official, the third person cited earlier, said this should have happened earlier.
The official said: “Sebi had issued a circular on 20 June this year, asking brokers to segregate their securities from client securities, and prohibited them from using client securities for funding purposes. Considering the changes in rules, the banks should have increased their due diligence earlier. Brokers were also required to unwind the pledges which used client securities, by the end of September, and many of them are yet to affect the same."""

MUMBAI :
Investors are starting to weigh the merits of rotating into small- and mid-sized Indian stocks after a few large companies drove a record-breaking rally in the main equity index.
“Leadership in India’s rally has been very narrow,"" Tim Moe, chief Asia Pacific equity strategist for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said last week in Mumbai. “Valuations are at the high end of the range, both in historical terms and relative valuation compared with the region as a whole.""
The S&P BSE Sensex has risen about 12% from a low in September, with three members — Reliance Industries Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd. and HDFC Bank Ltd. — accounting for 61% of all the gains. The broader market has lagged behind, leaving the valuation gap between smaller firms and the gauge at close to its widest in a decade.
“Many of India’s large caps are overvalued,"" said Sunil Singhania, founder of Mumbai-based Abakkus Asset Manager LLP. “Most of them are unlikely to grow at the rate expected of them."" Abakkus has about 75% of its $300 million in assets invested in small and medium-sized stocks. The firm earlier this year said some quality stocks are likely in a “bubble zone.""
Investors have taken shelter in some of the South Asian nation’s biggest companies amid a credit crunch and the slowest economic growth in six years. That’s added to an extended underperformance by small stocks that goes back to 2017.
Still, Chandresh Nigam, who oversees $14 billion of assets at Axis Asset Management Co. isn’t convinced there’s value in small caps. It is worth paying more for shares of high-quality businesses, he said in an interview last month.
Quality can be expensive, with the Sensex trading at 19 times 12-month blended forward earnings. That’s close to a level that’s proved the ceiling for gains in the past few years.
Yet, the bet has paid off for Axis, with the money manager’s largest equity fund beating 96% of peers in the last five years.
For market breadth to widen, economic outlook needs to improve. Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict the growth is set to return. High valuation has partly priced in the expected recovery, with the MSCI India Index trading at 1.2 standard deviations above its 10-year mean, they wrote in a note.
There are signs investors are warming up to mid-cap stocks. The Nifty Midcap 100 edged out the benchmark index since the start of October, rising 6.3% versus a 4.8% gain for the NSE Nifty 50 Index.
“Early signs point to a change in market undercurrent,"" Navneet Munot, chief investment officer at SBI Mutual Fund said in a note on Tuesday. “‘Value stocks’ have significantly outperformed ‘quality’ over the past two months."""

New Delhi: Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Tuesday:
Yes Bank: The board of the bank is scheduled to meet today to finalise its fundraising plans. The bank has indicated that it has so far received offers worth $3 billion from potential investors. Separately, a Bloomberg report said the bank is likely to reject an offer that made up more than half of its planned $2 billion capital raising and is talking to institutional investors about making up for the shortfall.
HDFC: The mortgaged lender, after market hours on Monday, said it proposes to acquire the remaining 9.12% stake in its higher education financing subsidiary HDFC Credila Financial Services Pvt Ltd (HDFC Credila) for up to  ₹395 crore. The acquisition of HDFC Credila will take place on a fully diluted basis from Ajay Bohora and Anil Bohora. Currently, HDFC Ltd holds 90.88% of the equity share capital in HDFC Credila.
Bharti Airtel: The steep tariff hikes, effected by the troubled telcos earlier this month after five years of after rock bottom prices, can help more than double their operating profit to  ₹60,570 crore in fiscal 2021 from  ₹29,450 crore in 2018-19, according to a report by ratings agency Crisil. Telecom operators hiked tariffs after an unfavourable Supreme Court verdict in the adjusted gross revenue case.
Hero MotoCorp: The company, after market hours on Monday, announced that it will increase prices of its motorcycles and scooters from 1 January 2020. In a regulatory filing, the company said prices of its products will be hiked up to  ₹2,000 across the portfolio. Last week, India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki Ltd announced it will raise product prices starting 1 January 2020.
RIL: The company’s telecom subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is likely to benefit from the tariff hike that it announced earlier this month, according to a report by ratings agency Crisil. It is a “structural positive"" for the telecom sector, which has been weighed down by weak cash flows, mounting debt levels and shrinking revenues due to bare minimum tariffs in the past five years.
Coffee Day Enterprises: The sale of the company’s technology park to Blackstone Group Inc. is stalled as one of its creditors has not approved the deal, according to a Bloomberg report. Yes Bank Ltd has not issued the so-called no objection certificate as seeks assurances on repayments of other loans taken by the company. All other creditors have approved the transaction.
Bank of India: After State Bank of India, public-sector lender Bank of India on Monday reduced its overnight MCLR by 20 basis points (bps) to 7.75%, effective today. The bank has also slashed its one-month MCLR to 8.10% from 8.20%. One year MCLR was reduced by 10 bps to 8.20%. Banks are reducing rates to pass on the benefits to their customers after the Reserve Bank India last week reiterated its concern over slow transmission of rate cuts.
PC Jeweller: Ratings agency Crisil downgraded the company’s long-term and short-term ratings to bank loan facilities to ‘Crisil D’. The agency said, “the downgrade in the rating factors in the instances of devolvement of letter of credits and overutilisation in working capital limits for more than 30 days. The same is reflective of the fact that the liquidity profile of the group has deteriorated in the past few months on account of cash flow mismatch"".
Quess Corp: The board of the company, in a meeting held on Monday, approved cancellation and reduction of 7.13 crore shares held by Thomas Cook (India) Ltd. After cancellation, the board approved allotment of 7.14 crore shares to eligible equity shareholders of Thomas Cook, as per entitlement ratio of the scheme.
Mphasis: The company, after market hours on Monday, clarified that $900 million minimum revenue commitment (MRC) with DXC from September 2016 was not a cumulative calculation and works on the basis of annual thresholds that run for the full tenure of the MRC. The company said DXC continues to remain a strategic partner."

Rohit Singre, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities, said Nifty managed to close the day above 11,900 zone after a super volatile session and formed bullish candle on daily chart.
""After a subdued trade during most part of the day, market witnessed a sharp turnaround due to short covering in index heavyweights. Upcoming macro indicators like CPI inflation & IIP data are unlikely to paint a rosy picture which may reduce upside potential in the near term. On global front, FOMC meeting, UK election and US tariff deadline remain key events,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has lowered India's economic growth forecast for FY2019 to 5.1 per cent on slowing job prospects, rural distress exacerbated by poor harvest and credit crunch.
India's CPI inflation data will be released tomorrow while the Federal Reserve will announce its policy decision today.
Global stock markets rose Wednesday following reports President Donald Trump's advisers were preparing for a possible delay in a weekend tariff hike on Chinese goods.
London and Frankfurt rose in early trading while Shanghai and Hong Kong closed higher. Tokyo declined.

12,2019-12-16,HDFC Bank,"There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loans Personal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow's income today, and unlike other loan products that are used for buying a house or paying for an education, the process involved is simple. In fact, if you already have an account with a bank, you would have come across many offers for a personal loan. While these are easy to get, and offer almost instant gratification, you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan.
This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset; you don’t have to put up any asset like property or gold to be able to get the loan. However, the loan amount on offer and its interest rate depend on a few parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others.
There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loans. These are pre-approved loans—the lender has already looked at your information, based on which it is offering this loan.
Easy to get, but not so easy to pay back. One must remember that personal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral. Here are some personal loan rates and other costs of the top private and public sector banks in India.

FASTag came into force from Sunday across the national highways. The government has mandated FASTag for toll payments from December 15 onwards.
At a toll plaza, 75% lanes will be accepting FASTag whereas 25% 'hybrid lanes' will continue operating till the government enforces mandatory usage of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based FASTag for all.
However, at every toll plaza pan India one hybrid lane will remain operative for the vehicles from both directions.
At Delhi-Faridabad toll plaza on National Highway 48, Sunil Agarwal, a commuter, said: ""Non-stop passing of cars at the toll plazas is helping us in saving our time and fuel. People should accept it positively.""
However, before plastic money comes into full force without exemption, the commuters queueing up in the cash lanes expressed concerns.
""We are facing trouble. The government has extended the deadline for another month. However, toll plazas are not opening enough gates for cash payment. Earlier we used to get daily passes but now money will be deducted each time we cross the toll. It's a trouble,"" said Rakesh Kashyap, a businessman who is yet to buy FASTag.
Hybrid lanes, which are yet to go cashless after the latest extended relaxation of FASTag for a month, are experiencing long queues resulting in a massive traffic jam at the Delhi-Faridabad toll plaza.
In addition, the government is offering incentives of 2.5 per cent cashback in FASTags till March 2020. However, cars without FASTag will be charged double the amount.
Standing in queues where people are buying FASTags, Rishab, 25, while waiting for his turn, said: ""It will take time for the people to accept and adjust to the usage of plastic money at toll plazas. It is hugely beneficial if the system works properly.""

NEW DELHI :
After making National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system 24x7, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has now instructed banks to make all online payments done through NEFT and RTGS free of cost for savings account holders. Several banks have already made it free while others have been asked to do so from next month.
""In order to give further impetus to digital retail payments, it has now been decided that member banks shall not levy any charges from their savings bank account holders for funds transfers done through NEFT system which are initiated online (viz. internet banking and/or mobile apps of the banks),"" the RBI said in a notification issued this week.
The new rules will come into effect from 1 January, 2020.
NEFT charges:
Earlier in July, the apex bank had removed all charges it imposes on banks for processing of NEFT and RTGS transactions. The RBI had also asked banks to pass on the benefits to its customers as well after which some banks like SBI and ICICI Bank had made online NEFT transfers free.
India's largest bank the State Bank of India (SBI) has not levying any transaction charges through IMPC, RTGS and NEFT for YONO, internet banking and mobile banking customers. Similarly, HDFC Bank imposes no charges on NEFT transactions.
According to an earlier RBI order, banks were not allowed to charge more than  ₹2.50 for funds transfer upto  ₹10,000,  ₹5 for transfers between  ₹10,001 to  ₹1 lakh and  ₹15 for transfers between  ₹1 lakh and above and  ₹25 for for transfers beyond  ₹2 lakh.

6,2019-12-19,HDFC Bank,"The market regulator held that Karvy had misused client securities by pledging them with various lenders without authorizationIn a stock exchange filing, Bajaj Finance said that it has invoked 24 lakh pledged shares of KDMSL representing 10% equity stake in the company

MUMBAI :
Non-bank lender Bajaj Finance Ltd on Thursday said that it has invoked shares of Karvy Data Management Services Ltd (KDMSL), which were pledged by Karvy Stock Broking Ltd to raise funds from the lender.
In a stock exchange filing, Bajaj Finance said that it has invoked 24 lakh pledged shares of KDMSL representing 10% equity stake in the company.
KDMSL, incorporated in 2008, is a Hyderabad-based step-down subsidiary of Karvy Stock Broking and provides business and knowledge process services. The company started off with back-office services and has over the years added various other services to its portfolio to cater to the banking, telecom, and e-commerce sectors.
“The shares of KDMSL were pledged with the company for securing the outstanding dues of Karvy Stock Broking Limited, the borrower company. The company has invoked the pledged shares of KDMSL for recovery of its dues,"" the stock exchange filing said.
Bajaj Finance is amongst the group of lenders with the largest exposure to Karvy Stock Broking, which raised money from the lenders by pledging shares belonging to its clients.
On 22 November, Sebi barred Karvy from acquiring new clients and from using power of attorney, thereby barring it from trading on behalf of clients, after the broker allegedly transferred clients’ money for other purposes and indulged in trade not authorized by them.
The market regulator held that Karvy had misused client securities by pledging them with various lenders without authorization.
These securities were used to raise funds from banks, some of the securities were sold off and the proceeds were transferred to its real estate arm – Karvy Realty Ltd.
Since then some of the lenders including Bajaj Finance have been engaged in a legal tussle over these pledged shares.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on 14 December declined to give any relief to the four lenders -Bajaj Finance Ltd, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, Mint reported. The lenders had lost control over pledged shares after they were transferred by National Securities Depository Ltd into clients’ accounts.
The four lenders including Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank had extended  ₹345 crore,  ₹642 crore,  ₹208 crore and  ₹159 crore to the broking firm against pledge shares worth  ₹2873 crore as of 16 September 2019. These pledged shares came down to  ₹2319 crore in November 2019."
5,2019-12-20,HDFC Bank,"The auto sector pain has indeed been the culprit behind the sharp slowdown in loan growthIt is clear that IndusInd Bank’s investors will allocate more brownie points for the stock once both growth and asset quality concerns reduce

IndusInd Bank Ltd has had a difficult first half in FY20. The bank’s shares have shed more than 15% since April, reflecting the deceleration in the bank’s balance-sheet growth.
The auto sector pain has indeed been the culprit behind the sharp slowdown in loan growth.
Will the lender bounce back to its heydays of high growth?
While the 30-35% growth rates seen in earlier years are unlikely soon, the bank is expected to arrest some of the slowdown. Analysts are confident that IndusInd Bank can salvage its loan growth considerably. This faith comes after the lender made a presentation detailing strategy for each vertical to analysts earlier this month.
IndusInd Bank is targeting 18-20% growth in vehicle finance, which forms more than a quarter of its loan book. But it also wants to grow its non-vehicle loan book at 24% over the next three years on a compound annual growth rate basis.
Here, the microfinance book will play a key role. The private sector lender’s merger with Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd took effect in July this year and it has had a mixed impact on IndusInd Bank’s balance sheet. Bad loans have gone up as a proportion of the loan book in contrast to the bank’s long-standing record of having low bad loan ratios. For the September quarter, gross bad loans made up 2.2% of its loan book.
But the microlender was swallowed with an intent to not just diversify but also grow the loan book. Analysts believe this segment would be a key growth fillip in the coming quarters.
Further, the bank wants to boost its fee income too by targeting selling to high net-worth individuals. All the above factors would contribute to an increase in the bank’s operating profit.
But analysts have not taken their eyes off asset quality. Here the picture is mixed. The corporate stress watch-list stands at about 1% of the lender’s loan book. This could reduce, said analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.
“The resolution of two IL&FS-SPV exposures of  ₹800 crore could meaningfully cut NPAs by Q4. Vodafone exposure remains a concern, though it assigns a lower default probability as of now,"" the brokerage firm said in a note. IL&FS-SPV stands for special purpose vehicles of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd.
But some such as HDFC Securities Ltd are still concerned over slippages. “We are a bit wary of IndusInd Bank’s exposures to stressed groups and companies. We model slippages of 2.3% and (loan loss provisioning) LLPs of 1.4% over FY20-22,"" the brokerage firm said in a note.
It is clear that IndusInd Bank’s investors will allocate more brownie points for the stock once both growth and asset quality concerns reduce. Until then, the multiple of about twice its estimated book value for FY21 appears reasonable."

Mumbai: HRITIK acronym for index heavyweight stocks: HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, Infosys and Kotak Bank put up a strong show in 2019. Leading a Nifty rally, three among these advanced 38 to 50 per cent in the last one year. Market participants are now guessing who would be the next set of stocks leading the rally.
A section of traders is betting on SALMAN -- SBI, Axis Bank, Larsen and Toubro, Maruti Suzuki, Adani Ports and National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) -- to lead the next rally.
The Brokerages have maintained 'BUY' on SBI, betting on a recovery in India's growth momentum. Nomura had said SBI's Q2 asset quality beat its estimates. SBI gained over 12 per cent in the past one year, and closed on Friday at  ₹337.25 a share.
The asset quality of the bank improved with gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio coming in at 7.19 per cent, down 276 bps yearly and 34 bps sequentially.
Axis Bank, has also been traders and brokerages favourite. The index heavyweight along with RIL, ICICI Bank and HDFC were the preferred pick by the brokerage house CLSA. The bank had reported a consolidated Interest Income of  ₹12,183.88 crore, up 3.89 per cent from last quarter. Axis Bank has gained over 15 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹739 a piece.
The NTPC has also been on the rise after the foreign financial firm Morgan Stanley upgraded the company's shares to 'Overweight' from 'Equal-Weight' earlier. This came on the back of the government's decision to approve strategic disinvestment in the power major.
It had, however, fallen 23.53 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹114.55 a share on Friday.
JPMorgan had recently reiterated 'overweight' rating on Maruti Suzuki and also raised its target price. The largest car manufacturer in India has, however, declined 8.58 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹7,255 a share.
Larsen and Toubro had recently downgraded by Credit Suisse to 'neutral' from outperform and revised target price down to  ₹1460 from  ₹1750. The brokerage has downgraded the stock as macro continues to remain hostile in terms of gap in government finances from tax shortfall and continuing credit growth deceleration.
It has fallen 8.64 per cent in the past year and closed at  ₹1,310.75 a share.
Global brokerage houses are also bullish on Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone despite its quarterly results falling short of market expectations. Macquarie has also raised its target price on Adani. Adani Ports lost a little over one per cent in the last one year of trade and closed at  ₹371.65 a share on Friday."

India’s largest stocks are likely to be winners again in 2020, after propelling the benchmark equity index to its fourth straight annual gain. Analysts expect gains in the S&P BSE Sensex in the new year to be led by just a handful of big names, similar to 2019, as uncertainty around a slowing economy is likely to continue driving investors to the safety of quality stocks.
“Investor focus is unlikely to shift soon from the few high-quality names which continue to steadily grow faster than the economy,"" said Dipen Sheth, Mumbai-based head of institutional research at HDFC Securities Ltd. “The foreign flows, too, favor top players.""
Economic growth slowed to a more than six-year low of 4.5% in the July-September quarter. That hasn’t stopped the Sensex from climbing nearly 16% this year, to a succession of record highs to cap a fourth straight annual gain.
However, only three companies have accounted for 65% of all of the advance: Reliance Industries Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd. and HDFC Bank Ltd.
“We expect narrow market performance to continue, as economic uncertainty continues to push funds into the ‘safe’ stocks, resulting in higher market concentration,"" said Neelkanth Mishra, a Mumbai-based analyst at Credit Suisse.
Global Flows
A gush of cash from global funds has helped drive the record-breaking stock rally, as overseas investors bet the worst of the economic slowdown may have passed. Foreigners have pumped $14 billion into India’s stocks this year, the highest inflow since 2014.
“Global flows are likely to be supportive as well,"" Mishra said “A significant part of foreign portfolio investment holdings in India appears to be longer term in nature or benchmarked.""

Earnings growth for India Inc. is another factor seen support stocks in the new year. A possible economic recovery, lower corporate tax rate, clean up of bad assets at banks, above average monsoon and accommodative central bank stance support the outlook.
“Growth has likely bottomed out,"" Timothy Moe, chief Asia Pacific equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in Mumbai this month. “We see it as one of the top three Asian markets for earnings growth next year.""
Moe said he expects profit growth to expand to 16% in 2020 from 12% this year. That’s his best earnings forecast for a country in the region next year, after South Korea. Among sectors that may drive this recovery are financials, consumer-oriented companies and industrials.
While earnings are improving, valuations have jumped. The Sensex is trading at 19 times 12-month forward earnings estimates, above its 10-year average of under 16 times.
Smaller stocks have lagged the overall market rally, with the NSE Midcap 100 Index down over 5% and the Nifty Smallcap 100 Index down nearly 12% year to date. Optimism around further government reforms and an economic recovery could help build a case for a catch-up by the broader market.
Valuations for mid-caps are reasonable and small-caps have bottomed out, said Jaideep Hansraj, chief executive officer at Kotak Securities Ltd.
""The small caps can show material outperformance, if the economy revives,"" he said.
