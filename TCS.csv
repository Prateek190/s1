London: Britain’s Marks & Spencer has appointed Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) as its technology partner and is targeting annual efficiency savings of about £30 million ($40.5 million) in the area by 2021-22. 
London: Britain’s Marks & Spencer has appointed Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) as its technology partner and is targeting annual efficiency savings of about £30 million ($40.5 million) in the area by 2021-22.
M&S said on Tuesday implementing a new technology programme, which involves TCS taking on core supplier services and management of specialist suppliers, would incur a one-off cost to implement of £25 million.
In November, the clothing and home retailer detailed a new five-year strategy, part of which involved eking out £340 million of additional annual cost savings.
M&S said the technology changes will involve about 250 existing M&S roles transferring to TCS roles.
The firm will retain a small in-house technology team.

354,2018-01-12,TCS,"TCS did not specify the exact value of the Transamerica contract, but it said it was worth more than the Nielsen deal struck last month

Bengaluru: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) has won its largest IT outsourcing deal with an over $2 billion, 10-year contract from a unit of Dutch insurer Aegon NV, assuring India’s largest information technology company the fastest revenue growth in three years in 2018-19. 
Bengaluru: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) has won its largest IT outsourcing deal with an over $2 billion, 10-year contract from a unit of Dutch insurer Aegon NV, assuring India’s largest information technology company the fastest revenue growth in three years in 2018-19.
The contract from Transamerica Life Insurance Co. is the second large outsourcing deal won by TCS in the past one month, and bigger than the $2.25 billion deal announced when it renewed a partnership with television ratings measurement company Nielsen Holdings Plc in December. TCS did not specify the exact value of the contract, but it said it was worth more than the Nielsen deal.
TCS’s ability to win such multibillion-dollar deals should help put an end to its protracted underperformance. TCS reported a 1.3% sequential increase in revenue in constant currency terms, which eliminate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, during the October-December period, marking the 13th straight quarter that TCS either underperformed or at best managed to match analysts’ estimates.
Significantly, these large deal wins will assuage any investor concerns over TCS’s decision to elevate chief financial officer Rajesh Gopinathan to the chief executive officer’s mantle in Feburary 2017, replacing N. Chandrasekaran, who was appointed chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, the group holding company.
Mumbai-based TCS won the Transamerica contract in competition with at least three other global outsourcing companies, including Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., according to a TCS executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Under the Transamerica-TCS contract, the deal value will be unevenly spread over the decade-long contract period.
This means that TCS, which is expected to end this fiscal year with over $19 billion in revenue, should improve its annual growth rate by at least 1 percentage point in the next fiscal year. This is because TCS stands to make over $200 million in business in the first year from this partnership. TCS needs to add $1.9 billion in new business to clock 10% revenue growth.
“TCS will simplify the service of more than 10 million policies into a single integrated modern platform, and drive greater sustainable growth opportunities through superior customer experiences,"" said a statement from Transamerica.
As part of this deal, 2,200 employees of Tansamerica will join TCS.
“The Transamerica deal is TCS’s biggest deal till date, bigger than the Nielsen deal. Remember, deals like this do not only happen because we have a platform,"" TCS chief operating officer N. Ganapathy Subramaniam told Mint on Friday. “The combined expertise of TCS, of almost every capability of the organization, has come together to help us. And we are extremely proud of what we have achieved.""
“We have invested heavily in our insurance digital platform, TCS BaNCS, and our extensive US capabilities, and are proud to partner with Transamerica in its ongoing transformation and welcome the transitioning employees to promising new careers at TCS,"" said CEO Gopinathan.
TCS will use BaNCS to complete many of the back-end processes of insurance claims.
“I’m very excited to embark on this partnership with TCS, whose transformation and technology innovation capabilities will supplement our focus on improving our customers’ experience in a digitally enabled way,"" said Mark Mullin, Transamerica’s president and chief executive officer. “TCS was carefully selected because of their significant ongoing investments in technology and their expertise in the insurance and annuity industry.""
Subramaniam also clarified that the deal is not margin-dilutive. “It will not be a margin-draining deal over the life of the contract,"" he said."
357,2018-01-12,TCS,"TCS's Q3 revenue improved 1.2% to Rs30,904 crore from the preceding quarter, CEO Rajesh Gopinathan says firm has delivered a fairly strong result, especially in a seasonally weak quarter

Bengaluru: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), India’s largest software services company, on Thursday posted December quarter revenue growth that fell short of already downbeat Street expectations, as it battled headwinds in the US and soft demand from financial services clients. 
Bengaluru: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), India’s largest software services company, on Thursday posted December quarter revenue growth that fell short of already downbeat Street expectations, as it battled headwinds in the US and soft demand from financial services clients.
In constant currency terms, which eliminate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, TCS’s revenue in the seasonally weak fiscal third quarter rose 1.3% from the preceding three months.
This is the 13th straight quarter that TCS has either underperformed or, at best, managed to match analysts’ estimates in constant currency terms.
Mumbai-based TCS reported dollar revenue of $4.79 billion, a 1% rise from the preceding three months and up 9.1% from the year-ago period. In rupee terms, third-quarter revenue improved 1.2% to Rs30,904 crore from the preceding three months. TCS’s quarterly profit rose 1.1% sequentially to $1.01 billion (Rs6,531 crore), up 1.2% from $1 billion in the year-ago period.
A Bloomberg survey of analysts had estimated the company to report Rs6,532.7 crore ($1.03 billion) profit on net sales of Rs31,041.7 crore ($4.90 billion).
“TCS delivered a fairly strong Q3, especially in a seasonally weak quarter,"" said Rajesh Gopinathan, who took over as chief executive officer of TCS in February last year after N. Chandrasekaran was appointed chairman of Tata Sons Ltd. “Overall, from financial performance perspective, it has been a relatively strong quarter…don’t forget that the 9.1% year-over-year growth is completely organic.""
TCS’s operating margin improved 10 basis points sequentially to 25.2% from 25.1% in the July-September period but was 80 basis points narrower than 26% in the year-ago period.
One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Still, one encouraging metric in what analysts called a largely listless performance was the fact that the company did almost as much new business in the first nine months of the financial year as it did in all of last year.
TCS added $994 million in incremental revenue in April-December, higher than the $786 million in new business in the same period of the last fiscal year. In 2016-17, TCS added $1.03 billion in new revenue.
This means that TCS, which does not give any quarterly or yearly growth forecast, will certainly grow faster in 2017-18 than the previous year.
TCS’s performance in the third quarter was driven largely by a 2.6% constant currency rise in revenue from clients in continental Europe, which brings about 11.1% of total revenue.
Some of the company’s other smaller industry-serving units did well too: revenue from retail and consumer packaging and transportation saw a 6.4% sequential jump, while revenue from energy and utilities saw an 8.5% rise. Both these divisions accounted for 17% of TCS’s overall revenue.
But that was not enough consolation for analysts.
“TCS’s numbers continue to be uninspiring and listless,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a foreign brokerage, on condition of anonymity. “For a few years now, management has always blamed some two or three underperformers for the tepid growth but the company until now does not give a reason behind the softness. The company claims these are not structural challenges but then what explains soft growth over such a long time? Yes, the company will grow higher than last year, but then, compared to its larger rival, there is not much to be happy.""
Accenture Plc., which is twice the size of TCS in revenue, is expected to grow its dollar revenue by 10.4% in the current fiscal year, implying that for the first time, it will grow faster than TCS, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd in a financial year.
The challenges ahead for TCS include a weak performance in the US and soft demand from clients in the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) space.
Revenue from the US, which accounted for 52% of TCS’s third-quarter revenue, grew 1.5% in constant currency terms over the September quarter, and 2.8% over the year-ago period. BFSI, which accounted for 32.1% of TCS’s revenue, contracted 1.5% sequentially and grew just 0.2% from a year ago.
Some analysts fretted about the weakness plaguing its all-important BFSI arm.
“Rajesh (Gopinathan) continues to claim that the company’s banking segment in Europe did well. Now, there is a decline in the overall BFSI segment. This is worrying because this means there are multiple banks or clients in the US who, for reasons not known, are either holding back tech spend or deferring,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage who also declined to be named.
The company’s workforce increased by 1,667 to 390,880 employees at the end of December. TCS added 3,404 people in the September quarter after headcount fell by 1,414 in the June quarter.
TCS shares fell 0.67% to Rs2,788.40 on the BSE at the close of trading on a day the benchmark Sensex gained 0.2% to 34,503.49. The results were reported after markets closed."
356,2018-01-12,TCS,"TCS's key banking, financial services and insurance segment pulled down overall growth

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd’s (TCS’s) year-on-year revenue growth fell to just 6.2% in the December 2017 quarter, its lowest in more than three years. Growth has been sluggish for a while now, and the last quarter was little different, except that some growth in some segments picked up. 
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd’s (TCS’s) year-on-year revenue growth fell to just 6.2% in the December 2017 quarter, its lowest in more than three years. Growth has been sluggish for a while now, and the last quarter was little different, except that some growth in some segments picked up.
Most importantly, the key banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) segment pulled down overall growth. Revenues accruing from these industries fell 1.5% sequentially and were flat year-on-year.
The glass-half-full view is that some other segments are doing extremely well, for overall growth to settle at over 6%. But investors should be worried. BFSI accounts for about a third of revenues, and there’s no sight of a recovery yet.
“Banking continues to be an area where we are in a wait-and-watch mode; it is still a couple of quarters away from seeing a meaningful recovery,"" Rajesh Gopinathan, chief executive of TCS, said at a press conference. Analysts are particularly worried about the lack of growth in the segment, with questions on the segment forming the majority of queries in a post-results call with the company’s management.
What’s disconcerting for them is that Accenture Plc has reported higher-than-company-average growth in the BFSI segment in recent quarters. While TCS said it has defended market share in the BFSI segment, the disparate growth of the two companies in this segment seems to suggest otherwise.
Meanwhile, there were pockets of strength, which helped overall growth. Revenues from the retail industry bounced back last quarter, for instance, and troubled segments such as Diligenta and the company’s Japanese acquisition are on a good trajectory, said TCS."

Earnings Corner
Infosys, Gail and Sintex Industries are among the companies that will be announcing their December quarter earnings today."
353,2018-01-13,TCS,"Infosys profit margins this year have more or less converged with that of TCS this year, compared to a difference of as much as 570 basis points about three years ago

Infosys Ltd reported 5.8% year-on-year growth in revenues in constant currency terms in the December quarter, slightly lower than the 6.2% growth reported by Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). Likewise, growth in operating profit at the companies wasn’t very different last quarter. In short, Infosys has done well in a period during which it functioned without an active chief executive officer (CEO). 
Infosys Ltd reported 5.8% year-on-year growth in revenues in constant currency terms in the December quarter, slightly lower than the 6.2% growth reported by Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). Likewise, growth in operating profit at the companies wasn’t very different last quarter. In short, Infosys has done well in a period during which it functioned without an active chief executive officer (CEO).
Of course, TCS has been growing at a sluggish pace (bit.ly/2CUp4AW) and hasn’t exactly set a high bar to beat. Still, the fact that Infosys delivered steady growth in a seasonally weak quarter, and in the midst of a leadership transition, is a heartening sign.
Besides, as the chart alongside points out, Infosys’s profit margins this year have more or less converged with that of TCS this year, compared to a difference of as much as 570 basis points about three years ago.
As a result of this catch-up, Infosys’s operating profit growth in the first three quarters is slightly ahead of its bigger rival. 
While Infosys shares have recovered all of their losses since Vishal Sikka’s exit (and then gained some more), they still trade at an 18% valuation discount to TCS shares based on the current year’s earnings estimates. Just before Sikka announced his resignation, the valuation discount was narrower at around 13%.
With Infosys delivering better profit growth, perhaps investors need to sit up and take notice. Interestingly, Infosys’s commentary on the key banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) vertical is far more optimistic than TCS’s. 
While the latter said it will be a couple of quarters before there is a meaningful recovery in the segment, Infosys said 2018 will be better compared to the previous year. A majority of its large deal wins are from the segment, and the company said on a call with analysts that regulatory spend and digital engagements are expected to drive growth in BFSI. 
“We expect discretionary spending to come back next fiscal; and things are not as hazy as a year ago,"" Infosys said in post-results comments.
In the December quarter, the BFSI segment’s revenues were flat sequentially, better than the 1.5% decline reported by TCS. From the looks of it, the client mix of the two companies is behind the difference in commentary. 
True, TCS has other engines firing away but as its third quarter results announcement showed, BFSI with its 33% contribution to revenues can pull down overall growth to a large extent. 
What’s more, analysts expect recent tax reforms in the US to have a negligible impact on Infosys, compared to being a headwind for TCS. 
Having said all this, investors may still be a tad cautious with Infosys, considering that its new CEO hasn’t yet clearly articulated his strategies and priorities.
But, based on how things stand currently in terms of growth rates, and given the difference in commentary, some of them may well start wondering about their higher allocations towards TCS in the past few months.
The writers do not hold positions in the companies mentioned above."
352,2018-01-15,TCS,"It is not the TCS' guidance but recent deal wins, stable senior management team, and execution ability makes the senior management believe of return to double-digit growth

Bengaluru: There is reason why Rajesh Gopinathan, a man who rarely lets down his guard, now comes across as sprightly and sports a smile. 
Bengaluru: There is reason why Rajesh Gopinathan, a man who rarely lets down his guard, now comes across as sprightly and sports a smile.
With help from Tata Sons chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran and the senior management team at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), CEO Gopinathan is now poised to lead his firm to a double-digit growth in 2018-19, which will be the fastest since the company reported a 15% growth in 2014-15. 
TCS’s recent deal wins, including two of the largest multi-year billion dollar contracts, in addition to more contracts it expects to close in the coming months, a stable senior management team, and its industry-leading execution ability to complete a project without glitches are the primary reasons behind this optimism, according to a senior executive of the company.
“I believe we should have double digit growth in FY19,"" TCS’s chief operating officer, N. Ganapathy Subramaniam told Mint, in an interview last week, adding that this should not be interpreted as the company’s guidance as TCS does not give any quarterly or yearly growth outlook.
“This is not our guidance but as a management team, we have had this major focus to get back to double digit growth. This is one of the strategic KPIs (key performance indicator) for all of us (senior management team),"" said Subramaniam, who took over as COO in February, when Gopinathan took over as CEO.
This reversal of fortunes at TCS is remarkable as for 13 quarters it has either underperformed or, at best, managed to match analysts’ estimates.
 TCS has struggled to generate more business from large banks in US, which account for over half of its overall revenue. Understandably, TCS’s return to form does not imply that the company—and its peers—are out of the woods. 
Structural challenges remain with the rise of cloud computing, along with a push towards automation and artificial intelligence platforms, meaning that IT vendors earn less for the same scope of work done in the past. 
Finally, all homegrown companies earn less than a fourth of revenue from digital, the fuzzy term to define all new technologies like data analytics which most Fortune 1000 clients want their IT vendors to offer to help them run their business better. 
Accenture Plc, which is twice the size of TCS, generates more than half of its business from digital technologies, and a faster growth from this business is one reason behind the company’s projected 10.4% dollar revenue growth in the current fiscal. 
For this reason, many analysts are sceptical on Indian IT firms’s growth trajectory and unsure if it is more than a dead cat bounce. Still, TCS remains confident.
“We have been investing in digital technologies. If you look the kind of large deals we are winning and the other deals we are working on, here the credit goes to the stable senior management team we have. Again, we have resolved each of the three soft spots we had in Diligenta, Japan and Latin America. So overall, we are reasonably confident (of achieving double digit growth),"" said Subramaniam.
“But here, I’ll share why we are not coming out and saying this. The thing which bothers us a bit is if there can be any impact of Brexit, a new government getting formed in Germany and what it could mean for Europe, parts like tax reforms and H1 related issues in the US… So these are uncertainties on which I cannot really put my thumb on, and say this is how they will play out""
Still, TCS’ optimism appears justified, according to deals publicly announced and according to three company executives.
A 1% sequential growth in the current January-March quarter will help TCS end the current year with $18.95 billion in revenue, a 7.8% dollar growth in 2017-18.
This means TCS will need to improve upon its current year’s growth by 220 basis points to achieve at least a 10% dollar revenue growth in 2018-19. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
TCS stands to make over $200 million as part of its over $2-billion contract with a unit of Dutch insurer Aegon NV, assuring the company of more than 110 basis points in incremental growth. Another $60 million in business from a unit of Lloyds Banking Group, $17 million from Rolls Royce Group, and business from Marks and Spencer contract and renewed contract with Nielsen, together bring $100 million in new business or over 60 basis points incremental growth in next fiscal. 
Still, two challenges ahead for TCS to achieve its plan of double digit growth will be the impact of cross currency movement and TCS’s ability to retain contracts which will be up for rebid, including the largest contract with Citibank. 
“Based on our execution experience, I do not believe our ability to pull revenue out of these (new and existing) deals is in question,"" said Subramaniam."

350,2018-01-16,TCS,"The old days of consistent, back-to-back mega deals aren't coming back in a hurry, but when we do see them, other factors that are leading the discussion

We’re seeing two trends here with this resurgence in the mega deals. Firstly, some clients developing more trust with their long-term partners to give them a larger piece of the pie, and finally, the cost/benefit of using a sole supplier across a broader set of processes to take advantage of the economies of scale and the provider’s willingness to invest in digitization.  
We’re seeing two trends here with this resurgence in the mega deals. Firstly, some clients developing more trust with their long-term partners to give them a larger piece of the pie, and finally, the cost/benefit of using a sole supplier across a broader set of processes to take advantage of the economies of scale and the provider’s willingness to invest in digitization. 
Here are more thoughts on these two recent mega deals:
The Nielsen renewal is a lesson in “give a little, get a little"":
Nielsen had been a Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) client since 2007, but the terms of the television ratings measurement company’s renewed contract have changed significantly. The outsourcing contract, according to Nielsen, has been extended by five years, beginning 2020 up to 2025. However, Nielsen has committed to spend $320 million every year, beginning 2017 until 2020, $186 million per year from 2021 until 2024 and $139.5 million in the year 2025.
It’s a relief for new TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan to retain the business, but the diminishing future returns from the deal are a sign of things to come for the whole information technology (IT)/business process management (BPM) services industry. Simply put, clients like Nielsen are expecting to have the same services for less money in the future because of promised efficiencies from providers like TCS in the digitization and automation of services, leading to lower numbers of staff to manage the work. The real net result is that all the leading providers are refocusing their futures on maintaining profit margins, as revenue growth is flattening, and already in negative territory in some areas.
Transamerica is really as much about TCS building out its US insurance business as it is about the $2 billion+ carrot.
According to the new agreement with Transamerica Life Insurance Co., TCS will add a whopping 10 million policies to the 17 million policies already being administered under the TCS Bancs platform. These include Transamerica’s life insurance, annuity, supplemental health insurance, and workplace voluntary benefits products. TCS will be rebadging approximately 2,200 employees who work in offices across several US cities, prominently in Iowa, where Transamerica is headquartered. The deal is expected to lead to annual run-rate savings of ~$70 million initially for Transamerica, growing to $100 million over time. Gopinathan has stated that the deal has “a big transformative component at the beginning and then it has a long operations segment"", adding that TCS’s digital capabilities will be leveraged.
When studying this deal, TCS’s current competitive positioning in insurance operations becomes critical. The service provider has grown its presence in the US by primarily working with property and casualty carriers on pure-play business process work. So far, the specialized third party administration (TPA) market for life and annuity had remained elusive. TCS’s experience and platform capabilities were suited to the UK, where it operates through its Diligenta brand to service clients such as Friends Life. In the latest HfS Insurance-as-a-Service Blueprint, we called out TCS as a leading provider, but highlighted the gap in their US delivery network, noting “Clients would like to see TCS expand its delivery presence. The service provider has a large footprint in India and the UK, and needs to develop its nearshore and onshore presence in North America in the next two years as it grows this client market.""
TCS has spent a considerable amount of time in customizing its platform and investing in product knowledge for the US L&A market, and it has just found its way in—with Transamerica. With a US operations base for L&A, employees with broad product knowledge, an adapted platform, and a marquee client, TCS is now presumably set up for market success. That is, if it can pull this one off with sustainable margins. The deal promises increasing savings year-o-y to Transamerica, meaning TCS will have to ramp up automation and digital capabilities, just like the Nielsen contract.
Will mega-deals like Nielsen and Transamerica be the new norm—for TCS and for the rest of its “WITCH"" (Wipro, Infosys, TCS, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. and HCL Technologies Ltd) cohorts?
The Transamerica announcement must be viewed on its own merit, rather than part of a larger trend back towards large-scale deals. TCS needed a solid base in the US for the insurance TPA market, and this deal brings them significant presence and local insurance talent within life and annuities. Also notably, this is a platform based services transformation mega-deal, which TCS has been known to orchestrate, as it did with Friends Life in the UK in 2011. The challenge for TCS will be in bringing the smart use of tools including intelligent automation and analytics into its new US operations base, and find value for Transamerica in new ways that the market demands—not just rebadged employees and platform conversions. The service provider has been commended in our recent Blueprint for its progress in driving better member experiences for insurance carriers, and aggressively embedding automation across the services value chain to improve quality and performance over time. We expect TCS to bring the full force of this collective insurance experience to make the Transamerica engagement successful in coming years.
Similarly, the Nielsen deal, while huge, is typical of what is going on when it comes to profitability for the providers—it is driving firms like TCS to invest in their own automation and digital capabilities so they can deliver the same services with less staff in the future. Hence, there is short-medium term investment needed to stay in the game and reap similar profits in the longer term.
The old days of consistent, back to back mega-deals aren’t coming back in a hurry, but when we do see them, it is these other factors that are leading the discussion.
Bottom-line: The mega-deal is alive in today’s digital market, but comes with a much more complex set of promises and investments—ones that TCS is willing to make.

Bengaluru: At Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), it is raining deals. India’s largest information technology outsourcing company said on Tuesday that it had won a $690-million, 10-year contract from a unit of British insurer Prudential.
The latest order is the third large outsourcing contract won by TCS in less than a month. It won two more than $2 billion, multi-year outsourcing contracts from television ratings measurement firm Nielsen and Transamerica Life Insurance Co., a unit of Dutch insurer Aegon NV, in December and earlier this month, respectively.
TCS will use its insurance platform, BaNCS and Diligenta, the UK-based subsidiary of the company, to largely do away with human interventions in completing many of the back-end claims processes of M&G Prudential, the European savings and investments business of Prudential.
TCS won the outsourcing contract from Prudential over British IT outsourcing firm Capita Plc, which was earlier hired by the British insurance giant. 
TCS does not outline any quarterly or yearly growth outlook but 1% sequential growth in the March quarter will help it end the current year with $18.95 billion in revenue, a 7.8% dollar revenue increase in 2017-18. 
This means TCS will need to improve on its current year’s growth by 220 basis points to achieve at least 10% dollar revenue growth in 2018-19. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The latest deal brings $69 million in new business, or 37 basis points incremental growth, for TCS. 
The company stands to make over $200 million in new business or more than 110 basis points in incremental growth from the contract with Transamerica. 
Additional deal wins from a unit of Lloyds Banking Group, Rolls Royce Group, and Marks and Spencer is expected to bring more than $100 million in new business or over 60 basis points incremental growth in the next fiscal, according to Mint’s calculations, together bringing over 200 basis points in incremental growth. 
Understandably, TCS’s management is confident of a double-digit growth in the next fiscal.
“I believe we should have double digit growth in FY19,"" TCS’s chief operating officer N. Ganapathy Subramaniam had said in an interview last week, adding that this should not be interpreted as the company’s guidance as TCS does not give any quarterly or yearly growth outlook.
“This partnership with TCS is an essential element of our strategy to create a digitally enabled business. Our customers will receive a better service—day in, day out—as a result and our colleagues will be better equipped to provide that service more efficiently,"" John Foley, chief executive of M&G Prudential, said in a statement.
“TCS is delighted to be the digital transformation partner for M&G Prudential to enhance service for its UK savings and retirement customers and drive sustainable growth. We will propel this digital transformation through TCS’s continuous investments in digital and technology services,"" Rajesh Gopinathan, chief executive of TCS, said in the statement."
348,2018-01-17,TCS,"Four biggest IT stocks listed on NSE Infosys, TCS, Wipro, HCL Technologies rose between 4.1% and 5.9% on Tuesday, although part of that could be due to weakness in rupee

A rising tide may lift all boats, but to expect higher IT spending to benefit all Indian IT companies is clearly taking things too far. Morgan Stanley said in a 15 January note that “an improving global macro could spur tech spending, which could re-rate stocks"". The four biggest IT stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange rose between 4.1% and 5.9%, although part of that could be due to the weakness in the rupee, after the trade deficit for December came in at a three-year high.  
A rising tide may lift all boats, but to expect higher IT spending to benefit all Indian IT companies is clearly taking things too far. Morgan Stanley said in a 15 January note that “an improving global macro could spur tech spending, which could re-rate stocks"". The four biggest IT stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange rose between 4.1% and 5.9%, although part of that could be due to the weakness in the rupee, after the trade deficit for December came in at a three-year high. 
Ironically, the biggest gainer was the Wipro Ltd stock, on which Morgan Stanley still has an underweight rating with a target price of Rs290. Wipro shares rose to Rs334 apiece on Tuesday. Investors are taking the rising tide argument far too literally.
For that matter, even Morgan Stanley’s thesis is predicated upon the assumption that a turnaround in global IT spending will result in better times for the Indian IT sector. 
This isn’t necessarily the case. In recent years, multinational firms such as Accenture Plc and some small companies such as EPAM Systems Inc. and Globant SA have done far better than Indian IT firms, with spending patterns shifting towards new technologies at the expense of traditional services. 
Data collated by ISG, the world’s largest third-party outsourcing deal adviser, shows that Indian IT companies have lagged by a huge margin in the Americas region, despite high growth in overall deal flow. Growth in total deal flow tracked by ISG rose as much as 37% in Americas in the second half of 2017. 
“While the deal flow momentum in Americas was positive, the perplexing factor remains that for the top-4 Indian IT companies, growth in Americas has decelerated to 5% y-o-y in 2QFY18 (versus its near-term peak of 14% y-o-y)"", analysts at Nomura Research wrote in a note to clients. Results of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd for the December quarter show that the weakness in growth continues—the former reported growth of less than 3% year-on-year in the Americas region. In short, the tide was rising in America, but it didn’t really lift Indian IT companies with it. 
A 2018 outlook report by ISG suggests this trend might continue in 2018. “Traditional sourcing will continue to face pricing pressure (as clients look to do more with less)... Traditional sourcing momentum remains slow... deal flow grew 3% y-y in 2017 (and is estimated to grow 4% in 2018),"" Nomura’s analysts said in the note citing the ISG report. What ISG classifies as traditional sourcing is the bread and butter segment for Indian IT companies. 
The other category of deals ISG tracks is classified as “as-a-service sourcing"", which includes Software as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service. This can be used as a rough proxy for digital spending, a segment where Indian IT companies have been lagging. Even here, ISG has indicated that deal flow is expected to fall to 20% in 2018, compared to 36% in the previous year."

Mumbai: The largest software exporter Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has expanded its business relationship with the American audio equipment maker Shure, which entails setting-up of a global development centre.
This is the third deal announcement by the Tata group company since reporting its December quarter numbers last week, where profits slid marginally. The deals announced in the recent past include over $2 billion each wins from American insurer Trasnmerica and market research firm Nieslen, a $690 million contract from a Prudential unit, and one more from retailer Marks & Spencer for an undisclosed sum. For the newer contract with American firm Shure, with whom it has had a five-year association, it did not specify the total consideration. 
The company has established a GDC to help build cross-platform and mobile enabled software for Shure’s audio technology and solutions, it said in a statement on Wednesday. Shure will be able to create secure, scalable, and differentiated audio products and solutions using TCS’ innovation labs and expertise in internet of things and cyber security technologies, it said. 
The GDC and innovation labs will bring together talent, tools and frameworks, and enable Shure to adapt their current offerings and launch new products, TCS’ global head for technology business unit V. Rajanna said. 
“Our expanded collaboration with TCS will allow us to complement our core team and create innovative new product offerings more efficiently by leveraging TCS innovation labs,"" Shure chief technology officer Avi Vaidya said."

Mumbai: India’s most-valued lender HDFC Bank Ltd on Thursday crossed Rs5 trillion market capitalisation for the first time, making it only the third Indian company to achieve this milestone.
In intraday trade, the stock touched a fresh record high of Rs1,53.75 on the BSE, up 3.31% from its previous close. The scrip closed at Rs1,931.80, up 2.15% with a market cap of Rs5 trillion. The Sensex index closed higher by 0.51% to 35,260.29 points.
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) are the other two companies which crossed market capitalisation of Rs5 trillion. RIL remained the most-valued company with a market cap of Rs5.82 trillion, followed by TCS with a market cap of Rs5.57 trillion.
HDFC Bank’s steady 20% profit growth quarter-after-quarter as well as its immunity to the bad loans crises has helped the stock.
The bank also reports bad loan ratio below 1%, the lowest among Indian lenders. Thus, investors continued to buy the stocks despite high valuation of close to 4.8 times its expected book value for this fiscal.
The recent gains in the stock along with other banking shares was due to news report on government mulling 100% foreign direct investment in the banking sector.
Brokerage firm Jefferies India expects that the this is sentiment positive, but the magnitude of impact should be marginal as the gap between current foreign institutional investor (FII) shareholding and upper limit is wide for most banks barring HDFC Bank.
In the last 12 months, the stock has gained 42.34%, while the S&P Bankex, the broader gauge of banking stocks, advanced 36.62%.
The bank will report its December quarter earnings on 19 January. According to 16 Bloomberg analysts’ estimates, the bank may report a net profit of Rs4,652.90 crore.
“HDFC Bank’s earnings growth should get a boost from recovering loan demand as disruption from the 2017 implementation of India’s goods and services tax wanes,"" said a 16 January Bloomberg Intelligence report.
“Strong exposure to retail should promote loan growth. Margin may struggle to expand further, but should stay above 4%. Credit costs could rise from last year’s low base, but will still stay under control, as HDFC Bank has lower exposure to stressed borrowers than other corporate lenders. Investors may closely monitor digital banking initiatives,"" the report added.
Among the analysts covering the HDFC Bank stock, 50 have a “buy"" rating, three have a “hold"" rating, while two has a “sell"" rating, according to Bloomberg data."

The initiative, whose founding partners also include Accenture, CA Technologies, Cisco, Cognizant, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Pegasystems, PwC, Salesforce and SAP, aims to bring competitive training content together on one platform to serve the greater good.  
Davos: Indian IT companies TCS and Infosys have joined a global drive for tech reskilling of 1 million workers in the first ever such IT industry initiative. The initiative, whose founding partners also include Accenture, CA Technologies, Cisco, Cognizant, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Pegasystems, PwC, Salesforce and SAP, aims to bring competitive training content together on one platform to serve the greater good. 
The initiative will be targeting 1 million people for training and resource opportunities on the World Economic Forum SkillSET portal by January 2021. The IT Industry Skills Initiative was launched here by the World Economic Forum (WEF) to meet the global skills gap challenge and address job displacement arising from automation and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. 
The initiative was conceived by the Forum’s IT Governors community under the chairmanship of Chuck Robbins, the chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Cisco. 
“We need responsive solutions and coordination from all parts of society—governments, citizens and private industry alike—to re-envision an educational system based on lifelong learning that can fully prepare workers for the jobs of the future,"" said Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman, World Economic Forum. “This initiative is a clear example of industry leaders taking concerted, collective action to address a major social challenge at scale."" 
According to a World Economic Forum report on workforce reskilling, one in four adults reported a mismatch between the skills they have and the skills they need for their current job. Therefore, enabling and empowering workers to transform and update their skills is a key concern for businesses and societies across the globe. 
The coalition has created a free platform of online tools to streamline the process of reskilling adults. The initial iteration of the portal will be available in April 2018. The coalition, which continues to add members, will be working over the next few months to develop tools and processes intended to address many of the barriers that prevent adults from reskilling or successfully completing trainings. 
The initiative will initially target the US market, with plans to scale to other geographies and build industry and public-sector partnerships in 2018 and beyond. Under the chairmanship of Mike Gregoire, CEO, CA Technologies, the coalition will report on progress at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019. 
Cognizant CEO Francisco D’Souza said: “The workplace issue of the 21st century is a worldwide shortage of qualified technology talent driven by a massive skills gap, which we must address together on a global scale. “The pace of technological change has education systems struggling to keep up in delivering learning experiences that are relevant, immersive and readily available as workers seek to expand their skills."" 
He also said the future of talent development depends on new models, ways of thinking and initiatives like this one that engage individuals as lifelong learners and provide them with opportunities for continuous reinvention. 
Infosys CEO Salil Parikh said, “Our relevance, in an increasingly digital future, will depend on our ability to learn and evolve lifelong at the pace of technology. Democratising digital literacy is an essential first step to make technology a force for good that moves us all forward."" 
TCS chief Rajesh Gopinathan said with the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, enterprises are leveraging the combined effect of emerging technologies to transform their businesses. 
“Employees will also have to transform their skills and adopt newer ways of working to participate in today’s opportunities that are as enormous as in any of the previous generations. It is important for enterprises to make investments in reskilling and upskilling employees and prepare them for digital-age careers,"" he added."

Mumbai: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), India’s largest software services firm, on Wednesday became the second Indian company to cross Rs6 trillion in market capitalization after a 17% rally in its share prices so far this year. 
Mumbai: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), India’s largest software services firm, on Wednesday became the second Indian company to cross Rs6 trillion in market capitalization after a 17% rally in its share prices so far this year.
On Wednesday, TCS share price touched a record high of Rs3,254.80 on the BSE, and gained as much as 4.89% in intraday trading. It closed at Rs3,174.60, up 2.3% from its previous close. TCS’s market capitalization is now Rs6.07 trillion. Since the start of this year, the stock has added nearly Rs1 trillion to its market capitalization.
Oil and retail-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd is the country’s first company to cross the Rs6 trillion market cap mark.
TCS is way behind global technology firms in terms of market capitalization. It holds the 17th position among the most valuable international technology firms.
Apple Inc. is the biggest tech company by market capitalization at $900.41 billion, followed by Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd with $814.89 billion, $708.97 billion, $656.57 billion and $573.94 billion, respectively.
Among all listed companies the world over, Reliance Industries is at 118th place while TCS ranks 119th in terms of market capitalization.
The recent surge in TCS shares was triggered by three large new orders won by the company since it announced its December quarter earnings.
The company said this month that it had won a $690-million, 10-year contract from a unit of British insurer Prudential Plc. It won two more than $2 billion, multi-year outsourcing contracts from television ratings measurement firm Nielsen and Transamerica Life Insurance Co., a unit of Dutch insurer Aegon NV, in December and earlier this month, respectively.
“The announcement of three big business deals is positively impacting investor sentiment,"" said Satish Kumar, research analyst at the fundamental research desk of Choice Broking.
“In addition to that, IT is only among the few sectors which offers value in this bull run with stretched valuations of many sectors. Further, IT companies are also likely to remain beneficiaries of the big tax cut in the US. All these factors have increased interest of investors towards the IT sector and a leader like TCS will attract customers,"" Kumar added.
IT stocks have been gaining since the start of the year after brokerage firm Morgan Stanley Research predicted that Indian IT services stocks may be set for a turnaround in 2018.
So far this year, TCS has advanced 17.56%, Infosys Ltd has risen 14%, Wipro Ltd 0.11%, HCL Technologies Ltd 14.4%, Tech Mahindra Ltd 19.35%, Mindtree Ltd 23.68%, Mastek Ltd 30.15% and Cyient Ltd 11%.
“Large cap stocks have underperformed the Sensex for the last three years. Valuations are at or below long-term averages and an improving global macro could spur tech spending, which could re-rate stocks, in our view,"" said a Morgan Stanley report dated 15 January.
The brokerage house has upgraded Infosys, Tech Mahindra Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd to “overweight"" as valuations are at or below long-term averages. The firm expects that an improvement in banking, financial services and insurance and retail verticals will help TCS and hence it upgraded it to “equal-weight"".
Of the 50 brokers tracking the TCS stock on Bloomberg, as many as 12 have a “buy"" rating, 28 have a “hold"" rating and 10 asked investors to sell the stock.
On 11 January, TCS reported dollar revenue of $4.79 billion in the quarter ended December, a 1% rise from the preceding three months and up 9.1% from the year-ago period. Profit rose 1.1% sequentially to $1.01 billion (Rs6,531 crore), up 1.2% from $1 billion in the year-ago period."
341,2018-01-25,TCS,"Only a fifth of all analysts tracking TCS have a buy rating, and even they had an average target price of around Rs3,020. TCS shares now trade at Rs3,176 apiece

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd’s (TCS’s) shares are in a tearing hurry. So far this year, the company’s market capitalization has risen 18% to Rs6.1 trillion ($95.6 billion). It is fast closing in on Accenture Plc, which has a valuation of $103 billion. 
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd’s (TCS’s) shares are in a tearing hurry. So far this year, the company’s market capitalization has risen 18% to Rs6.1 trillion ($95.6 billion). It is fast closing in on Accenture Plc, which has a valuation of $103 billion.
In the process, TCS has raced past the target price set by analysts who are most bullish on the company’s prospects. Only a fifth of all analysts tracking the stock have a buy rating, and even they had an average target price of around Rs3,020. TCS shares now trade at Rs3,176 apiece.
In other words, TCS’s valuation is now far ahead of what its most ardent supporters think it should be. True, one broking firm, UBS, has set a target price of Rs3,650 for the stock, although it is an outlier. TCS shares are ahead of all other target prices set by broking analysts.
According to an analyst at a multinational brokerage, TCS shares are reaching levels where the number of sell ratings on the stock is bound to increase. Currently, about a fifth of all ratings are sell or reduce, while the majority (around 55%) of broking firms have a hold or neutral rating on the stock. This is predominantly because of the company’s high valuation; and not so much a reflection of growth prospects vis-a-vis peers. 
In a note to clients, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities have explained what the company’s current valuations mean in terms of growth expectations: “TCS is trading at a peak cycle multiple of 21 times one-year forward earnings, implying 12-13% revenue growth for seven years at stable profitability... While TCS can deliver low-teen growth for a year or two, extrapolating it for seven years would be a bit of stretch.""
Note also that growth in the current fiscal is estimated at less than 7%. As such, growth of 12% over FY18 revenues translates into incremental revenues of $2.3 billion for TCS. Kotak analysts provide a reality check, “It is interesting to note that Accenture has added absolute organic revenues in the range of $1.6-2.5 billion/year at the peak of its sweet spot (during FY2016-18E, which was marked with revival in consulting + shift of spends towards digital)."" Accenture operates at a far larger revenue base, and expecting TCS to catch up in terms of incremental revenues will require a reversal of sorts in market share trends.
Besides, as pointed out in this column, growth acceleration in some segments such as the Americas in the second half of last year hasn’t yet translated into higher growth for Indian IT. So expectations of far higher growth in fiscal 2018-19 are riding on hope. 
According to an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage, while things are looking up compared to the previous year, it’s difficult to call out the extent of improvement, since Indian IT companies are also simultaneously losing business/revenues for a number of reasons. For instance, there is pricing pressure in traditional services, besides which IT spend continues to shift from traditional to digital services. Then, there’s the aspect of consolidation of vendors, because of which it’s difficult to predict the winners and losers at the end of the day.
TCS’s bloated valuations suggest all these concerns are being blown to the wayside, which is something investors should be worried about."

At the close of trade on Monday, TCS’ market capitalization (m-cap) stood at Rs6,11,634.03 crore (Rs6.11 trillion), which is Rs1,170.86 crore more than RIL’s Rs6,10,463.17 crore. 
Shares of TCS rose by 2.48% to end the day at Rs3,195.10 on the BSE, while RIL shares fell by 0.08% to Rs963.80. 
In the ranking of top-five firms on the m-cap chart, TCS took the number one position followed by RIL, HDFC Bank at Rs5.18 trillion, ITC with Rs3.36 trillion m-cap and HDFC at Rs3.12 trillion. 
On 24 January this year, TCS’ market valuation had surged past the Rs6 trillion, making it the second company to achieve the milestone after RIL but still trailing the Mukesh Ambani firm. 
It can be noted that since 2013, TCS was the most valued firm in terms of M-cap with over Rs4 trillion delegating RIL to the second slot. However, on 21 April, 2017, RIL overtook TCS to regain the most valued firm tag after a gap of almost four years with an m-cap of Rs4.60 trillion. Since then both the companies gained and crossed the Rs6-trillion tag in December last."
339,2018-01-30,TCS,"TCS chief operating officer N. Ganapathy Subramaniam says the IT industry changes every 3-5 years and constantly requires reskilling and upskilling

Davos: Confident that automation and artificial intelligence will help businesses upscale and grow bigger, a top TCS executive says the job loss fears in the IT industry are highly exaggerated and it is the organisation’s responsibility to reskill and upskill its workers.  
Davos: Confident that automation and artificial intelligence will help businesses upscale and grow bigger, a top TCS executive says the job loss fears in the IT industry are highly exaggerated and it is the organisation’s responsibility to reskill and upskill its workers. 
Chief operating officer N. Ganapathy Subramaniam, who has been with TCS for 35 years and is known as NGS among colleagues, said the ‘change’ is the only constant in the IT industry and internally his company uses it as an acronym—‘Change Has Another Name, Gaining Excellence’. 
Subramaniam, who was here to participate in the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting last week, said the IT industry changes every 3-5 years and constantly requires reskilling and upskilling. 
“We have been seeing these changes from the beginning, but what safeguards our employees from these changes is the contextual knowledge they possess,"" Subramaniam told PTI in an interview.
 “What we do is that while working with a particular client, a particular industry at a particular time, our people acquire a contextual knowledge that is beyond the domain knowledge. The technology knowledge is something which you can get through training and that is not a big deal. 
“All employees in the IT industry have been through various changes and keep updating their domain knowledge. But, contextual knowledge is beyond that and tells you that in a particular domain, how a client and its business operates. It tells you about the ecosystem, work flow, data and information flow, and that knowledge is very valuable to the clients,"" he said, while explaining what sets TCS apart from others. 
Asked whether the job loss fears are for real in the Indian IT industry with automation and artificial intelligence (AI) gaining ground, he said India is a very competitive country. 
“Right from getting admission in nursery school to going through competitive examinations and then getting a job in a company like TCS with another exam and another interview, we come out from a particularly competitive environment. 
“If our people cannot learn, I don’t know who else can learn then,"" he said while exuding confidence that Indians are always ready for any new challenge and keep upskilling themselves. 
“There are some irresponsible statements that have come out that 60-70% people would be left irrelevant and jobless and I do not believe that. We always say there are only legacy technologies and no legacy people,"" he said. 
“We at TCS believe in always reskilling and upskilling our people. Some competitors have gone ahead and done some acquisitions for getting new technologies and make money. We could have done that as we have the cash and make our own people irrelevant, but we did not do that and said we want to invest in our people to retrain them,"" he said. 
Subramaniam said the path adopted by TCS may be longer but he was happy doing it this way, as the contextual knowledge of its people, combined with the new technology knowledge they will acquire, will make them much more sustainable and powerful than a new set of people and technology coming in through an acquisition. 
“We have always invested in our people and we will keep doing that. The fundamental question is whether AI, machine learning, automation etc are going to make people redundant and create job losses? In our experience, we have done a lot of transformational projects in a year or so... and we have seen, this gives the businesses an opportunity to expand and upscale at a lower cost, and growth in business creates room for more people though in different roles,"" he said. 
The IT industry veteran said TCS has seen from the studies it did that automation results in people getting reoriented and improving their quality of work. Giving example of a retail company for which it worked, he said automation at front office level brought in efficiency and the people earlier in those roles were reoriented to be consultants. 
“The retailer decided to adopt a hybrid model where customers can order online and then comes to pick it up, where he is served by a consultant, who was earlier a front office person and now tells the customer whether he or she needs to order something more. 
“These sound like small things, but help win over the customer loyalty. This is another case of contextual knowledge helping transform the people,"" Subramaniam said. 
“We have not seen job losses. People get reoriented and the efficiency that is brought in, makes the volume of transactions increase significantly which automatically results in growth. 
“With growth comes additional responsibility and there are organisations where people get trained and when growth happens, franchises are created,"" he said. 
He said all organisations and the individuals in this industry have a responsibility to ensure survival of everyone with the new way of working and with new constraints. 
“How do we retrain our people is the organisation’s responsibility. We do not want a hiring-and-firing model. As long as you are able to do this with existing people it should be done,"" he said. 
Subramaniam said there are more examples where this has worked than those examples where things have not worked, but human nature is to see negatives more."
338,2018-02-21,TCS,"After a two-decade career at Intel, most recently as managing director for South Asia, Debjani Ghosh will lead NASSCOM that represents global leaders in software outsourcing from TCS to Infosys

Debjani Ghosh, NASSCOM, Indian IT industry, Intel Corp, women workers, Indian software industry,  
Debjani Ghosh, NASSCOM, Indian IT industry, Intel Corp, women workers, Indian software industry, 
Bangalore: In a sign of the times, the organization that speaks for and champions India’s $167 billion IT services industry will soon get its first female head.
Intel Corp. veteran Debjani Ghosh takes over as president of the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) in April — three decades after its formation. After a two-decade career at the US chipmaker, most recently as managing director for South Asia, Ghosh will lead the trade body that represents global leaders in software outsourcing from Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. to Infosys Ltd.
Ghosh promises to advocate for women in a workplace that remains male-dominated. Her appointment underscores how the local industry is waking up to a gender imbalance that plagues the global technology sector, starting with its epicenter of Silicon Valley, and has resulted in harassment and discrimination at all levels.
Ghosh, also an angel investor in a number of startups, argued that changes in the executive suite and mindsets are needed for a level playing field. India’s IT services sector employs about four million skilled workers and nearly a third of those are women. But that imbalance becomes starker the higher up the rungs one goes: none of India’s largest IT services companies have ever been headed by a female. Part of the problem is talent drain, she said in an interview.
“Things have to change. We have to check talented, capable women dropping out,"" said Ghosh, who featured prominently during Nasscom’s annual conference, which is wrapping up on Wednesday in Hyderabad. “Leakages are the challenge and I want to focus on how to fix that.""
According to a 2017 Nasscom study called “Women and IT – Scorecard,"" technology companies face the significant problem of retaining women after maternity leave. For men and women starting their careers at the same age, women progress slower and men in senior positions are often younger than women at a similar level, the study found after surveying 55 companies.
“The pipeline is clearly not the problem since engineering colleges have seen gender parity in enrollments for years,"" Ghosh said during the three-day conference.
Ghosh takes up her role at a critical time for a sector that contributes about 8% of the country’s gross domestic product. She’ll represent an industry transforming itself from low-paid legacy work such as maintaining computer systems, and getting into newer technologies from the cloud to artificial intelligence. She’ll help Nasscom’s 2,400-plus members grapple with controversial issues such as hiring, which is flattening due to the onset of automation, and the likelihood of more layoffs. India’s IT sector is also grappling with the challenge of immigration barriers in its largest market, the US.
But in some ways, her very appointment is already regarded as a victory.
“The industry needs more role models,"" said Sangeeta Gupta, a senior vice president at Nasscom. “Debjani is a signal that the tide is turning."" Bloomberg"

329,2018-03-21,TCS,"As per the rule, TCS on rent doesn't have to be deducted and deposited on a monthly basis; this has to be done only once, at the end of the financial year

As amended in the Finance Act 2017, a tenant (individual or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF)) paying house rent of more than Rs50,000 a month needs to deduct tax from the rent. Such collection of tax by a tenant is known as tax collected at source (TCS). However, as per the rule, TCS on rent doesn’t have to be deducted and deposited on a monthly basis; this has to be done only once, at the end of the financial year or at the end of tenancy, whichever is earlier. Given that the current financial year (FY) is coming to an end in a few days, all tenants must ensure that they have deducted the TCS amount from the current month’s rent, latest by 31 March. Once TCS is collected, it has to be deposited with the tax department. Read on to find out how to do this.  
As amended in the Finance Act 2017, a tenant (individual or Hindu Undivided Family (HUF)) paying house rent of more than Rs50,000 a month needs to deduct tax from the rent.

Given that the current financial year (FY) is coming to an end in a few days, all tenants must ensure that they have deducted the TCS amount from the current month’s rent, latest by 31 March. Once TCS is collected, it has to be deposited with the tax department. Read on to find out how to do this. 
A tenant is required to deduct tax if the monthly rent is more than Rs50,000. Where the house owner has provided her Permanent Account Number (PAN) to the tenant, the tax has to be collected at the rate of 5% of the monthly rent. 
If the house owner has not given her PAN, then tax has to be deducted at a higher rate, but it should not exceed the amount of rent payable for the last month of the preceding financial year or the last month of the tenancy.
Typically, the tax has to be collected as and when a payment is made. But to make things simpler for individual tenants, TCS has to be collected only once a year or at end of the tenancy.
Besides that, to bring down the compliance burden, the tenant (deductor) doesn’t have to get a Tax Deduction Account Number (TAN).
The collected tax needs to be deposited within 30 days from the end of the month in which the collection is made. It can be deposited electronically by filling the challan-cum-statement in Form No. 26QC. This form is available on the e-tax payment system website.
To fill the 26QC form, tenants have to enter their own and the house owner’s details. This would include information such as name, PAN, address, mobile phone number and email address.
Other details that have to be provided are: number of tenants and/or house owners, period of tenancy, total value of rent paid and value of rent paid last month, amount of tax collected and the date of collection, details of tax deducted, interest and fee along with date and mode of payment.
After paying the tax and submitting Form 26QC, the tenant will be able to download Form 16C—which is a certificate of tax deducted— from the e-tax Web portal, and give it to the house owner. This should be done within 15 days of submitting Form 26QC. 
Form 16C will carry details such as name and address of the deductor (the tenant), PAN, name and address of the deductee (the house owner) along with PAN, details of tax deducted and deposited, date of deposit, and more.
Remember that if a tenant does not charge TCS, or does not deposit the sum on time, it can lead to her paying interest and penalty."
328,2018-04-04,TCS,"Infosys, Wipro and TCS have dramatically reduced their H-1B visa filings and foreign nationals are exhibiting reluctance to make the jump to a US company

Bengaluru/Washington: India’s largest information technology (IT) outsourcing companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd, have reduced their dependence on H-1B visas over the last three years, a US daily reported, reflecting these companies’ preparations to tackle the protectionist approach followed by the current US administration of President Donald Trump. 
Bengaluru/Washington: India’s largest information technology (IT) outsourcing companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd, have reduced their dependence on H-1B visas over the last three years, a US daily reported, reflecting these companies’ preparations to tackle the protectionist approach followed by the current US administration of President Donald Trump.
According to data analysed from 2015 to 2017 by San Francisco Chronicle, Wipro saw a 52.4% drop in number of visa applications filed by the company over the three-year period while TCS reported a 18.3% decline and Infosys saw 38.1% reduction. Wipro applied for only 5,812 visa applications for engineers to work in the US in 2017, while TCS applied for 13,537 and Infosys filed for 20,587 applications, according to data gathered from US Department of Labour by the US daily.
This decline in number of visa applications mirrors the commentary from each of the IT firms. Wipro, for example, claims that over 55 percent of the 13,000 people employed by the company in the US are local American citizens.
“Indian consulting firms, which have been accused of flooding the system with applications, have dramatically reduced their filings. Foreign nationals are exhibiting new reluctance to make the jump to a US company,"" the paper said as the process for filing H-1B visa application for the 2019 fiscal beginning 1 October, started on 2 April.
Still, since the decline in number of applications made by Indian IT firms was most in the last year, the paper noted that the Trump administration’s hard-line anti-immigration stance is taking its toll.
The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.
Envoy Global, a technology-oriented immigration services provider, reports that 26% of employers it surveyed have had to delay projects, and 22% of them have relocated work overseas as a result of the current uncertainties in the US immigration system, San Francisco Chronicle said.
The daily argued that study after study has shown that foreign-born workers are good for the US economy and good for US-born workers.
“When companies are allowed to hire the workers with the best skills for the job—regardless of where those workers happen to have been born—their increased competitiveness boosts all the industries around them,"" it said.
According to The Wall Street Journal, evidence suggests market demand for H-1B visas is ebbing. Daniel Culbertson, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, says “searches related to the H-1B visa, as a share of all searches on Indeed.com, have consistently declined through 2017 and into 2018. In February 2018, searches for H-1B as a share of all searches on our site are down nine percent from the 2017...This also marks the thirteenth consecutive month of year-over-year declines. The decreased interest in H-1B related work from job seekers is a trend, not a temporary shift in preferences,"" he added.
The Wall Street Journal said corporations continue to struggle with a paradoxical labour market where 548,000 tech jobs remain open while unemployment in the technology sector hovers below full employment levels.
“There are lots of jobs, but not enough workers to fill them,"" it said."
327,2018-04-16,TCS,"Core IT servicesbusiness seen falling apart as outsourcing firms Infosys, Wipro and TCS struggle to earn more from new solutions

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd lowering its profitability outlook for the current financial year is a sign of worry for all companies, according to analysts and industry executives, who say that the core services business is falling apart even as companies struggle to earn more from offering newer solutions. 
Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd lowering its profitability outlook for the current financial year is a sign of worry for all companies, according to analysts and industry executives, who say that the core services business is falling apart even as companies struggle to earn more from offering newer solutions.
 Despite a favourable rupee-dollar movement and companies adding fewer employees, India’s three largest information technology (IT) firms, including Infosys Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Wipro Ltd, have seen their profitability decline in the past five years.
Worryingly for investors, many believe that both TCS and Wipro could lower their profitability outlook for the current financial year.
TCS declares its earnings on 19 April, while Wipro reports its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on 25 April. 
“…(W)e do not think FY19 is a one-time event and represents a new normal,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 11 April. “Our read through is that margins will likely be under pressure for the IT services sector broadly, and is also evidenced by ACN’s (Accenture) margin performance/guidance in the February quarter.""
On Friday, Infosys, while declaring lukewarm full-year results, lowered its profitability outlook to 22-24% for 2018-19, as against 24-26% two years back.
Last month, Accenture Plc, while declaring its second-quarter earnings, reported an operating margin of 13.4%, narrowing 30 basis points from the year-ago period.
Three reasons explain this continued pressure on profitability.
Firstly, all IT outsourcing firms have seen an increase in wage bill on account of hiring locals in overseas markets, including the US and Europe.
Secondly, companies increasing the pace of acquiring companies focused on newer technologies means their overall profitability will remain challenged. A case in point is Wipro, which saw its operating margin fall by over 200 basis points after the company spent over $1 billion in buying five companies between April 2016 and December 2017.
Finally, intense pricing pressure on commoditized deals, which still account for over three-fourths of total revenues at these companies, is another reason. Digital, the fuzzy umbrella term, which each company uses to call revenue generated from areas generally classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud computing and Internet of Things, still brings less than one-fourth of overall business.
“It is an absolutely cut-throat environment out there… Despite all companies offering digital technologies, the fact remains that 75-80% of business is still traditional work. All rebids are seeing up to 20% discounts being offered by IT vendors. So, even if you add digital on top of this, traditional or overall business is hardly growing and so profitability will remain under pressure,"" said an Wipro executive on the condition of anonymity.
Still, executives at IT firms say that it will be foolhardy to write off the sector.
“There are not many industries that can claim of having 22-23% profitability. So why should IT outsourcing be an exception? But for sure, a new normal is being scripted when most companies will see at least a 200-300 basis points decline in profitability in the next two-three years,"" said an executive at TCS. 
Infosys’s operating margin dropped to 24.7% at the end of March 2018 as against 26.3% at the end of March 2013. 
This despite a 18% favourable movement in currency (INR/USD was 54.54 for the year ended March 2013 as against 64.46 in the year ended March 2018.
“We believe INFY (Infosys) will have a very difficult time growing its operating margins over the next few years, given increased onsite mix from digital penetration as well as limited incremental utilization expansion. We are forecasting FY2018 margins of 23.2%,"" BMO analyst Bachman wrote in his note."

Mumbai: India’s largest information technology (IT) services firm, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), posted a stellar Q4 results that beat analyst estimates both on revenue and profitability. The double-digit growth for the quarter came on the back of thirteen straight quarters of underperformance, and the board of the Mumbai-based company immediately rewarded shareholders with a 1:1 bonus issue while also recommending a final dividend of Rs29 per share. 
Mumbai: India’s largest information technology (IT) services firm, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), posted a stellar Q4 results that beat analyst estimates both on revenue and profitability. The double-digit growth for the quarter came on the back of thirteen straight quarters of underperformance, and the board of the Mumbai-based company immediately rewarded shareholders with a 1:1 bonus issue while also recommending a final dividend of Rs29 per share.
Significantly, TCS added $1.51 billion in incremental revenue in 2017-18, about twice the $731 million in new business done by Infosys Ltd, the country’s second largest IT outsourcing firm. Although TCS’s profitability declined, the management, unlike that of its smaller rival Infosys, expressed confidence in retaining its aspirational profitability range of more than 25% for the current year.
The company’s dollar revenue increased 3.9% (2% in constant currency terms) to $4.97 billion in the quarter ended 31 March from the preceding three months, thanks to higher client spend from most of its geographies and key industry verticals.
Net profit improved 5.7% to $1.07 billion in the March quarter from $1.01 billion in the preceding three months while operating margin improved 20 basis points to 25.4% from 25.2% in the October-December period.
A Bloomberg survey of 26 analysts had forecast TCS to report revenue of $4.85 billion, or Rs31,659.7 crore, in the quarter. The analysts estimated the company to report a net profit of $1.05 billion, or Rs6,810.3,7 crore, in the period.
“I’m very happy with the strong set of Q4 earnings for what is a turnaround year for TCS as we are back to double-digit trajectory (11.7% year-over-year dollar revenue growth in January-March period),"" said TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan.
TCS does not give quarterly or annual forecasts but a few equity analysts expect the company to report a double-digit growth in the current year, primarily on account of winning large outsourcing contracts.
“Solid Q4 with a revenue beat and a slight miss on margins,"" analysts Anantha Narayan and Nitin Jain of Credit Suisse wrote in a note to investors after TCS Q4 results. “The management is sounding incrementally more hopeful on financial services: in Q4 FY18, BFSI remained muted with 0.4% QoQ growth (2.9% YoY) and so did North America with 0.2% QoQ (4.9% YoY).... Management thinks BFSI has likely bottomed out and hopes to see signs of recovery in Q1 FY19.""
TCS ended FY18 with $19.09 billion in revenue, a 8.6% year-on-year growth, and 24.8% operating margin, better than 6.2% in 2016-17 but its profitability was 90 basis points lower than last year when it was 25.7%.
In constant currency terms, TCS reported a 6.7% growth, as against the 5.8% growth that Infosys managed. Both figures were however lower than industry body Nasscom’s estimate of 7.8% growth last year.
TCS shares were up 0.99% at Rs3,190.65 on the BSE at the close of trading on a day when the benchmark Sensex gained 0.28% to end at 34,427.29. The TCS results were reported after market hours."

Mumbai: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) on Friday edged closer to becoming India’s first company to hit a market capitalization of $100 billion after the information technology (IT) services firm posted stellar Q4 results.
Shares of India’s largest IT services firm closed 6.76% higher at Rs3,406.40 on BSE, taking its market value to around $98.75 billion. TCS shares touched a record high of Rs3,421.25 per share during the day, rising as much as 7.2%, and adding around Rs41,300 crore to the company’s market capitalization. So far this year, the TCS stock has risen 26.4%, while the BSE IT index has gained 18.2%, which makes it the best performing index in India at current levels.
Following the rise in TCS shares, India’s top five technology companies added a combined nearly $10 billion or Rs64,390 crore to the their total market value. Infosys Ltd accumulated Rs10,000 crore, Wipro added Rs3,053 crore, HCL Technologies Ltd Rs6,600 crore and Tech Mahindra Rs3,500 crore.
TCS posted double-digit revenue growth in the March quarter after 13 quarters of under-performance. The firm also announced a 1:1 bonus issue and recommended a final dividend of Rs29 a share. Dollar revenue increased 3.9% (2% in constant currency terms) to $4.97 billion in the quarter. Net profit improved 5.7% to $1.07 billion in the March quarter from $1.01 billion in the preceding three months while operating margin improved to 25.4% from 25.2% in the October-December period.
Most analysts have raised their earnings estimates and target price for TCS, factoring in the March-quarter earnings. “Led by dollar revenue upgrade and modest rupee reset to lower levels, we upgrade our earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 1.4% and 2% for FY19 and FY20 to Rs149 and Rs161 per share respectively. Stock trades at 19.8 times FY20 EPS. TCS is currently trading at par with Accenture on the valuation front. Uptick in revenue trajectory leads to us re-rate multiples. We value TCS at 21 times FY20 EPS which yields a target price of Rs3,380 per share. This represents a 20% upgrade in our target price,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd in a note on 19 April.
According to Edelweiss Securities Ltd, TCS has a definite possibility of double-digit revenue growth with robust deal wins in the banking, financial services and insurance sector. “However, current valuations at 19.2 times FY20 EPS offers limited upside. But, we do not see downside to the stock despite high multiple due to sector tailwinds and high cash returns,"" it said in a note on 19 April.
HDFC Securities Ltd expects revenue and EPS to grow at an annualized 8.4% and 10.6%, respectively, based on dollar revenue growth of 8.5% for fiscal 2019.
Goldman Sachs has tweaked its FY19-21 EPS estimates at 1% and maintained its “neutral"" rating on TCS, saying its early lead in digital technology with wide scope and scale of domain expertise positions it well for 9% revenue CAGR over FY18-21, but valuations at 20.8 times FY19 versus EPS CAGR of 11% over FY18-21 largely captures this strong growth. 
“Our view on TCS sustained financial outperformance get further reinforced post the management commentary on improved deal signings, broad-based growth performance, and company’s emerging supremacy in Digital business"" said Emkay Global in a note to investors. The brokerage firm revised its earnings estimates by 1% and 3% for fiscal years 2019 and 2020 respectively and maintained its “accumulate"" rating on the stock with a target price of Rs3,330. 
According to Credit Suisse, TCS continues to execute solidly for a company of its size. “Its recent deal wins have also been strong, and it appears to be transitioning to digital services well. However, even with growth acceleration in FY19, we expect earnings CAGR of around 10-11%. Our estimates remain largely unchanged but we increase our target price to Rs2,950 from Rs2,550,"" it said in a note on 19 April. Credit Suisse expects revenue growth to accelerate from 6.7% in FY18 to 9.9% in FY19.

New Delhi: India’s largest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) is betting big on its ‘Business 4.0’ strategy to propel its revenues from new age-technologies like automation, cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) to over $5 billion this year. 
Speaking to PTI, TCS CEO and managing director Rajesh Gopinathan said Business 4.0 is thought leadership framework to help customers leverage digital technologies to address their growth and transformation agendas. 
“There are many components to digital technologies, there is cloud, automation, analytics, IoT. People have been looking at various technologies, each of which is powerful and valuable in its own right but the point has been how do you stitch it together to help businesses,"" he said. 
He added that Business 4.0 provides an integrated and holistic framework to help customers address issues and focus on growth in an agile manner. Gopinathan said the “digital opportunity"" globally runs in the billions as these new technologies are becoming increasingly entrenched across the table at an enterprise. 
“Last year, we had crossed USD 3 billion (in digital revenue)...It has grown 35 per cent, it has grown faster than it had grown last year. We have crossed USD 4 billion in digital revenues... Run rate-wise, it is close to USD 4.7 billion,"" Gopinathan said. He added that digital revenues would be well over $5 billion this year for the Tata Group company. 
For the quarter ended March 2018, TCS’ revenue from digital engagements accounted for 23.8% of its overall revenues, growing at 42.8% year-on-year. TCS posted a 4.4% growth in net profit at Rs6,904 crore, while its revenue was up 8.2% to Rs32,075 crore in the March 2018 quarter. 
For the full fiscal, its revenue rose 4.3% to Rs1.23 trillion. Asked if the company would look at acquisitions to strengthen its play in the digital space, Gopinathan said while TCS is “always open"" to such deals, it would not rely only on inorganic routes.
“Our story is not dependent on acquisitions to kick start or accelerate this, we are executing beautifully. If we find the right acquisition at the right time and right price, we will go ahead, we are always in the market,"" he said. 
Asserting that TCS is not a “desperate shopper"", he said the company is very selective in acquisitions. “...that is why, all our acquisitions have delivered value. We have never had to roll back any acquisition,"" he said. 
TCS chief operating officer N. Ganapathy Subramaniam said Business 4.0 has worked for the company and that the strategy has the potential to drive large-scale transformation across sectors like retail, travel and hospitality, utilities etc. He added that there has been a steady increase in the number and size of digital assignments clients are providing. 
In FY2018, over 2.45 lakh TCS employees were trained on digital, and more than 2 lakh employees have now been trained at various stages of ‘agile’ methodologies."
320,2018-04-23,TCS,"TCS's stand brings back to focus the current conundrum of balancing growth and profit faced by India's IT industry, especially after Infosys lowered its profitability outlook in FY19 to improve growth

Mumbai/Bengaluru: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) believes that its half-a-century experience has made the management realize that sacrificing profitability is not enough to drive growth and contrary to popular belief, following this model can be counterproductive, as both margins and growth are intertwined. 
Mumbai/Bengaluru: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) believes that its half-a-century experience has made the management realize that sacrificing profitability is not enough to drive growth and contrary to popular belief, following this model can be counterproductive, as both margins and growth are intertwined.
Rather, India’s largest information technology (IT) services firm believes superior growth and profitability can be managed by having a stable senior management team, and managing operating costs deftly, which should more than offset expenses to build intellectual property (IP) software and tools needed by an IT firm’s customers.
“From our mentors, from Kohli (Faqir Chand Kohli) to Ramadorai (Subramaniam Ramadorai) and to Chandra (Natarajan Chandrasekaran), we have learnt that if we compromise margin to funnel growth, neither will happen,"" chief operating officer, N. Ganapathy Subramaniam said in an interview last week.
TCS’s comment is significant because it brings back to focus the current conundrum of balancing growth and profitability faced by India’s $167 billion information technology outsourcing industry, especially after the country’s second largest IT firm, Infosys Ltd, lowered its profitability outlook in the current financial year, as it hopes to improve growth.
“If you say, we drop margins because we want to invest in growth, our experience is that growth does not happen. Our experience is that you don’t compromise on either (margins or growth). We have a remarkable senior management team, and our ability to reskill our people on the agile framework, makes us confident that our Business 4.0 approach will help us set for the right growth and profitability,"" said Subramaniam. 
Earlier this month, Infosys said it expects operating margin to be between 22% and 24% and expects to grow its dollar revenue between 7-9% in 2018-19.
Infosys reported a 7.2% growth and an operating margin of 24.3% to end last year with $10.94 billion in revenue. TCS reported an 8.6% dollar revenue growth at an operating margin of 24.8% to end with $19.1 billion in revenue.
Infosys said the reason behind lowering of profitability is to plough back the savings to invest in digital technologies, the fuzzy umbrella term which each company uses to classify revenue generated from areas generally classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud computing and Internet of Things. Further, Infosys also expects savings to cover expenses related to hiring more locals in the US and to pay more to hire the brightest engineers.
TCS, which saw its operating margin narrow 90 basis points over the last year to 24.8%, remains confident that it will be able to retain its aspirational target of managing 26-28% operating margin in the current financial year.
“Are visa costs and other staffing costs increasing? Of course they are increasing for us (like for other IT firms) but our ability to balance these costs, like how to manage the staff costs, and at the same time, how we can increase our price points for digital services, is going to determine our margins overall,"" said Subramaniam.
“Remember, every single transaction or deal or project we undertake has to be in the right value,"" said Subramaniam.
Some analysts, for now, are not certain on the approach followed by either of the two companies.
“This shows that Infosys until now has not kept pace with investing in digital, say compared to TCS and other large companies, and now realises it needs to invest. But no easy answers for now and it remains to be seen who eventually succeeds,"" said the head of research at domestic brokerage, on the condition of anonymity."

TCS has also overtaken outsourcing and consultancy giant Accenture Plc which has a market cap of $98.20 billion. Accenture ended fiscal 2018 with revenues of $34.90 billion, far higher than TCS’s annual revenue of $19.1 billion.
TCS holds the first position among the most valuable international pure play technology services firms. INTL Business Machines Corp. (IBM) has market cap of $133.48 billion, but it has both hardware and technology services operations.
With this, TCS joined the ranks of the world’s 100 most valued organizations and now ranks 97th. According to Bloomberg data, currently there are 96 companies which have market cap of over $100 billion. The last Indian name to cross that threshold—in 2007—was Reliance Industries Ltd, a Bloomberg report said.
Currently, RIL’s market cap is at $89.36 billion.

The brokerage firm has increased its target price to Rs2,950 from Rs2,550 earlier. It expects revenue growth to accelerate from 6.7% in fiscal 2018 to 9.9% in FY19."
323,2018-04-23,TCS,"That TCS stock is trading at about 20 times FY20 estimates, compared to 13-17 times of Infosys and Wipro, is justifiable due to its relatively better results in the past

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) ended fiscal year 2018 (FY18) on a positive note, recording a sequential constant currency growth of 2% in the March quarter, higher than Street estimates of 1-1.5%. 
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) ended fiscal year 2018 (FY18) on a positive note, recording a sequential constant currency growth of 2% in the March quarter, higher than Street estimates of 1-1.5%.
The $100 million client segment has seen one addition and the other client buckets also saw noticeable additions. Cash conversion is strong. The contribution of digital business in the overall revenues continues to rise and operating margins have improved.
Further, the management is confident of carrying forward this positive momentum into FY19. It expects the margins to remain stable.
The company is seeing renewed traction in the UK and Europe. Industry-wise the management is confident about the retail business vertical gaining momentum in the rest of the fiscal year. Six industry verticals grew faster than the company average on a year-on-year scale.
The only business segment that is lagging is the banking and financial services (BFS) vertical, which generates almost one-third of TCS’s revenues. Commentary on this segment remains cautious.
In a post results conference, the management said it is incrementally turning confident about the BFS vertical, though revenues are yet to reflect this. Growth in this segment remained flat or expanded just 0.4% on a sequential basis in constant currency terms. More clarity is expected in the June quarterly results.
Traction in this segment may well be crucial for the earnings upgrades, a necessity for the next leg of growth in the stock.
After trailing the benchmark indices in 2017, TCS along with the other information technology stocks began gaining traction this year. As Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities points out, the gains are driven more by expansion in valuation multiples and sector rotation than a growth recovery, which was modest until now.
The TCS stock is trading at about 20 times FY20 estimates compared to Infosys Ltd’s and Wipro Ltd’s 13-17 times. The valuation premium is partly justifiable due to TCS’s relatively better performance in the past."
311,2018-04-24,TCS,"The success of these two companies, TCS  and Flipkart, and hundreds more like them, is nothing short of a modern day miracle

Even 20 years ago, what we are witnessing today would have been in the realms of fantasy. An Indian software services company valued at over a $100 billion and an Indian start-up, a parvenu in the world of global e-commerce, at over a fifth of that number. 
Even 20 years ago, what we are witnessing today would have been in the realms of fantasy. An Indian software services company valued at over a $100 billion and an Indian start-up, a parvenu in the world of global e-commerce, at over a fifth of that number.
The first, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), is a pioneer with a 50-year-old history, pedigree and performance to boast of. 
The second, Flipkart, barely 10 years in the business, is an arriviste steeped in losses, but one that has held off the mighty Amazon, the destroyer of retailers across the world.
In the India of 1998, TCS was a promise that grew in the dark and Flipkart not yet a gleam in eyes of its founders. 
But the world around them was changing dramatically and inexorably. Technology, with the world-wide web at its centre, was enabling companies and people to crisscross geographies. It was opening new frontiers of opportunities, much as the industrial revolution did nearly 200 years ago. And just like it happened with the Industrial Revolution, it was the rich nations of the West that were expected to mop up all the spoils.
No one expected that in less than 20 years, there would be a set of Indian tech-enabled companies rubbing shoulders with the best of the West. 
In 1998, if someone had whispered that an Indian upstart and a backend provider of software services, not yet even a listed company, would in the next two decades be collectively valued at over $120 billion, a shrink would have been requisitioned immediately. 
With good reason. In 1998, India’s total gross domestic product (GDP) was $428 billion and the total market cap of BSE led by Sensex heavyweights like Reliance Industries Ltd, was just about $100 billion. From there to a single company in the knowledge industry being valued at over $100 billion is a coming of age story for Indian business.
A country which even today struggles with broadband speeds, where many early programmers learnt their initial lessons in coding on a blackboard, is today among the best exemplars of how technology can be a magnificent equalizer. At its stage of development in the 1990s, India’s leading lights should have been companies in metals or textiles or minerals. Technology was for the developed countries. Impoverished countries like India were the boondocks of the information technology revolution.
Yet, TCS went on to write the software that has powered some of the world’s mightiest corporations like Citigroup Inc. and General Electric. And Flipkart developed the algorithms that drove an Indian e-commerce boom. If Amazon and Walmart are falling over each other to mine that boom, it is to the likes of Flipkart that they owe a debt of gratitude.
We will still carp about how TCS isn’t a Microsoft and why it doesn’t have the same number of patents or why Flipkart couldn’t go on to become an Alibaba or a Tencent. It is after all, our right to expect more from our champions. But for all that, let us also celebrate the triumph of knowledge over physical assets, of mind over matter. The success of these two companies, and hundreds more like them, is nothing short of a modern day miracle. For evidence, check the list of the world’s top unicorns. Dominated by American and Chinese firms, it makes space for a few from India as well. And in the big boys list of most valuable companies in the world, there is TCS now. It is the very essence of the company of the future, having already proved how adroitly it can change directions to stay in step with the emerging challenges that clients present. 
That Flipkart following its impending sale to either Walmart or Amazon, will cease to exist, is a matter of some regret. But in its brief and tumultuous existence, it has already shown the way to a million other Indian start-ups. That’s something to celebrate.

312,2018-04-24,TCS,"TCS's valuations are far ahead of what the company's growth justifies. It's fair to say that TCS shares are riding on hope rather than substance

Analysts say there are plenty of reasons to love Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), except when it comes to the attribute that should matter most to investors—valuations. TCS’s market capitalization reached the $100 billion mark on Monday, rising high above analysts’ expectations of where its valuation should be. The most bullish analyst on the Street has a 12-month target of Rs3,900 for the company’s shares, or Rs3,400 in present value terms. The company’s shares changed hands at an average price of Rs3,480 apiece on Monday, which effectively means that all analysts would have been recommending that investors sell TCS shares.

The most bullish analyst on the Street has a 12-month target of Rs3,900 for the company’s shares, or Rs3,400 in present value terms. The company’s shares changed hands at an average price of Rs3,480 apiece on Monday, which effectively means that all analysts would have been recommending that investors sell TCS shares. 
If analysts are cautioning investors, what’s behind the massive rally? One major factor is the recent fancy domestic institutional investors have taken to the IT services sector. They have been underweight IT stocks for years and have started increasing allocations, especially with flows to domestic mutual funds remaining high. A number of other IT stocks have hit all-time highs in recent trading sessions, and valuations have reached unreasonable levels for many of them too.
In TCS’s case, an added factor is its bullish commentary while announcing its March quarter results, which has led some investors to believe that the company’s growth will rise to double-digit levels this fiscal. But growth has been sluggish in the company’s largest business segments, and all investors can hang on to for now is hope that growth will pick up because of some large deal wins, and the company’s commentary that things are looking up. This is all the more surprising because TCS’s performance has fallen short vis-à-vis its commentary in the past.
Note that revenues grew by 6.7% in constant currency terms in fiscal 2017-18. The ask rate for growth to jump to double-digit levels, and that too on a larger revenue base, is by no means modest. “TCS requires incremental revenue addition of $2.1 billion in FY19 and about 11% CAGR in incremental revenues over the next 7 years to justify the price. We like the business model of TCS but struggle to justify valuations,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients last week, echoing the view among most analysts. In FY18, the company added $1.5 billion in revenues.
The rally in TCS’s shares has brought it within kissing distance of Accenture Plc.’s market capitalization, which is interesting considering that the latter is double in size in revenue terms. 
Until a few years ago, it made sense to ascribe a materially higher revenue multiple to the Indian company, simply because it was growing at a much faster pace. But in the 12 months till February 2018, Accenture has grown revenues by around 8.8% in local currency terms, about 200 basis points higher than TCS’s growth rate in FY18. After adjusting for inorganic contribution to Accenture’s revenue, growth of the two companies are more or less in the same range. 
Investors are also glossing over risks such as constraints on visas and a general antipathy towards outsourcing firms under the Trump administration. 
Of course, there are things to like about TCS and based on the median of about 44 price targets compiled by Bloomberg, it deserves a valuation that’s at least four-fifths of the $100 billion mark. 
It has been investing to tap opportunities in the digital space, an area of growth. 
And while growth is unexciting, it is steady, and its operations still throw up large amounts of cash. Besides, it has increased payouts, and the leaner capital structure is resulting in better returns to shareholders.
But all told, valuations are far ahead of what the company’s growth justifies. It’s fair to say that TCS shares are riding on hope rather than substance."

TCS ended with 25.8% operating margin in the year ended March 2018. 
The TCS stock now trades at 22.94 times one-year forward price-earnings while Infosys trades at 17.16 times of one-year PE.

Shares of TCS have surged over 30% so far this year, gaining nearly 8% in the last two trading sessions alone after its earnings announcement. The BSE IT index is up 20% in 2018 so far.

Net profit improved 5.7% to $1.07 billion in the March quarter from $1.01 billion in the preceding three months while operating margin improved 20 basis points to 25.4% from 25.2% in the October-December period.
Nomura finds valuations of TCS to be expensive at 20 times projected fiscal 2020 earnings and sees risk to street expectations of double-digit constant currency revenue growth and flattish margin.

TCS large segment US and BFSI remained weak and Nomura expects that it is likely to grow at low-to mid-single digits year on year with clarity on BFSI still a quarter away amid risks from insourcing at a large US bank.
Kotak Institutional Equities said on 20 April, that the stock trades at 19 times fiscal year 2020 estimates earnings. “To put valuations in context, TCS requires incremental revenue addition of $2.1 billion per year in FY2019 estimates and about 11% CAGR in incremental revenues over the next 7 years to justify the price"", the report added.
On 13 April, Infosys reported a 1.8% sequential rise in dollar revenue to $2.8 billion, allowing it to end 2017-18 with $10.94 billion in revenue, a 7.2% year-on-year growth, and 24.3% operating margin. In constant currency terms, it managed a 5.8% growth, which was lower than industry body Nasscom’s estimate of 7.8% growth last year.
According to PhillipCapital, Infosys reported decent earnings. Its revenue growth and total contract value were encouraging even as it reported weak margin outlook. The firm is positive on Infosys, on the back of improving business metrics and the significant valuation gap versus TCS.
“Assuming Infosys achieves mid-point of its guidance, it will report CC organic growth similar to TCS. Despite that, the stock trades at 14x FY20 – a significant discount to TCS (19x).

Bengaluru: A higher client spend from companies in Europe, and higher growth from the company’s four industry segments, including from custom ers in the oil and gas industry, helped Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) report a double-digit year-over-year growth in the January-March period, after 13 straight quarters of underperformance.
Expectedly, the company’s chief executive officer Rajesh Gopinathan called it a “turnaround"" performance.
TCS does not give quarterly or annual forecasts but the management reaffirmed its optimism (first outlined in January) of the company clocking double-digit growth in the current financial year.
“It has been an extremely satisfying last 15 months and there is no doubt about it,"" TCS’s chief operating officer N. Ganapathy Subramaniam said in an interview last week. 
In February last year, TCS appointed Subramaniam as chief operating officer and Rajesh Gopinathan as chief executive officer. 
Gopinathan took over from N. Chandrasekaran, who was appointed chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, the Tata group holding company
So what explains this higher growth for TCS, which added $1.51 billion in incremental revenue to end with $19.1 billion in revenue in 2017-18, an 8.6% dollar revenue growth (6.7% in constant currency terms)?
To start with, higher client spending in Europe, which accounted for 27.7% or $5.29 billion of the company’s overall revenue, a growth of 18.4% year-on-year in the year ended 31 March 2018. 
This growth was primarily led by large deal wins, including a $690 million, 10-year contract from a unit of British insurer Prudential, Lloyds Banking Group, Rolls Royce Group and Marks and Spencer.
TCS discloses its performance in Europe under Continental Europe and the UK. 
Continental Europe, which accounted for 13.4% of total revenue, reported a 26.5% year-on-year jump, while the UK, which brought in the remaining 14.3% of business from Europe, reported an 11.73% increase.
TCS’s four industry verticals, including oil and gas, healthcare and life sciences, communication and media and travel and hospitality, reported double-digit growth, thereby helping the company end the year on a strong footing.
TCS’s $2.25 billion deal renewal from television ratings measurement company Nielsen, which now translates into more business every year for the company than in the past, also helped it better its growth. 
This is reflected in the 14.8% growth in the company’s communication and media industry vertical, which accounted for 7.4% or $1.412 billion of its overall revenue.
“What we have accomplished is that we have added this capability of adding a cylinder to a moving car. Now how we understand is that Digital is not technology. It is a series of technologies. This is why we have defined Business 4.0 under which we can come up with new offerings, without say destabilising a car. And credit to Rajesh (Gopinathan) and our team for remaining focused on delivering what our clients want,"" said Subramaniam.
TCS claims that Digital, the fuzzy umbrella term which each company uses to classify revenue generated from areas generally classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud computing and Internet of Things, grew 43% in constant currency terms to $4.5 billion or about 24% of company’s overall revenue."
310,2018-04-26,TCS,"TCS had became the first Indian IT company on Monday to cross the $100 billion mark in market capitalisation in intra-day trade but had closed the session at about $98.8 billion

New Delhi: IT bellwether Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Thursday became the first Indian company to close the trading session with over $100 billion market valuation.  
New Delhi: IT bellwether Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Thursday became the first Indian company to close the trading session with over $100 billion market valuation. 
It had became the first Indian IT company on Monday to cross the $100 billion mark in market capitalisation (m-cap) in intra-day trade, but had closed the session at about $98.8 billion in value. Before TCS, Reliance Industries Ltd had breached the mark in intra-day trade on 18 October 2007. But, it too had failed to sustain that level and had closed the session below that coveted number. 
The US dollar was quoted at Rs39.59 at that time. The market valuation of TCS on Thursday has been calculated on the basis of exchange rate of Rs66.77 against the dollar in the afternoon. At the close of trade TCS’ market cap was up by Rs13,869.81 crore to Rs6,77,724.81 crore ($101.5 billion) following surge in the stock price amid positive March quarter earnings. 
Shares of the company ended 2.09% higher at Rs3,540.35 on BSE. During the day, they gained 2.65% to Rs3,560. On NSE, the stock went up by 1.98% to close at Rs3,539.25. 
In terms of equity volume, 1.51 lakh shares of the company were traded on BSE and over 60 lakh shares changed hands at NSE during the day. The nation’s largest software exporter TCS on 19 April reported a 4.4% rise in March quarter net profit at Rs6,904 crore. 
TCS is the country’s most valued firm in terms of market valuation, followed by Reliance Industries Ltd (Rs6,17,894.97 crore), HDFC Bank (Rs5,00,930.27 crore), ITC (Rs3,39,645.53 crore) and Hindustan Unilever Ltd (Rs3,22,785.35 crore) in the top five order. 
TCS m-cap is Rs59,829.84 crore more than that of RIL’s valuation. Shares of TCS has gained over 31% so far this year. Its market valuation had in 24 January this year surged past the Rs6 trillion mark."
309,2018-05-06,TCS,"Since the start of the year until 12 April, TCS shares gained 16.2%, Infosys 11.8% and HCL 13.5%, while Wipro lost 8.5%

Mumbai/Bengaluru: A less-than bullish commentary by managements of Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, and fewer analyst recommendations for buying their shares, have made many wonder if the current financial year will be better for the industry than the last one.  
Mumbai/Bengaluru: A less-than bullish commentary by managements of Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, and fewer analyst recommendations for buying their shares, have made many wonder if the current financial year will be better for the industry than the last one. 
In January, executives at India’s largest information technology (IT) outsourcing companies had exuded optimism that 2018-19 was going to be a better year. Investors bought into the story as shares of the four largest IT companies outperformed the Sensex until 12 April.
Since the start of the year until 12 April, a day before Infosys declared earnings, TCS shares gained 16.2%, Infosys 11.8% and HCL 13.5%, while Wipro lost 8.5%. During this time, BSE Sensex hardly posted any return, gaining 0.13%. 
However, two months into the current financial year, it appears many of these companies are grappling with unique challenges and that all of them will struggle to improve the growth reported in the last two years.
India’s largest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services Ltd has bucked this trend so far. The Mumbai-based company has been an outlier—its management reaffirmed that it should clock double-digit growth in the current year, leading to more brokerages putting a buy recommendation on the shares after it declared earnings on 19 April.
But fewer analysts are now bullish on Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies (See adjoining table) after the companies declared earnings than at the start of the year.
“Save for TCS, the question to be asked to IT companies is, where is the recovery,"" said the former CEO of one the largest IT firms. “Certainly, the growth outlook is not much better than last year. Even the management commentary is not cheerful as it sounded in January. So, what has really changed in the last four months?""
Infosys reported a 7.2% dollar revenue growth at 24.3% operating margin in the year ended March 2018. For the current year, the company expects to grow its dollar revenue between 7% and 9%, but at a lower operating margins band of between 22% and 24%, prompting some analysts to change their bullish outlook. 
Ditto for Wipro and HCL. 
Two client-related bankruptcies and the company’s planned restructuring in the Middle East and India is taking longer than chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala had anticipated dashed any hopes that Wipro will turn the corner soon. 
Wipro does not give a full-year revenue guidance but expects quarterly revenue to be between a decline of 2% and growth of 0.2% in constant currency terms in the April-June period from the preceding quarter.
HCL Technologies, which reported a 12.4% growth last year, expects to grow its dollar revenue between 10.5% and 12.5% in the current fiscal. However, management expects more than half of this incremental growth to come from acquisitions and because of business brought from the company’s many intellectual property (IP) partnerships.
Worryingly for investors, all these companies are not struggling for revenue growth alone as a few analysts like Keith Bachman of BMO Capital Markets have expressed scepticism on the profitability outlook for them."

New Delhi: India’s largest IT services firm TCS said on Tuesday it has expanded operations in Arkansas, US with over 200 employees joining the company as part of the Transamerica deal. 
In January, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) had signed a deal worth over $2 billion with Transamerica to administer the latter’s life insurance, annuity, supplemental health insurance, and workplace voluntary benefits products, and manage the administration of more than 10 million policies. 
“TCS will occupy several floors of the 1,400 Centerview building in downtown Little Rock, as part of a multi-year agreement with Transamerica...More than 200 former Transamerica employees now work for TCS at this Little Rock facility,"" TCS said in a statement. 
This was a part of the efforts by the Mumbai-based company to recruit and protect more than 2,200 Transamerica jobs across the US in multiple locations. The Little Rock office is a new US business centre for TCS, adding to its existing office in Bentonville, Arkansas that hosts more than 150 employees. TCS said it has invested nearly $3 billion in the US over the past three years and has been among the top two IT services job creators in America."

Mumbai: Even when the market rose 6.65% in April, mutual funds’ top stock sales in the month in the large-cap space included software exporter Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), private lender ICICI Bank Ltd. and supermarket chain Avenue Supermarts Ltd. 
Mutual funds invested a net of Rs9,435.64 crore in Indian equities in April, data from Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) showed. 
This was in light of slowing down of gross inflows into equities schemes. However, redemption also came down from a month before, leaving the net inflows more or less in line with that in March.
TCS was the most sold stock as fund houses locked in gains after it rallied nearly 24% in the month of April, and joined the league of $100 billion market capitalization. Fund managers collectively, sold Rs1,750,27 crore worth of TCS stock in April, data from Value Research India Pvt. Ltd. showed.
On 19 April, TCS posted stellar March quarter results that beat analyst estimates both on revenue and profitability. The strong growth for the quarter came on the back of thirteen straight quarters of underperformance.
“Most fund managers are under pressure, and are wary of market valuation in general,"" said Dhirendra Kumar, chief executive of Value Research, a mutual fund analytics firm.
“If you look at valuation gap of Infosys vs TCS, they seemed to have jumped where more value was visible,"" added Kumar.
At the end of April, while Infosys traded at 16.75 times 1-year forward earnings, TCS traded at 22.79 times 1-year forward earnings, data from Bloomberg showed.
“IT is going through a complete re-rating. There is strong business revival. They are able to fight back on the revenues from digital business. They have more automation than before. The once-broken pieces are now falling in place,"" said Dipen Sheth, head of institutional research at HDFC Securities, adding that the depreciating rupee is the last booster for the otherwise recovering industry."" 
“Infosys is much cheaper than TCS and so the churn seems to have taken place in its favour, given the big changes in the company at the top level,"" added Sheth.
Infosys Ltd., the country’s second-largest software exporter was the most bought stock by mutual funds as they stocked up Rs1,404.94 crore worth of stocks. 
For ICICI Bank, the alleged corporate governance issues have deterred fund managers, who sold Rs843.08 crore worth of the bank’s shares. The allegation relates to a loan to Videocon Group, whose controlling shareholder co-founded a separate company with the husband of ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar. A significant portion of the loan has since become non-performing.
“The noise around the falling standards of governance, and issues with leadership, led to an erosion of faith on the part of investors,"" said Sheth of HDFC Securities.
Avenue Supermarts, the top performing debutante in recent times, also witnessed profit-booking by fund managers, after the stellar run. Fund managers trimmed some of the positions and sold Rs316.97 crore of the stock in the month.
“Avenue Supermarts, also had run up a lot and stretched valuations seem to have been a driver that prompted mutual funds cut some holdings,"" said Kumar of Value Research.
The parent of supermarket chain D-mart, has seen its stock jump 400% since its debut on 21 March 2017."

304,2018-05-31,TCS,"Rajesh Gopinathan, the chief executive officer of Tata Consultancy Services, argues that the tech industry's opportunities today are bigger than they've ever been

Bangalore:These are challenging times for India’s technology-services industry. Growth has slowed. Profits are pinched. Layoffs, once unheard of, are commonplace. Many of the businesses’s own leaders think its best days are in the past. 
Bangalore:These are challenging times for India’s technology-services industry. Growth has slowed. Profits are pinched. Layoffs, once unheard of, are commonplace. Many of the businesses’s own leaders think its best days are in the past.
Rajesh Gopinathan is not one of them. The chief executive officer of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd argues the industry’s opportunities today are bigger than they’ve ever been. The problem he contends is that his peers aren’t thinking creatively enough about how to evolve from the services of the past.
India’s tech industry was built by using the country’s low-cost labour to handle basic tasks like technology support and infrastructure maintenance. Now corporate clients need help with ever more challenging questions of technology and strategy—and companies can thrive if they divine the answers.
“The industry has been overdoing the negativity,"" says Gopinathan, 46, during an interview in his wood-panelled office in Mumbai. “We have the largest technology talent pool in the world—400,000 people—and if we can’t figure out how to grow from here, then there’s something wrong.""
He’s done okay so far. Since Gopinathan was named CEO last January, his stock is up 50%, adding about $32 billion to its market value. TCS is now worth about $100 billion, more than that of the next four rivals combined.
“Their strategy is working,"" says Deven Choksey, managing director of the Mumbai-based K.R. Choksey Investment Managers. “Investors are more confident about TCS than its peers.""
Gopinathan vows to get revenue growing even faster, despite warnings from rivals like Infosys Ltd about tough times. “Our target is to get back to double-digit growth,"" he says, which would be up from 8.6% in the last fiscal year.
He may negotiate more acquisitions to get there. Critics point out that rivals like Dublin-based Accenture Plc have spent billions of dollars on deals to boost growth. He cautions TCS will be selective about finding “the right asset at the right price point.""
He also has to contend with President Donald Trump, who has been tightening the rules for foreign workers, like those from TCS, who take high-skill roles in the US Gopinathan says new technologies will let his company handle client needs wherever its employees are. “Work will go where the talent is, rather than talent moving to where the work is,"" he says.
On a recent May afternoon, Gopinathan welcomes visitors to his office at TCS House, an impeccably-restored colonial building in Mumbai. The sprawling space is adorned with art, antiques and an historic map of the local neighborhood. He sits on a couch and then immediately springs up to put on his jacket, making sure he’ll look nothing less than professional for a photographer.
Gopinathan started his career at TCS in 2001, becoming chief financial officer in 2013. He took over the CEO suite last year when his predecessor was promoted to restore stability at conglomerate Tata Group after a bitter boardroom coup.
TCS pioneered the India tech services model five decades ago and, until recently, the industry barreled along at 20%-plus growth with little trouble. Now easy outsourcing deals are gone and customers are looking for price cuts. Gopinathan says the industry needs to adapt, like it has with the evolution from mainframes to smartphones.
“If the iPhone doesn’t come up with a new model every two years, they will fall off the peak,"" he said. “If they don’t have the luxury of permanence, why should any of us even expect that?""
Gopinathan offers an example. British retailer Marks & Spencer Group Plc initially came to TCS looking for cost cuts on technology in the wake of Brexit and market tumult. Instead of pushing back, TCS came up with a broader five-year strategy, including an enterprise-wide tech-led transformation to use digital and other technologies to boost the retailer’s customer experience and drive growth. “By not responding negatively, we turned it from a CIO’s project into a CEO initiative,"" he says. Business grew.
TCS benefits from helping corporate customers unsnarl internal operations that are inefficient or outdated. Among its recent contracts are mega-deals with Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc and Transamerica Corp. “For every dollar spent on customer-facing ops, it’s getting clients to put four dollars on the back-end,"" says Ashutosh Sharma, India head of Forrester Research. “That’s where TCS shines.""
Gopinathan spent much of his first six months meeting with clients to hear their concerns and see if TCS could help. He came away convinced new technologies are agitating most industries—like in retail where the buying experience is digitized or in autos where cars are sold based on how smart they are. All these shifts can amplify demand for TCS services. But the company has to invest in new technologies, like artificial intelligence and cloud computing, and retrain hundreds of thousands of employees. “It is aligning yourself for the future,"" says Gopinathan.
He’s overhauled his management team. He tapped the head of the infrastructure services practice, a 36-year company veteran named P.R. Krishnan, to lead a newer automation services unit. Digital services—like cloud computing, analytics and machine learning—account for about $4 billion revenues, about a fifth of total revenues, but nearly every large deal is becoming a digital deal.
He’s pouring money into training. TCS used to teach workers skills much like at university—with classrooms and faculty. Now employees are more likely to get guidance from its “classroom-in-the-cloud,"" where they watch short videos or take micro sessions on mobile devices anytime. Learners code on the fly, compete with peers and become ‘gurus’ in specific technologies. Internal job fairs recruit those proficient in newer technologies and counsel others on which skills to learn.
As the conversation winds up, Gopinathan stands against tall windows that overlook lush foliage. There’s a distant rumble of construction for an upcoming metro line. Are the tremors shaking up TCS headquarters? “Not those tremors,"" laughs Gopinathan."
303,2018-06-05,TCS,"TCS is bunching the $7.1 billion of its cash reserves in short and long-tenure securities to balance its need for easy liquidity with safety as it looks to make significant payouts to shareholders each year

Mumbai: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) is bunching the Rs477 billion ($7.1 billion) of its cash reserves in short and long-tenure securities to balance its need for easy liquidity with safety as it looks to make significant payouts to shareholders each year. 
Mumbai: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) is bunching the Rs477 billion ($7.1 billion) of its cash reserves in short and long-tenure securities to balance its need for easy liquidity with safety as it looks to make significant payouts to shareholders each year.
Asia’s largest software services provider invested about 53% of its reserves in government securities as of 31 March, with the rest spread over deposits, mutual funds and corporate paper, according to TCS’s annual report. Investments declined 1.4% from the previous financial year’s Rs484 billion after last year’s share buyback, which the company says was India’s largest.
“We are essentially saying that we will distribute close to 80-to-100% of our free reserves, free cash generated a year,"" chief executive officer Rajesh Gopinathan said in an interview in Mumbai. “We formed this dumbbell-shaped holding because we have core holdings, which are long tenure, and then we have a set of holdings that are more short tenure because during the course of the year it has to be liquidated and paid off.""
Software services firms, which have been hoarding cash, are under pressure to return money to shareholders via buybacks and dividends as the outlook for the industry dimmed with clients cutting IT budgets and the US government cracking down on the work visas the companies have long depended on. Gopinathan said the industry has been overdoing the negativity and his aim is to return to double-digit revenue growth.
The company’s cash-distribution plan is one of the primary drivers of its investment strategy rather than returns maximization, Gopinathan said. That exposes its holdings to the vagaries of the market, with a Bloomberg index tracking total returns on India’s 10-year bonds down about 2% this year as markets look ahead to higher benchmark interest rates.
“Neither on the tenure side, nor on the instrument side, we are not changing much,"" said Gopinathan. “The core holdings keep on getting consolidated into long-duration instruments.""
TCS’s approach to its currency exposure is similar, with the firm guarding against changes in the value of the rupee against major peers including the dollar, euro, pound, Canadian and Australian dollars. The rupee has been the worst performer in Asia after the Philippines, dropping 4.8% against the US dollar."

TCS shares closed at Rs1,824.20 apiece, up 2.43% from previous close. In intraday trade, the stock climbed as much as 2.86% to Rs1,832 a share.
The scrip gained for the sixth consecutive session and advanced over 6.5% in this period. So far this year, it has gained over 35%. The company’s market valuation surged by Rs16,539.68 crore to Rs698,408.68 crore. In terms of equity volume, 3.54 lakh TCS shares were traded on BSE and over 53 lakh shares changed hands on NSE during the day.
The company in a regulatory filing on Tuesday has not disclosed the details of its buyback, including the size of repurchase and the price at which it will buy shares.
Recently, TCS gave one for one bonus to its shareholders. Last year, TCS, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd have returned $9.75 billion to its shareholders to keep investors’ faith amid slowing growth in the sector. TCS repurchased Rs16,000 crore shares, while Infosys and Wipro repurchased worth Rs10,000 crore and Rs11,000 crore, respectively.
Analysts say that the share buybacks typically improve earnings per share and return surplus cash to shareholders while also supporting stock price during sluggish market conditions.
The three companies together have more than $12 billion in cash. In addition, they generate about $7.5 billion cash every year, suggesting that these companies have enough cash to reward their shareholders.
On Tuesday, TCS said in a notice to exchanges that it expects to generate $1.36 billion in revenue over 10 years from its partnership with a unit of British insurer Prudential Plc. TCS said it will get $668 million in business from the Prudential unit in addition to the $690 million order it got from the UK insurer in January."

Bengaluru: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) expects to generate $1.36 billion in revenue over 10 years from its partnership with a unit of British insurer Prudential Plc. 
Bengaluru: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) expects to generate $1.36 billion in revenue over 10 years from its partnership with a unit of British insurer Prudential Plc.
India’s largest information technology (IT) outsourcing company said on Tuesday that it will get $668 million in business from the Prudential unit in addition to the $690 million order it got from the UK insurer in January.
The 10-year contract TCS has with M&G Prudential, the UK and European savings and investments business of Prudential, marks the third mega deal (more than $1 billion) bagged by the Mumbai-based company since December last year. 
TCS extended its partnership with television ratings measurement company Nielsen in December when it won a $2.25 billion, eight-year contract. 
This was followed by a more than $2 billion, 10-year contract with a unit of Dutch insurer Aegon NV in January.
These developments imply that TCS will surely report its fastest revenue growth in three years in 2018-19. The developments also explain why the company’s market value has surpassed the $100 billion mark in April. 
The ability of TCS to win large deals (the three deals assure TCS of $5.6 billion over the coming years) is one reason behind the ever-widening gap between the company and its smaller rivals. Sample this: TCS revenue in the January-March period totalled $4.97 billion, more than the annual $4.77 billion sales of India’s fifth largest IT firm, Tech Mahindra Ltd, in 2017-18. 
Although TCS does not provide a growth outlook, the company is expected to exceed 10% growth in the current fiscal year.
The company reported an 8.6% growth to end with $19.1 billion in revenue last year when it added $1.51 billion in incremental revenue.
In the current fiscal, TCS needs to add $1.91 billion in new business to report a 10% growth."

At its board meeting, TCS said it will buy back up to 76.19 million shares, aggregating up to 1.99% of the paid-up equity capital, via a tender at  ₹ 2,100 per equity share.
The buyback price is a steep 17.17% premium to Thursday’s closing price of  ₹ 1,792.25. TCS expects the buyback to be completed in the second quarter of this fiscal year.
“The buyback announcement is in line with TCS’ stated intent to return 80-100% of free cash generated to shareholders through the dividend/buyback route. Nevertheless, we maintain our cautious stance on TCS due to expensive valuations with the stock trading at 21X FY2020E earnings,"" said Kotak Institutional equities in 14 June report.
TCS had announced a  ₹ 16,000 crore share buyback last year as well, which was subscribed over 221.39%. This year, in April, the company rewarded shareholders with a one-for-one bonus.
Analysts say share buybacks typically improve earnings per share and return surplus cash to shareholders while also supporting the stock price during sluggish market conditions.
India’s three IT majors—TCS, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd— together have more than $12 billion in cash. In addition, they generate about $7.5 billion cash every year, suggesting that they have enough cash to reward their shareholders."

297,2018-06-18,TCS,"Sebi's share buyback norms may have its quirks, but they are nothing compared to the oddities involved in valuing Indian IT stocks at the moment

Mumbai: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) said last week that it would buy back roughly 2% of its shares at a 17% premium to prevailing prices. This should ideally have had almost no impact on the company’s share price, given the small reduction in the company’s share capital. But the TCS stock rose 3% after the share buyback announcement, largely because of a peculiarity in India’s share repurchase rules. 
Mumbai: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) said last week that it would buy back roughly 2% of its shares at a 17% premium to prevailing prices. This should ideally have had almost no impact on the company’s share price, given the small reduction in the company’s share capital. But the TCS stock rose 3% after the share buyback announcement, largely because of a peculiarity in India’s share repurchase rules.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India, or Sebi, has mandated that companies reserve 15% of share buyback offers for small shareholders with holdings worth less than  ₹ 2 lakh.
These shareholders typically own a fraction of the company’s shares, which essentially means that all or most of the shares they tender in buyback offers get accepted. This provides an incentive for short-term trades that involve buying shares worth  ₹ 2 lakh or so just ahead of the buyback, and then tendering them at the announced buyback price, which in this case is at a 17% premium.
As pointed out earlier in this column, Sebi’s misguided policy of protecting small shareholders is being taken advantage of by sophisticated traders who don’t need the regulator to hold their hand. As such, the bizarre quota system should be done away with to remove distortions in the market place.
Of course, this behaviour is being fed by flawed taxation rules, which impose a heavy burden on dividend income. Indian companies are, therefore, turning increasingly to share buybacks to return cash to shareholders in a tax-efficient way. 
In TCS’s case, Tata Sons Ltd, with its 72% stake in the company, will take home the lion’s share of the  ₹ 16,000 crore share buyback. But it would be bad PR if it walks away with everything; hence, the necessity to buy back shares at a handsome premium and attract other shareholders to tender as well. 
If there was no tax arbitrage between dividends and share buybacks, the company’s managers wouldn’t need to worry about these decisions. But as things stand, TCS is buying back shares at a valuation of about 26 times one-year forward earnings, or at a 45% premium to its historical average. This goes against the basic tenet that companies buy back shares when they perceive market valuations to be lower than their fundamental worth. 
Besides, buying shares at high valuations reward exiting shareholders at the expense of remaining shareholders, which is again a strange stance for a company.
To conclude, the 3% rise in TCS shares has taken its valuations to 22.5 times estimated FY19 earnings, way ahead of historical average of 18 times one-year forward earnings. 
Analysts at Nomura Research said in a note to clients last month that the sharp rise in TCS’s valuations have come about despite cuts in the company’s earnings estimates in the past two years. TCS’s key business in the banking and financial services vertical remains under pressure, which is why expectations on earnings haven’t improved materially. And while the rupee has depreciated sharply this year, this surely can’t be relied upon for a meaningful upgrade in earnings.
Sebi’s share buyback norms may have its quirks; but they are nothing compared to the oddities involved in valuing Indian IT stocks at the moment.

New Delhi: India’s largest software services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Monday said it has set up a new delivery centre in Suresnes, France that can accommodate up to 230 employees. 
The centre, located in the Parisian region, is the third such unit of TCS in France after the facilities in Lille (opened in 2012) and Poitiers (2014). 
“Along with TCS’ existing locations in Lille and Poitiers, the new delivery centre demonstrates TCS’ ongoing commitment to France and the company’s willingness to support national brands in the French economy by offering them immediate access to TCS’ deep expertise as well as its global network,"" TCS said in a statement. 
The company, however, did not disclose the investment details for the centre. The centre can accommodate up to 230 employees and benefits from highly secure connectivity, a robust infrastructure and secure spaces, it added. 
“As TCS celebrates 50 years of operations and 25 years of presence in France, the opening of this delivery centre marks a new step in our development in this strategic market,"" TCS CEO and managing director Rajesh Gopinathan said. 
Since establishing operations in France in 1992, TCS has expanded its presence in the country significantly. In 2006, the Mumbai-based company acquired its then representative and exclusive partner in the region, TKS, the statement said. 
The acquisition laid the foundation for TCS’ long-term strategic growth in France, which is Europe’s third largest IT services market. In 2013, TCS acquired Alti SA for 75 million euros (about Rs533 crore)."

New Delhi: The revenue department has decided to keep in abeyance GST provisions relating to reverse charge mechanism, tax deducted at source (TDS) and tax collected at source (TCS) for another three months till September-end. 
The GST council in its meeting on 10 March had suspended the provision for deduction of TDS and collection of TCS, as well as implementation of the reverse charge mechanism (RCM) till 30 June. 
A senior revenue official said the GST implementation committee (GIC), headed by the revenue secretary, has decided to keep in abeyance the TDS/TCS provision and GST by way of RCM by another three months. “The GIC has decided to postpone by three months the TDS/TCS and RCM provisions. Notification will be issued shortly. The GIC decision has been circulated to the states for issue simultaneous notification, the official told PTI. 
With this, e-commerce companies can heave a sigh of relief as they will not be required to collect 1% TCS while making payment to suppliers under the goods and services tax (GST). 
As per the Central GST (CGST) Act, the notified entities are required to collect TDS at 1% on payments to goods or services suppliers in excess of Rs2.5 lakh. GST has been rolled out from 1 July, 2017, and transformed India into a ‘one nation, one tax’. 
Besides, the reverse charge mechanism, under which registered dealers are required to make tax payments in case they procures goods from unregistered businesses, too stands deferred till September-end. 
The law review committee, comprising officers from the Centre and states, had earlier suggested reworking Section 9(3) of Central GST Act by bringing composition scheme dealers in the purview of reverse charge mechanism.

New Delhi: India’s largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Friday said its promoters intend to participate in its recently announced up to  ₹ 16,000 crore buyback offer.
Earlier this month, the TCS board had approved a proposal to buy back up to 7.61 crore shares or 1.99% of the total paid-up equity share capital at  ₹ 2,100 a share. Last year too, TCS had undertaken a buyback offer of a similar size.
“In terms of the Sebi Buyback Regulations, under tender offer route, the promoters have the option to participate in the buyback. We would like to inform you that the promoter and promoter group of the company have communicated their intention to participate in the proposed buyback,"" TCS said in a BSE filing today.
The buyback is subject to approval of the members by means of a special resolution through a postal ballot, it added.
TCS said a public announcement setting out the process, timelines and other details will be released in due course in line with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) norms.
At the company’s 50th annual general meeting in June this year, TCS managing director and CEO Rajesh Gopinathan had said the capital allocation policy is paramount to the company.
“We’ve always believed in rewarding the shareholders. We’ve steadily increased our payout to shareholders and now we are at the upper end of the band of 80 to 100% band,"" he had said.

292,2018-07-02,TCS,"Valuations of most IT stocks are bizarre, especially those which have not even half of the recovery in deal wins and growth in digital services as TCS has

Much has changed for Accenture Plc in the past one year. Three quarters ago, it had said that organic growth would fall till August 2018, year-on-year. It had said overall growth would remain flat at 5-8%, while inorganic growth was likely at 2.5-3%, compared to 2% last year. In other words, organic growth was expected to be sluggish. 
Much has changed for Accenture Plc in the past one year. Three quarters ago, it had said that organic growth would fall till August 2018, year-on-year. It had said overall growth would remain flat at 5-8%, while inorganic growth was likely at 2.5-3%, compared to 2% last year. In other words, organic growth was expected to be sluggish.
However, growth has turned out to be higher, and Accenture has been raising its growth guidance every quarter. In the third quarter ended May 2018, the company’s revenue grew 11% in constant currency terms. Consequently, Accenture raised its annual growth target to 9.5-10%, compared to the earlier 7-9%.
The fact that Accenture’s revenue growth is in the high single digits, excluding acquisitions, is commendable.
Especially so, when we consider the base effect. Accenture reported net revenue of $10.31 billion in the quarter ended May, which was more than double that of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd at $4.97 billion in the March 2018 quarter. 
Of course, TCS’s scale of operations is enormous, although growth seems to have stunted. Constant currency growth rates have hovered between 6.2% and 7.2% in the last four quarters. While the company has announced a slew of deal wins, and even business analysts have hailed the company’s inroads in digital services, all of this is yet to reflect in its revenue numbers. It is, however, important to note that Accenture has a relatively different business mix, and the recovery in its growth rates cannot be extrapolated to Indian IT companies.
Despite this, TCS’s market value has caught up with Accenture in the past year. A look at the chart alongside suggests TCS has had a revival in growth, with things still being relatively sluggish at Accenture. Before Accenture gave its initial guidance for the year, and much before the pickup in its growth rates, TCS had traded about 4 times its revenue, or at a 70% premium to Accenture’s valuations. Now, after its huge rally, it trades at 5.2 times its revenue, or at a 104% premium to Accenture. This is based on annualised revenues for the latest reported quarter.
This inordinate divergence just goes to show that Indian IT stocks have charted their own course, without any reference to what was happening in the underlying business. Even if we were to give TCS credit for doing better than other Indian companies, that would only justify part of the rally in its shares. The fact that it has sharply outperformed Accenture, whose recovery has been sharper, lays bare flaws with the valuations of Indian IT stocks. Valuations of most IT stocks are bizarre; especially those which have not even half of the recovery in deal wins and growth in digital services as TCS has.
Of course, as pointed out earlier in this column, this is largely because of TINA, or “there is no alternative"", factor, which is leading to high valuations for companies that are not tainted by accounting or other scandals."

Key companies that will report Q1FY19 earnings this week are IndusInd Bank, TCS and Infosys. HDFC Securities Institutional Research expects IT sector earnings to accelerate, despite cross currency headwinds after six quarters. Revenue growth in first quarter of FY19 is expected at 1.3% and 9.6% QoQ and YoY respectively. “Operating performance is expected to remain stable despite headwinds of cross currency, wage increase, visa cost impact, which are expected to be offset by higher efficiencies and rupee depreciation,"" it said in a note on 6 July.
Among macros, industrial growth data, measured on the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) for the month of May will be released on 12 July. Industrial output jumped by 4.9% in April this year, spurred by higher growth in manufacturing and mining sectors. Retail inflation data for June will also be released this week. India’s retail inflation in May rose to a four-month high of 4.87% due to costly petrol and diesel, and a weak rupee."
291,2018-07-09,TCS,"Tech Mahindra CEO C.P. Gurnani's salary consists has a large component of stock options, which pegs  his remuneration significantly higher than peers at TCS, Infosys and Wipro

Bengaluru: Tech Mahindra’s chief executive officer C.P. Gurnani earned  ₹  146.19 crore in remuneration in 2017-18, bringing his total earnings over the last five years to  ₹ 510 crore. The numbers have rekindled debate among analysts and observers on compensation for the CEO of India’s fifth largest software services company and how it compares with the median salary of its other employees. 
Bengaluru: Tech Mahindra’s chief executive officer C.P. Gurnani earned  ₹  146.19 crore in remuneration in 2017-18, bringing his total earnings over the last five years to  ₹ 510 crore. The numbers have rekindled debate among analysts and observers on compensation for the CEO of India’s fifth largest software services company and how it compares with the median salary of its other employees.
Significantly, Gurnani’s  ₹ 510 crore in earnings is about 24% more than the combined earnings of  ₹ 387.92 crore of nine CEOs at the four largest IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, over the last five years, according to a Mint analysis.
Tech Mahindra’s vice-chairman Vineet Nayyar who retires this year, earned  ₹ 363.13 crore during this period, making the total payout by the company to two of its senior-most executives to  ₹ 873.16 crore over the last five years.
Gurnani and Nayyar’s annual salary has a large component of stock options exercised during the last four years and for this reason, their compensation is higher than their peers.
Tech Mahindra defended the high compensation to its two executives, saying the grant of shares to Gurnani and Nayyar is tied to the company’s performance, with the company having clocked the fastest compound annual growth since 2013.
“The grant of shares for the executives including MD (managing director) & CEO is based on performance parameters and is decided by the Nomination and Remuneration committee, consisting of non-executive and independent directors,""said a spokeswoman for Tech Mahindra. 
“If one looks at the last five years of growth, Tech Mahindra has been the fastest-growing company amongst the top five and the stock has been one of the best performers amongst peer group,"" said the spokeswoman.
Although this is correct, Tech Mahindra’s performance—both revenue and profitability—is not significantly better than its four larger rivals. 
Again, as Tech Mahindra is much smaller than TCS or Infosys, it is only expected of the firm to grow faster. 
Sample this: Tech Mahindra reported a 9.6% dollar revenue growth to end with $4.77 billion in revenue in 2017-18 as against TCS’s 8.6% growth to end with $19.1 billion in revenue last year. 
TCS’s $4.97 billion revenue in the January-March period is more than Tech Mahindra’s $4.77 billion sales for the entire year. 
Still, TCS chief executive Rajesh Gopinathan earned  ₹ 12.49 crore, as against Gurnani’s  ₹ 146.19 crore last year. 
Vishal Sikka, Infosys’s former US-based CEO, who faced criticism over higher salary from some of the software services company’s founders, earned  ₹ 111.32 crore over three years.
“Capitalism is still trying to find a comfortable home in India and it is such instances of high, excessive compensation which in a democracy likes ours gives capitalism a bad name,"" said Gurcharan Das, author and former chief executive officer of Procter & Gamble India. 
“The fact is that flaunting wealth is distasteful and imprudent in our country. The last thing you want is the government to get involved in fixing salaries, but one should not forget that it is these examples of inequality that has partially contributed to leaders like Donald Trump getting elected in the US because it bothers a lot of people. The board of Tech Mahindra and Anand Mahindra (chairman of Tech Mahindra) should use self-restraint and make sure that there is no resentment among employees in Tech Mahindra,"" Das said.
Gurnani, 59, joined Tech Mahindra in 2004, and took over as chief executive officer in August 2012. 
Tech Mahindra, which was founded in 1986 and went public in 2006, allotted shares to Gurnani in 2006-07 and again in 2010-11."

New Delhi: Shares of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) edged higher on Tuesday, ahead of the company’s June quarter results announcement, rising 0.35% to  ₹  1,894. India’s biggest IT company TCS will announce its Q1 FY19 results after market hours today. The TCS top management will address the media at 5.15 pm, followed by an analyst conference call at 7pm. TCS share prices have hugely outperformed the broader market this year, surging about 40%. There has been a re-rating in some IT stocks on expectations that growth will pick up.
The IT index has outperformed the broader markets this year, driven by a depreciating rupee. Expectations are high from TCS and other top-tier IT companies on the earnings front for the June quarter.
“The first quarter is a seasonally strong one for IT companies due to higher billing days and allocation of budgets to programmes. This, along with benefits from currency movement, is expected to result in improved recovery for the sector,"" market analyst Ambareesh Baliga wrote in a blog post.
Here are five things to watch out for in the TCS Q1 FY19 results:
(1) For the June quarter, TCS is expected to post a net profit of  ₹  6,985 crore on revenues of  ₹  33,966 crore, according to Bloomberg estimates. HDFC Securities expects TCS to report revenues of $5,063 million, rising 1.8% sequentially and 10.3% year on year. For the March quarter, TCS had reported a net profit of  ₹  6,904 crore on net income from operations of  ₹  32,075 crore.
(2) The growth outlook from the TCS management with respect to first-half seasonality, large account metrics, performance and outlook in core verticals such as financial services and retail will be key things to watch out for, according to HDFC Securities.
(3) The company’s EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margin is expected to decline 40 basis points, quarter on quarter, to 25%, affected by wage increases, according to HDFC Securities. This is likely to be offset by rupee depreciation and efficiency gains, it adds. The rupee is down nearly 7% against the dollar so far this year. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
(4) TCS rival Accenture Plc’s strong results in the third quarter have put the focus on Indian IT companies. Accenture follows a September-August financial year. “Accenture’s early participation in digital, led by a comprehensive portfolio of offerings across verticals and geographies, is reaping rich dividends. Accenture results demonstrate that the spending environment is robust but requires an optimum portfolio mix and capabilities to capitalise on it. From IT companies’ perspective, the progress made by TCS is impressive,"" says Kotak Institutional Equities in a note.
(5) The digital business of TCS will be another key focus area for analysts. Greater adoption of digital technologies by customers helped digital engagements contribute 23.8% of TCS’s revenue in the March quarter, rising of 42.8% year on year. “We are seeing strong demand in digital, in security and blockchain, in analytics and data,"" TCS chief operating officer N. Ganapathy Subramaniam had said after the March quarter results were announced."
287,2018-07-10,TCS,"TCS registers fastest sequential growth in 4 years, double-digit expansion likely in FY19

New Delhi: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) kicked off the fiscal first-quarter earnings season by reporting its fastest sequential growth in four years, as the largest banks in the US boosted spending on technology. 
New Delhi: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) kicked off the fiscal first-quarter earnings season by reporting its fastest sequential growth in four years, as the largest banks in the US boosted spending on technology.
In constant currency terms, TCS’s June quarter revenue rose 4.1% from the preceding three months. It grew 9.3% from a year earlier. Currency fluctuations, however, took some sheen off the company’s growth. Dollar revenue increased at a slower 1.6% pace to $5.05 billion in the quarter ended 30 June from the preceding three months.
TCS last reported a 4.8% constant-currency revenue growth in the fiscal first quarter of 2014-15.
Net profit rose 1.1% to $1.08 billion in the June quarter from $1.07 billion in the preceding three months, while operating margin narrowed 40 basis points to 25% from 25.4% in the January-March period.
A Bloomberg survey of 15 analysts had estimated  ₹ 6,985.4 crore ($1.02 billion) profit on net sales of  ₹ 33,966 crore.
For the first time in two years, India’s largest software services provider is poised to outpace Nasscom’s industry growth projection of 7-9% in constant currency terms.
The US, which accounted for 51% of TCS’s June quarter revenue, and financial services, which constituted 31% of overall business, grew 3.7% each. 
If TCS’s two recent more-than-$1 billion outsourcing contracts in the insurance space are included, the financial services segment grew 5.6% sequentially.
A strong performance by digital, which grew 45% from a year earlier to account for 25% of the firm’s quarterly revenue, means the company’s strategy of building both talent and technologies is beginning to yield results.
“Both revenue and margins beat CS (Credit Suisse) and consensus estimates,"" Anantha Narayan and Nitin Jain of Credit Suisse wrote in a note to investors after TCS reported its earnings. “Sequentially, BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) vertical grew at 3.7% QoQ, the best since the last 7 quarters.""
TCS does not give quarterly or annual forecasts but a strong start to the financial year reaffirms the management’s optimism on the company reporting double-digit growth in the current financial year.
“The two takeaways are that BFSI and US have seen good growth. We have the momentum and our strategy is resonating well with our customers. We are enthused with what we see and this sets us up well for the year,"" said TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan. 
“We, the entire management team, have said that we are looking at a double-digit growth in the current fiscal, and we believe we are headed there,"" he added.
TCS ended the previous fiscal year with $19.09 billion in revenue, a 8.6% year-on-year growth, and 24.8% operating margin, faster than the 6.2% in 2016-17, but its profitability was 90 basis points lower than the previous year’s 25.7%.
On Tuesday, TCS’s shares declined 0.56% to  ₹ 1,877 on BSE, while the benchmark Sensex gained 0.85% to 36,239.62 points. The results were announced after the end of trading in Mumbai.
“We expect a positive reaction (from investors) given strong Q1 numbers and positive commentary,"" UBS’s analyst Diviya Nagarajan wrote in a note to clients after the company declared its earnings."

New Delhi: Deepak Parekh-led financial services conglomerate HDFC Group on Tuesday saw the market capitalisation of its listed firms cross the  ₹  10 trillion mark, making it only the second Indian business house after the Tata group to achieve this feat. HDFC Group has four listed companies—Housing Finance Development Corp. Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd, life insurance firm HDFC Standard Life Ltd and Gruh Finance Ltd. The Tata Group has about 30 firms listed on the stock exchange.
Another HDFC entity—its mutual fund arm—is currently in the process of launching an IPO, after which the group will have five listed firms. Analysts have pegged HDFC Mutual Fund’s market cap at around  ₹  30,000 crore.
At close of trade Tuesday, the market cap of HDFC Bank stood at  ₹ 559,633.53 crore, HDFC’s was  ₹  326,776.81 crore, HDFC Standard Life Insurance  ₹ 95,936.72 crore and Gruh Finance  ₹ 24,967.71 crore on the BSE.
Tata Group firms have a combined market cap of nearly Rs11 trillion. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) is the country’s most valued firm with a market valuation of  ₹ 718,623.56 crore. HDFC Group’s HDFC Bank is the country’s third most valued firm in terms of market cap.
On Tuesday, shares of HDFC Bank rose 1.31% to close at  ₹  2,149, HDFC 1.54% to  ₹  1,939.20, HDFC Standard Life 0.51% to  ₹  476.70 while Gruh Finance fell by 0.96% to  ₹  341.35 on the BSE.
HDFC is one of the few blue-chip companies in the country which is not run by a promoter family and is professionally-managed with a diverse institutional shareholding. The group has also seen a very stable top management leadership, while it has prospered in a sector like real estate consistently over decades. The top-four leaders of HDFC Ltd, including Parekh and Keki Mistry, together have over 150 years of leadership experience.
While the flagship HDFC Ltd has been in business for the last four decades, HDFC Bank has been in business for 25 years and HDFC Standard Life for 20 years. Gruh Finance has been in business for 30 years.
HDFC Ltd currently has 76% FII holding, which has remained in this range for many years, including in the aftermath of the Lehman crisis that saw foreign investors pulling out money across sectors. The FII holding rose to as much as 80% in March 2015."
289,2018-07-10,TCS,"Among the top-tier IT companies, TCS is expected to lead with sequential growth of between 3.5% and 4% in Q1 FY19

There has been a massive rerating of IT stocks in the past one year. On an aggregate, IT stocks were trading at 19.6 times one-year forward earnings in end-June, far higher than the multiple of 16.1 times a year earlier, based on the earnings estimates of Kotak Institutional Equities. 
There has been a massive rerating of IT stocks in the past one year. On an aggregate, IT stocks were trading at 19.6 times one-year forward earnings in end-June, far higher than the multiple of 16.1 times a year earlier, based on the earnings estimates of Kotak Institutional Equities.
Of course, the rerating has been far higher for some companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), and Larsen and Toubro Infotech Ltd. So much so that one would imagine IT companies are about to report a huge increase in growth rates vis-à-vis last year.
As it turns out, hardly anyone is expecting this. While growth rates are expected to pick up for a few companies, it’s nowhere near as dramatic as the jump in valuations suggest. Analysts at Nomura estimate tier-I companies to report an 8.7% year-on-year growth in revenues in constant currency terms. This compares with growth of 6.7% in the year-ago period.
Among the top-tier companies, TCS is expected to lead with sequential growth of between 3.5% and 4%. This roughly translates into year-on-year growth of around 9% in constant currency terms, which compares with growth of 6.7% in fiscal year 2018. Another quarter of decent growth would push the company’s growth to double-digits, which will undoubtedly get investors excited.
But it must be said that TCS stands out among large-sized companies. And even in its case, valuations of nearly 24 times one-year forward earnings are pricing in high growth for years to come.
Kotak’s analysts expect companies such as Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd to report a decline in organic revenues, while growth at HCL Technologies Ltd is expected to be sluggish at around 1%. Infosys Ltd was originally expected to grow revenues by around 2.5% in constant currency terms, but a rumour last week has led investors to believe growth would be about 100 basis points lower."
285,2018-07-11,TCS,"The only concern, for investors, is Tata Consultancy Services's (TCS's) high valuation of nearly 24 times one-year forward earnings

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) celebrated its 50th anniversary in the April-June quarter (Q1). Whether by happy happenstance or perfect planning, it also turned out to be a quarter where multiple milestones were reached. The company reported quarterly revenues of over $5 billion for the first time, and its employee count— already at staggering levels—rose to over 400,000. 
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) celebrated its 50th anniversary in the April-June quarter (Q1). Whether by happy happenstance or perfect planning, it also turned out to be a quarter where multiple milestones were reached. The company reported quarterly revenues of over $5 billion for the first time, and its employee count— already at staggering levels—rose to over 400,000.
More importantly, the Q1 results addressed a constant crib of critics, including this column. Growth has returned to decent levels, after being stuck in the mid single-digits for almost two years. On a year-on-year basis, revenue grew 9.3% in constant currency, the highest in the last eight quarters. In all likelihood, TCS will report double-digit growth in the September quarter.
“We are focused on getting back well above double-digit growth...that is the biggest test of the appropriateness of our strategy,"" Rajesh Gopinathan, chief executive and managing director of TCS, said at a press conference.
The company has sounded optimistic in the past, but never this confident. And for the first time in a long time, TCS has the numbers to back up its narrative.
The mainstay North American business, and the key banking and financial services vertical had dragged growth earlier, but are now growing at a decent pace. TCS said that a large part of its deal wins worth $4.9 billion last quarter were from these business segments. This, too, addresses concerns that large chunks of the company’s portfolio are underperforming.
To be sure, an increase in growth was expected by analysts, on the back of large deal wins TCS has been announcing in the past couple of quarters. Even so, growth appears to be slightly ahead of the Street’s estimates, which will please investors. The fact that the company has managed this without resorting to acquisitions is commendable, too.
What’s more, any worry that the large deals, including with Transamerica and Nielsen came at the cost of lower margins seems to have been unfounded, at least based on the company’s reported margins in the June quarter. Operating margin fell just 38 basis points sequentially, despite the impact of wage hikes and promotions given during the quarter. TCS said a large part of this was offset through scale benefits and other operational efficiencies. This is again better than analysts’ estimates of a decline of over 100 basis points in margins.
Which brings us to another milestone—operating profit grew 24.1% year-on-year, the highest in the past 17 quarters. Conversion of profits to free cash flow was decent too, at over 100%.
The big question, of course, is if all of this is sustainable. Going by the continued success the company has had with large deal wins, revenue growth can be expected to be in the double-digits for the year. And with margins being steady in a quarter where wage hikes were given, the outlook on margins looks bright as well.
The only concern, for investors, is TCS’s high valuation of nearly 24 times one-year forward earnings. While the depreciation in the rupee may help earnings grow by over 20% this year, it’s another matter if earnings will grow at a similar pace without the currency boost."

Mumbai: Shares of India’s biggest information technology (IT) firm Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) on Wednesday surged over 6% to hit a record high after the company reported better-than-expected June quarter (Q1) results.TCS shares touched an all-time high of  ₹  1,995 apiece, rising 6.28% in intraday trading. It ended the day at  ₹ ₹  1,979 on the BSE, up 5.5% from previous close.
Nomura Research and Kotak Institutional Equities have retained their “reduce"" ratings on the stock, citing expensive valuations. TCS shares have gained over 45% since January.
“TCS Q1 results were ahead of expectations on revenue/margins, positive on the rebound in BFSI, and the commentary suggested a better growth outlook. The company indicated a better outlook in BFSI, continued traction in retail, and it retained its aspiration of 26-28% EBIT margins. However, the stock up-move of 40%, year to date, largely builds in the positivity. We find the valuations expensive at 23x FY20F EPS,"" Nomura said in a note to its investors.
Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities reckons TCS is on track to achieve 10% constant currency revenue growth in FY19. “Even as we like the success in platform bets and integrated digital programmes, we struggle to justify punchy valuations of 21X FY20E earnings. We raise our EPS estimates by 3-5% for FY19-21E on the back of revisions to INR/USD assumptions,"" the report said.
TCS on Tuesday reported a 24% profit rise, the fastest pace in two years, to  ₹  7,340 crore due to robust growth in banking, financial services and insurance and the North American operations. Revenue grew 16% to  ₹  34,261 crore.
The TCS management said the recovery was broad-based across small and large clients and across different sub-segments within BFSI and confirmed a better medium-term outlook for the vertical. TCS posted 4.1% sequential constant currency growth to clock $5.05 billion in revenue in the June quarter
On an overall basis, the company’s management indicated an improved outlook on return to double-digit year-on-year growth helped by non-RFP based transformational deals, better visibility in BFSI and continued momentum in Europe/UK. TCS also reiterated its target of 26-28% EBIT margin citing favourable currency and better revenue growth as tailwinds.
Brokerage firm Jefferies India has increased its constant currency growth estimates to 10-11.5% over FY19-21 against 8.5-10% earlier and factors 4-6% and 9-13% increase in rupee revenue estimates and EBIT margins, respectively, due to a weaker rupee.
Jefferies increased its price target to  ₹ 2,140 and upgraded the stock to buy from hold. “We believe the valuation premium to peers is justified by better growth visibility/outlook as it is the only Tier-1 IT company in our coverage with double-digit growth over FY19-21E. High FCF/dividend yield, USD exposure and sector leadership support the valuation on an absolute basis,"" Jefferies added.

Sticking with financial stocks and not chasing returns has helped Axis Asset Management Co. to ride the wave of volatility in Indian markets that has hammered many of its competitors. 
Sticking with financial stocks and not chasing returns has helped Axis Asset Management Co. to ride the wave of volatility in Indian markets that has hammered many of its competitors.
The Axis Bluechip Fund is up 25% over the past year, beating nine index funds and 35 other actively managed portfolios to the mantle of India’s top performing large-cap fund, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its biggest holdings - HDFC Bank Ltd., Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. Housing Development Finance Corp. and Tata Consultancy Services - have contributed more than three quarters of gains on the S&P BSE Sensex Index this year.
“Our portfolio tilt toward very high-quality stocks has helped us ride out the market volatility,"" Shreyash Devalkar, senior fund manager at Axis, which has $12 billion in assets, said in an interview. The fund exited some smaller companies in December after a gush of inflows lifted valuations, he said.
Gains in Indian equities this year have been lopsided as investors sought safety in the biggest stocks amid headwinds from a brewing trade conflict and elevated prices of oil, India’s top import. A selloff in stocks of medium and smaller-sized companies was made worse by stringent margins requirements imposed in June. That’s left those smaller firms trading near the biggest discount to the Sensex in two years, according to Bloomberg data.
Axis expects a boost in government spending in India’s countryside ahead of next year’s general elections to benefit companies able to capture improved consumer demand. The government this month raised minimum assured prices for crops like cotton and rice to boost rural incomes and spending. “We are tracking earnings closely to see how consumer demand is panning out,"" he said, without naming the stocks he’s watching.
New Record
The Sensex is up more than 8% this year, surpassing a previous all-time high reached in January, after turmoil in the first quarter dragged equities into a correction. Despite the rebound, volatility may remain elevated amid uncertainty over international politics and in the run up to next year’s national ballot, Devalkar said.
Rising crude prices and its impact on public finances remains a cause for concern, he said. Brent oil held above $72 per barrel, up about 45% from a year ago, fueling concern inflation will quicken. India is the world’s third-biggest oil user and relies on imports to meet about two-thirds of its fuel requirements.
Prior to his fund’s outperformance over the past 12 months, Devalkar’s fund lost about 3.6% in 2016 compared with a 3% gain in the NSE Nifty 50 Index that year."

TCS, which closed 0.19% lower at  ₹  1,941.25 per share, was valued at  ₹  7.43 trillion.
The surge in RIL share price follows its Q1 results where its standalone net profit increased 18% to  ₹  9,459 crore. TCS, on its part, reported quarterly revenues of over $5 billion for the first time in Q1.
RIL shares have beaten the market by a wide margin in the past two months on expectations of a regulatory boost for its refining business and excitement about revenue accretion from its telecom subsidiary Reliance Jio’s non-mobile businesses.
It’s outperformance in Q1, however, was led by the petrochemical and refining realizations, which reported a 35% year-on-year jump in volumes, helped by the company’s expanded capacity. Revenue at the energy-to-telecom conglomerate rose 56.5% to  ₹  1.4 trillion against  ₹  90,537 crore in the corresponding previous quarter. Its telecom arm Reliance Jio reported a profit of  ₹  612 crore for the June quarter, a 19.9% rise on a sequential basis, on the back of a revenue of  ₹  8,109 crore from its operations, the company said.
“Reliance Jio continued to show strong subscriber momentum, in line with our expectation. However, flattish sequential ARPU despite cash back offers and changes to prime membership are surprises. Focus remains on onboarding more subscribers and driving engagement; price increase appears less of a focus for now,"" said Morgan Stanley in a note to its investors.
TCS on 10 July reported a 24% profit rise, the fastest pace in two years, to  ₹  7,340 crore due to robust growth in banking, financial services and insurance and the North American operations. Revenue grew 16% to  ₹  34,261 crore.
“TCS had a strong quarter witnessing a healthy growth on back of turnaround in the BFSI segment of the North American market and the management expects the growth to sustain in the coming quarters... TCS is on track to achieve its targeted double-digit growth in FY19. Yet, we believe that at current valuations, the stock is fairly priced from a short to medium-term perspective,"" said Indsec Securities in 12 July note."

Bengaluru:  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp’s second-quarter earnings were a tad disappointing as both revenue and profitability missed analysts estimates, although the Nasdaq-listed company retained its full-year forecast of growing at best 10% in 2018. 
Bengaluru:  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp’s second-quarter earnings were a tad disappointing as both revenue and profitability missed analysts estimates, although the Nasdaq-listed company retained its full-year forecast of growing at best 10% in 2018.
Significantly, for the first time in many years, Cognizant’s year-on-year revenue growth of 9.2% in the April-June period was lower than the 10% growth of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS).
Cognizant, which is based in the US but has most of its employees in India, said revenue in the three months ended 30 June increased 9.2% from a year earlier, and improved 2.4% from the preceding March quarter, to $4.01 billion.
ALSO READ: HCL Tech displaces Wipro as India’s third largest IT firm
Net profit declined 12% sequentially to $456 million in the second quarter as against $520 million in the first quarter and was also 3% less than $470 million in the year-ago period on account of unfavourable currency movements. 
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected Cognizant to report a revenue of $4.03 billion and profit of $643 million.
The Teaneck, New Jersey-based company expects revenue in the September quarter to be between $4.06 billion and $4.10 billion, a sequential increase of 1.24% and 2.24%.
On Thursday, Cognizant said it reaffirmed full-year revenue to be between $16.05 billion and $16.3 billion, translating into a growth of 8.4% and 10% or adding new business of between $1.24 billion and $1.49 billion.
ALSO READ: Why Infosys has lost its IT bellwether tag
At the heart of Cognizant’s soft performance is the company’s inability to generate more business from its largest banks. Cognizant’s largest revenue segment, financial services, which accounts for 37% of the firm’s total revenue, managed only a 0.5% sequential growth and 4.5% growth from the year-ago period.
TCS, on the back of two mega deals (more than $1 billion), and optimism on higher client spending in the financial services, expects to clock growth exceeding 10% in 2018-19. Mumbai-based TCS has seen its year-on-year growth improve in the January-March period and in the April-June quarter even as Cognizant’s year-on-year growth slipped. 
For this reason, some analysts are of the view that TCS could grow faster than Cognizant in the current financial year.
“CTSH’s (Cognizant’s) relative growth has also slowed compared with its competitors, TCS and Infosys. More importantly, 2018 revenue growth guidance is weaker than TCS and just about in line with Infosys, which has been impacted by significant internal issues. We are now concerned that this may be a side-effect of the onus on margin expansion,"" HSBC analyst Yogesh Aggarwal wrote in a 17 May note.
Still, Cognizant is the only company that has managed to improve its operating margin in the past two years even as the Indian IT firms’ higher profitability has seen erosion during this time.
“As our second-quarter results confirm, we’re making solid progress on our plan to accelerate our shift to digital services and solutions,"" said Francisco D’Souza, chief executive and vice-chairman, Cognizant. 
“We’ve been methodical in developing, aligning, and applying our portfolio of skills, services, and solutions to clients’ needs, so they can become fully digital organizations. We remain confident in our ability to invest for growth and achieve our financial targets,"" he said.
Cognizant’s shares fell about 6% in pre-market trading in New York on Thursday."

3) TCS had earlier said that its promoters intend to participate in the buyback offer. “We would like to inform you that the promoter and promoter group of the company have communicated their intention to participate in the proposed buyback,"" TCS had said in a BSE filing.

5) According to Sebi’s mandate, companies have to reserve 15% of any buyback for small shareholders with holdings of less than  ₹ 2 lakh. This will increase the acceptance ratio for TCS’ retail investors who want to participate in the buyback offer."

Mumbai: US-based Simonelli Innovation LLC has sued Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) in a Texas court, alleging India’s largest information technology (IT) outsourcing firm wrongfully used its intellectual property (IP) and trade secrets to build its own consulting practice.
Simonelli, a privately held consulting firm in Texas, accused TCS of misusing Simonelli’s trade secrets and confidential information and sought a jury trial, seeking compensation for loss in revenue on account of TCS using its consulting offering solutions.
“This case is being brought because TCS and TAIC (Tata America International Corp.) agreed to keep the IP and trade secrets of Simonelli Innovation confidential and to only use same in projects under the ‘Alliance Agreement’ that would mutually benefit both entities,"" reads Simonelli’s lawsuit dated 15 August, filed in the western district of Texas.
Mint has reviewed a copy of the lawsuit.
“Despite this, the defendants (TCS) took the methodology and foundation given to them by plaintiff (Simonelli), and used it to transform their consulting options, obtain customers and increase revenue without including the plaintiff as required by the ‘Alliance Agreement’ contract between the parties"".
An email sent to TCS seeking comment went unanswered.
Simonelli’s lawsuit is the second IP infringement case faced by TCS in the past few years after a US-based healthcare software company, Epic Systems Corp., took the Mumbai-based IT firm to court in 2016, alleging TCS took Epic’s proprietary software to build its own healthcare software product.
Last year, a US court ordered TCS to pay $420 million in damages to Epic. TCS denies all charges and is contesting the order.
According to the latest lawsuit, Simonelli and TAIC formed a partnership on 11 June 2014 to co-develop a “prototype factory and co-innovation model"" to let TCS provide prototyping services to clients.
Simonelli claims it invested money and time to develop its own methodology and expertise, which is a trade secret as defined by the Defend Trade Secrets Act.
Simonelli alleged TCS decided not to comply with the agreement after its North America president, Surya Kant, reviewed the agreement in August 2016.
“Defendants (TCS) took Simonelli’s trade secrets under the guise of a contractual agreement, improperly used those secrets outside of the agreement to build their business, and failed to compensate plaintiff (Simonelli) under the agreement,"" Simonelli alleged in the lawsuit.
“Through the intentional and deceitful conduct,"" the lawsuit said, “the defendants breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the TCS America Agreement and denied Simonelli benefits due to Simonelli under the agreement. Defendants’ conduct violated the spirit of the ‘Alliance Agreement’, and deprived Simonelli of the fruits of that contract."""

“A portfolio of turnkey services offerings, traction in emerging markets, improving sales and marketing prowess, and willingness to take multiple big bets (different go-to-market models) are among the key drivers that should help TCS sustain its hi-growth trajectory in the long run"", said brokerage Edelweiss Securities said in its July report.
The banking, financial services and insurance sector, or BFSI, which contributes 30% of TCS’s revenue, has started growing at a higher pace. The company’s management is confident of double-digit growth in the BFSI segment in the near- to medium-term. The company has strong hiring plans for FY19, despite a lower attrition rate than peers.
“TCS is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for offshore IT services. Considering its greater experience than peers in implementing large, complex, and mission-critical projects, the company is a serious contender for large deals"", the Edelweiss report added."

New Delhi/Mumbai: Tata Sons Ltd is set for a windfall of as much as  ₹  12,603 crore from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd through share buybacks and dividend income in the first half of the financial year, funds that chairman N. Chandrasekaran can use to pare debt in several group companies, a Mint analysis shows. 
New Delhi/Mumbai: Tata Sons Ltd is set for a windfall of as much as  ₹  12,603 crore from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd through share buybacks and dividend income in the first half of the financial year, funds that chairman N. Chandrasekaran can use to pare debt in several group companies, a Mint analysis shows.
Tata Sons is expected to get at least  ₹  11,502 crore from the 54.7 million scrips it plans to tender in the TCS share buyback. The Mumbai-based conglomerate has already received about  ₹  1,100 crore as dividend for the first quarter. Tata Sons earned  ₹  24,760 crore by tendering shares in a buyback and dividend from India’s largest information technology outsourcing company last year.
Tata Sons could use the proceeds to retire debt at some of its group firms, including Tata Motors Ltd and Tata Teleservices Ltd, three analysts said.
The move is part of Chandrasekaran’s ongoing efforts to cut debt and make the group more agile but it also exposes the group holding company’s over-dependence on TCS, which he led in his previous role.
“There is a pressing need to reduce debt in Tata Power, Tata Steel and Tata Motors (about  ₹  2.3 trillion in total). They could use this money in the form of additional equity in any of these indebted companies,"" said the first analyst at a Mumbai-based brokerage firm, requesting anonymity.
“Last year, Tata Sons used much of the money got from selling shares (of TCS) and from a buyback in reducing the debt of its telecom businesses and also in making the payments due to Docomo,"" another Mumbai-based analyst at a foreign brokerage said on condition of anonymity. “This year’s proceeds should be used for retiring debt of Tata Motors.""
“Both Tata Steel and Tata Motors, with large capex requirements, should see capital infusion,"" said a third Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage. “TCS giving back money to shareholders is actually good for minority shareholders. And because Tata Sons holds more than 70% stake, it is the largest beneficiary. Now, TCS is doing well, so it’s always debatable how else could the company have used the cash—either in investing more in its existing business or to buy companies.""
An email sent to Tata Sons seeking comment remained unanswered till the time of publishing this story.
“I really don’t know what Chandra is doing from a larger perspective. But, it is clear that he is essentially fighting the debt problem and leading the fire fighting in some of these companies,"" the first analyst cited before said.
“TCS has been their story for the last decade or so. TCS has been shining while others have been growing but that growth is fuelled to an extent by debt and one such example is Tata Steel. They had to take an urgent action to reduce debt by selling Corus to Thyssenkrupp,"" the first analyst said.
Chandrasekaran, who took over as chairman of Tata Sons in February 2017, has inherited a set of companies that had been under pressure for a while (including Tata Motors’ domestic business), an unstable leadership team in the interim period after the ouster of Cyrus Mistry, a legal dispute involving NTT Docomo, the troubled operations of Tata Steel in Europe and the never-ending debate over the future of Tata Nano."

New Delhi: Seven of the 10 most valued Indian companies suffered an erosion of  ₹ 75,684.33 crore from their market valuation last week, with FMCG major HUL taking the steepest hit.
In a weak broader market where the Sensex fell by 255.25 points or 0.66% last week, the top seven blue chip companies, including State Bank of India (SBI), Maruti Suzuki India and ITC witnessed a decline in their market valuation.

270,2018-09-12,TCS,"The turnaround in the pace of hiring at TCS, Infosys, Cognizant, Wipro and HCL Technologies in the June quarter follows a year of tepid employee additions

New Delhi: The top five software services providers operating in India added 24,047 people in the first quarter of this fiscal, compared with the 13,772 net additions in the previous fiscal, leading many experts to believe that the industry is set to record the fastest growth in three years. The turnaround in the pace of hiring at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd in the June quarter follows a year of tepid employee additions, the slowest pace since the offshore outsourcing boom started at the turn of the century. 
New Delhi: The top five software services providers operating in India added 24,047 people in the first quarter of this fiscal, compared with the 13,772 net additions in the previous fiscal, leading many experts to believe that the industry is set to record the fastest growth in three years. The turnaround in the pace of hiring at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd in the June quarter follows a year of tepid employee additions, the slowest pace since the offshore outsourcing boom started at the turn of the century.
Analysts attribute the reversal of fortunes for the sector to three reasons. First, companies are looking to spend more on outsourcing technology work. Second, Fortune 1000 companies are using data analytics platforms offered by information technology (IT) vendors to run their business better. This, in turn, is translating into more work for the outsourcing companies, for now. And third, companies are increasing their spending on digital technologies. The increased spending has led to more contracts valued at over $1 billion.
For instance, Mumbai-based TCS has won three mega deals since December, bringing in a combined $5.6 billion in revenue. Last week, Bengaluru-based Wipro won its largest contract valued at $1.6 billion.
“The early legs of any transformation are always challenging, and this we have seen in the last two years when all companies struggled for growth,"" an executive at Cognizant said on condition of anonymity. “For all the five companies, digital is now a fourth of total revenue. So, without getting into the debate of digital definition, the heartening thing is that quality of revenue is only improving.""
Although all IT firms are moving away from a people-led model to a platform-based business approach, hiring by the largest IT firms continues to be a dominant indicator of their prospects. The five firms together employed 1.17 million at the end of the June quarter.
“Growth is back,"" a senior executive at TCS said on condition of anonymity. “Companies were always spending more on digital in the past. But now, what we are seeing is that if the traditional business can be done efficiently and if you have solution offerings like data analytics and AI (artificial intelligence) platforms, you will be able to differentiate from others.""
“To us (TCS), the question of digital offsetting the loss in traditional is not relevant because there is enough and more work available and hiring is just one indicator,"" said the executive cited above.
The June quarter net additions of the five firms is the highest in at least two years. They added 26,565 people to their workforce in the three months ended 30 June 2016. 
Although TCS does not provide a growth outlook, it is expected to cross 10% growth this fiscal. It managed an 8.6% dollar revenue growth to end last year with $19.09 billion in revenue. Ditto for Wipro, which ended last year with $8.06 billion in revenue. It expects to get at least $80 million or 1% growth this fiscal from the $1.6 billion contract.
“I’m not sure with this ‘little upswing’ we are seeing but the mood is definitely more bullish over the last couple of months,"" said Phil Fersht, chief executive officer of US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing research firm. His caution finds support from some industry executives.
“The biggest downside risk to this growth story is the uncertainty in the many of the first-of-its kind of projects,"" said the Cognizant executive cited before. “The work in areas like IP (intellectual property) platforms runs the risk of IP infringement cases. You are offering data analytics solutions when debate on data privacy is gaining traction. The promised benefits from automation will be tested. So, any incidental issue and this can blow up, making many clients hold back on spending in these areas."""

We try to get into the root cause of an issue and ensure that we can create capacity on the ground so that people can have a sustainable approach to dealing with the issue. We want to create impact in a way that we also empower communities,"" he says. Edited excerpts from an interview:
Learnings from four years of implementation: The learning has been to select NGOs with whom you partner very cautiously. The company also has to be willing to spend time with the NGOs so that it can constantly work together and monitor the progress, he says. It has to be a strong initiative with a strong involvement from the organisation. NGO can be counted on their reach and their ability to influence people at ground level, and their execution but whether the programme is achieving end results or not needs constant involvement and monitoring from the company. Also, we have learnt that engagements (in CSR) have to be long term.
Any need for course correction: No matter what you do, you need to have proper systems in place to measure the outcome and find out if over a longer period of time the life of the beneficiaries is getting impacted positively, says Mukherjee. It is difficult to measure this but as a company we have to help non profits to design surveys in a way that this data can be captured in order to evaluate and course correct the programmes.
I think we need more alignment of CSR programmes with what the business does. 
Social vs sustainable: We always think about programmes in a way that identify with the needs of society and also help the business. For example, we chose to work with STEM (Science Technology Engineering Mathematics) as a stream outside of India and even in India because this is related to business in way. The main asset in our business is talent and we must ensure that people who come out of institutes in India and outside are ready for the industry. This approach does not directly create profit for the business but it does create capacity and a pool of talent for the nation to draw on in the longer run.
The big picture: For the industry, it is a must that social welfare of the area where they operate out of is taken care of. Businesses, of course, exist to generate profit because without that being in business does not make sense but while you are doing business be aware of the community around and work for its well-being too, says Mukherjee. At the same time, (protecting the) environment and sustainability is important too. For us, even though we are an IT company, we know we are creating carbon since we run large data centres which consume a lot of power. That’s why we decided to reduce our carbon footprint. Most of our initiatives are mapped to SDGs. Among our programs dealing with eradication of poverty is one called Bridge IT with two partners. We aim to help the Dalit and SC/ST individuals who have some level of high school or college education through this. There are many people who are not getting jobs, or those who want to continue to live in and around certain villages. We give these youth laptops and teach them how to set up their own kiosks so that they can in turn help their community and help us with adult literacy programs around where they stay. They also end up creating their own revenue streams through this by becoming agents for banks etc. We handhold these students for two years, give them stipend etc in order to help them develop a sustainable livelihoods. This program created quite a few role models.
Basically we are also looking at areas in healthcare where technology can help because that is our focus.
Stakeholder feedback: In most programs, even the Bridge IT program, we stay in touch with our partner non-profits and the people who will be involved. When the first batch started we met some of the people in Kolkata and they had a lot of questions, they wanted to know how will this plan work etc. We have learned that unless you spend time in selecting the right people for these programs, they will not be successful. We also learned that everyone may not succeed, some may lose interest over a period. We took this as a learning and asked ourselves what could we have done better while selecting people.
Focus CSR speaks to CSR heads to find out how the space has evolved and what the next big steps could be."
269,2018-09-14,TCS,"Among IT stocks, TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra are up 20-53%, while Wipro is up 3%

Technology stocks have raced ahead of benchmark indices in 2018 after lagging them last year, as the Indian rupee weakens and the economic engines in the West roar back to life. An economic boom in developed nations implies greater outsourcing business for India’s information technology (IT) companies. Also, since these companies earn mostly in dollars, a weak rupee means greater revenues. The US economy grew 4.2% in the second quarter, while jobless claims hit a 49-year-low last week. Meanwhile, the rupee has slipped 11.51% against the dollar in 2018, touching a record low of 72.92 on Wednesday.

Also, since these companies earn mostly in dollars, a weak rupee means greater revenues. The US economy grew 4.2% in the second quarter, while jobless claims hit a 49-year-low last week. Meanwhile, the rupee has slipped 11.51% against the dollar in 2018, touching a record low of 72.92 on Wednesday.
In the year so far, the BSE IT index has gained nearly 40%, outpacing gains in the benchmark Sensex index which has gained around 10%. In 2017, even as the Sensex rose 27.91%, the BSE IT index gained only 10.83%, as revenues grew slower at large IT services companies. This is the best performance of the BSE IT index in the last five years. In 2016, it had slipped 8%, gained 4.26% in 2015, was up 17.6% in 2014 and jumped 55.24% in 2013.
According to Arun Thukral, MD & CEO of Axis Securities, the improving US economy has changed sentiments toward IT sector, which draws a large chunk of its business from the US. “Better profitability of US companies (a part of which could come from tax cuts) would mean better business prospects for Indian IT services. Similarly, Europe is also limping back to stability following the economic revival of the financial crisis-hit peripheral economies. This improvement in the business prospects of Indian IT companies has led to the re-rating of the IT sector in general,"" he added.
Among IT stocks, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd are up 20-53% while Wipro Ltd is up 3%. 
Thukral believes Indian IT firms have witnessed a revival of growth on the back of increased technology investments from clients in the US and Europe. “But these investments are in newer areas such as digital and cloud at the cost of traditional outsourcing, where budgets are shrinking. Hence, we like Indian IT companies who are increasing their revenue share from digital and cloud business,"" he added.
According to a Kotak Institutional Equities note dated 10 September, a 1% rupee depreciation aids earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin of IT firms by 20-30 basis points (bps) and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) by 2-3%. It has upgraded FY2019-21 earnings per share (EPS) by 0-7% but slashed its US dollar revenue growth assumptions due to cross-currency headwinds, stating FY2019 EPS will be influenced by hedges, and all companies will receive an earnings boost in the subsequent year. 
According to Kotak, even though the rupee has weakened, its impact on immediate earnings will be decided by hedging. Kotak said Infosys has minuscule cash flow hedges of $300 million; TCS hedges but through options, meaning it will realize the benefit of rupee depreciation unless the company has entered into range barrier options with the rupee depreciating beyond the range; Mindtree hedges only the monetary assets and does not have any cash flow hedges; and Tech Mahindra has hedged 70-90% of net cash inflow over the next 12-months. Wipro, HCL Technologies, Mphasis and Hexaware, it said, have hedged aggressively. “Infosys, TCS and Mindtree do not have meaningful cash flow hedges and will benefit immediately from Indian rupee depreciation,"" the Kotak note said. 
According to a Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd report, a weak rupee boosts net profits and operating margins of the entire IT sector; however, the impact on individual company earnings will be determined by three aspects -- the share of dollar revenue among all currencies; the extent of onsite-offshore revenue mix that will determine the net exposure after natural hedge; and the hedging policy in terms of duration and proportion of the net exposures hedged.
However, it added that had the rupee weakened similarly against all currencies, the impact would have been felt on the majority of the revenues. In the calendar year so far, the rupee has fallen 11.51% against the dollar, 8.03% against the pound and only 8.27% against the euro. 
“Bottoming cyclical pressures and improved capital allocation are factors that will feed into the valuation multiples favourably. Currency keeps earnings growth ticking further,"" Motilal said in its note on 10 September. 
However, Nomura said Indian Tier 1 IT valuations are at a 20% premium to that of multinational corporations (MNCs) and 15-25% discount to Tier 2 IT and challengers. “Indian Tier-1 IT, after progressively showing lower market share gains over the past three years, has lost market share to MNCs. Also, FY19 guidance suggests a weaker year, with Cognizant and HCL Tech guiding for slower organic growth in FY19 versus FY18, Infosys likely to grow near the lower end of guidance (similar to FY18) and Wipro expected to grow low-single digits for FY19, on our estimates. The only exception is TCS, where we expect growth to accelerate in FY19,"" it said in a note on 6 September."

New Delhi: The Reserve Bank has shortlisted five IT firms including Infosys and TCS for implementation of a centralised information and management system (CIMS) for seamless data collection and validations.
The central bank had invited of expression of interest (EOI) in July for identification of solution provider for implementation of CIMS by overhauling the Data Warehouse (DW) of the apex bank.
After evaluation of the responses, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said “it has been decided to shortlist"" five vendors for issuance of ‘Request for Proposal’ (RFP) for selection of vendor for CIMS development and implementation. The vendors are: Capgemini Technology Services India, IBM India, Infosys, Larsen & Toubro Infotech and Tata Consultancy Services.
The RBI had proposed a CIMS comprising of DW and Data Lake (DL) which would include, seamless data collection from regulated entities by creating system-to-system interface; system driven data validation and data review; flexible and scalable data repository and providing data dissemination platform.
The CIMS would also include centralised analytics platform to facilitate creation of RBI Data Sciences Lab.
The RBI, in April, had announced to gainfully harness the power of big data analytics by setting up a data sciences lab that will comprise experts and budding analysts, internal as well as lateral, who are trained inter alia in computer science, data analytics, statistics, economics, econometrics and/or finance.
One of the functional requirements for CIMS, as per the EOI, was establishing system-to-system interface for automated element based data collection from about 130 banks/entities.

New Delhi: The fate of 2.37 crore job aspirants who have applied for 1.6 lakh posts in Indian Railways in 2018 is uncertain as a public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed in Delhi High Court challenging the appointment of TCS iON by the railways for conducting the computer-based test (CBT). 
New Delhi: The fate of 2.37 crore job aspirants who have applied for 1.6 lakh posts in Indian Railways in 2018 is uncertain as a public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed in Delhi High Court challenging the appointment of TCS iON by the railways for conducting the computer-based test (CBT).
In his plea, petitioner Shailendra Sharma had alleged that the ministry of railways and the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB) had awarded the contract for conducting the computer-based recruitment test to TCS iON on nomination, instead of through a bidding process. By doing this, they had violated the norms and undermined the guidelines of the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), the petitioner added.
“The Central Vigilance Commission has repeatedly reiterated the need for transparency in the award of contracts by the government and its instrumentalities,"" the petition says.
In February, the Indian Railways had initiated the world’s biggest recruitment drive to fill around 1.6 lakh vacancies for posts like assistant loco pilots, technicians, gangmen, switchmen, trackmen, cabinmen, welders, helpers and porters in Group C and D. The recruitment exams started in August and will continue till October, while the result dates are yet to be announced. However, following the petition, uncertainty will prevail till Indian Railways gets a clean chit from the judiciary.
Queries sent by Mint to both Indian Railways and TCS iON remained unanswered. They refused to share details of the contract stating the matter was sub judice.
Three companies conduct online exams for government bodies and universities--TCS, SIFY and Prometric. Among these, TCS has been market leader for the last few years. The company conducts many exams like the Common Aptitude Test (CAT) and Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) among others.
Indian Railways entered into an MoU with TCS iON in 2015 for conducting online exams. In 2016-17, TCS won the contract to conduct the examinations after a bidding round organized by the Railways charging around  ₹ 100 per candidate (for the ones who appeared). In 2016-17 around 90 lakh applicants took the exam.
In February, the railways had floated a tender for empanelment of examination conducting agencies with a closing date of February 28. However, on February 22 it issued a public notice stating the date of submission of RFQ documents had been postponed and a fresh date would be notified. But on June 25 it discharged the tender without assigning any reasons through a public notice.
Talking to Mint, a senior railway official said, “Railways can justify the move. Under Rule 194 of General Financial Rules 2017, the government can select an entity by direct negotiation/nomination, on the lines of single tender mode under exceptional circumstance. For example such tasks that represent a natural continuation of previous work carried out by the firm or situations where only one consultant has the requisite expertise."" In case of TCS iON both the rules applied, he added.
The notice by the Delhi High Court was received by lawyer Jagjit Singh on behalf of the railways and the RRCB and the next date of hearing is fixed for December 10.
Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has described the recruitment drive as one of the NDA government’s biggest achievements. “Indian Railways has made its upcoming recruitment drive completely online, enhancing transparency and fairness in the process,"" he had tweeted."

New Delhi: Ankur Prakash, Wipro Ltd’s vice-president, manufacturing strategic business unit and Latin America, has resigned, marking the second senior management exit in as many months at the information technology (IT) company. Wipro’s healthcare and life sciences head Jeffrey Heenan Jalil put in his papers last month.
Wipro has entrusted Anand Padmanabhan, president and global head of strategic sales and geographies, with additional responsibility of overseeing the Latin American business. Communications head and president Milan Rao has been asked to oversee manufacturing.
Prakash, who was vice-president and chief operating officer for Latin America at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, was one of eight executives from Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, or TCS, to join Wipro after Abidali Neemuchwala took over as Wipro’s chief operating officer in April 2015. Subsequently, in February 2016, Neemuchwala was elevated as chief executive officer and executive director. 
Wipro’s manufacturing division—which clubs together the services offered to clients in the manufacturing space—posted revenues of $701 million, or 8.7% of its total income of $8.06 billion, in 2017-18.
Under Neemuchwala’s watch, Wipro’s senior leadership team had not witnessed any major change in management, barring the exit of Satishchandra Doreswamy, then chief business officer, in March 2016. 
Wipro recently appointed Harmeet Chauhan as the head of its industry and engineering services (IES) division. In April, the company set up IES, which comprises the $564 million product engineering services business, IoT practice and industry 4.0 vertical. 
A Wipro spokesperson confirmed the developments. “Ankur Prakash has resigned from the company after deciding to take a career break."" 
“Harmeet Chauhan has joined as senior vice-president and global head of IES. He comes with over 20 years of experience across products and engineering services, and, until recently, was a member of Aricent’s executive team as president , software and internet. He will report to Abidali Z. Neemuchwala,"" the spokesperson added."
263,2018-09-29,TCS,"From October 1, e-commerce companies will have to deduct 1% TCS before making payments to suppliers

New Delhi: E-commerce operators will have to register themselves in every state where their suppliers are located for collection of tax collected at source (TCS) and foreign companies can appoint an ‘agent’ on their behalf for securing such registration, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has said. From October 1, e-commerce companies will have to deduct 1% TCS before making payments to suppliers. 
New Delhi: E-commerce operators will have to register themselves in every state where their suppliers are located for collection of tax collected at source (TCS) and foreign companies can appoint an ‘agent’ on their behalf for securing such registration, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has said. From October 1, e-commerce companies will have to deduct 1% TCS before making payments to suppliers.
The CBIC has come out with a list of 29 FAQs, to answer industry queries on the modalities to be followed by e-commerce operators for deducting TCS.
E-commerce operators have to obtain separate registration for TCS irrespective of whether they are already registered under GST as a supplier or otherwise and have a GSTIN. The amount collected by the operator has to be paid to the government within 10 days after the end of the month in which the said amount was collected.
The CBIC said e-commerce companies, whether domestic or foreign, would have to register themselves in each state/union territory (UT) as the obligation for collecting TCS would be there for every intra-state or inter-state supply.
“In order to facilitate the obtaining of registration in each state / UT, the e-commerce operator may declare the head office as its place of business for obtaining registration in that state / UT where it does not have physical presence,"" the CBIC said.
In case of foreign e-commerce operators that do not have a place of business in India since they operate from outside but have suppliers and customers in the country, the CBIC said they would be liable to collect TCS on such supply and would be required to obtain registration in each state/UT.
“If the foreign e-commerce operator does not have physical presence in a particular State / UT, he may appoint an agent on his behalf,"" it added.
Clarifying on when e-commerce operators will have to collect tax at source, the CBIC said TCS is to be collected once supply has been made through the operator and where the business model is that the consideration is to be collected by the operator irrespective of the actual collection of the consideration.
Giving an example, the CBIC said if the supply has taken place through the e-commerce operator on 30 October, 2018, but the consideration for the same has been collected in the month of November, then TCS for such supply has to be collected and reported in the statement for the month of October 2018.
The CBIC said every operator will need to furnish a statement electronically, containing the details of outward supplies of goods or services effected through it, including the supplies of goods or services returned through it, and the amount collected by it as TCS during a month within 10 days after the end of the month in the GSTR-8 form.
The FAQ also defined e-commerce operator as any person who owns, operates or manages digital or electronic facility or platform for electronic commerce. E-commerce means the supply of goods or services or both, including digital products over digital or electronic network."

Mumbai: The past month’s worst performing emerging market currency is nearing a bottom, according to the head of global treasury at Asia’s largest software exporter Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. 
Mumbai: The past month’s worst performing emerging market currency is nearing a bottom, according to the head of global treasury at Asia’s largest software exporter Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.
The Indian rupee has dropped 3% over a month, the biggest slump among 24 emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg. It fell to a new record on Thursday and is inching closer to 74 against the dollar. The currency won’t drop much further with the Reserve Bank of India and government taking “adequate measures"" to arrest declines, T Venkatesan, TCS’s global treasury head, said in an interview at his office in Mumbai.
“I don’t see rupee breaching 74 against dollar. That should be the cap,"" Venkatesan said. “We are already close to the top of this move.""
India’s currency has declined for six straight months, prompting analysts at banks such as Barclays Plc. and Mizuho Bank Ltd. to predict a weakening past 74 per dollar by the end of the year. Weighing on the rupee are ever-higher oil prices and a current account deficit that makes India dependent on foreign inflows. Measures by the central bank and government - including raising import tariffs and easing some overseas borrowing norms - have as yet failed to revive the confidence of investors.
Given concerns around inflation and the currency, the central bank will probably raise interest rates 25 basis points on Friday, adding to two increases this year, according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.
The RBI will deliver at least two hikes in benchmark borrowing rates this year, estimated Venkatesan in the interview, adding that his views on the currency and rates were his own and not TCS’s. “If the Fed hikes, we should see another two hikes next year,"" he said.
TCS is a large investor in India’s bond markets with a little more than half of its  ₹ 47,700 crore ($6.5 billion) in cash reserves invested in government securities as of March 31, according to its annual report. The rest is spread over deposits, mutual funds and corporate debt.
The rupee traded 0.6% at 73.78 per dollar in noon trade on Thursday.
On the currency side, the company hedges its exposures for about two to three quarters ahead, Venkatesan said. “While in the short-run there are always pitfalls. But in the long-run, hedging is going to make you gain only."""
260,2018-10-05,TCS,"What's been different about the correction in the past few sessions is that market heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, TCS and the HDFC twins were also punished

Asian equities slipped on Thursday on worries that a stronger US economy will result in interest rate hikes, and make emerging market assets even less attractive for foreign investors. Investors in Indian equities have a lot more to worry about. Not that anything materially new has emerged in terms of information, but the liquidity squeeze has forced investors to finally acknowledge the cracks in the India story. For quite some time now, the markets have been afloat using either the “earnings aren’t growing, but the macro is great"" argument or its counterpart, “there are worries on the macro-economy, but earnings are growing"". 
Asian equities slipped on Thursday on worries that a stronger US economy will result in interest rate hikes, and make emerging market assets even less attractive for foreign investors. Investors in Indian equities have a lot more to worry about. Not that anything materially new has emerged in terms of information, but the liquidity squeeze has forced investors to finally acknowledge the cracks in the India story. For quite some time now, the markets have been afloat using either the “earnings aren’t growing, but the macro is great"" argument or its counterpart, “there are worries on the macro-economy, but earnings are growing"".
There is no place to hide now, with earnings being downgraded at the same time when macroeconomic worries, such as a widening current account deficit and the need to slow down the economy, are causing investors to flee. It’s the proverbial perfect storm.
The rupee hit a fresh low of 73.80 against the US dollar on Thursday, despite the government’s desperate measures to curb the currency’s free fall. In a double-whammy, the price of Brent crude rose to $86 per barrel. In short, the country’s current account deficit will worsen further.
Consequently, the yield on benchmark 10-year bonds hardened, adding to the panic in the equity market. Expectations that the Reserve Bank of India will adopt an aggressive monetary policy stance on Friday also eroded the risk appetite.
The fear gauge, National Stock Exchange’s India VIX (volatility index) rose 9.65% to an intraday high of 19.68. But it’s still far below its peak of 20.015 in February.
What’s been different about the correction in the past few sessions is that market heavyweights such as Reliance Industries Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and the HDFC twins were also punished. Earlier, a correction in other stocks would lead to a flight to safety in the above-mentioned counters. But this had resulted in bizarre valuations in sectors such as IT services and a few other stocks. As such, they were ripe for a correction. 
It’s interesting that the IT and pharmaceutical stocks were the biggest losers on Thursday, despite the continuing slide in the rupee. Finally, the markets seem to have given up silly props such as “buy shares of exporters whenever the rupee falls, regardless of where valuations are"".
Investors have also been forced to reckon with the fact that earnings are under pressure. Hopes of a revival in corporate earnings have dimmed, thanks to input cost pressures. Besides, worries of a liquidity crisis in the NBFC (non-banking financial company) sector still loom. Public sector banks are still struggling to get rid of their bad loan baggage. What’s more, subdued sales of automobiles in September could well mean that the consumption story is faltering.
While all of this has led to a much-needed reality check on Indian stocks, valuations of Indian equities remain expensive. As the chart shows, the one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of MSCI India Index is much higher than that of its Asian peers, excluding Japan. While the gap has narrowed a bit compared to early September, it remains wide. And the India VIX suggests there is a fair bit of complacency in the markets.
But given the rapidly deteriorating situation on the macroeconomic front, the downgrade in corporate earnings and the liquidity shock, it shouldn’t be surprising if the markets continue in correction mode."

258,2018-10-09,TCS,"Accenture added $4.72 billion in incremental revenue in the financial year ended August 2018, a shade lower than the combined $4.78 billion new revenue of TCS, Cognizant, Infosys, Wipro and HCL Tech

New Delhi: Accenture Plc reported 13.5% growth and added $4.72 billion in incremental revenue in the financial year ended August 2018, a shade lower than the combined $4.78 billion new revenue of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp, Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd. 
New Delhi: Accenture Plc reported 13.5% growth and added $4.72 billion in incremental revenue in the financial year ended August 2018, a shade lower than the combined $4.78 billion new revenue of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp, Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd.
Accenture’s scorching growth pace was underpinned by the firm’s aggressive acquisition strategy and the firm generating more business from technology areas that are seeing faster growth: digital, the fuzzy umbrella term which each company uses to classify revenue generated from areas generally classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud computing and Internet of Things.
Accenture claims that its new business, which comprises digital, cloud computing and cyber security, totalled $23 billion, or about 60% of its full-year revenue. Along with its strong consulting practice, Accenture managed to end the year with $39.57 billion in revenue.
Homegrown IT firms, for now, say that digital accounts for between 22% and 25% of their business.
Last year, Accenture spent $660 million in buying companies, less than the $1.8 billion it spent to buy companies in 2016-17. However, Accenture has again upped its acquisition spend in 2018-19.
“This year, we would expect to spend up to $1.5 billion, consistent with our capital allocation strategy. As always, given the right opportunities and the right circumstances, we could certainly spend more than that,"" Accenture’s Chief Financial Officer David Rowland told analysts after the company declared its earnings.
Accenture added 34,309 employees last year to take its total workforce to 459,178 people. Cognizant and the four big Indian IT firms added only 13,772 employees in 2017-18.
“We believe Accenture’s execution is best in class among IT service providers in our coverage. We think digital will continue to help drive strong revenue growth with slow and steady margin expansion over time,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 27 September.
Accenture firm follows a September-August financial year. Indian IT firms follow an April-March financial year while Nasdaq-listed Cognizant follows a January-December financial year.
Over the past three years, Accenture has spent $3.4 billion to buy 70 companies, considerably more than the $1.58 billion spent by TCS, Infosys and Wipro put together, since 1 April 2014.
Only twice earlier have two companies added more than $2 billion in new business in a year, according to a Mint analysis. In 2015, Cognizant had added $2.15 billion in incremental revenue, while Mumbai-based TCS added $2 billion in new business in the year ended March 2015.
In July, Mint reported that Accenture was on its way to script history by adding incremental revenue that would be about the new revenue generated by the five firms together. Save for Noida-based HCL Technologies, all IT companies reported single-digit growth in the year ended March 2018.
Still, homegrown IT firms expect better growth in the current financial year. TCS does not issue annual or quarterly guidance, but the management expects to report double-digit growth in the current financial year. Hiring for all the firms has also seen encouraging signs, as the top five software services providers operating in India added 24,047 people in the first quarter of this financial year, compared with the 13,772 net additions in the previous year, leading many experts to believe that the industry is set to record its fastest growth in three years."

New Delhi: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) kicked off the fiscal second-quarter earnings season by reporting its fastest sequential growth in revenue in more than three years.
Chief executive Rajesh Gopinathan exuded optimism that, save for any macroeconomic downside risk, the company will clock double-digit growth in revenue this fiscal.
“We have the numbers before us. I can say that we will have a double-digit growth this year,"" said Gopinathan, who took over as CEO in February last year.
In constant currency terms, the company’s September quarter revenue rose 3.7% from the preceding three months. It grew 11.5% from the figure a year earlier. Currency fluctuations, however, took some sheen off the company’s growth as dollar revenue grew at a slower 3.2% to $5.21 billion in the quarter ended 30 September, compared with the preceding three months.
“On year-on-year basis, the growth improved to 11.5% in organic constant currency terms. This is the highest growth in 12 quarters,"" HSBC analyst Yogesh Aggarwal said in a note to clients. “TCS’ Q2 is largely in line with our expectations"".
Net profit rose 3.4% to $1.1 billion from $1.08 billion in the preceding three months, while operating margin jumped 150 basis points to 26.5% from 25% in the April-June period, aided largely by a weaker rupee. One hundred basis points make up one percentage point.
A Bloomberg survey of 23 analysts had estimated a profit of  ₹  7,925.4 crore ($1.07 billion) on net sales of  ₹  36,470.4 crore ($4.92 billion).
TCS continued to bag large deals as it won $4.9 billion worth of deals in the September quarter. In the first quarter, the company won contracts worth $4.9 billion.
Clients spending more on TCS’s digital technology solution offerings helped increase its share of digital business, which surged 60% year-on-year (y-o-y)and accounted for $1.47 billion of total revenue in the September quarter.
The Mumbai-based company’s impressive performance in the July-September period came on the back of a strong 4.1% constant currency revenue growth in the first quarter. Encouragingly for its investors, the September quarter was the third straight double-digit increase in revenue for TCS. The company posted a 11.7% y-o-y dollar revenue growth in the January-March period, followed by a 10% y-o-y growth in both April-June and July-September quarters.
For the first time in three years, India’s largest software services provider is poised to outpace Nasscom’s industry growth projection of 7-9% in constant currency terms.
The US, which accounted for 51.1% of TCS’ Q2 revenue, and financial services, which constituted 31.2% of overall business, grew 8.1% and 6.1% y-o-y, respectively.
TCS ended the previous fiscal year with an 8.6% rise in revenue to $19.09 billion and a 24.8% operating margin, faster than the 6.2% in 2016-17, but its profitability was 90 basis points lower than the previous year’s 25.7%.
On Thursday, shares of TCS fell 3.1% to  ₹  1,979.75 on BSE, tracking a 2.19% drop in the benchmark Sensex to 34,001.15 points. The results were announced after market hours."

Delhi: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd’s chief executive officer Rajesh Gopinathan is a happy man. Since taking over as CEO in February last year, Mumbai-based TCS, under Gopinathan, with every quarter, has only improved, and in turn proved critics of the company and naysayers, including analysts and industry executives, wrong. TCS, which until December was struggling for growth, now expects to clock double-digit growth in the current financial year (TCS last reported 15% growth in 2014-15). 
Delhi: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd’s chief executive officer Rajesh Gopinathan is a happy man. Since taking over as CEO in February last year, Mumbai-based TCS, under Gopinathan, with every quarter, has only improved, and in turn proved critics of the company and naysayers, including analysts and industry executives, wrong. TCS, which until December was struggling for growth, now expects to clock double-digit growth in the current financial year (TCS last reported 15% growth in 2014-15).
On Thursday, TCS declares its second-quarter earnings. The company has won a good number of deals, and its management remains cheerful. Unsurprisingly, TCS should report a third consecutive good quarter. 
These are the five things to watch out for in TCS’s second-quarter earnings on 11 October:
1. Revenue growth and management commentary for the financial year: TCS is estimated to post a sequential dollar revenue growth of 3.3% in the July-September period, according to an analyst at brokerage JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd. This is higher than the 1.6% sequential growth recorded in the first quarter. Management commentary on the demand outlook for the six months of 2018-19, with the October-March period being tepid for IT services, will be crucial.
2. Performance in key industry segments: One wrinkle in TCS’s early stages of a turnaround has been modest growth in its banking and financial services industry, or BFSI, segment which accounted for 31% of the company’s total revenue. TCS reported 3.7% sequential constant currency growth in BFSI in the April-June quarter. Still, TCS’s larger rival, Accenture Plc reported 3% constant currency growth from its clients in the banking space in the June-August period (Accenture follows a September-August financial year). This weak performance could signal a worry as it possibly suggests that large banks are still not spending enough. For this reason, management commentary on demand from TCS’s banking clients will be eyed.
3. Growth in digital: TCS’s digital business grew 45% year-over-year in the first quarter and now accounts for 25% of the company’s revenue. Accenture still continues to see double-digit growth in its digital business, which constitutes about 60% of its total revenue. For this reason, TCS’s growth in the fast-growing digital business will be eyed by analysts to see how the company is making itself future-proof.
4. Update on Ignio: During the first quarter, TCS celebrated three years of its artificial intelligence (AI) platform Ignio. Ignio got $31 million in revenue last year. Agreed, this is tiny: TCS ended with $19.1 billion in revenue for the year ended March 2018. However, it is heartening to see a services-focused company earning business from products and platforms. TCS expects to generate over $100 million in revenue from Ignio by March 2020. Finally, homegrown IT services firms are looking to leverage their proprietary products and platforms to differentiate their service solution offerings, and for this reason, management commentary on Ignio will be significant. 
5. Impact of cross-currency and the rupee: During the first quarter, TCS reported 4.1% sequential constant currency revenue growth. The company’s dollar revenue growth was slower at 1.6%, implying a negative currency movement shaved 250 basis points off its business growth. Revenue growth at TCS, like its other peers, will again be hurt on account of currency movement, although the impact will be less than in the preceding quarter. A depreciating rupee will lift the company’s profitability."
255,2018-10-12,TCS,"TCS has grown about 20% in size compared to about two years ago, when it had last grown in double digits

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) reported a return to double-digit revenue growth after two years. Revenues grew 11.5% in the September quarter in constant currency terms, far higher than the 6.2% growth the company had reported just three quarters ago. True, the low base from last year has helped growth rates look better this year. And a pickup in growth rates has been priced in by investors for over nine months now; as far as investors go, it’s almost last year’s news. Even so, the sharp pickup in growth is commendable. TCS has grown about 20% in size compared to about two years ago, when it had last grown in double digits.  
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) reported a return to double-digit revenue growth after two years.

True, the low base from last year has helped growth rates look better this year. And a pickup in growth rates has been priced in by investors for over nine months now; as far as investors go, it’s almost last year’s news. Even so, the sharp pickup in growth is commendable. TCS has grown about 20% in size compared to about two years ago, when it had last grown in double digits. 
Needless to say, incremental revenues need to be much higher now to support the same level of growth. Besides, none of the company’s competitors based in India have reported a similar acceleration in growth. 
Of course, the big question is if growth rates will sustain. The company has said that it will end fiscal year 2019 (FY19) with double-digit growth, breaking the tradition of the last few years of not providing any guidance.
But that’s nothing to celebrate. Even if the company grew revenues by just 1% in each of the next two quarters, it will end up with revenue growth of 10% in FY19 in constant currency.
What really counts is if growth rates sustain at last quarter’s levels of 11-12% at least until next year. According to an analyst at a multinational brokerage firm, growth this year is being driven by very large platform deals TCS had won in FY18, and it seems like the company hasn’t won similar deals so far in FY19. As such, it remains to be seen if growth rates will sustain.
Note that despite the 12% correction in the share price, TCS still trades at more than 22 times estimated earnings for the 12 months till September 2019.
And even though last quarter’s revenue growth stood at a 10-quarter high, and margins reached a 14-quarter high thanks to the depreciation in the rupee, net profit growth stood at 22.5%. 
Earnings growth rates are expected to fall within a few quarters, since gains from the weaker rupee are typically reinvested in the business through pricing discounts or increased sales and marketing expenses. 
So it’s imperative that revenue growth rates sustain to justify the faith of investors. That may well be a tall order for TCS, which is already firing on all cylinders, with growth having picked up in all of the verticals it operates in. But just because investors have run ahead of themselves doesn’t mean that the company hasn’t been doing well."

253,2018-10-15,TCS,"This decision will make TCS the first home-grown IT company to disclose digital revenue as none of its peers, including Cognizant, disclose business from individual components of digital

Mumbai: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) will start outlining the business from some of the individual components it now calls digital, a top company executive said. Beginning next quarter, India’s largest information technology (IT) outsourcing company will also disclose revenue from cloud computing, data analytics and TCS Interactive, reflecting its confidence in monetizing business from these newer technologies. 
Mumbai: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) will start outlining the business from some of the individual components it now calls digital, a top company executive said. Beginning next quarter, India’s largest information technology (IT) outsourcing company will also disclose revenue from cloud computing, data analytics and TCS Interactive, reflecting its confidence in monetizing business from these newer technologies.
The decision also mirrors the recent trend which has seen companies like International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Accenture Plc disclose business from these newer technologies as they look to retain investor faith in the management’s efforts to make themselves future-ready.
“Today, we show you how much we make in geographies. We also share how much we make in industry segments like BFSI (banking financial services industry), retail etc. Now, very soon, we will share the service line breakup also. So, how much we are making in cloud, artificial intelligence, analytics, interactive,"" TCS chief operating officer N. Ganapathy Subramaniam said in an interview.
“Hopefully, from the next quarter onwards, we will start publishing it (business from individual components of digital technologies)"" said Subramaniam, who took over as COO in February 2017.
Subramaniam’s elevation followed TCS appointing Rajesh Gopinathan as chief executive officer, after his predecessor N. Chandrasekaran was named chairman of Tata Sons Ltd, the Tata group holding company.
The latest decision will make TCS the first home-grown IT firm to disclose business revenue from digital technologies, as none of the IT firms, including Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp, disclose business from individual components of digital.
Bengaluru-based Wipro Ltd only discloses business from data analytics in addition to outlining business from digital. For now, digital accounts for 23-28% of total revenue at the largest IT firms.
To be sure, TCS until March 2017 used to share business from some of the technology areas which are now called as legacy technologies as they are getting commoditized. These included service lines like application development, infrastructure maintenance and back-office services. In FY17, TCS’s share of the digital business was 16.7% or about $2.93 billion.
Over the last 15 months, TCS claims its digital business has grown at a scorching pace. In the July-September period, its digital technologies grew 60% year-on-year and accounted for 28% or $1.47 billion. This implies that digital revenue in a quarter is what the company generated over six months in 2016-17.
Some industry executives gave their thumbs-up to the move.
“I very much welcome TCS sharing greater details with regarding ‘digital’ revenue, as all the providers are loosely slapping the ‘digital’ tag of any contract that didn’t involve moving hardware around,"" said Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing-research firm. “In fact, I would go as far as declaring the term ‘digital’ as largely meaningless today, so being able to badge revenue as AI, analytics, cloud, and interactive is much more relevant and meaningful. I hope the other Indian leaders to follow suit and stop sugar-frosting everything.""
Subramaniam added: “Please understand that when there was widespread scepticism about IT industry a couple of quarters back, we made a bold statement that there are no legacy people but only legacy technologies. We started re-skilling our people and started investing in technologies. We then decided we have to come back to double-digit growth, and the whole organisation rallied behind this. Today, we are proud of having secured double-digit growth.""

TCS, on the back of 1.6% and 3.2% sequential dollar revenue growth in the first and second quarters respectively, will see full-year dollar revenue growth of 9.25% if it grows 1% in both the third and fourth quarters. For now, the management has said that the company will surely clock a double-digit growth in constant currency terms in the current financial year."
252,2018-10-16,TCS,"Infosys's net profit rose 0.5% to $581 million in the September quarter from $578 million in the preceding three months

New Delhi: Infosys Ltd posted a surprise 3.2% dollar revenue growth in the September quarter (Q2) from the preceding three months, the fastest sequential growth by India’s second-largest information technology (IT) services company in more than a year. 
New Delhi: Infosys Ltd posted a surprise 3.2% dollar revenue growth in the September quarter (Q2) from the preceding three months, the fastest sequential growth by India’s second-largest information technology (IT) services company in more than a year.
In constant currency terms, Infosys’s Q2 revenue rose 4.2% from the preceding three months. Currency fluctuations, however, took some sheen off the company’s growth as dollar revenue increased at a slower pace to $2.92 billion in the quarter ended 30 September. Infosys last posted a 3.2% sequential dollar revenue growth in the June quarter of 2017.
Net profit rose 0.5% to $581 million in the September quarter from $578 million in the preceding three months. Operating margin was 23.7%, same as in the June quarter.
A Bloomberg survey of 23 analysts had estimated  ₹ 4,048.5 crore ($548.4 million) profit on net sales of  ₹ 20,318.6 crore ($2.75 billion).
Infosys’s better-than-expected performance was largely helped by a 4.7% sequential growth from clients in the financial services space, which contributed to 32.2% of revenue. A 4.9% increase in business from retail clients, accounting for about 17% of revenue, also helped the company. For the first time in its history, Infosys won over $2 billion in new deals in a quarter.
“Both TCS and Infosys have done well in the second quarter. But TCS has the edge over Infosys as they have been reporting a double-digit, year-on-year growth for three straight quarters. But a $2 billion in deal wins is encouraging,"" a Mumbai-based analyst at a foreign brokerage said on condition of anonymity.
Infosys still faces challenges. Despite its performance in the second quarter and a weakening rupee, it has maintained its full-year operating margin between 22% and 24% and expects revenue to grow between 6% and 8% in constant currency terms. The company does not give a dollar revenue outlook, but it runs the risk of growing at the slowest pace in three years. Infosys reported a 0.9% sequential dollar revenue growth in the first quarter. Business growth is typically slower in the second half of the year for Indian IT firms, and even if Infosys manages to grow revenue by 1% in the third and fourth quarters, it will end the current financial year with 6.8% dollar revenue growth, according to Mint analysis.
Infosys’s year-on-year growth continues to be sluggish. In contrast, TCS—which last week posted a 3.2% sequential dollar revenue increase in the second quarter—has managed a double-digit year-on-year growth for three straight quarters.
Infosys also continues to struggle to retain people. Its attrition was 22.2% at the end of September quarter, a tad better than the 23% at the end of June quarter, but considerably higher than its peers (TCS’s attrition was 10.9% at the end of September quarter).

“EBIT margins were at 23.75% vs consensus expectation of 24.5% in 2Q19. Margins were flattish vs 1Q19 despite absence of visa costs, wage inflation and most important INR depreciation,"" HSBC analyst Yogesh Aggarwal said in a note to clients.
On Tuesday, Infosys shares declined 0.39%, or  ₹ 2.70, to  ₹ 696.40 on the BSE, while the benchmark Sensex gained 0.85%, or 297.38 points, to end the day at 35,162.48. Infosys Q2 results were announced after the end of trading in Mumbai.
Infosys also decided to pay its former chief financial officer, Rajiv Bansal,  ₹ 13.58 crore in outstanding severance payments, including interest, after an arbitration panel last month directed the company to pay the money.
“The company has received legal advice and will comply with the award and make the necessary payments,"" Infosys said in a press release."
251,2018-10-17,TCS,"Since Infosys still lags TCS by a wide margin in terms of revenue growth, the strategy to sacrifice margins for growth may be a sensible one

First, the good news: Infosys Ltd’s revenue growth in the September quarter (Q2) was its highest in the past eight quarters. In constant currency terms, i.e. after eliminating the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, revenues grew 8.1% year-on-year in Q2, much better than the average growth of 5-6% in the preceding four quarters. Now, the bad news: the company’s operating profit margin is at a 20-quarter low. And although the rupee has depreciated by over 11% in the past six months, Infosys is continuing to guide for margins of between 22 %and 24% for the full year, the same levels it had forecasted back in April.

This is not how things were supposed to go. The sharp depreciation in the rupee was expected to boost profit margins at least in the near term. Last week, the company’s chief competitor, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), reported a 150 basis points improvement in margins sequentially. Its margins reached a 14-quarter high, boosted by the decline in the rupee.
Infosys, on the other hand, has been forced to hand over the gains from the currency to employees and sub-contractors, to support growth and rein in employee attrition. In the second half of the year, the company plans to step up investments to capitalize on opportunities in digital services, which will put a lid on margins as well.

Since Infosys still lags TCS by a wide margin in terms of revenue growth, the strategy to sacrifice margins for growth may be a sensible one, unless it has struck large deals that entail low margins for some time to come. The company’s revenues were considerably ahead of the Street’s estimates. Besides, it announced deal wins worth over $2 billion, the highest ever for a single quarter, and nearly double the levels it reported in Q1. While this is nothing to sneeze at, the fact remains that expectations have been running high with IT stocks, including Infosys, which has outperformed the Nifty 500 index by about 40% this year. 
In that backdrop, investors will be disappointed that the higher-than-expected increase in revenue growth is not translating into higher earnings growth. Infosys’s net profit grew by 10.3% year-on-year in Q2, less than half the rate at which TCS’s net profit rose.
Of course, one can argue that Infosys also trades at a lower price-earnings multiple of 19 times estimated FY19 earnings, compared to TCS’s valuation of 23 times earnings. But given the large differential in earnings growth rates between the two companies, investors now need to consider if the valuation discount is wide enough."
250,2018-10-19,TCS,"In the July-September period, TCS got $2.07 billion in business from the BFSI sector as compared to Accenture's $2.01 billion in the June-August period

New Delhi: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd’s quarterly earnings from the financial sector have edged past that of Accenture Plc, which is nearly double its size, making the Mumbai-based company the world’s largest pure-play information technology (IT) and consulting firm servicing mega banks and insurers. 
New Delhi: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd’s quarterly earnings from the financial sector have edged past that of Accenture Plc, which is nearly double its size, making the Mumbai-based company the world’s largest pure-play information technology (IT) and consulting firm servicing mega banks and insurers.
Financial services sector is the largest buyer of services and solutions from IT and consulting firms, and in the last decade, Accenture has managed to retain its sectoral dominance.
During the July-September period, TCS got $2.07 billion in business from banking, financial services and insurance, or the BFSI sector. This included $1.63 billion from work across application development and maintenance, and other traditional solution offerings, besides $445.9 million from its proprietary platforms such as TCS BaNCS.
Accenture, which follows a September-August financial year, got $2.01 billion in business from banking and insurance customers in the June-August period.
Put another way, TCS’s BFSI vertical, if carved out as an independent unit, will be larger than India’s third largest IT services firm, HCL Technologies Ltd, which ended with $2.05 billion in revenue in the April-June quarter.
“In the last quarter, we became the number one pure-play IT services firm servicing the banking and financial services sector across the world,"" TCS’s chief operating officer, N. Ganapathy Subramaniam, said in an interview last week. “This is very heartening to see we are doing well, and the way we are shaping the industry.""
TCS ended with $5.21 billion in revenue in the September quarter, recording 10% growth, while Accenture ended with $10.1 billion in the August quarter, up 11% from the year-ago period. However, TCS’s BFSI vertical saw 9.3% year-on-year growth, while Accenture managed just about 3.1% growth in the latest quarter.
TCS overtaking Accenture is largely on account of the two mega (over $1 billion multi-year IT) contracts, including an over $2 billion, 10-year contract with Transamerica Life Insurance Co., a unit of Dutch insurer Aegon NV, and a $1.36 billion, 10-year contract from a unit of British insurer Prudential Plc. Both contracts saw TCS deploying its BaNCS platform. Expectedly, TCS’s platforms business reported a 26.65% jump in revenue in the September quarter from the year-ago period.
“TCS’s Business 4.0, Digital, Machine First Delivery Model, cybersecurity solutions and the BFSI specific offerings have combined to take them over the top,"" said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm. “This is seen in the number of $50 million clients added in the financial sector by TCS.""
During the September quarter, both TCS and its rival Infosys Ltd reported an impressive growth in demand from clients in the financial space, making one analyst conclude that the industry is seeing an uptick in demand.
“We think growth in both INFY (Infosys) and TCS’s financial services vertical indicates that the industry is rebounding, but we continue to believe that CTSH (Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.) has a weak financial services client mix, and thus we do not think it will rebound to the same extent as competitors,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 October.
Still, it is sketchy for now if TCS is winning at the expense of smaller competitors or if it is the beneficiary of renewed spending on technology from some of the largest banks as over the last few years, many banks had put their tech spends on hold.
Wang of Constellation believes that TCS’s faster growth in the last 12 months is both on account of the company benefitting from new tech spend in digital areas by banks and the company displacing a few incumbent vendors."

The H-1B visas are the most sought-after among Indian IT professionals. The visa programme allows employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in the US on a non-immigrant basis in specialty occupations or as fashion models of distinguished merit and ability.
London-headquartered Earnest and Young, a multinational professional services firm, has emerged as the top employer to have received the certification.
In fact, Ernest and Young with 151,164 H-1B specialist occupation labour certifications accounted for the 12.4% of all foreign labour certification for the H-1B work visas for the fiscal year 2018 ending on September 30, according to the latest annual report released by the Department of Labour early this month.
Ernest and Young is followed by Deloitte Consulting which received 69,869 H-1B specialty occupations labour conditions programme. Cognizant Technology Corp comes at number three with 47,732 specialty occupations labour conditions programme, the Department of Labour said in its latest annual report.

According to Department of labour, a specialty occupation requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of specialised knowledge and a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent in the specific specialty (e.g. sciences, medicine, health care, education, biotechnology, and business specialties, etc.).
Congress has limited the annual number of qualifying foreign workers who may be issued a visa or otherwise be provided the H-1B status to 65,000 with an additional 20,000 under the H-1B advanced degree exemption. Before applying for the H-1B visas the employer submits a labour condition application to the Department of labour.

247,2018-10-24,TCS,"HCL Technologies is exuding optimism about revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal, but it remains to be seen how much that helps in narrowing the valuation gap with TCS and Infosys

One reason why HCL Technologies Ltd remained on the investor radar, despite delivering subdued quarterly performances in the recent past, is its valuation discount vis-à-vis larger peers Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd. At around 13 times current fiscal earnings estimates, the stock is trading at a considerable discount to the 23 times earnings of TCS and Infosys’s 18 times earnings. The valuation discount reflects subdued expectations and the Q2 results may not alter this in a major way. 
One reason why HCL Technologies Ltd remained on the investor radar, despite delivering subdued quarterly performances in the recent past, is its valuation discount vis-à-vis larger peers Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd. At around 13 times current fiscal earnings estimates, the stock is trading at a considerable discount to the 23 times earnings of TCS and Infosys’s 18 times earnings. The valuation discount reflects subdued expectations and the Q2 results may not alter this in a major way.
The results do show an improvement in growth but only incrementally. From a year ago, revenues in constant currency terms increased 10.5% compared to 8-8.5% in the earlier two quarters. On a sequential basis, they are up 3%, largely in line with Street expectations. Profitability has improved.
Importantly, the management expects revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year to be better than what the company delivered in the first half, helping it achieve the mid-point of its objective of 10.5% constant currency growth for the full year. Deal momentum remains healthy.
The commentary is encouraging. The question, however is, will it help narrow the valuation gap with its larger peers? There is some scepticism about that.
What set TCS apart, accelerating gains in its stock, is a broad-based recovery. HCL Tech has seen incremental improvement in growth rates at key service segments. But much of the growth came from the engineering and R&D and business services, which generate less than 30% of revenues.
Growth at the application and infrastructure services businesses, which generate 70% of HCL Tech’s revenues, remains sub-par. Revenues at the application services business (which generates more than a third of revenues) are up just 1.8%. The management attributed the subdued growth to client-specific issues.
That said, HCL Tech’s Q2 results shows a notable improvement in the infrastructure services business—it grew 4.4% compared to 2% in the first quarter. The management sees a healthy outlook for this segment, which adds credence to a better second half vis-à-vis the first half of the fiscal year. It also expects the momentum in the engineering and R&D and business services continuing, which should aid growth.
The question is how much growth acceleration the company can see in the second half of the year. The Q2 results show incremental improvement in growth rates, widely expected by the market. But it is not yet clear if growth will exceed the previous year’s level, which is crucial for the stock re-rating. The third quarter results should provide more cues."

In the trade-off between profitability and growth, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. has always favoured the latter, except in the past two years. This was after activist investor Elliott Management Corp. questioned the company’s “growth-at-all-costs-mindset"" in late 2016. The company took some of Elliott’s suggestions on board, and ended up improving profit margins by about 200 basis points in the past two years. The improvement in profit margins meant that Cognizant’s earnings were growing ahead of peers, most of who were reporting a decline in margins.

The company took some of Elliott’s suggestions on board, and ended up improving profit margins by about 200 basis points in the past two years. The improvement in profit margins meant that Cognizant’s earnings were growing ahead of peers, most of who were reporting a decline in margins."

Mumbai: The abrupt sacking of Cyrus Mistry as the chairman and director, respectively, of Tata Sons and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) violated provisions of the Companies Act, RBI rules and more importantly, Tatas’ own Articles of Association, Registrar of Companies (RoC), Mumbai, said in an RTI reply. 
Mumbai: The abrupt sacking of Cyrus Mistry as the chairman and director, respectively, of Tata Sons and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) violated provisions of the Companies Act, RBI rules and more importantly, Tatas’ own Articles of Association, Registrar of Companies (RoC), Mumbai, said in an RTI reply.
The right to information (RTI) reply, given by Uday Khomane, assistant RoC, Mumbai, on October 3, is in response to a RTI request filed by the investment arms of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group on 31 August.
The reply said the way Mistry was removed from the chairmanship of Tats Sons and also as the director of TCS, violated the relevant legal provisions under the Companies Act, 2013; the Reserve Bank rules governing non-banking financial companies (NBFCs); and more importantly, the rule 118 of the Articles of Association of Tata Sons, the parent of the diversified Tata group,registered as an NBFC with the monetary authority.
A Tata Sons spokesman refused to offer detailed comments on the questions sent by PTI, saying, “We do not wish to comment on the matter as the matter is sub-judice.""
PTI has seen a copy of the RTI reply, which is based on the assessment of the documents furnished by the Tatas in the aftermath of the boardroom coup on 24 October 2016, dismissing Mistry as the group chairman.
The report offers an internal view of the RoC, opposite to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai, earlier this year, while dismissing the petition filed by Mistry challenging his dismissal from the group.
In a boardroom coup, Mistry was sacked as the chairman of Tata Sons on 24 October 2016, two months short of four years in the corner room of the Bombay House.
Mistry, whose family is the single largest non-Tata shareholder with 18.4% stake in Tata Sons, was nudged to take over the reins of the $103-billion group as the second non-Tata chairman, after Nowroji Saklatwala(1934-38), in December 2012, after group patriarch Ratan Tata retired.
Mistry was removed as TCS director with 93.11% votes at the EGM held on 13 December 2016, according to company secretaries Parikh & Associates, which cited section 169(2) of the Companies Act 2013 with Aection 115 and 100 (2)(a) for his removal.
But TCS did not send out the complete representation of Mistry to all shareholders, which violates Section 169 (4)(b) of the Companies Act, according to the RoC reply.
The RTI reply is based on the queries posed by SP Kumar, western regional director, RoC, Mumbai which found that Tata Sons violated rule 118 of its articles of its Articles of Association, when it removed Mistry.
The report, exclusively available with PTI, states that “Article 118 of the Articles of Association of Tata Sons prescribes that its chairman can be removed in the same process as specified for his appointment i.e. by the selection committee consisting of four persons and based on such recommendation of the removal committee only the board is empowered to remove its chairman"".
It goes on to add that Tata Sons “being an NBFC duly registered with the RBI, any management change required prior approval of the RBI"", which was also not complied with.
The reply also cited several irregularities pertaining to the 13 December 2016 EGM convened by TCS to remove Mistry as a director from its board.
TCS had adopted a letter written by the company secretary and chief operating officer of Tata Sons on 9 November 2016 as a special resolution notice to sack Mistry.
The reply noted that this letter from Tata Sons was sent to TCS without any proof of a board resolution authorising the issuance of such a letter. The report also states that “it appears prima facie that there was no proper ‘special notice’ received"" by TCS.
The RoC also said that the TCS’ company secretary thereafter “on his own"" forwarded the purported special notice from Tata Sons dated 9 November 2016 to Mistry.
Additionally, TCS had also failed to send out the complete shareholder representation of Mistry to all shareholders, “in violation of section 169(4)(b) of the Companies Act"", and hence “the consequential resolution of EGM dated 13 December 2016 for the removal of Mistry would also be void"".
The RoC, Mumbai, in a letter dated 25 January 2017 had written to the regional director of the corporate affairs ministry highlighting these concerns. “As the verification of the relevant documents further finds that the company has violated the provisions of the Companies Act, and rules there under, I am referring the matter to the regional director to verify the findings in terms of rule 11(2) of the Companies (registration offices and fees) rules of 2014,"" according to the letter.
In the reply, SP Kumar, RoC, Mumbai, in a letter dated 17 February, stated: “RoC having come to the conclusion that transactions are void [Annexure C point (1) to (4)] has to express in unequivocal words whether the e-form is to be rejected or e-form or document as the case may be, as invalid in the electronic record in terms of rule 10(4) of Companies (Registration Offices and Fees) Rules, 2014.""However, it is unclear what further action the ministry took on these observations, it noted.
Mistry and his elder brother Shapoor Mistry, through their investment companies, are the single largest non-Tata shareholder in Tata Sons with 18.4%. The group’s investment companies are currently waging a legal battle against Tata Sons in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal alleging oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement at Tata Sons.

243,2018-11-01,TCS,"TCS, Infosys, HCL, Wipro and Tech Mahindra stand to make over $1 billion in 2019-2021, says report

New Delhi: The planned rollout of 5G or fifth-generation wireless technology by telecom companies globally offers at least $10 billion business over the next six years for India’s information technology (IT) services companies, according to a Mumbai-based brokerage firm. This new technology spend by telecom firms on software and services could bring over $1.1 billion in incremental revenue over the next three years for country’s five largest companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd. 
New Delhi: The planned rollout of 5G or fifth-generation wireless technology by telecom companies globally offers at least $10 billion business over the next six years for India’s information technology (IT) services companies, according to a Mumbai-based brokerage firm. This new technology spend by telecom firms on software and services could bring over $1.1 billion in incremental revenue over the next three years for country’s five largest companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd.
This development is significant as telecom firms over the last two years had held back their spend on technology, leading to tepid growth at telecom verticals for all IT firms. A new gusher of money should further boost growth for the five largest IT firms, which share among themselves about 30% of homegrown IT companies’ business from telecom companies. 
“The impending rollout of 5G networks by telecom service providers (TSPs) globally could translate to a USD 10bn incremental market opportunity – implying a 1 ppt addition to the overall industry CAGR – over 2019-25 for the Indian IT companies, on our conservative estimates,"" Pankaj Kapoor, director of India IT services and software equity research at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, wrote in a note dated 29 October.
Homegrown IT firms got $5.4 in business during 2014-16 when telecom companies set up the 4G infrastructure and Kapoor of JM Financial estimates a higher spend of over $10 billion, although over a much longer period of six years.
The world’s largest telecom firms are looking to give a face-lift to the current 4G infrastructure as newer technologies allow them to send billions of bits of data a second, higher than the current hundreds of millions of bits of data. This, in addition to letting a consumer download a movie in seconds, also allows autonomous cars and industrial equipment to work better as they need this network of ultra-fast speeds for relaying data sets.
For now, executives at some of the largest IT firms remain optimistic on the new technology spend and maintain that much of the incremental revenue will come in from the second half of the next financial year. 
A big reason behind the optimism of Indian IT companies from this rollout of 5G infrastructure by telecom firms are some of the recent mega-IT contracts awarded to set up hardware. In July, US-based T-Mobile awarded a $3.5 billion contract to Nokia to supply 5G network gear. This was followed by T-Mobile awarding another $3.5 billion contract to Ericsson in September, under which Ericsson will offer both hardware and software to the US telecom major.
“All telecom firms first set up the hardware and software and then work for the services needed to run them. Now the contracts may not be this large but then with newer technologies needed for 5G, many of us (Indian IT firms) have the chance to offer IoT (Internet of Things) platforms, data analytics solutions and other work as part of managing the network,"" said an executive at Mumbai-based TCS. The executive did not want to be named as he is not authorized to talk to the media. 
“Recent commentaries by major operators indicate selective commercial launches could start as early as 2019, though a wider global coverage is likely to be spread over 2020-22… The biggest commercial use-case of 5G is likely to be around narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) that could open an additional market for Indian ER&D/IT services players. While the timing of project flows is difficult to predict, conservatively, we see a meaningful financial impact of 5G on Indian IT companies only from 2HFY20,"" wrote Kapoor in the note."
242,2018-11-02,TCS,"W12 Studios will be part of TCS Interactive, further strengthening that already impressive array of creative and experience services it offers

New Delhi: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) on Thursday said it has acquired London-based design firm, W12 Studios, the first acquisition of India’s largest information technology (IT) services company in about four years. The deal underscores TCS’s growing confidence in its newest offering, the TCS Interactive digital design arm, to scale up revenue from this fast-growing business. 
New Delhi: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) on Thursday said it has acquired London-based design firm, W12 Studios, the first acquisition of India’s largest information technology (IT) services company in about four years. The deal underscores TCS’s growing confidence in its newest offering, the TCS Interactive digital design arm, to scale up revenue from this fast-growing business.
The move by TCS mirrors the approach of Accenture Plc, which in less than a decade has built the digital design business into more than $7.8 billion in revenue, according to Mint estimates.
The acquisition also signifies that TCS is open to acquisitions instead of only building technologies and talent in-house. The company last invested $50 million in a joint venture with Mitsubishi Corp. in Japan in 2014.
TCS said on Thursday that W12 Studios was founded in 2012 and has about 50 people. The company did not disclose the financial details of the acquisition.
“W12 Studios will be part of TCS Interactive, further strengthening that already impressive array of creative and experience services it offers,"" the Mumbai-based company said in a statement. 
TCS is also India’s first IT firm to establish a dedicated marketing services arm, under TCS Interactive. 
“We acquired a small company in Santa Clara some years back, which had a studio and core digital skills. Having acquired that company, we started building capabilities around it, and now have digital interactive, which is helping us offer solutions to clients which look at what is called as ‘re-imaging the future,"" TCS’s chief operating officer N. Ganapathy Subramaniam said in an interview last month, when asked on the rationale behind setting up TCS Interactive.
TCS acquired Brightfon Inc., a Santa Clara-based firm in 2010.
Subramaniam declined to share details, including revenue of TCS Interactive.
He however said it is a relatively new entrant compared with Accenture, which started this business in 2009.
“Accenture has built a very huge business (around Accenture Interactive). We are a new entrant, if I can say. Now, very soon, we will share the service line breakup also. So, how much we are making in cloud, artificial intelligence, analytics, interactive. Hopefully, from the next quarter onwards, we will start publishing it,"" said Subramaniam.
The rationale behind Accenture, Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions and now TCS setting up TCS Interactive or marketing services arms underscores how these IT firms are looking to grab a bigger slice of marketers’ advertising budgets away from traditional advertising firms.
Interactive is coming to play an important part of digital strategy of large IT outsourcing firms, which still continue to generate much of their revenue from managing IT infrastructure or from software engineers writing code for applications that help their clients run their business. Many of the world’s largest companies are moving their ad dollars from traditional media, such as print, to the web, pushing more IT firms to chase the opportunity in the digital world.
Digital accounted for 28% or $1.46 billion of TCS’s $5.2 billion revenue in the July-September period.
“TCS Interactive is a direct competitive play to offer large enterprises an alternative to Accenture,"" said Phil Fersht, chief executive of US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing-research firm. 
“In my view, TCS will be one of the three most aggressive competitors to Accenture in the digital space over the next three years.""
Earlier this year, Accenture, which follows the September-August financial year, told investors that Accenture Interactive generated $6.5 billion in revenue for the year ended August 2017.
Last month, the management said revenue at Accenture Interactive, which employed 25,000 people, grew more than 20%."

240,2018-11-06,TCS,"TCs is set to go on trial Monday in California over racial discrimination claims by American workers who lost their jobs at TCS offices in the US because they hadn't been assigned to any of its clients

San Francisco: India’s IT outsourcing giant Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. needs to offer a good explanation for why engineers hired at its American outposts are 13 times as likely to be fired if they’re not South Asian. The company is set to go on trial Monday in California over racial discrimination claims by American workers who lost their jobs at TCS offices in the U.S. because they hadn’t been assigned to any of its clients. 
San Francisco: India’s IT outsourcing giant Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. needs to offer a good explanation for why engineers hired at its American outposts are 13 times as likely to be fired if they’re not South Asian. The company is set to go on trial Monday in California over racial discrimination claims by American workers who lost their jobs at TCS offices in the U.S. because they hadn’t been assigned to any of its clients.
The trial will cast a spotlight on work-visa programs companies use to bring overseas workers to the U.S., a practice President Donald Trump has criticized in his protectionist push. TCS, Asia’s largest outsourcer, and rival Indian information technology staffing firms Infosys Ltd. and Wipro Ltd. have all been squeezed by the Trump administration to hire more Americans on U.S. soil.
Mumbai-based TCS denies any unlawful bias in its U.S. operations and says in court filings that the Caucasian American leading the lawsuit was removed from one of its projects and ultimately terminated over “performance concerns."" TCS said it can’t comment specifically on the pending litigation, but believes it has a strong case and will prevail at trial.
“Our success is based on our ability to provide the best talent available, both in the US and globally, based purely on the individual’s specialized experience, skills and fit for each client’s specific needs,"" a company spokesman said. “TCS also strictly adheres to all federal and state equal employment opportunity laws and regulations.""
The jury is expected to be shown statistical evidence that the odds of race and national origin not being a factor in TCS’s termination decisions are less than one in a billion. That’s because, since 2011, the company fired 12.6 percent of its non-South Asian workers in the U.S., compared with less than 1 percent of its South Asian employees, according to the complaint.
A unit of the Tata Group, India’s largest industrial conglomerate, TCS employs more than 400,000 people worldwide, is valued at about $100 billion and posted revenue of $19 billion for the fiscal year that ended in March. Most of its revenue comes from the U.S. and its primary customers are in the financial services sector.
Still, these are challenging times for the company that pioneered the India tech services model five decades ago. The outsourcing industry barreled along at 20 percent-plus growth with little trouble until recently, but easy deals are now gone and customers are looking for price cuts. TCS Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Gopinathan said in a May interview that the industry needs to adapt to seize bigger opportunities than ever.
While TCS has won awards as a top employer in North America, the lawsuit paints a different picture. The case was brought as a class action on behalf of about 1,000 non-South Asians -- most of them U.S. citizens -- who were fired by TCS while on “benched"" status, meaning they were laid off by the company while they were between job assignments.
The plaintiffs allege TCS has engaged in a “systematic pattern and practice of discrimination"" by favoring Indian ex-pats and visa-ready workers from India for U.S. positions. That has resulted in a workforce that’s almost 80 percent South Asian, far greater than the 12 percent representation of South Asians in the U.S. IT workforce, according to the complaint.
Daniel Kotchen, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the aim of the litigation is to stop outsourcing firms from violating U.S. anti-discrimination laws. Kotchen’s firm is suing a half dozen other outsourcing firms over alleged discrimination, including Infosys and Wipro.
“The U.S. has the world’s strongest economy,"" he said. “Foreign corporations that seek to profit from our economic strength have to respect the law of our land.’’
Kotchen said he couldn’t estimate damages the jury may award if it finds that TCS violated U.S. civil rights law. He’s also seeking a court order requiring the company to adopt non-discriminatory practices.
U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland scaled back the case to focus only on allegations about bias in firings, after concluding there was insufficient evidence to back up the claim that TCS discriminated against non-South Asian job applicants. The trial is slated to take about 18 days.
The case is Buchanan v. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., 15-cv-01696, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).

“Despite recent underperformance, these risks remain for Indian equity market.

HSBC analysts said MSCI India EPS (earnings per share) growth consensus expectations are for 18.8% in 2018 and 24% in 2019, which means India is one of the fastest growing markets across the region.
However, five stocks—State Bank of India, Reliance Industries Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd—account for nearly half of all 2019 earnings growth, they said, expressing concerns that they estimate 65% market-cap weighted average earnings growth for these five stocks.
Against this background of high growth and the much-anticipated rate hikes, India’s valuation now appears fair and almost in line with the five-year average 12-month forward PE (price to earnings), they said, adding that it was still far from cheap as India trades at 17.4 times whereas MSCI AxJ trades at 11 times.
“Meanwhile, investors’ weights in India are now at historically low levels and there is an opportunity to add to this. In the past, elections have tended to be a key catalyst for performance,"" HSBC analysts said. “A key risk is the dependency on a few large-cap stocks for growth. These are mostly banks. Thus, rising NPLs (non-performing loans) can quickly and significantly change India’s earnings outlook,"" they warned.
The currency could weaken from here, prompting more interest rate hikes, while lower oil prices are supportive now, HSBC said, though it expects oil to rise in 2019-20."

230,2018-11-29,TCS,"The verdict is a major victory for the Indian outsourcing industry, whose business model depends heavily on exporting Indian engineers to the US

A jury in California rejected claims that Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) has discriminated for years against American workers in favor of staffing its US offices with Indians. The verdict is a major victory for the Indian outsourcing industry, whose business model depends heavily on exporting Indian engineers to the U.S. A federal jury in Oakland, California, sided Wednesday with TCS against four former employees who claimed they’d been sidelined and fired because they aren’t South Asian. 
A jury in California rejected claims that Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) has discriminated for years against American workers in favor of staffing its US offices with Indians. The verdict is a major victory for the Indian outsourcing industry, whose business model depends heavily on exporting Indian engineers to the U.S. A federal jury in Oakland, California, sided Wednesday with TCS against four former employees who claimed they’d been sidelined and fired because they aren’t South Asian.
The case was the first of several accusing India’s big IT firms of hiring bias in the U.S. to go to trial. HCL Technologies Ltd., Infosys Ltd. and Wipro Ltd. face similar claims.
The trial cast a spotlight on work-visa programs that companies use to bring overseas workers to the U.S., a practice President Donald Trump has criticized in his protectionist push. TCS, Asia’s largest outsourcer, and rivals Infosys and Wipro have all been squeezed by the Trump administration to hire more Americans on U.S. soil.
The ex-employees who sued accused TCS of a “systematic pattern and practice of discrimination"" by favoring Indian ex-pats and visa-ready workers from India for U.S. positions. That has resulted in a workforce that’s almost 80 percent South Asian, far greater than the 12 percent representation of South Asians in the U.S. IT workforce, according to the complaint.
At trial, the plaintiffs cited statistical evidence that the odds of race and national origin not being a factor in TCS’s termination decisions are less than one in a billion. They said that since 2011, the company fired 12.6 percent of its non-South Asian workers in the U.S., compared with less than 1 percent of its South Asian employees.
TCS attorneys argued the company had no incentive to discriminate, having spent millions of dollars on building a local talent pool in the U.S. Employees were terminated because they were unwilling to move to cities in the U.S. where TCS needed more engineers, the company said.
“We have always maintained the claims made in this case were baseless, and we are gratified that the jury agreed,"" Ben Trounson, a spokesman for TCS, said in an emailed statement after the verdict. “The decisions we make about the hiring and retention of employees are based purely on their abilities and fit to serve our clients’ specific needs.""
A unit of the Tata Group, India’s largest industrial conglomerate, TCS employs more than 400,000 people worldwide, is valued at about $100 billion and posted revenue of $19 billion for the fiscal year that ended in March. Most of its revenue comes from the U.S., and its primary customers are in the financial services sector."
229,2018-12-03,TCS,"CBIC says GST law provides that a person supplying services through an e-commerce platform is exempted from obtaining compulsory registration provided his aggregate turnover does not exceed 20 lakhs

New Delhi: The e-commerce companies are not liable to collect TCS on supplies made by entities with turnover not exceeding  ₹ 20 lakh and are not registered under GST, the CBIC has said. 
New Delhi: The e-commerce companies are not liable to collect TCS on supplies made by entities with turnover not exceeding  ₹ 20 lakh and are not registered under GST, the CBIC has said.
As per Goods and Services Tax (GST) provisions, beginning October 1, 2018, e-commerce companies deduct 1% tax collected at source (TCS) before making payments to their suppliers.
The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), in a clarification to the FAQ for TCS, said GST law provides that a person supplying services through an e-commerce platform is exempted from obtaining compulsory registration provided his aggregate turnover does not exceed  ₹ 20 lakhs (or  ₹ 10 lakhs in case of specified special category states) in a financial year.
“Since such suppliers are not liable for registration, e-commerce operators are not required to collect TCS on supply of services being made by such suppliers through their portal,"" the CBIC said.
In a separate FAQ, the CBIC said e-commerce operators who could not register themselves for GST but have already collected TCS, can show the amount collected while filing the first return form GSTR-8.
“E-commerce operators, who have been unable to obtain registration in the month of October, 2018 but have already collected TCS for the said month, may furnish the details of TCS collected in the month of October, 2018 in the first return in Form GTSR-8 to be filed after obtaining registration,"" the CBIC said.
The clarifications come after the e-commerce companies faced troubles in deducting TCS and depositing the same to the government.
The CBIC had earlier said that e-commerce companies, whether domestic or foreign, would have to register themselves in each state/UT as the obligation for collecting TCS will be there for every intra-state or inter-state supply.
Foreign e-commerce operator, which does not have a physical presence in a particular state/UT, were asked to appoint an agent on his behalf for the purpose of TCS registration.
“In order to facilitate the obtaining of registration in each State/UT, the e-commerce operator may declare the Head Office as its place of business for obtaining registration in that State/UT where it does not have physical presence, the CBIC had said.
In a clarification, the CBIC Monday said each State/UT has indicated one administrative jurisdiction where all e-commerce operators having business (but not having physical presence) in that State/UT will register. “The proper officer for the purpose of registration of ECOs (e-commerce companies) has also been notified by each State/UT,"" it said.
EY tax partner Abhishek Jain said, “Some of these clarifications like no deduction of TCS on supplies by unregistered persons, assigning of an administrative jurisdiction in states where e-commerce players do not have a place of business, were quite sought for by the e-commerce players and should aid easier implementation of this compliance by them.""

New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has shortlisted six major IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Wipro Ltd and IBM India, to set up a wide-based digital Public Credit Registry for capturing details of all borrowers and wilful defaulters. 
New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has shortlisted six major IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Wipro Ltd and IBM India, to set up a wide-based digital Public Credit Registry for capturing details of all borrowers and wilful defaulters.
The proposed Public Credit Registry will also include data from entities like capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the corporate affairs ministry, Goods and Service Tax Network (GSTN) and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) to enable banks and financial institutions to get a 360-degree profile of the existing as well as prospective borrowers on a real-time basis.
“Consequent to the publication of expression of interest (EOI) on October 27, 2018, the Reserve Bank had received responses from several vendors for implementation of end-end solution for Public Credit Registry,"" the central bank has said. After evaluating the responses of the interested vendors, the RBI said it has been decided to shortlist the six firms.
The other three shortlisted vendors are: Capgemini Technology Services India, Dun & Bradstreet Information Services India, and Mindtree Ltd.
The RBI would soon seek request for proposal from the six vendors.
In June this year, RBI had announced to set up a Public Credit Registry for India to address information asymmetry, foster access to credit and strengthen the credit culture in the economy.
Earlier, a high-level task force was constituted by RBI to review the current availability of information on credit, the adequacy of the existing information utilities, and to identify gaps that could be filled by a PCR.
“In essence, Public Credit Registry will be a digital registry of authenticated granular credit information and will work as a financial information infrastructure providing access to various stakeholders and enrich the existing credit information ecosystem,"" according to the EOI document issued in October.
The Public Credit Registry would be the single point of mandatory reporting for all material events for each loan, notwithstanding any threshold in the loan amount or type of borrower.
Currently, there are multiple granular credit information repositories in India, with each having somewhat distinct objectives and coverage.
Within the RBI, CRILC is a borrower-level supervisory dataset that keeps record of loans of  ₹ 5 crore and above.
Also, there are four privately owned credit information companies (CICs) operating in India. RBI has mandated all its regulated entities to submit credit information individually to all four CICs.
According to the EOI, the proposed solution should allow easy integration with ancillary information sources, such as the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Sebi, GSTN, CERSAI, utility billers, Central Fraud Registry and Wilful Defaulter/Caution/Suit Filed Lists.
Besides, borrowers would also be able to access their own credit information and seek corrections to the credit information reported on them.
Setting up of the Public Credit Registry assumes significance amid rising bad loans in the financial system. The non-performing assets in the banking system stand at about  ₹ 10 trillion."
227,2019-01-02,TCS,"Tech firms, including TCS, Infosys and Wipro, generated more revenue than ever before from standalone outsourcing deals signed in 2018

New Delhi: The twin trends of outsourcing larger technology contracts and Fortune 1000 companies awarding work that was earlier done internally to its vendors have led analysts and information technology executives to suggest that the sector could grow faster in the year starting 1 April. 
New Delhi: The twin trends of outsourcing larger technology contracts and Fortune 1000 companies awarding work that was earlier done internally to its vendors have led analysts and information technology executives to suggest that the sector could grow faster in the year starting 1 April.
These trends are the third positive development for India’s $167 billion information technology (IT) outsourcing sector, after the first six months of the current fiscal saw IT firms adding more employees and raising salaries of some of them by as much as 40%.
“Digital spend is industrializing a little bit, moving from pilots and PoC (proof of concepts) to big spends. That should look well overall for the industry, so I am quite optimistic,"" Nasscom chairman Rishad Premji said in an interaction with Mint last month. “The other interesting and exciting thing is, again at broad basis, the return of larger deals.""
The ability of IT companies to offer solutions through mobility and data crunching platforms that allows their clients, from Citigroup Inc. to Walmart Inc., to do their business more efficiently saw the technology vendors generating more revenue from stand-alone deals signed in 2018 than ever before.
This development is one reason for improved growth at some of the largest companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS).
The largest IT services companies, including TCS, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd, shared this optimism when they briefed analysts at an event organized by outsourcing research firm HFS Research in New York on 12 and 13 December.
“[M]anagement shared that 50% of the value of new deals are coming from 25% of the new signings, which implies that contracts are longer in duration with increasing complexity,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a 17 December note.
Bachman made the observation after speaking with the management of Genpact, the New York-based business process and technology management firm, at the HFS event.
For close to a decade, outsourcing deals shrank as tech work became commoditized. An added challenge for IT firms was the rise of in-sourcing, which saw several large clients setting up their own technology units or captives to do the tech work.
However, 2018 saw this change, according to three executives from TCS, Cognizant and Wipro.
“Several service providers discussed clients that have taken work in-house out of frustration with service providers, but have experienced difficulty in implementing new technologies without external help. As a result, clients are returning to service providers with more realistic expectations,"" Bachman wrote in the note.
“I do not see a huge rush to captives—the big issue is talent shortages in higher value areas, such as digital, AI (artificial intelligence), analytics, machine learning, etc. No one wants to hire those internally—the talent is too expensive and hard to retain,"" said Phil Fersht, chief executive officer of HFS Research. “Hence, we are witnessing a resurgence in services based on higher-value services and deeper, more consultative partnering.""
“In a nutshell what we are witnessing is the shift from ‘outsourcing’ to ‘real value partnering’ and the winning providers are those who can convert to the latter with smart talent and operating model investments,"" said Fersht.
TCS, Infosys and Wipro declined to comment as all three are in a quiet period ahead of declaring their December quarter results.
Since December last year, Mumbai-based TCS and Bengaluru-based Wipro have won four multi-year mega deals, which will together generate over $7.2 billion in revenue.
“A lot of deals, beyond the four mega deals, have seen integrated traditional offerings like infrastructure maintenance and BPO, along with deployment of data analytics platforms and some level of automation. This means that a resulting contract is of larger value than a pure-play traditional work,"" an executive at TCS said on the condition of anonymity."

New Delhi: Concerns about a slowdown in US economy poses the biggest risk to India’s $167 billion information technology (IT) outsourcing industry as experts fear Fortune 1000 companies may cut spending on technology, hurting Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd. Demand for digital services, which includes data crunching and artificial intelligence (AI) powered platforms, is still linked to the overall health of an economy, they say. 
New Delhi: Concerns about a slowdown in US economy poses the biggest risk to India’s $167 billion information technology (IT) outsourcing industry as experts fear Fortune 1000 companies may cut spending on technology, hurting Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd. Demand for digital services, which includes data crunching and artificial intelligence (AI) powered platforms, is still linked to the overall health of an economy, they say.
For this reason, analysts will be closely monitoring management commentary from homegrown IT firms on the growth outlook for the companies when they report earnings starting next week. Mumbai-based TCS kicks off the earnings season, when it reports its results on 10 January, followed by Infosys a day later and Wipro on 18 January.
“If the economies of the world are going to suddenly change in terms of their performance, it will certainly have a bearing on enterprises and, as a consequence, on technology companies. I can see that correlation translate at some level,"" Nasscom chairman Rishad Premji said in an interaction with Mint last month. “So, if the question is ‘if economies of the world are not doing well, will corporations continue to spend on digital?’ I would submit no. So, for now, there’s no decoupling (between economic growth and performance of IT firms)."" (read more)
Over the last two months, many economists and brokerages have flagged that the US will slow down in 2019.
Economists at Morgan Stanley expect a 2.3% growth in the current year from an estimated 2.9% growth in 2018.
US accounts for bulk of business, between 55% and 70% for the five largest companies, including TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies Ltd, Wipro and Tech Mahindra.
A weak growth could derail the uptick witnessed in the IT outsourcing industry in the past 12 months, an uptick in larger technology contracts getting outsourced and most companies awarding work that was earlier done internally to its vendors. The first six months of the current fiscal saw Indian IT companies adding more employees and raising salaries of some of them by as much as 40%.
“We need to wait and see how all of this impact the client budgets (technology spend) in the coming two-three months,"" a Wipro executive said on the condition of anonymity, as the company is in a silent period ahead of its earnings.
Digital accounts for less than a third of overall revenue at each of these companies, and that explains why any slowdown in the US will hurt growth at these companies.
“We believe a key question for Accenture, and the rest of our IT services coverage, is how defensive is its business model in the face of slowing global GDP, or even a recession,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a 20 December note. Bachman maintains that “consulting projects would be “aggressively cut in a recession"".
Bachman made the observation after Accenture Plc declared its results. At least two analysts quizzed the management on the impact of a macroeconomic slowdown on company’s growth during the management’s post-earnings interaction with analysts.
“[W]hen it’s raining hard, either you watch the rain or you build an umbrella. At Accenture, we decided to build an umbrella. And what the umbrella is made of, if you will, probably seven key elements which I truly believe are making Accenture more resilient and more durable across different cycles,"" said Pierre Nanterme, chief executive officer, Accenture on 20 December.
Accenture claims that over 60% of its business comes from newer technologies and digital and maintains that the firm will be a beneficiary.
“[I]n Brazil, they say how are you (Accenture) growing double-digits in Brazil, with terrible economic conditions? Because in Brazil, we are the number one. We are the market leader. And when times are tough, you remember the flight to quality. I would use the same comparison which is flight to leadership. When times are tough, clients are going to the leader with all the characteristics we have and the values,"" said Nanterme.
On Thursday, share prices of TCS and Infosys fell 1.39% and 0.26%, respectively, while that of Wipro rose 0.09% on the BSE. The benchmark Sensex lost 1.05%, or 377.81 points, to end the day at 35,513.71."

New Delhi:Tata Consultancy Services Ltd has been an outlier in the first-half of 2018-19: the Mumbai-based information technology (IT) outsourcing company added $936 million in incremental revenue in the six months ended 30 September. This was about $151 million less than the $1.08 billion in new business posted by Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd put together for 2017-18. 
New Delhi:Tata Consultancy Services Ltd has been an outlier in the first-half of 2018-19: the Mumbai-based information technology (IT) outsourcing company added $936 million in incremental revenue in the six months ended 30 September. This was about $151 million less than the $1.08 billion in new business posted by Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd put together for 2017-18.
Employee attrition of 10.9% at the end of the September quarter also implies that India’s largest IT services firm has managed to be the most successful among its peers in retaining employees. It has managed to retain almost all senior leaders, despite the company seeing a change of guard at the top, with Rajesh Gopinathan taking over as the chief executive officer in February 2017.
Besides, TCS’s deal wins of $9.8 billion in the April-September period is the highest among all home-grown IT firms.
Unsurprisingly, all these factors helped TCS shares post impressive gains: company shareholders saw 40% returns in the last calendar year, far higher than the 6% and 25% returns from investing in the benchmark BSE Sensex and BSE IT index, respectively.
Can TCS improve on its performance in 2019? On Thursday, the Mumbai-based IT firm will kick off its earnings calendar by declaring its earnings for the October-December period.
TCS will need $1.9 billion in incremental revenue to clock dollar revenue growth of 10%. Simply put, this means that despite reporting 10% year-on-year dollar revenue growth in both the June and September quarters, it still needs to do $972 million in new business during October-March to end the current financial year with a double-digit revenue growth in dollar terms. This should not be daunting for TCS as the management continues to be buoyant and the company continues to edge past its rivals in winning orders. Unsurprisingly, TCS should report a third consecutive good quarter on Thursday.
Here are 5 things to watch out for in TCS Q3 results to be declared on 10 January:
1. Revenue growth and management commentary for the financial year: TCS is estimated to post sequential dollar revenue growth of 1.4% in the October-December period, according to an analyst at brokerage JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd. This is less than the 3.2% sequential growth recorded in the second quarter, but then October-December is a weak season for IT firms on account of fewer working days (translating into lower billing hours for engineers deployed by IT vendors). Management commentary on the demand outlook for the fourth quarter and for the next financial year will be crucial.
2. Performance in key industry segments: The first half of the financial year saw TCS, along with its rivals, post modest growth in business from the banking and financial services industry, or BFSI, which accounted for 31% of the company’s total revenue. TCS reported 3.5% sequential constant currency growth in BFSI in the July-September quarter. Management commentary on demand from its banking clients will indicate whether the sector has finally turned the corner.
3. Growth in digital: TCS’s digital business grew 60% year-on-year in the second quarter, after reporting an impressive 45% y-o-y growth in the first. The business now accounts for 28% of the company’s revenue. Accenture still continues to see double-digit growth in its digital business, which constitutes about 60% of its revenue. For this reason, TCS’s growth in the fast-growing digital business will be watched by analysts to see how the company is making itself future-proof.
4. Will TCS share business from individual digital components? Chief operating officer N.G. Subramaniam said in October that the company was considering outlining businesses from some individual components of the digital business. Any such move will be helpful, reckon analysts, as it will help them gauge how TCS is positioning itself against its global peers, including International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Accenture Plc, which have started sharing business from artificial intelligence areas and cloud computing. More clarity on how the firm is faring in these growth areas will further reaffirm faith of its shareholders.
5. How resilient is the business model? Concerns over a slowdown in the US economy poses the biggest risk to TCS and its peers. For this reason, last month saw a few analysts quiz the management of Accenture on the resilience of its business model. Accenture shrugged off any such concerns, claiming its heft should allow it to benefit from clients looking to cut on outsourcing spending, should economic growth slows. TCS comments will help analysts gauge the strength of the home-grown IT industry."

The fruits of the weak rupee should be visible in the earnings of IT companies in the December quarter. Kotak Institutional Equities estimates earnings of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) to rise 26%. The company will report its earnings for the third quarter (Q3) on Thursday. TCS is expected to benefit from the recovery in growth rates in key business verticals, operating efficiencies and rupee depreciation.

TCS is expected to benefit from the recovery in growth rates in key business verticals, operating efficiencies and rupee depreciation.
Infosys Ltd, which is slated to release its earnings on Friday, is projected to report the weakest profit growth among large companies. Its earnings are estimated to grow a mere 9%, weighed down by higher employee expenses and investments in sales. The company has been battling high attrition, and had to dole out incentives and bonuses to try and arrest the trend.
However, by and large, IT firms are expected to gain. Besides, though the macroeconomic situation remains volatile, they had won large deals, which should aid volume growth in the near term. In the December quarter in particular, volumes tend to be a bit sluggish when compared sequentially, given furloughs at clients. Even so, considering the large deal wins, analysts are baking in sequential revenue growth of 1.8% for TCS."
221,2019-01-11,TCS,"TCS trades at 20 times one-year forward earnings estimates, and some analysts are still working with a rupee-dollar exchange rate of 72

After several quarters of sedate growth, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) has returned to double-digit growth this fiscal year. Its growth of 12.1% in the December quarter (Q3), on an annualized revenue base of nearly $20 billion, is nothing to sneeze at. And, especially so, considering its peers are growing at a lower rate on a lower revenue base.

Its growth of 12.1% in the December quarter (Q3), on an annualized revenue base of nearly $20 billion, is nothing to sneeze at. And, especially so, considering its peers are growing at a lower rate on a lower revenue base.
Who says elephants can’t dance? But things can sometimes get a bit wobbly when they do. In TCS’s case, while growth last quarter turned out to be almost exactly in line with investors’ expectations, profit margins were considerably lower.
Earnings before interest and tax stood at 25.6% of revenue, about 100 basis points lower than consensus estimates on the Street. A basis point is 0.01%.
After TCS had reported record margins in the September quarter, analysts and investors seemed to have assumed that things will be smooth on the costs front.
But employee and sub-contracting costs rose last quarter, far more than anyone had anticipated. The risk of a higher cost structure owing to more stringent visa norms is rearing its head.
“The tightening of conditions for visas comes at a time when unemployment rates are at a record low. Even as IT companies have stepped up local hiring, the fact is that talent is not easily available at the mid-level. This could potentially impact cost structure in the US or even impact demand fulfilment. Companies have to resort to a mix of subcontracting and offshore/near-shoring to meet demand. This impacts margins,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities had said in its TCS Q3 results preview note.
Even so, the broker had pencilled in a 40 basis points improvement in margins last quarter. The fact that TCS reported a 90 basis points drop instead, suggests visa-related shocks to the cost structure may have been higher than expected. “Clients will let these costs be passed on, but with a lag,"" CEO Rajesh Gopinathan told analysts on a call.
Another worry on the margins front is the company’s post-results commentary. Gopinathan told analysts that TCS plans to participate aggressively when it spots a demand opportunity. This may mean a hit on margins in the interim, with the hope that cost optimization happens over the life cycle of the project.
While this doesn’t necessarily mean TCS was willing to take pricing cuts and sacrifice margins to win volumes, it does mean that margins can be under pressure in the near term.
Of course, this shouldn’t be something investors should be unduly worried about. In any case, investors prefer growth and momentum over fat margins.
The problem, however, is that investors have been pricing in growth at high margins. TCS trades at about 20 times one-year forward earnings estimates, and some analysts are still working with a rupee-dollar rate of 72. This means earnings estimates may need to be cut both to reflect lower margin assumptions and a stronger rupee.
The good news is that the prognosis on demand remains strong. TCS won deals worth $5.9 billion last quarter, higher than the $4.9 billion worth deal wins in each of the preceding quarters. The key BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) vertical continued with its growth recovery, and management commentary suggests the momentum should continue. Compared to the lacklustre growth a year ago, investors might just be grateful that the elephant is still dancing."
220,2019-01-11,TCS,"TCS reported third-quarter earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin of 25.6% of its revenue, about 100 basis points lower than Street estimates

Mumbai: Shares of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd fell over 2.5% to hit over a six-week low on the BSE on Friday, a day after the company reported sharp contraction in its operating margin. The stock fell 2.55% intra-day and touched a low of  ₹ 1,840.10, a level last seen on 27 November 2018. The stock hit an all-time high of  ₹ 2,273 on 1 October 2018, and had since declined over 19%. At 10.06 am, the stock was trading at  ₹ 1,852 on the BSE, down 2% from its previous close.

At 10.06 am, the stock was trading at  ₹ 1,852 on the BSE, down 2% from its previous close.
TCS reported third-quarter earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin of 25.6% of its revenue, about 100 basis points lower than Street estimates, due to a 60 basis point headwind from cross-currency movements. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.
“Sharp margin contraction disappointed, largely due to higher sub-contracting charges. Fewer mega-deals than in the year-ago period, combined with signs of macro slowdown in the US, could lead to slower growth in 2019-20 according to estimates,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities in a 10 January note.
Kotak Institutional Equities reduced its 2019-21 earnings estimate for TCS by 2-3% due to a revised rupee/dollar rate and 70-90 basis point cut in margin assumption. The brokerage firm also cut its target price for the share to  ₹ 1,825 from  ₹ 1,950 and maintained its “reduce"" rating due to stretched valuations.
During the third quarter, sub-contracting costs increased 60 basis points to 7.6% of revenues due to shortage of talent onsite. The company expects the trend to continue in the short term.
“We believe it would be transient in nature for TCS as it would rationalise the cost structure in the medium term, given the company’s execution capability and ability in absorbing price hikes,"" brokerage firm Sharekhan said in a 10 January note.
TCS’ revenue rose 1.8% in constant currency terms during the October-December quarter against the preceding three months, while net profit rose 1.9% to $1.14 billion from $1.11 billion. A Bloomberg survey of 17 analysts had estimated a net profit of  ₹ 8,154.4 crore ($1.17 billion) on net sales of  ₹ 37,849.1 crore ($5.43 billion). The company won deals worth $5.9 billion in the December quarter, taking the total number to $15.7 billion in the first nine months of the current financial year.
“TCS results came in a bit below our expectations on growth, but missed EBIT margins materially. In dollar terms, growth was materially lower, driven by higher-than-anticipated constant currency impact,"" brokerage firm Nomura said in a 10 January note. The brokerage firm maintained its “reduce"" rating on the stock and kept its target price to  ₹ 1,840 per share.
Of the analysts covering the stock, 24 have a “buy"" rating, 16 have a “hold"" rating, while 10 have a “sell"" rating, according to Bloomberg."
218,2019-01-14,TCS,"With Tata Consultancy Services's Q3 operating income of $1.35 billion is almost double that of Infosys, TCS can use other tactics in its arsenal to stave off the debilitating effects of a price war

Bengaluru: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) said it won’t engage in a price war, although some of its rivals have offered discounts, to win new deals. “We are seeing in the market some of them are dropping prices,"" chief operating officer N. Ganapathy Subramaniam said without naming the companies that are resorting to discounts to boost revenue growth. “We are not worried about the pricing play of our competition because we have always maintained you cannot compromise margins to funnel growth.""

Ganapathy Subramaniam said without naming the companies that are resorting to discounts to boost revenue growth. “We are not worried about the pricing play of our competition because we have always maintained you cannot compromise margins to funnel growth.""
Examples abound in the world of business of how retaliatory price slashing results in a precipitous drop in industry profitability. With TCS’s December quarter (Q3) operating income of $1.35 billion is almost double that of its nearest local rival Infosys Ltd, the Mumbai-based company can use other tactics in its arsenal to stave off the debilitating effects of a price war.
“Pricing alone is not the criteria. So, when we say we will be aggressive, what we are saying is that you need to have a solution, the sleekness of the solution, the ability to create business value, and how you are committing to growth parameters (of a client). All of this makes a winning proposition for clients,"" clarified Subramaniam.
Some analysts had interpreted that TCS might lower its pricing in some work it does after the management told analysts in a post-earnings interaction on Thursday that the firm plans to participate aggressively when it spots a demand opportunity.
TCS reported a Q3 operating margin of 25.6%, about three percentage points wider than Infosys’s 22.6%, highlighting how the Mumbai-based TCS is generating more revenue at higher profitability.
Significantly, until the Q3 of 2008-09, Infosys earned more for its services offered, as its $373 million in operating profit was more than TCS’s $367.2 million.
TCS said it continues to work towards operating between a 26% and 28% profitability band, even as Infosys in April last year dropped its profit outlook to between 22% and 24% for the current fiscal.
Many analysts say this was on account of the company looking to drop prices for its services, although Infosys maintains that the reason for the lowering of profitability is to plough back the savings to invest in digital technologies and also cover expenses related to hiring more locals in the US and pay more to hire the brightest engineers.
The underlying reason for declining profitability at Infosys and other large IT firms, including Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, is that there is pricing pressure on commoditized deals or traditional information technology work, which still account for over three-fourths of total revenues.
These firms maintain they earn more money on work related to digital, the fuzzy umbrella term that each firm uses to call revenue generated from areas generally classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud computing, and Internet of Things.
However, digital still brings less than a third of the overall business.
Worryingly for investors of Infosys, some analysts say the company’s profitability will remain challenged in the current quarter and will be unchanged in the fiscal beginning April.
“We project margins to be roughly flat in FY20,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 11 January.
“We think margins will be lower sequentially in 4Q, as INFY (Infosys) will have a negative impact from INR appreciation, and has continued expenses in localization, reskilling, and compensation changes to help lower attrition. Also, we think there is a ramp time for new deals, which we expect will also weigh on margins in 4Q. In FY20, we project 23.0% operating margins, as we think investments will stabilize though FX will be a headwind,"" wrote Bachman."
217,2019-01-14,TCS,"Infosys trades at a sizeable valuation discount vis--vis bigger rival TCS, and the  large share buyback should also help support the former's stock

Shares of Infosys Ltd have risen 27% in the past year, outperforming the Nifty IT index’s 18% gain. Apart from the fact that the shares came off a low base, there have been signs of improvement in growth rates under the new CEO, Salil Parekh. In that backdrop, Infosys Q3 results come as a big reinforcement of that belief.

Apart from the fact that the shares came off a low base, there have been signs of improvement in growth rates under the new CEO, Salil Parekh. In that backdrop, Infosys Q3 results come as a big reinforcement of that belief.
Growth is certainly back to decent levels. The constant currency revenue growth of 10.1% from a year ago is notably higher than Street estimates. Importantly, Infosys also revised FY19 growth upwards by about 100 basis points. This implies growth momentum should continue into the fourth quarter, and return to double-digit growth is certainly something that will excite investors.
While the Infosys Q3 results were declared after Indian markets closed on Friday, the company’s American depository receipts rose more than 5% on the New York Stock Exchange.
Traditionally, the second half of the fiscal year is relatively softer for software companies due to fewer working days on account of Christmas and New Year holidays. So for Infosys to raise its forecast based on its second-half performance is quite unusual. The firm raised its growth forecast to 8.5-9% from 6-8% earlier.
Deal wins have been strong, too. Infosys won 14 large deals amounting to about $1.5 billion last quarter. Cumulatively deal wins so far in FY19 stand at $4.7 billion, more than double the orders Infosys booked in the year-ago period.
But the optimism is yet to reflect in its profitability. Operating margin narrowed 1.1 percentage points sequentially and 1.7 percentage points from a year ago. While there were some one-offs, even after adjusting for them, margins were lower than Street estimates. But investors seem to be in the mood to ignore margin-related concerns, given the strong pickup in growth.
Infosys is investing in building sales and digital capabilities, besides giving related compensation hikes to tame attrition. In addition, transition costs in large deals are leading to softness in margins. The investments are expected to continue, implying the trend of soft margins should continue in the near term.
While growth is back, it has to be seen if momentum will sustain on a higher base. Growth in the last two quarters came off a relatively low base.
That said, Infosys trades at a sizeable valuation discount vis-à-vis bigger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, and the large share buyback should also help support the former’s stock. The buyback price is at a 16% premium to the last closing price of the stock. Importantly, it will be implemented through the open market route, which means the company will be regularly buying shares from the market and this will support the Infosys stock."

Wipro is considering a proposal to issue bonus shares, sending its shares as much as 6% higher today. In a communication to BSE, Wipro informed that its board will meet on January 17-18 to consider financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, and declaration of interim dividend, if any, for the financial year 2018-19. The board will also consider a proposal for issue of bonus shares at the meeting.

If Wipro announces a bonus issue, it will be second such move by the Bengaluru-headquartered IT services company in two years. In 2017, Wipro had announced a 1:1 bonus issue.
Cash-rich Indian IT companies have been returning cash in their books to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Also in 2017, Wipro had carried out an  ₹ 11,000 crore share buyback programme.
When a company announces bonus issue, the number of outstanding shares goes up as investors get extra shares. The face value of a company’s share does not change but it increases the liquidity of shares in the market. Bonus issues may also result in higher dividends for investors because of higher number of shares. Analysts say that bonus issuance signals that the company may increase its profitability to justify expanded equity base.
Infosys, which announced Q3 earnings last week, had also approved an  ₹ 8,260-crore share buyback, the second in less than 13 months’ time. Infosys also declared a special dividend of  ₹ 4 per share. Last year, Infosys had also approved 1:1 bonus issue to celebrate 25 years of stock market listing.

Mumbai: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) missed analysts’ estimates on earnings although the country’s largest information technology (IT) services provider posted a fourth straight quarter of year-on-year (y-o-y) double-digit revenue growth in constant currency terms.
The Mumbai-based company’s December quarter, or Q3, revenue rose 1.8% in constant currency terms from the preceding three months. Currency fluctuations took some sheen off the growth as dollar revenue grew at a slower pace of 0.67% to $5.25 billion in the quarter ended 31 December from the preceding three months.
“Because of TCS’s size, one should not try to evaluate its performance on q-o-q (quarter-on-quarter) as there will be some volatility. The heartening thing is that the company has a strong order book and its year-on-year growth continues to be in double-digit,"" a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage said on condition of anonymity.
Q3 is a seasonally weak one for IT firms as there are fewer working days for engineers deployed at client sites in the US and Europe, where companies shut because of Christmas and New Year holidays.
TCS reported a 9.7% dollar revenue growth from a year earlier in Q3, which was preceded by a 10% y-o-y growth in both July-September (Q2) and April-June (Q1) quarters and an 11.7% revenue growth during January-March (Q4 FY18).
Net profit rose 1.9% to $1.14 billion from $1.11 billion in the preceding three months, while operating margin narrowed 90 basis points to 25.6% from 26.5% in the July-September period, hurt by cross-currency movement and higher employee costs.
One hundred basis points make up one percentage point.
A Bloomberg survey of 17 analysts had estimated a profit of   ₹ 8,154.4 crore ($1.17 billion) on net sales of   ₹ 37,849.1 crore ($5.43 billion).
A few analysts were concerned about the contraction in TCS’s operating margin.
“Our Take: Decent revenue with momentum in BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) and digital but no positive surprises,"" analysts Anantha Narayan and Nitin Jain of Credit Suisse wrote in a note to investors after TCS Q3 results. “Negative margin surprise—increased costs in the US and adverse actual currency impact vs. estimates could be reasons.""
“While the revenue trajectory and contract wins remain strong, the markets are likely to view the margin miss negatively,"" Diviya Nagarajan, an analyst at UBS Securities, wrote in a note after the company declared its Q3 results.
Still, the two biggest takeaways from TCS’s performance are that the firm will clock double-digit growth this fiscal and its impressive deal wins should help it maintain this growth in the next fiscal.
TCS, which follows an April-March fiscal, has managed a 10.3% dollar revenue growth in calendar year 2018, as it ended with $20.5 billion in revenue, implying that the firm added $1.9 billion in incremental revenue. TCS did $1.98 billion in new business, the highest, in fiscal 2011-12.
TCS won deals worth $5.9 billion in the December quarter, taking the total number of deal wins to $15.7 billion in the first nine months of this fiscal year.
This strong performance underscores why for the first time in three years TCS will outpace Nasscom’s industry growth projection of 7-9% in constant currency terms.
Chief executive Rajesh Gopinathan exuded optimism that, save for any macroeconomic downside risk, the company remained well-positioned to clock double-digit growth this fiscal and in the medium term.
“We have had a fairly strong quarter in a seasonally weak period,"" said Gopinathan, who took over as TCS CEO in February 2017. “We’ve repeatedly said that we are closing this year on a much stronger note and are well positioned in the medium term.""
Clients spending more on TCS’s digital technology solution offerings helped raise its share of digital business, which surged 52.7% y-o-y and accounted for $1.58 billion, or 30.1%, of total revenue in the December quarter.
The US, which accounted for 51.2% of TCS’s third quarter revenue, and financial services, which constituted 30.8% of overall business, grew 8.2% and 8.6% y-o-y, respectively.
On Thursday, TCS shares rose 0.02%, or   ₹ 0.35, to   ₹ 1,888.15 apiece on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex fell 0.29%, or 106.41 points, to 36,106.50.

Shares of Wipro Ltd gained over 10% last week after the company said its board will consider a bonus issue of equity shares. The board eventually approved a 1:3 bonus issue, and what’s more, its earnings exceeded Street estimates. The constant currency revenue growth of 7% year-on-year indicates continued recovery. Revenue grew 5.1% in Q2 and 2.4% in Q1 from a year ago.
But the 0-2% revenue growth forecast for the current quarter caught the Street off guard. This can temper expectations. The subdued guidance comes in the backdrop of strong revenue growth commentaries by larger rivals.
Encouraged by robust deal wins and order pipeline, both Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd have guided for strong growth momentum in the current quarter, with the latter even revising its FY19 growth guidance upwards by a percentage point.
Wipro is also seeing a good deal flow. According to the management, the order pipeline is strong. “The management is confident of growth recovery on the back of a) continued traction in BFSI and digital; b) robust demand environment especially for digital transformation and enterprise scale modernization services, c) steady progress in client mining,"" SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note. BFSI is banking, financial services and insurance.
But recovery is not broad-based yet. The sectors which are on the recovery path—financial services, consumer and energy—continue to see acceleration. The laggards—healthcare and manufacturing—have continued to languish. The saving grace is that they account for only a fifth of Wipro’s revenue, although even then, they have been a drag on overall growth.
The uneven recovery is clouding the near-term outlook. Revenue growth in the healthcare segment is directly correlated to enrolments, which have been low. Similarly, performance in the manufacturing vertical is likely to be volatile due to restructuring.
So, even as the company delivered healthy execution and margin improvement for the second consecutive quarter, the subdued growth outlook is constraining earnings expectations. While the Wipro stock trades at a discount to larger peers, lacklustre growth is proving to be a handicap.
“Despite some improvement, Wipro continues to underperform other top-tier IT services companies on growth and valuation at 15x FY20E P/E is expensive by comparison (vis-à-vis growth expectations), keeping us on the sidelines,"" Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note."
213,2019-01-21,TCS,"Tata Tea is offering free cups to tea to passers-by, group firm TCS proudly declares itself as one furthering digital skillsAndhra Pradesh has expanded the space it takes every year for setting up a lounge at the spot earlier used for the Make in India 

Davos:  Indian leaders may be missing but India still is a toast of this snow-laden ski resort town buzzing with the global elite who have congregated for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF).
While Tata Tea is offering free cups to tea to passers-by, group firm TCS proudly declares itself as one furthering digital skills and helping businesses with technology solutions.
Telangana is welcoming investors to India by making the state their first stop in the country, while Andhra Pradesh is projecting itself as the sunrise state and future-ready.
Despite its Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu pulling out from the Davos trip, Andhra Pradesh has expanded the space it takes every year for setting up a lounge at the spot earlier used for the Make in India lounge, and before that 'India Adda', known for Indian food and beverages.
There is no Adda this time, but India Invest has set up India Investment Centre, even as Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan have dropped out and so has Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.
There is no clarity as yet on the participation of Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu, while some regulars among Indian CEOs may also give the summit a miss this year.
So is the case for some other countries, with top leaders from the US, UK, France and Russia not attending the meet this year.
Hotels are, however, not complaining despite last minute cancellations as they had long waiting lists. In fact, since cancellations at the last minute do not involve any refund, it is a case of the same room fetching booking amount twice.
Locals say it's business as usual in the city, once known for health tourism, always frequented by skiing enthusiasts and home to the annual week-long pow-wow of the rich and powerful of the world in sub-zero temperatures for five decades now.
For now, Davos teems with huge billboards atop buildings and even on buses, promoting India and Indian companies, while the narrow roads made even narrower by heavy snowfall are packed with lounges set up by the private and public sector from the country where Indian delicacies are flying off the counters.
Flush with nearly three-times its usual population, this Swiss resort town is teeming with black business suits for the annual WEF gathering, but it still cannot deter the skiing enthusiasts and those coming for medical tourism.
The event has also brought thousands of army, police and other security personnel from across Switzerland and some neighbouring countries as well to secure the summit being attended by several heads of state and government.
Davos has a much older and fascinating history of its own, being a place of eminence for medical tourism as also winter sports.
Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the famous detective character Sherlock Holmes, moved to this town along with his ailing wife that reportedly helped her regain her health.
Once famous for being a summer health resort, Davos has gradually emerged as a major winter sport hub on the Alps, but its biggest claim to fame for the past almost five decades has been the World Economic Forum's annual meeting every January, beginning 1971.
The only drawback for tourists is that they cannot stay within the town, which has less than 10 medium-sized hotels and about 40 small ones, including in nearby areas like Klosters and Dorf.
Besides, the so-called WAGs (wives and girlfriends) of those attending the WEF meet are also around in large numbers on ski circuits and at various tourist destinations of the town that comprises two big parallel roads and numerous connecting alleys.

212,2019-01-21,TCS,"The first elephant is the turmoil in the US equity markets, which indicates the end of a long expansion 

Information technology (IT) analysts are largely a happy bunch. Their primary arguments for an overall rosy macro outlook include comments that there appear to be no headwinds seen on clients’ IT budgets because of the deal renewal cycles as well as the fact that digital spending is now becoming “non-discretionary"". The latter supposedly means that IT departments at client firms that outsource to service providers have no choice but to spend large amounts on digital projects.
Early last year in this column, I predicted that IT services firms would have a good 2018, primarily because of large deals being recycled out into the market, and because of early “digital"" efforts made by clients now moving into the mainstream. The first phenomenon is a cyclical one, and it appears as if the effect of the expansion caused by deal renewals will continue into 2019.
As the spending on digital goes from the ideation stage (where Indian IT services firms have a lacklustre presence) to the execution stage, which allows them to compete on a level playing field with others, Indian players are seen benefiting from clients’ budgets. The other macro shift that worked in favour of Indian service providers in 2018 was the fall in the value of the rupee vis-à-vis the dollar.
While the positive impacts are clear, each enterprise has had firm-specific factors affecting performance. And so, much of the commentary this quarter has started to focus on the relative differences among firms. Analysts seem to favour stocks such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd and Infosys Ltd, while being lukewarm towards others.
There is also speculation about probable consolidation among mid-cap providers, especially where existing investors, such as private equity firms or large single investors, look to monetize their stake through exits and forced mergers. The promoter equity at these firms is now dwarfed by the private equity stake, and investors will have to look to moves by private equity firms as a leading indicator of stock price performance.
Last week, Mint carried an article about moves by Baring PE Asia, KKR and Café Coffee Day’s V.G. Siddhartha, which could massively impact at least a couple of mid-cap providers that are already billion-dollar revenue bracket firms.
The rest of the analysis seems to focus on the expected spending from the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector, the largest sector from a revenue perspective for almost all Indian IT services firms. This analysis focuses on two vectors.
The first vector is on the interplay between insourcing of work through the BFSI sector’s India-based in-house delivery centres and outsourcing of work to IT services firms.
The second vector is on the apparent spending pattern within BFSI, which is seeing cautious expansion into digital running alongside continued spending on older systems.
Such fine splitting of hairs while analysing recent results and near-term forecasts is but to be expected in a sector that has grown mature, and by some accounts, past its “use by"" date. In my opinion, however, most analysts seem to have completely missed three elephants in the room.
The first elephant is the turmoil in the US equity markets, which indicates the end of a long expansion and the possible start of economic contraction in that market. This contraction is based on fears of a “bull in a China shop"" (quite literally) attitude toward US trade with China, increasing rhetoric around US trade wars and slowing growth in both China and Europe.
After a decade of growth, many investors are worried that a contraction is near, and December’s jitters on the heels of a threatened fifth raise of interest rates by America’s Federal Reserve was only a preview. Markets in the US have calmed over the past few days and US stocks have seen a rebound, but only because another interest rate action by the Fed now seems less likely, after the Federal Reserve officials repeatedly assured investors that they were sensitive to concerns about the economy and would be flexible and patient with further interest rate hikes. However, many factors behind last year’s alarming and precipitous drop loom in the shadows.
IT analysts also seem blind to two other pachyderms: political upheaval in both the US and in the UK, still two of the largest markets for Indian IT. The first is the ongoing battle between US President Donald Trump and those who oppose his border wall proposal and the latter is the complete chaos on Brexit.
The US is now well into its longest government shutdown, with Trump and opposition Democrats casting blame for the deadlock on each other. Whoever is to blame, there is no doubt at all that the shutdown will exact a massive price on the US economy; the shutdown’s total costs will far outweigh the $5.7 billion for the wall that Trump and the Democrats are quarrelling about. According to Standard & Poor’s, the last time the US government shut down for 16 days in 2013, the economy took a $24 billion hit. This shutdown is 31 days old and counting.
Start to get very picky with your investments in Indian IT.

211,2019-01-22,TCS,"TCS has announced three changes to its employees last monthTCS has appointed new deputy heads for its human resource function and manufacturing vertical

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) has undertaken the first management changes after Rajesh Gopinathan took over as chief executive officer two years ago.
India’s largest information technology services company appointed new deputy heads for its human resource function and manufacturing vertical.
The company has, with these appointments, reaffirmed faith in these leaders with eye on the future, according to an executive familiar with the developments.
Mumbai-based TCS named Ritu Anand, formerly deputy head of human resources (HR), as the new head of global diversity. TCS has entrusted Milind Lakkad, the head of the manufacturing industry unit, with the additional responsibility of deputy HR head.
Lakkad is expected to succeed Ajoyendra Mukherjee, the HR head, when the latter retires, the executive cited above said on condition of anonymity.
Mukherjee, 59, will retire soon as TCS has a mandatory retirement age of 60 for its senior executives.
Susheel Vasudevan, who is also overseeing the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) business unit along with president K. Krithivasan, has been named the deputy head of the manufacturing segment.
“Milind (Lakkad) is being groomed to take over from Ajoy, while Susheel (Vasudevan) has been tasked to scale up business from the manufacturing vertical,"" the executive said.
The company has announced these three changes to its employees last month.
An email sent to Tata Consultancy Services on 14 January seeking comment has not been answered.
Tata Consultancy Services, which had 417,929 employees at the end of December 2018, got about 7% or $378 million of the company’s $5.25 billion in revenue from customers in the manufacturing industry during the October-December period.
Since Tata Consultancy Services named Gopinathan as CEO and N. Ganapathy Subramaniam as chief operating officer (COO) in February 2017, the company has continued with the senior leadership put in place by Natarajan Chandrasekaran, who was elevated as chairman of Tata Sons, the holding company of the $103-billion Tata Group.
During this time, Tata Consultancy Services has retained almost the entirety of its senior management team, with the consensus view being that this has been one of the smoothest management transitions at an Indian corporate entity.
For Tata Consultancy Services , a stable leadership at the top, along with low attrition rates, and its better execution has helped the company return to industry-leading growth.
Tata Consultancy Services does not give quarterly or yearly growth outlooks but the company, which ended with $19.1 billion in revenue last year, is expected to increase this by more than 11% in constant currency terms in the current financial year."

209,2019-01-25,TCS,"Finding a successor to CEO Francisco D’Souza, improving growth figures are the two key challenges ahead for firmCognizant has had only four CEOs so far, while Infosys and Wipro have had at least four bosses in the last decade alone

NEW DELHI :
For a quarter of a century since it was set up in 1994, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. has followed a simple mantra: capitalize on the opportunity emerging out of every crisis.
“Frank (CEO Francisco D’Souza) often says never miss a crisis, it’s an opportunity,"" said Ramakrishnan Chandrasekaran, executive vice-chairman, Cognizant India.
This approach is best exemplified by the company’s performance during the financial meltdown of 2008. Cognizant’s revenue grew 16% in 2009 and 40% in 2010; Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd could only manage single-digit growth.
“Unlike some Indian firms, Cognizant increased its investments in business. From hiring more sales executives to even doing some work pro bono for clients, Cognizant realized that all this will help the company in future,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a foreign brokerage, requesting anonymity.
Cognizant, which started as a software services arm of Dun & Bradstreet Corp. with 175 employees in 1994, will end 2018 with over $16 billion in revenues. The Nasdaq-listed firm completes 25 years on 26 January. TCS completed 50 years last year.
Cognizant is envied by its Indian rivals for its scorching pace of growth. Beginning 2010, it has been adding over $1 billion in incremental revenue every year. In other words, in the 12 years ended December 2018, Cognizant has added $14.66 billion in revenue, or the combined numbers of what Wipro and Tech Mahindra Ltd could achieve.
“Cognizant had a challenger strategy,"" said Ray Wang, founder, Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm. “The key was that they had less rules, less bureaucracy to do the right thing, and that led to explosive growth.""
Four things underline Cognizant’s steroid-charged growth.
First, the company’s super-aggressive sales culture as the firm always had more people managing its large accounts. Second, Cognizant’s senior management comprises more people from outside the firm, unlike the insular approach followed by homegrown companies. “We are truly an MNC,"" said R. Ramkumar, executive director, Cognizant India. “We had a CEO who operated out of the US, the next one operated out of India, and the one after him out of the US. If you were to look at the next 25 years, this one aspect of being a global organization with a global mindset and a global leadership positions us well to thrive in the digital era,"" said Ramkumar, who joined Cognizant from TCS in 1998. Third, stability at the top. Since inception, Cognizant has had only four CEOs. Srini Raju and Lakshmi Narayanan were based out of India, while Kumar Mahadeva and current boss D’Souza are based out of US. Both Infosys and Wipro have had at least four bosses in the last decade alone.
Finally, the company has gained from its focus on fewer countries and industry segments. In 2017, the US accounted for three-fourths of its total revenue, while business from banking, financial services and insurance and healthcare accounted for 38.1% and 28.8%, respectively.
Still, 25 years later, Cognizant again finds itself at a crossroads.
The IT major’s growth fell to single digit for the first time in 2016, when activist investor Elliott Management Corp. pushed the management to focus on improving profitability rather than its growth-at-all costs approach. 2018 will be the third straight year of Cognizant reporting single-digit growth.
Understandably, a few analysts such as HSBC analyst Yogesh Aggarwal, have said in the past that Elliott’s decision was nothing short of “destructive activism"".
A bigger challenge ahead for the company is to find the successor to CEO D’Souza, and the board is evaluating both internal and external candidates. D’Souza is expected to step down sometime this year.
“Cognizant has been a good story,"" said former Infosys CFO V. Balakrishnan. “Their USP has, however, been to grow higher than Indian firms. The Elliott chapter was a distraction for the company, and it needs to be seen if the company can get back its old DNA.""
Amazon, which was also founded in 1994, set up its cloud services business, Amazon Web Services, in 2006. AWS’s revenue now stands at $21 billion (on trailing 12 months basis), more than TCS.
For now, Chandrasekaran won’t admit if Cognizant, like its Indian peers, lacked the foresight to invest in cloud computing business. “The good thing is that we were able to scale our business. The bad thing was we didn’t focus on path-breaking innovations, but in the future you will see a lot more path-breaking innovations,"" said Chandrasekaran.

HCL Technologies Ltd on Tuesday reported a 4.9% sequential increase in its dollar revenue for the October-December quarter, the fastest among the large companies in India’s $167 billion information technology (IT) outsourcing sector.
HCL Tech’s dollar revenue improved sequentially to $2.2 billion in the quarter, while revenue grew 10.8% year-on-year (y-o-y).
In constant currency terms, the company’s revenue rose 5.6% on a sequential basis.
Net profit was at $364 million in the December quarter when compared with $357 million in the September quarter.
However, its operating margin fell 30 basis points from 19.9% to 19.6% in the quarter under consideration, on account of rising wages. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
A Bloomberg survey of 29 analysts had forecast revenue of $2.18 billion, or  ₹15,514.1 crore, besides profit of $357.54 million, or  ₹2,541 crore, for the December quarter.
Noida-based HCL Tech’s performance in the October-December quarter was better than its Bengaluru-based rivals, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd, which reported 2.2% and 1.8% sequential dollar revenue growth, respectively. Mumbai-based Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, which does more business than Infosys and Wipro put together, reported 0.67% growth.
For now, HCL Tech’s growth continues to be driven by higher business from its infrastructure management services unit, besides revenue from its acquisition strategy.
HCL Tech expects its full-year revenue for 2018-19 to grow at the upper-end of its guidance of 9.5-11.5%. Mumbai-based TCS, which does not provide a growth outlook, is expected to grow over 11%, while Infosys expects at-best 9% growth.
Industry body Nasscom expects revenue for the industry to grow between 7% and 9% in constant currency terms.
“I’m very happy with the outstanding performance delivered by us during this quarter,"" said HCL Technologies chief executive officer C. Vijayakumar.
“For now, we see healthy demand and we don’t see any impact on our client spends from either the continued shutdown in the US or any macroeconomic slowdown.""

The brokerage, however, said it continues to have concerns over the company’s $1.8 billion acquisition of eight software products from IBM, which was announced last month.
On Tuesday, HCL shares rose 1.24% to  ₹988.1 on the BSE even as the benchmark Sensex slipped 64 points, or 0.18%, to end the day at 35,592.5 points. HCL Q3 results were announced after market hours."

Executives from Infosys Ltd’s consulting practice will now work jointly with sales and delivery heads to garner more business by offering a wider array of services to its top clients.
This effort is the latest initiative being rolled out by Infosys under chief executive Salil Parekh, who since taking over in January last year has focused on bringing stability at India’s second largest information technology (IT) services firm.
“There is a lot more focus on driving growth in top 30 accounts,"" said U.B. Pravin Rao, Infosys chief operating officer. “As part of this, we are looking to get digital strategists. Digital strategists are people, who will be again a handful, and who are consultants or technologists or people with industry background and will be looking at these top accounts.""
Infosys expects to grow at a faster pace in the current financial year than in 2017-18. The company, after posting a 2.2% sequential increase in dollar revenue during the October-December period, raised its revenue outlook for 2018-19 to 8.5-9% in constant currency terms.
Infosys’s revenue grew 5.8% in constant currency terms in financial year 2017-18.
“We need it (consulting) to be part of the account team. It has to be a consultative-led selling approach,"" said Mark Livingston, Infosys’s head of consulting.
Infosys, like its peers, gets the bulk of its business from its largest clients: the top 25 clients accounted for a third or $1 billion of Infosys’s $2.98 billion in revenue in the October-December quarter.
In the quarter ended December 2017, just before Parekh took over as CEO, the top 25 customers accounted for 35.3% or $972.5 million of Infosys’s $2.75 billion in revenue.
This means that in calendar year 2018 business from top 25 clients grew at a slower pace of 4.1% as against an 8.4% growth in Infosys’s quarterly revenue.
Infosys’s latest effort appears it is looking to take a leaf out of its rival Cognizant’s approach which during the last decade modelled its ‘three-in-a-box approach’ under which the Nasdaq-listed firm got a consulting partner to work along with a sales and delivery executive for its largest accounts.
One reason behind this push by Infosys to make consulting more integral to its business is also driven by the change in the way companies globally, from big banks to healthcare firms, are looking to do business with their IT vendors.
Over the last few years, newer digital technologies like data analytics and cloud computing platforms offer companies to run their business better.
“Consulting is key as you have to work with clients at a strategic level to identify opportunities and co-create and co-innovate solutions. The account-based models require consulting to be a key part of the selling and service model,"" said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm.
Infosys’s latest approach to consulting comes after many failed attempts by its earlier management over the last 15 years to leverage its consulting arm: From setting up a consulting arm at the start of the century to buying Swiss consulting unit Lodestone, then later merging it with its own small consulting business, Infosys has struggled to scale up its consulting business.
None of the Indian IT firms, including Cognizant and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, share revenue from their consulting practices but analysts attribute Cognizant’s industry-leading growth over the last decade to its strong consulting business."

204,2019-02-05,TCS,"Wipro Ventures’ fundings underscore IT firm’s success in tapping startup ecosystemWipro has done a better job at M&As and investments than its peers, including Infosys, say analysts

NEW DELHI :
Wipro Ventures has deployed $65 million, or two-thirds of its corpus, in 18 startups since it was set up in 2015 and has helped its parent, Wipro Ltd, win more than 100 deals, underscoring the early success of the software services company in tapping into the disruptive startup ecosystem.
Of its total investments, 14 are in the US, three in Israel and one in India—in Pune-based big data start-up Altizon Systems Pvt. Ltd.
“As of date, we have committed more than $65 million in capital,"" said Venu Pemmaraju, a managing partner at Wipro Ventures.
Both Pemmaraju, formerly a senior investment manager at Intel Capital, and the other managing partner, Biplab Adhya, are based out of California. They report to Rishad Premji, the elder son of billionaire, philanthropist and Wipro chairman Azim Premji.
“Since 2015, we have had more than 100 wins in conjunction with the startups we have invested in,"" said Adhya.
Wipro Ventures’ investments have allowed Wipro to offer new-age technology solutions in engagements with some of the firm’s 1,132 customers, and win contracts, highlighting how large information technology (IT) companies are keeping pace with the latest technologies.
In the last few years, Wipro’s revenue growth has lagged its larger rivals, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd. At the end of the June quarter, HCL Technologies Ltd edged past Wipro to become India’s third-largest IT firm.
Wipro Ventures’ performance, however, has been one of the few bright spots in the Wipro story.
Infosys, which also set up a $500 million corporate venture arm, Infosys Innovation Fund, in 2015, has invested in only eight startups so far. Infosys divested its stake in ANSR Consulting Holdings Inc. in December 2017.
Rishad Premji, who is Wipro’s chief strategy officer and director, also oversees the company’s mergers and acquisitions.
Over the last four years, Wipro has been second only to Noida-based HCL in acquisitions, having spent $1.17 billion in acquiring six companies including Denmark-based design firm Designit and US-based cloud computing firm Appirio Inc.
Understandably, many analysts maintain that Wipro has done a better job at mergers and acquisitions and investments than its peers, including Infosys.
“Wipro has done a better job of M&A than most IT services firms to date,"" said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm.
“We measure both the financial health of the companies and the strategic value to Wipro and the startups. Our baseline investment strategy is still the same—invest into early- to mid-stage enterprise software companies that have exhibited initial product-market fit, deployed their solution at a handful of enterprise customers and put mechanisms in place to engage with a global technology services provider,"" said Pemmaraju.
“That said, each deal is different and one size doesn’t fit all. So we do modify our evaluation criteria accordingly,"" said Adhya."

202,2019-02-07,TCS,"Only a handful of stocks, including RIL, Infosys Ltd. and TCS have driven the gains in the NSE Nifty 50 IndexThe market may begin to broaden now that the Nifty has reclaimed the key psychological level of 11,000

Mumbai: The benchmark equity gauge of India’s 50 biggest companies reclaimed the 11,000 level after four months on Wednesday, but not all investors are celebrating.
Only a handful of stocks, including Reliance Industries Ltd. and software exporters Infosys Ltd. and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. have driven the gains in the NSE Nifty 50 Index since the year started. What’s more, about 40 percent of the gauge’s members are trading below their prices from three months ago, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Anemic breadth among frontline stocks aside, confidence in the broader market has also been busted recently by the meltdown in stocks teeming with risky debt. The Nifty Midcap 100 Index has slid to near its lowest level since October, led by companies such as Dewan Housing Finance Corp. that lost almost half its market value last week and Anil Ambani’s Reliance Infrastructure Ltd., which plunged 32 percent on Wednesday.
“It is a bipolar market where the main index has gained but bulk of the stocks remain in negative territory,"" said Dharmesh Kant, head of research at Mumbai-based Indianivesh Securities Ltd. “The uncertainty around elections, concerns regarding leveraged companies and possible debt defaults is dragging down the broader market.""
Why are some of the biggest names in the Nifty rising? The answer lies in the flows from global exchange-traded funds, which typically deploy cash in few heavyweights in times of uncertainty, Kant said. Foreigners have bought a net $144 million shares this month after withdrawing $75 million in January.
The market may begin to broaden now that the Nifty has reclaimed the key psychological level of 11,000, some analysts who study stock price moves say. A widely expected shift in the central bank’s policy stance to neutral at its rate decision due Thursday may also help turn the sentiment, according to Angel Broking Ltd.
“We expect the Nifty to hasten towards 11,200 and won’t be surprised to see the index extend the move toward 11,400 in the next few days,"" Angel said in a note Wednesday.

201,2019-02-11,TCS,"The top five IT firms added 99,010 employees last year to take their workforce to about 1.23 millionAnalysts say that there is no structural change to conclude that the pace of hiring will continue

New Delhi: India’s top 10 information technology (IT) companies added 114,390 engineers to their workforce in 2018, a more than four-fold increase from the previous year. While the numbers are the best in five years, few are predicting a similar showing in 2019.
Much of the jobs added in 2018 may have been because of increased hiring in the US under pressure from the Donald Trump administration and customers outsourcing large contracts on the condition that the vendors absorb some of their employees, two human resources (HR) executives said.
Although none of the companies disclosed details of hiring in the US or the number of employees absorbed from clients, the HR executives claimed that at least half of the net hiring made by companies in 2018 is on account of one of these two reasons.
The top five IT firms—Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Cognizant Technology Services Corp., Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd—added 99,010 employees last year to take their workforce to about 1.23 million as against an addition of 19,360 people in 2017, according to an analysis by Mint.
The rest of the top 10—Tech Mahindra Ltd, Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd, Mindtree Ltd, Cyient Ltd and Zensar Ltd—added just 15,380 engineers compared with 2,796 in the previous year.
India’s $167 billion software services industry employed 3.7 million people at the end of December and the 10 largest companies accounted for 38% of them.
Some experts say last year’s jump looks more like a temporary recovery as the industry undergoes a structural change from a people-led model to a platform-based approach.
“I see the global economy slowing this year, and IT hiring will slow with it. Plus, the emerging IT services models will ultimately require fewer people to support it with smarter automation and the use of platforms,"" said Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing-research firm.
For now, stable macroeconomic growth in both the US and Europe has made more companies across industries spend more on outsourcing technology work, resulting in higher demand for services offered by IT outsourcing companies.
Unsurprisingly, a few analysts expect the sector to grow at faster pace in 2019 than in the recent past.
“(A)nnual growth rates in CC (constant currency) slowed in CY (calender year) 2017 by ~250bps (basis points) y/y across the Indian IT services industry, and improved in CY18 by ~90bps across the industry. Based on current Street estimates, we expect the Indian IT services industry revenue growth rates to continue to re-accelerate in CY19 at 9.3% y/y growth,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 6 February.
Mumbai-based TCS is expected to grow its revenue by more than 11% in constant currency terms while Infosys expects full-year revenue to grow, at best, 9% in the year ending 31 March.
A large number of big IT outsourcing contracts have seen some employees of clients join the workforce of technology vendors.
For instance, 9,000 of the 13,514 people added by Wipro in 2018 joined from Alight Solutions as part of an outsourcing contract. Wipro won a $1.6 billion deal from Alight Solutions LLC, the former benefits administration and human-resources outsourcing business of Aon Plc in September last year.
Infosys’s contract with Verizon and TCS’s two mega contracts—the over $2 billion, 10-year contract from Transamerica Life Insurance Co. and $1.36 billion over 10 years from a unit of British insurer Prudential Plc—also saw the two IT firms absorb employees from their clients. The Transamerica contract alone added 2,200 employees to TCS’s workforce, which totalled 417,929 at the end of December.
Not many expect IT firms to add as many people in 2019 as they added last year.
“There is no structural change to conclude that the pace of hiring will continue. The industry is going through a change and faces the same pressure from automation. Of course, we will continue to hire in the US. But overall hiring depends on client budgets, which in turn is tied to macroeconomic growth,"" an executive at Wipro said on the condition of anonymity.
“Talent in areas such as algorithm development and automation is increasingly scarce and expensive, which will stifle resources and put increased pressure on services firms to train junior or mid-level staff at a faster pace than ever. I predict hiring will slow in the second half of 2019 and not pick up aggressively until early 2021,"" said Fersht of HfS Research."
200,2019-02-13,TCS,"Persistent Systems has named IBM's Christopher O'Connor as CEO in place of Anand DeshpandeChristopher O'Connor is the second outsider within a week to lead an IT firm after Cognizant

New Delhi: When IBM’s Christopher O’Connor was named as the chief executive officer (CEO) of a Pune-based software services company on Monday, he became the second outsider within a week to lead an IT services company after Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.
Persistent Systems announced on Monday that Anand Deshpande, founder, chairman and managing director (MD), will transfer his CEO responsibilities to O’Connor over the next three quarters.
His appointment means six of India’s 11 largest IT services firms have hired external candidates as their CEOs in the last three years, underscoring the insider versus outsider debate in an industry that is facing business disruptions from newer technologies.
Until August 2015, five of these six companies, save for Infosys Ltd, had an internal candidate as their CEO.
Last week, New Jersey-based Cognizant, which has most of its employees in India, named Brian Humphries, currently CEO of Vodafone Business, as the successor to founder and CEO Francisco D’Souza.
Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd (LTI) first hired former Infosys executive Sanjay Jalona as CEO in August 2015, which was followed by Zensar Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Infosys all appointing an external candidate to steer their firms.
Incidentally, the decision by Infosys to appoint former Capgemini SE executive Salil Parekh as CEO in January 2018 followed the failure of the company’s earlier decision to entrust former SAP executive board member Vishal Sikka to lead the firm. Sikka left Infosys three years after taking over in August 2014.
At least one expert attributes this trend to most companies not having enough leaders to take on the top job. “If you include the examples of NIIT Technologies, Hexaware and ITC Infotech, then the number of companies total nine,"" said Navnit Singh, chairman and regional MD, Korn Ferry India, an executive search firm.
Former Infosys executive Sudip Singh took over as CEO at ITC Infotech on 1 February while NIIT appointed former Genpact executive Sudhir Singh to the top post in January last year. Hexaware appointed former HCL Technologies executive R. Srikrishna as its CEO in July 2014.
“Clearly the boards of these companies were looking for a kind of game-changer and did not want an internal candidate, who they believed is too seeped into a company’s working style. So, a company getting an outsider as a CEO is a reflection that they don’t have internal candidates,"" said Singh. “But you have to give credit to all these leaders as these companies are on a roll, despite the disruptions facing the industry.""
Age is another factor— most external hires are young. Cognizant’s new boss Brian Humphries, at 45, is the youngest. Sanjay Jalona was 46 when he was hired by LTI while Abidali Neemuchwala was 48 when he got the top job at Wipro.
“Competing companies with identical business models seek strikingly different attributes in their CEO. CEO selection inevitably carries uncertainty,"" JPMorgan Chase and Co. analyst Viju George wrote in a note dated 8 February.
George clubbed the hiring of outsiders as CEO under three categories. Companies that have consistently done well prefer to promote internal leaders to take on the top job, and this decision also carries the least uncertainty. TCS elevating chief financial officer Rajesh Gopinathan to CEO in 2017 is one such example.
Others, such as Infosys, Wipro, LTI and Zensar, appointed their new chiefs from within the IT industry, an indicator that they want a departure from current working styles, though they are still wary of bringing in a rank outsider, George said in his note.
Cognizant’s move to appoint Humphries, who is from the telecom sector, comes with an additional risk compared with other IT firms that have hired CEOs from within the industry. George, however, wrote that Humphries, because of having worked across finance, strategy and operations across the US, UK, Europe, and South Africa, is a “good"" choice."
199,2019-02-13,TCS,"Investors repose faith in Tata Sons chairman N. Chandrasekaran after the controversial ouster of Cyrus MistryMarket capitalization of all 28 listed Tata group companies rose to  ₹10.88 trillion as of 12 February

Mumbai: Investors have reposed faith in the ability of Tata Sons Ltd chairman N. Chandrasekaran to steer India’s biggest conglomerate to a healthier future in the aftermath of the controversy over the ouster of its former boss Cyrus Mistry. The overall market capitalization of Tata companies has risen by about 21% in the two years since Chandrasekaran took charge as chairman on 21 February 2017.
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), the company that Chandrasekaran ran for more than seven years before he was named group chairman, led the growth in market value.
Market capitalization of all 28 listed Tata group companies rose to  ₹10.88 trillion as of 12 February, according to corporate data provider Capitaline. Of the top 19 conglomerates, the market value of six had declined during this period.
TCS alone accounts for more than 70% of the group’s market value. The software services company’s market capitalization rose 39% to  ₹7.69 trillion in the two-year period.
Excluding it, the picture looks less rosy, with the Tata Group’s market capitalization declining 7.35% in the two-year period, underperforming the 19% gain in benchmark Sensex.
Among group companies, the shares of Tata Motors Ltd were the worst performers under Chandrasekaran’s leadership. With a current market cap of  ₹43,728.9 crore, Tata Motors has plunged 59% in the period. The auto maker has been under pressure because of its British luxury unit Jaguar Land Rover (JLR).
Tata Motors posted the biggest quarterly loss in India’s corporate history in the December quarter owing to an impairment charge for JLR, following which its shares plunged as much as 22.4% on 8 February, the auto maker’s biggest single-day drop since February 1993, which led to many brokerages slashing its target price.
Tata Motors reported a consolidated loss of  ₹26,993 crore after its biggest ever write-off of £3.10 billion for JLR. The write-off has been attributed to slowing sales in China and disruptions from a shift towards eco-friendly hybrid and electric vehicles.
JLR’s sales, which have been contracting every month since July, fell 6.4% from a year earlier in the December quarter to 144,600 vehicles. JLR is also facing headwinds such as the growth slowdown in China and uncertainties because of Brexit.
In terms of market capitalization, TCS is the second most valued stock in the country after Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).
“Our optimism on TCS is based on strong growth visibility backed by robust deal bookings and strong deal pipeline, scale and growth leadership in digital with increasing penetration in large accounts, revival in BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) vertical and better outlook supported by reduction in captive intensity, and efficient capital allocation,"" HDFC Securities Institutional Equities said in an 11 January note.
RIL, India’s second largest conglomerate, saw its market capitalization rise the most in percentage terms, jumping 81% to  ₹8.1 trillion, mainly on the back of its retail and telecom businesses in the same period. For purposes of this report, conglomerates have been considered as a group of listed companies that have the same promoters and are in different businesses."

This compares with about  ₹545 billion for all of 2018, which was the highest in at least six years, the data show.
“Buybacks this year are likely to equal the year before, if not exceed, as improving liquidity boosts cash flows for companies,"" said Sameer Kalra, president of Target Investing, an investment advisory firm based in Mumbai.
While the rush to return excess cash to investors is driven by the tax efficiency of buybacks over dividends, declining share values and a slowing global economy has helped accelerate the trend. Software exporters, which get a bulk of their revenue from abroad, are leading the pack as shrinking client budgets leave them with fewer opportunities to use their cash.
Infosys, Asia’s second-largest software exporter, last month said it would buy  ₹82.6 billion of its own stock. The offer accounts for about half of this year’s total deal value. Larger peer Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. completed a  ₹160billion buyback in 2018. Both companies have made the offers for a second time in as many years.
Shrinking valuations are also prompting smaller companies to buy their own stock, according to Indianivesh Securities Ltd. A gauge of midcap shares is down about 10 percent since Jan. 1, extending last year’s drop that was the biggest since 2011, amid an aversion to risk assets.
“The last couple of years, especially 2018, have been a washout for small and medium-sized firms, and despite recent earnings showing signs of economic recovery, investor reaction hasn’t been favorable,"" said Dharmesh Kant, head of research at Indianivesh. “The buybacks show the founders are confident about their business models.""
Even state-run firms, including Coal India Ltd., hydro-power generator NHPC Ltd. and iron-ore miner NMDC Ltd. are on a buying spree to help the government — their biggest shareholder — meet its asset-sale target.
Buybacks allow cash-rich state firms to return excess funds to the government in a tax-efficient manner than paying out dividends, which attract a distribution tax, Target’s Kalra said.

Here are 10 things to know about Sensex, Nifty fall today
1) IT stocks like TCS, Infosys and Tech Mahindra witnessing profit-booking today as these stocks had run up a lot as a defensive bet and are trading at higher valuations, said Umesh Mehta, head of research at Samco Securities.
2) For India Inc, the December quarter remained lackluster in terms of earnings growth. A Mint analysis of 2,018 listed companies (excluding banks, financial services firms and oil and gas companies) showed that aggregate profit growth, after adjusting for one-time gains or losses, was at 5.29% in the three months ended 31 December, the slowest in five quarters.
3) Many brokerages have cut their earnings per share (EPS) estimate for FY19 and FY20. “Our FY19/20 Nifty EPS estimates have been cut by 2.8/3.0% to  ₹496/629 (prior:  ₹510/648),"" domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal said in a note.
4) Further weighing on Indian markets, global oil prices have been on a rising trend in recent months.
5) International Brent crude oil futures have moved past $66 per barrel, the highest level this year. The price of crude has gained nearly 20% this year, driven primarily by the prospect of a decline in oil supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other top exporters such as Russia.
6) India’s trade deficit for January widened to $14.7 billion, from $13.1 billion in December, largely due to higher oil prices.
7) And going ahead, domestic brokerage Edelweiss expects the trade deficit to remain high. “We expect exports to remain weak owing to weak global demand. Further, crude oil prices are now higher than in the past two months. Crude prices and global demand remain key monitorables,"" the brokerage said.
8) The next major support for the Nifty is seen at 10,500 and if this level is breached, markets could head further lower, says Jayant Manglik, president of Religare Broking. Participants are now eyeing the global cues like US-China trade talks and global oil prices, in absence of any major event, he added. The next round of talks between the United States and China to resolve their trade war will take place in Washington from later today, with follow-up sessions at a higher level later in the week.
9) On the domestic front, profit-taking in private banking counters and IT majors, which were holding the benchmark index, are added negatives, he added.
10) Atul Bhole, vice-president and fund manager at DSP Investment Managers, said there were multiple factors dampening sentiment. “To begin with, Indian markets are quite expensive as compared to global peers, which is why other markets are preferred. Also, uncertainty around the elections is adding to the jitters,"" he said."

190,2019-03-04,TCS,"In conversation with TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan, who in many ways is like the company he leadsThe talk on death of IT outsourcing is gibberish, he says, while sharing the road ahead for TCS

New Delhi: In many ways, Rajesh Gopinathan is like the company he leads. 
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) does business without much fanfare and is set to record $20 billion in revenue in the year ending 31 March. Yet, few people outside the company understand the secret sauce of India’s largest information technology (IT) services company.
Unlike what most management gurus will prescribe, TCS believes in building tech and grooming talent in-house rather than acquiring firms or hiring people from outside for senior roles. Gopinathan, who took over as chief executive in February 2017, lacks many traits of what is expected from a leader of a large firm. Unlike most CEOs, Gopinathan is shy and soft-spoken, and his conversation is not laden with declarative statements.
Gopinathan credits the company’s fastest growth (TCS will grow more than 11% in constant currency terms in the current fiscal year) in four years to his team for helping him execute the strategy fashioned by his predecessor (and current boss of Tata Sons Ltd, Natarajan Chandrasekaran).
Last month, Gopinathan, in an interview in Mumbai, argued why talk of the death of IT outsourcing is gibberish and shared the road ahead for his company. Edited excerpts:
Nasscom has done away with the practice of giving a forecast and rather shared a CEO survey. Do you agree with Nasscom’s commentary for FY20?
I haven’t gone through it. It is too early for us to comment on how the next year will look like. There is no negative overhang. Neither is there any gung-ho spirit. All the negatives are known. The reality is that macro is very difficult to call. We are no longer considering macro as an input to make decisions. There is nothing, for now, that tells me that we have to re-prioritize. I don’t think that we will get into the scenario, where we have years which are very positive or years which are very negative. This kind of environment will continue for the foreseeable future.
Are we at the cusp of the golden age of tech spending, with digital becoming mainstream?
I don’t know if I should characterize it as the golden age but definitely we are well into a period where technology will be a primary component of the value chain in multiple industries. Let me explain. If you take a longer-term horizon, say over 25-30 years, tech spending has consistently been faster than the economic growth.
Now, about 10-15 years back, technology spend of a client was part of the Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A). SG&A is traditionally about 15% of the revenue of a company in most industries. And depending on the industry, tech spend was some percentage of this 15%. Over the last five years, technology spend is part of the cost of revenue. For any company, the cost of revenue is 50-60% of the total revenue. So that is an upside.
Does this shift mean tech spending for most companies, across industries, on a blended basis doubled?
The real world is more complex. If you take banking and retail, then these industries have shrunk over the last few years. However, their technology spends over long term has been outstripping their growth or even GDP growth over a long-term duration. Now, overall retail spend has been negative over 10 years. But overall technology spends in retail has been growing. So it should not surprise you that business from retail used to be about 3-4% of our overall revenue 15 years back. Now, retail accounts for about 12-15% of our total revenue.
Does this shift in tech spending offer an opportunity for firms like yours?
Huge addressable opportunity for firms like us. This is because of the contextual knowledge that TCS brings. I’ll explain. 
When it was about creating a web front or creating an app or creating a social media strategy, that initial spend may very well go to a digital or new age firm. But once you have 50 apps, and then you need to connect them with the supply chain or stock-keeping systems in the back-end, then you need to make sure the apps are built in a manner in which they can handle the supply chain systems. It should not be just the cool feature of the app alone. That is where competency shifts to a firm like us which can understand the functionality aspect.
A great example is in banking. Core banking systems are huge systems. So, for example, you create an app, and in the app, there is a feature of instant balance look up. Earlier, people used to look up their instant balance once a month. Now, people use this feature 10 times a day. The load on the back-end is going to be such that it doesn’t matter how good your app design alone is, the app will crash if you can’t fix it as a joint solution between the back-end and front-end.
So does this mean that a client’s tech spending has become de-linked or decoupled from economic growth?
Yes and no. At one end, you have an example like retail, where because of the industry is in a difficult situation, the technology spend has been definitely decoupled from economic growth. Then there are other industries like utilities. Here, because of the inherent resilience in their business models, because of their natural monopolies, although the regulators have been trying to break these monopolies, the tech spending is still tied to economic growth.
Let me ask you about your two-year stint. What are your thoughts?
The magnitude of transition at a personal level was much higher than the transition of an organization. This was because the team at the organization remained constant and the strategy remained the same. For me, it was more of a personal transition as there was a sudden change in my role.
What was the toughest thing about this job?
Chandra told us long back that the toughest thing of any job is to make sure that you leave your last job behind and don’t do it. Because the natural tendency for you is to do your previous job, and the toughest thing is to have the discipline not to do that previous job. The temptation to continue doing your earlier job is the toughest thing to let go. And the success for me personally has been that I have been able to make that transition.
This year, TCS will be ending with over $20 billion in revenue. At this size, if you don’t have an aggressive acquisition approach or unless you enter new service lines, how do you expect to grow at double-digit and incrementally add over $1 billion every year?
In 2012, we crossed $10 billion in revenue. Eight years later, we have crossed $20 billion. For years now, the narrative still continues, that we are nearing saturation, our largest industry segment banking industry is doing badly, our core verticals are seeing a slowdown, technology is changing, and our competitors are acquiring. But we have grown and transformed through this period by staying focused on staying and staying close to our customers and relentlessly investing in retraining our people. So just because we are now $20 billion, I don’t see a need to suddenly adopt an ""aggressive acquisition approach"".
What according to you is the future of the IT industry?
As long as you are disciplined, you’ll keep on growing. It’s a beautiful industry. There is no other industry that has multi-decadal growth visibility. All we have to do is execute well and to make sure our capabilities are in tune with where the opportunity lies. And we cannot be complacent. The thing that can derail us is complacency."
189,2019-03-05,TCS,"Many IT firms say that clients will continue to spend on newer technologies, irrespective of overall growth India’s largest IT services firm, TCS, sees this trend only in some industry segments

NEW DELHI :
As fast-paced changes reshape global retailers, carmakers and banks, these companies are spending more time and money on digital technologies to ensure that they don’t face annihilation because of disruptive innovation.
The increased spending has led to windfall business opportunities for information technology (IT) companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Capgemini SE, which say that such structural changes in client industries are gradually leading to decoupling of technology spending from economic growth.
While France’s Capgemini and HCL Technologies Ltd, India’s third-largest IT services company, claim that tech spending has more or less completely delinked from economic growth, TCS maintains that tech spending has decoupled only in some industries.
For over two decades, IT companies’ growth has taken cues from the economic growth in the US and Europe, the two markets that account for the bulk of their revenue. This is because historically, companies, across industries, have spent more on technology in times of good growth and tightened tech spending when growth slowed.
As digital technologies are structurally disrupting most businesses, companies from Citigroup to Walmart are looking at their IT vendors to help them run their business better.
Many IT companies say that clients will continue to spend on these newer technologies, irrespective of overall growth.
“Broadly speaking, companies will continue to spend because if they don’t transform their own business models, they will be exposed to a much bigger threat,"" Thierry Delaporte, chief operating officer of Capgemini, said in an interview.
Capgemini claims that digital revenue accounted for 45% of its €13.19 billion in revenue in 2018.
At Indian IT firms, including TCS, Infosys and Wipro, digital accounted for 30.1%, 31.5% and 33%, respectively, of revenue in the October-December 2018 period.
“Clearly, we are seeing client spending getting delinked from macroeconomic growth,"" said C. Vijayakumar, chief executive officer (CEO) of HCL Technologies.
However, India’s largest IT services firm, TCS, sees this trend only in some industry segments.
“At one end, you have an example like retail, where because the industry is in a difficult situation, the technology spend has been definitely decoupled from economic growth,"" said Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO of TCS. “Then there are other industries like utilities. Here, because of the inherent resilience in their business models, because of their natural monopolies, although the regulators have been trying to break these monopolies, the tech spending is still tied to economic growth.""
There are some, like India’s IT lobby group, Nasscom, and Infosys Ltd, which say that tech spending is still tied to global growth.
“For now, tech spend (of clients) is still very much linked to economic growth,"" said U.B. Pravin Rao, chief operating officer of Infosys. “This is because any slowdown in economic growth will impact a company’s growth and consequently the tech budgets of a client.""
Infosys’s view is mirrored by Nasscom.
“If the question is ‘if economies of the world are not doing well, will corporations continue to spend on digital?’, I would submit no. So, for now, there’s no decoupling (between economic growth and performance of IT firms),"" Nasscom chairman Rishad Premji said in an interview last year.
Most analysts agree, and say that is why IT stocks can still not be viewed in the same league as consumer staples such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) or ITC Ltd.
“There is a reason why consumer staples enjoy a premium over IT stocks, because, irrespective of economic growth, people will continue to buy the products of a company like HUL,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage on condition of anonymity. “Enterprise IT spend is still a function of macroeconomic growth and for this reason, it will be incorrect to assume that IT stocks should be viewed as consumer staples."""
188,2019-03-06,TCS,"Titan’s present market cap at  ₹90,000 crore outweighs that of revenue giants like Tata Steel & Motors

In a $110 billion group, comprising 30 companies scattered across such diverse areas as steel and software, who would have thought that a small watch company would emerge as the second largest in terms of market capitalization and the fastest growing over the last three years?
Yet, this week, as a Business Standard story pointed out on Monday, Titan’s market cap scaled  ₹90,000 crore, well below that of software heavyweight Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), but nearly 60% more than that of revenue giants Tata Steel and Tata Motors.
Titan’s success is the story of steady and sterling leadership by two men, Xerxes Desai and Bhaskar Bhat, who helmed the company for all its 34 years in business. Desai, the man who wanted to be an Oxford don but came back at J.R.D. Tata’s bidding to set up a watch company, presided over the company’s first decade and a half of growth, in which time it established itself as India’s leading watch brand. Under Desai, the humble watch—till then symbolized by public sector entity HMT’s mechanical products or imports from abroad—became a fashion statement, a symbol of class best exemplified by its signature tune, an excerpt from Mozart’s 25th Symphony, personally picked by Desai.
However, by the end of the last century, as the watch business slowed, the company’s diversification into the jewellery business in 1995 was weighing heavily on its overall performance, already dragged down by debts following an ill-advised blitz into several European markets.
Enter Bhaskar Bhat as managing director in 2002. Tasked with engineering a turnaround of sorts, he faced a baptism by fire as a large-scale layoff was followed by a lockout at the company’s plant. After dousing those early fires, Bhat proceeded to execute a well-honed strategy of entering unorganized segments of the Indian market and gentrifying them. With this came crafted watches, jewellery, youth accessories such as bags and belts, eyecare products and, later, fragrances and saris.
The results have been spectacular. Titan is today one of the two jewels in the Tata crown. And, therein lies the problem, since its continuing success casts a questioning shadow over many of the other companies that are a part of India’s largest conglomerate and have, for years, been sucking up resources without really delivering results.
The conglomerate model, as rolled out by the likes of Harold Geneen and Jack Welch, was a consequence of the low interest rate regimes in the US following the Second World War, which in turn, helped finance a spate of leveraged buyouts. Conglomerates made sense till such time as capital markets lacked the depth and sophistication needed to back businesses at various stages of evolution and growth. They lost steam once those markets evolved to serve all comers.
Through the 1960s, Geneen made hundreds of acquisitions across a diverse collection of businesses ranging from telegraph equipment to insurance and hotels, to build International Telephone and Telegraph Corp., the company he headed, into a $17 billion conglomerate by 1970. Today, some four decades later, all that remains of that diversified portfolio colossus is a $2.5 billion business making specialty components for the aerospace, transportation, energy and industrial markets.
By the 1990s, most US corporations had come around to reaffirming their faith in specialization and focus, prompted in large measure by the teachings of management gurus like the late Coimbatore Krishnarao Prahalad, who in 1990 co-authored an article for the Harvard Business Review titled The Core Competence Of The Corporation, in which he urged executives to identify their organization’s core competencies that could foster growth.
It wasn’t as if the conglomerate idea fell off the cliff overnight. A 1994 study showed that for each of the years 1985, 1989 and 1992, over two-thirds of the Fortune 500 companies were active in at least five distinct lines of business.
Late last year, United Technologies, one of the best known industrial conglomerates after its acquisition of Otis Elevator in 1976 and Carrier Refrigeration in 1979, announced that it would spin off both those divisions into separate companies and focus on its core aerospace business.
This, coupled with the struggles of General Electric—once the world’s largest industrial conglomerate—as it looks to sell off pieces of its operations indicates that the era of conglomerates seems to have ended in the US.
In India though, conglomerates still rule the roost, accounting for nearly 50% of the corporate sector’s revenues. Yet, the success of focused companies in newer businesses such as IT, telecom, banking, auto, aviation and e-commerce shows that the conglomerate premium may be declining even in India. A study by Bain and Co. last year concluded: “Conglomerates in India and Southeast Asia no longer hold an advantage in total shareholder returns over pure plays and have begun to underperform in revenue growth and margin improvement.""
Significantly, the study’s list of conglomerates in the region that have continued to thrive despite the odds had a number of Indian groups, including Bajaj, Wadia, Murugappa, Lalbhai, Godrej, Emami and Torrent, but not Tata.

187,2019-03-09,TCS,"No GST on Tax Collected at Source (TCS) from consumers who make high value purchases such as premium carsA circular issued in December had said that the value of the product on which GST is to be levied is inclusive of TCS

New Delhi: The finance ministry on Friday provided relief to traders by withdrawing a rule that required them to charge goods and services tax (GST) on the compulsory income tax to be collected at source (TCS) from consumers who make high value purchases such as premium cars. A circular issued in December had said that the value of the product on which GST is to be levied is inclusive of TCS, leading to confusion among traders as it amounted to a tax on tax.
The Income Tax Act mandates a marginal tax to be collected at source on certain high-value transactions to ensure that those who make large purchases do not under-report their income. This tax is available as a credit at the time of making the income tax payment.
However, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) issued a circular on Friday clarifying that such income tax collected at source by dealers—over and above the value of the goods sold—and paid to the government on behalf of the consumer is not subject to GST.
CBIC said that the income tax department has clarified that the TCS was just an interim levy on the ""possible income"" of the buyer. There is a TCS of 1% on automobiles with an ex-showroom price of above  ₹10 lakh.
“For the purpose of determination of value of supply under GST, tax collected at source under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961, would not be includible as it is an interim levy not having the character of tax,"" Friday’s circular said.
The clarification comes as a relief for businesses, especially the automobile sector, according to experts. 
“While most industry players already believed that GST should not be levied on the income tax’s TCS component, the earlier clarification to the contrary made them quite apprehensive of litigation on this aspect,"" said Abhishek Jain, tax partner, EY.
The government on Thursday issued a clarification on another vexed tax problem faced by traders. It said that traders will not be denied credits for taxes paid while sourcing goods that are eventually given away free under discount schemes such as ‘buy one, get one free’."

TCS, HDFC Bank, ITC, HDFC, SBI, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank were also on the gainers' side, while HUL and Infosys suffered losses in their market capitalisation (m-cap) for the week ended Friday.
During the last week, the Sensex gained 607.62 points or 1.68 per cent to close at 36,671.43 on Friday.

Mumbai: India's most valued lender HDFC Bank Ltd crossed the  ₹6 trillion market capitalisation for the first time on Wednesday, making it only the country's third firm to achieve the milestone.
Intra-day, the stock touched a fresh record high of  ₹2,233 on the BSE, up 2.87% from its previous close. The scrip closed at  ₹2,226.10 on the BSE, up 2.56%, with a market capitalisation of  ₹6.06 trillion. The Sensex rose 0.58% to end at 37,752.17 points.
HDFC Bank's stock gained for the fifth session in a row, rising as much as 6% during the period. Year-to-date, it has advanced 5%.
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) are the other two companies that crossed the market capitalisation of  ₹6 trillion. RIL remained the most-valued company with a market value of  ₹8.54 trillion, followed by TCS with a market value of  ₹7.51 trillion.
HDFC Bank’s steady 20% profit growth quarter-after-quarter as well as its immunity to the bad loans crisis have helped the stock. Investors continued to remain buyers in the stock due to its healthy asset quality, superior deposit franchise credit underwriting and structurally better net interest margin.
But asset quality of the bank has deteriorated marginally over the last three years on account of cyclical trends in its agri-loan portfolio, patchy monsoon and farm loan waivers announced by various state governments.

In intraday trade, HDFC Bank shares rose 2.62% to a record high of  ₹2,227.40 apiece on the BSE. At 1.30pm, the scrip was trading at  ₹2,224.40, imparting the private sector lender a market cap of  ₹6.06 trillion.

The HDFC Bank stock has gained for the fifth session in a row, rising as much as 6% in this period. Year to date, it has advanced 4.8%.
HDFC Bank’s steady 20% profit growth quarter-after-quarter as well as its immunity to the bad loans crisis has helped the stock. Investors continued to remain buyers in the stock due to its healthy asset quality, superior deposit franchise credit underwriting and structurally better net interest margin.
But asset quality of the bank has deteriorated marginally over the last three years on account of cyclical trends in its agri-loan portfolio, patchy monsoon and farm loan waivers announced by various state governments.

182,2019-03-15,TCS,"Tata Sons' brand value grew by 6% in 2018, mainly due to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)The combined value of the top 40 brands stood at  ₹50.03 billion in 2018, a 5.2% growth over the previous year

New Delhi: Tata, Reliance and Airtel emerged as the top three Indian brands of 2019, according a report published by Interbrand, part of the Omnicom Media Group, an advertising and public relations conglomerate.
Tata continued to hold the top position in the best Indian Brands ranking as its brand value grew by 6%, mainly due to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Knocking its competitor Airtel off from the second spot, Reliance's brand value grew by 12%, bolstered by the success of Jio. This also explains the 13% degrowth in Airtel’s brand value. Following Airtel at number three, HDFC Bank, LIC, State Bank of India, Infosys, Mahindra, ICICI Bank and Godrej rounded off the top 10 list.
The Interbrand’s annual ranking is based on three key components — financial performance, the brand's role in influencing customer choice and strength, and the premium price that the brand commands. The combined value of the top 40 brands stood at  ₹50.03 billion in 2018, a 5.2% growth over the previous year. Financial services and automobile contributed the most to the year’s Top 40, with 27% and 10% growth in brand value, respectively.
In its sixth year, the Best Indian Brands ranking saw retail making its presence felt. Kishore Biyani-owned Big Bazaar grabbed the 33rd spot with  ₹26.86 billion, along with supermarket chain DMart at 37 with  ₹20.15 billion. Along with Big Bazaar and DMart, Nerolac Paints, which came in at 39 with a brand value of  ₹19.19 billion, were the three new entrants in this year’s ranking.
Automobile sector grew at an average 16% with brands such as Royal Enfield, Bajaj Auto, Ashok Leyland, Hero, Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra demonstrating a higher than average growth.
Tata’s jewellery and accessory brand Tanishq, motorbike brand Royal Enfield, Kotak, Bajaj Auto, Ashok Leyland and Britannia were amongst the fastest-growing brands. Meanwhile, Reliance Group and Canara Bank exited this year’s list.
“Many brands that are creating value are actually reinventing the category. The best example of a global brand is Amazon and the local counterpart is Jio, which has enabled digital life in the country,"" according to Ashish Mishra, managing director, Interbrand India.
While the luxury sector registered a 42% growth in brand value, Mishra said many brands outside the luxury category were adopting the luxury mindset. “They offer personalised experiences to customers, excellence in craftsmanship and community. Automobile brands have improved their dealerships and introduced innovations. In the retail sector, a brand like Big Bazaar has adopted a luxury mindset by changing its design language and store formats,"" he added."

Mumbai: The Bombay High Court on Monday stayed till 27 March the proceedings before a magistrate court in a 2016 criminal defamation case filed by Nusli Wadia against Ratan Tata and some other directors of Tata Sons.
A single bench of Justice Mridula Bhatkar stayed the proceedings through an interim order.
Justice Bhatkar will now hear a petition filed by Tata and other directors of Tata Sons seeking to quash the defamation case against them on 27 March.
Therefore, Justice Bhatkar directed the magistrate's court to refrain from proceeding with the hearing on the defamation case until then.
In December 2018, the magistrate court had issued notices to Ratan Tata and other directors of Tata Sons in the criminal defamation case filed by Wadia and then posted the matter for further hearing on March 25, 2019.
Wadia had filed the case in 2016 after he was voted out of the boards of some Tata Group companies.
Wadia had claimed that Tata and the others had made defamatory statements against him after they removed Cyrus Mistry on 24 October 2016 as the group chairman of Tata Sons.
Wadia was on boards as independent director of group companies such as Indian Hotels Company that runs the Taj group of hotels, TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, among others.
He was voted out by shareholders at a specially convened general meeting between December 2016 and February 2017.
He said he approached the magistrate's court as he was not satisfied with the explanation the respondents (Tata and others) had given him following his letters to them.
He therefore initiated defamation proceedings against the respondents under Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code.
Wadia is represented in the high court by advocate Abad Ponda.
Ratan Tata and others are represented by former Union Minister P Chidambaram, Congress party leader and senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi, and others.
All parties present in the high court on Monday had urged the court to stay the proceedings before the lower court until the quashing plea was heard by the court.

180,2019-03-21,TCS,"HCL Tech expects to generate $1.3 billion in revenue over the next seven years from its contract with XeroxThe deal marks the renewal of HCL Tech’s engagement with Xerox, which had first awarded a ten-year contract in 2009

New Delhi: HCL Technologies Ltd expects to generate $1.3 billion in revenue over the next seven years from its contract with Xerox Corp., the US printer and photocopier giant. Noida-based HCL Tech, which last year surpassed Wipro Ltd to become India’s third largest IT company, said on Tuesday that the deal marks the renewal of the company’s engagement with Xerox, which had first awarded a 10-year contract in 2009. HCL Tech did not, however, disclose the financial details of the earlier contract.
“This expanded partnership is a testament to the strong Xerox-HCL relationship that has grown through multiple collaborations over the past 10 years,"" said C. Vijayakumar, chief executive officer of HCL Technologies.
Under the terms of the contract, HCL Tech will help Xerox in administrative and support functions, according to a statement released by the company.
As part of this contract, HCL will absorb some employees from Xerox.
HCL Tech’s latest deal win is the second mega deal win for the company in the last four years. It had bagged $1.6 billion, five-year contract, from Swedish auto maker Volvo AB in October 2015.
Significantly, HCL Tech’s contract with Xerox is the fifth multi-year mega deal won by Indian IT firms in the last 15 months. The other four contracts have brought in at least $7.2 billion in revenue.
In December 2017, India’s largest IT firm Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) signed a $2.25 billion, eight-year contract with Nielsen, a TV ratings measurement firm, and followed it up with an over $2 billion, 10-year contract with a unit of Dutch insurer Aegon NV in January 2018. Last June, TCS won a third mega deal worth $1.36 billion, for over 10 years, from a unit of British insurer Prudential Plc.
In September, Wipro won its largest contract, valued at $1.6 billion over 10 years from Alight Solutions Llc, the former benefits administration and HR outsourcing business of Aon Plc.
HCL Tech, which ended with $7.84 billion in revenue last year, expects at-best 9.9% dollar revenue growth in the current financial year, implying that it expects to end FY19 with $8.6 billion in revenue.
On Wednesday, HCL Tech shares rose 0.45% to  ₹1,039.25 apiece on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex ended the dayflat at 38,386.75 points.

178,2019-04-05,TCS,"How a bunch of entrepreneurs built Mindtree over two decades but forgot to fence it against a hostile takeover by L&T

New Delhi: Late one Sunday evening in March this year, V.G. Siddhartha, who was in Mumbai, texted Mindtree Ltd’s executive chairman Krishnakumar Natarajan in Bengaluru about his decision to sell 20.3% shares the founder of the Café Coffee Day had held for close to two decades in the information technology (IT) outsourcing company to Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T). An agitated Natarajan, who knew that the company risked an ownership change, spoke to his friend and another co-founder Subroto Bagchi, who was in Bhubaneswar, more than 1,700km from Mumbai.
Three years ago, Bagchi had relinquished his role as executive chairman of the firm to devote time to his new calling as chairman of Odisha Skill Development Authority.
Though immersed in his new role, Bagchi hadn’t forgotten Mindtree. After all he, along with nine other friends, had set up the company on 18 August 1999.
“An imminent threat of hostile takeover of Mindtree has made me to resign from the government to be able to go, save the company. I must protect the Tree from people who have arrived with bulldozers & saw chains to cut it down so that in its place, they can build a shopping mall,"" Bagchi tweeted at 8.37pm on 17 March.
An imminent threat of hostile takeover of Mindtree has made me to resign from the Government to be able to go, save the company. I must protect the Tree from people who have arrived with bulldozers & saw chains to cut it down so that in its place, they can build a shopping mall.
Seven minutes later, he tweeted again.
“Mindtree has not been designed as an “asset"" to be bought & sold. It is a national resource. It has a unique culture that humanizes the idea of business. It sets the standards of corporate governance. I need to be there in its time of difficulty. Hence the hard decision to return.""
Mindtree has not been designed as an “asset to be bought & sold. It is a national resource. It has a unique culture that humanizes the idea of business. It sets the standards of corporate governance. I need to be there in its time of difficulty. Hence the hard decision to return
Over the next 48 hours, the three co-founders, including Natarajan, Bagchi and chief executive Rostow Ravanan, played the emotive card to express their unhappiness over what was India’s first hostile takeover bid in the IT services sector.
Not everyone was impressed. “Quite clearly, the bulldozer tweet and the decision to cast L&T as a villain is something the founders could have avoided. This is not how business leaders run,"" said an executive at a large IT firm, requesting anonymity.
But Natarajan, Bagchi and Co. aren’t cast in the same mould as other business leaders. To understand their present woes, one needs to go back to the beginning.
A brief history of the Tree
Fifteen years before the country was witness to the startup frenzy of 2014, Mindtree was set up by 10 friends, who came from Wipro Ltd, Cambridge Technology Partners Inc. and Lucent Technologies in 1999. Ashok Soota, who was then the vice-chairman of Wipro’s IT services business, had started discussions with Siddhartha, the firm’s first investor. After another two rounds of meetings, Soota was convinced, and told Azim Premji, Wipro’s charismatic chairman, about his decision to leave the company in February that year.
Over the next five-and-a-half months, a period which also witnessed the first dotcom boom in India, eight other co-founders joined Soota. Siddhartha and venture capital firm Walden Software put in about $8 million, while Soota and his eight friends came up with $1.4 million.
Finally, on the morning of 19 August, the nine co-founders, led by Soota, who was appointed as chairman and managing director, announced Mindtree to the world at a press conference in Bengaluru. A get together in the evening at Taj Residency was attended by over 100 guests, including Premji and Nandan Nilekani of Infosys Ltd.
S. Janakiraman, who was Wipro’s global head of research and development at the time and who would join in October as the 10th co-founder, was understandably missing from the party.
Mindtree, which raised $9.5 million, was valued at $40 million in 1999. The 10 co-founders, together, owned 75% of the new company while Siddhartha and Walden Software, which exited in 2012, owned the remaining 25% shares.
In 1999, Wipro’s IT services business was a tad over $100 million while Infosys had ended the financial year with $120 million in revenue. In 2001, Capital Group invested $10 million while an additional $4.4 million was put in by Franklin Templeton (Siddhartha got them into the company), Soota, Siddhartha and Walden. By now the firm’s valuation had jumped to $80 million. Six years later, Mindtree, after having raised over $24 million, went public in February 2007.
Mindtree, like many of the other IT vendors, deploys engineers to do software testing, manage IT infrastructure and write codes for applications that eventually help its clients, from Microsoft Corp. to Southwest Airlines Co. run their business. It wasn’t a unique proposition but investors still liked the IT story and its shares were subscribed 110 times.
Now, the company’s founders owned about 35.46%, a number that would progressively go down even as they focused on building a unique work culture incorporating some of the best practices from companies such as Infosys and Wipro.
Indeed, Mindtree’s two-decade journey is full of moments that can be the stuff of business school curriculums. One such instance shows how the firm won an account. A month after he had joined Mindtree as head of marketing, Joseph King arrived in Mindtree’s US office early one morning and made a direct call to Larry Kinder, the chief information officer (CIO) of Avis, the car rental firm.
“The IT business is all about relationships. So Joe came into the office early and called directly because he realized that was the only time he could connect with him as the receptionists would not have come in at that hour,"" Soota recounted in an interview.
Kinder took the call, liked the story, gave Mindtree executives an appointment and finally agreed to give them business, which over a three-year period became a $7 million account.
“I was employee no. 7 in the US and I joined Mindtree on 4 October 1999,"" said Joseph King, who now heads marketing and communications for Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) in the US. “I remember speaking to the Avis CIO in November 1999 and we started our engagement there in early 2000.""
However, the company also had its fair share of near-death experiences. The dotcom crash in 2000 was the first, followed quickly by the 11 September 2001 terrorist attack. “The second round of funding, led by Capital Group, got closed in the first week of September 2001, days before 9/11,"" said Janakiraman. “Post 9/11, it was a different world and imagine what would have happened had there been any delay.""
The financial crisis in 2008 was another. The company’s failed move to make mobile handsets, after it paid $8 million to buy Kyocera Wireless’s India R&D unit in 2009, only to shelve it later, was yet another. This failed attempt was too big a setback for Soota, who was spearheading this move. He decided to leave the company in 2011 and subsequently sold his 11.6% shares to Siddhartha, whose ownership increased to 20.32%.
Finally, Mindtree’s long restructuring exercise, which saw the firm hire management consulting major Bain and Co. in 2013, was another phase when both growth and profitability took a hit.
But Mindtree steered through each of these setbacks. Four reasons essentially explain how Mindtree survived many of the challenges it faced.
During the dot-com crisis, when almost 198 of the 200 companies that were set up in 1999 crashed, Mindtree had enough money to steer through the stress. “We survived because we had taken a lot of money and we still had money when the dot-com crash happened,"" said Soota.
Second, the decision to include engineering business helped the firm diversify with an alternative revenue stream.
Third, during the dot-com crash and then again during the financial crisis of 2008, the senior management, led by the founders, agreed to take salary cuts. Salaries of senior management were cut by 20-25% while mid-level managers agreed to a 10% cut. Finally, there was the excellent rapport between the founding team and the key investors, the two VCs in Walden Software and Siddhartha.
Betrayal or Bailout
So when the crunch came in 2018, why did Siddhartha choose to sell his crucial 20.32% stake in Mindtree at  ₹980 a share to L&T, even though the founders had repeatedly expressed their reservations to him about India’s largest engineering and construction company which had in the past, too, made overtures for a stake sale? After all, just two weeks before L&T’s announcement on 18 March, another global private equity firm had agreed to buy the shares at  ₹975, in a deal that was acceptable to Mindtree founders.
Siddhartha was forced to sell his shares because of a sudden liquidity squeeze in the lending markets, triggered by defaults in payments by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd in August. It led to his lenders calling in  ₹3,000 crore of loans given to him against his entire holding in Mindtree which had been pledged. 
With repayment deadlines fast approaching, he needed to monetize his holding in Mindtree at the earliest. However, none of the dozen-odd private equity firms, sovereign funds and long-term funds which were interested in buying his shares was okay with a complex deal. This was because for any sale to take place, the potential buyer needed to pay for the unpledging of the shares before buying them or at least agreeing to an arrangement wherein the shares stayed with the banks even while the transaction to sell them was underway. A deal just couldn’t happen as none of them was willing to pay unless the shares were transferred.
“They could have tried to get Infosys’s founders, including (N.R. Narayana) Murthy, (S.D.) Shibulal, and Krish (Senapathy Gopalakrishnan) to pick up some shares,"" said a former Infosys executive. “They would not have risked losing control of their firm. But the founders (Mindtree) thought nothing will happen to them.""
Natarajan does not comment on why the firm could not have got a friendly investor from an existing IT firm to buy Siddhartha’s shares, saying the founders did everything they could. It is also possible that at this moment of crisis, they missed Soota’s contacts and astuteness.
“Ashok was clearly the captain,"" said Janakiraman. “He was more like a father-figure to all of us and helped us stay sane as we sorted through each of the episodes.""
So did Mindtree miss Soota during this period? “Possibly,"" said Janakiraman.
“Absolutely not,"" Natarajan said, adding that the founders did everything possible to fend off the hostile takeover bid.

What is clear is that their inability to buy the shares of the five co-founders who exited the company over the years, in the process leaving the current founders with just 13.32%, cost them dearly—perhaps even their control over the company. Thus, when Soota exited in 2010, he sold his substantial 11.61% stake to Siddhartha. Ditto for Kalyan Banerjee and Anjan Lahiri, who together sold 2.06% in the open market.
Looking ahead
Even as Mindtree’s four independent directors evaluate the unsolicited offer by L&T, it appears a given that L&T will eventually get to own Mindtree.
L&T’s two listed technology firms, L&T Infotech Ltd and L&T Technology Services Ltd ended with $1.13 billion and $580.4 million in revenue, respectively, in the year ended March 2018. The company has said it intends to keep Mindtree, which ended with $846.8 million last year, separate for now. However, most analysts like JP Morgan Chase and Co. analyst Viju George expect parent L&T to combine the three entities once they, together, cross $5 billion in revenue. This will take at least three years, provided two of the three companies clock a 15% annual growth.
ALSO READ | A culture shock awaits Mindtree employees under L&T
Will combining the three firms be enough to compete against the large IT firms? Mumbai-based Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) will end the current year with more than $20 billion in revenue while Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., which follows January-December as the financial year, is expected to end with over $17 billion. Bengaluru-based Infosys will end with over $11 billion while HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd will end with more than $8 billion each.
Clearly, L&T’s consolidated IT business will still lack enough firepower to compete against the big boys of the industry. At best, it will be competing with Tech Mahindra Ltd, GlobalLogic and other mid-tier IT firms.

The downside risk is in the cultural mismatch. Mindtree’s informal culture, where many employees call members of the founding team by their first names is in contrast with command-and-control and top-down management at L&T.
For now, Mindtree founders don’t have many options other than to delay the inevitable and negotiate for a smooth transition. Management guru Peter Drucker best described it as: “Many problems cannot be solved; they have to be survived."" Ironically, Bagchi often recounted this to employees in the past when the company was faced with challenging times."

175,2019-04-08,TCS,"The note also that the banking and financial services vertical, a critical segment for the IT industry, is facing its own set of challengesGrowth challenges apart, the industry faces headwinds on the margins front

MUMBAI :
What goes up must come down. India’s information technology (IT) exports are estimated to have risen 9.2% in FY19, faster than the 7.8% growth in the preceding fiscal, according to industry lobby group Nasscom. With major IT companies set to report FY19 results and provide an outlook for the new fiscal, a moot question is if growth rates will scale down.
After all, apart from the high base effect for some companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, the industry needs to contend with a global slowdown. This double whammy has already hit growth at Accenture Plc, which reported results for the quarter ended February late last month. The company’s financial year starts in September and ends in August.
In the quarter ended August 2018, Accenture had reported revenue growth of 11% in local currency terms. But this year, growth slowed to 9.5% and 9% in the first and second quarters, respectively. Based on its guidance for the rest of the year, growth is estimated at 8.5% and 7% in the third and fourth quarters, respectively.
“Accenture indicated that macro uncertainties remain and budgets for next year will grow but less than last year,"" analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a 29 March note to clients. The fact that Accenture’s growth is dropping even in the March-August period, which coincides with a seasonally strong period for the sector, is a negative, the broker added.
But such worries are missing from the Street’s estimates of FY20 growth as well as commentary by top IT companies. Both seem quite sanguine. The general belief is that growth in FY20 will be more or less similar to that in FY19, on the back of large order wins in the past year. “Benefit from strong deal flow and increasing digital deal sizes will be offset to some extent with slower spending growth in budgets in FY20. We expect broadly similar industry growth in FY20,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a 29 March note to clients.
The note also that the banking and financial services vertical, a critical segment for the IT industry, is facing its own set of challenges. The segment’s contribution to Accenture’s revenue has fallen sharply, with growth slowing to just 2% in the February 2019 quarter from 7% in the year-ago period. “Any replication of weak BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance)/Europe trends at tier-1 IT could be a risk to Street growth expectations,"" Nomura’s analysts said.
Apart from the uncertain macro conditions, Accenture’s growth has been hit because of a high base in the year-ago period. Growth of 10-11% was among the highest in recent years, as the chart shows. Likewise, for Indian companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, growth picked up materially in FY19 and represents a relatively high base as well. But for some such as Infosys Ltd, which is in the middle of a recovery, growth may well turn out to be a tad higher this fiscal.
Growth challenges apart, the industry faces headwinds on the margins front. The rupee has appreciated materially in recent months, which in itself is a large setback as far as profitability is concerned. Besides, thanks to increasing restrictions on visas in the US, the cost of delivering on-site services has increased. “Profitability will face the test of increasing cost on-site,"" said Kotak’s analysts.
Despite all of these challenges, most IT stocks are now trading at a 25-30% premium to their five-year median valuation multiples, according to JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd. If growth rates do end up slowing down in FY20, so will these lofty valuations. After all, what goes up must come down.

174,2019-04-09,TCS,"Companies in the IT and banking sectors are expected to report decent numbersConsumption slowdown, especially in rural India, may weigh on automobile and FMCG earnings

Corporate earnings have been a constant source of disappointment for many quarters now. However, the tide seems to be turning. Bloomberg’s one-year forward consensus estimates for the Nifty’s earnings per share (EPS) are heading north (see chart).
The optimism is driven by the improving health of banks and expanding liquidity conditions. However, the ongoing consumption slowdown and subdued global growth cannot be ignored. In such a scenario, apart from the revenue and profit figures, investors should focus on cues about whether these estimates will sustain.
Automobiles: Tepid demand leading to high inventories can hit the earnings of auto companies. A watch on the demand outlook is, thus, essential. Investors will want to know the production strategies given that BS VI emission norms will be implemented from 1 April 2020. Concerns related to Brexit continue to haunt Tata Motors. Hence, investors would want to keep a watch on the commentary on Jaguar Land Rover.
Aviation: Financial woes at Jet Airways (India) Ltd pushed up airfares for metro routes during the quarter. IndiGo (InterGlobe Aviation Ltd) and SpiceJet Ltd are expected to gain. However, higher yields can be counter-balanced by a decline in the passenger load factor. In February, domestic passenger growth registered its slowest monthly gain in over five years.
Banks, NBFCs: Public sector banks’ recapitalization ratios will be watched. Commentary on unrecognized stresses in corporate loans, and the pace of bad loan resolution through the insolvency framework are crucial. Market share gain for banks from NBFCs is another important indicator. For NBFCs, the key parameters are asset-liability management, the liquidity outlook and the cost of funds.
Cement: March is a strong quarter for the sector. However, government-driven demand could have been impacted by the forthcoming general election. Choppy price trends make commentary on overall pricing important. As input costs ease, the outlook on margins is key. 
FMCG: Commentary on volume growth of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms is crucial after worries of a consumption slowdown have surfaced. Easing input costs make the outlook regarding margin growth important. Investors will be keen to know if ad spend will be trimmed.
Information technology: Usually, the March quarter is weak for the IT sector as customers are into their budgeting term. This time, however, the execution of recently-won deals would aid performance. Revenue guidance for fiscal year 2020 along with deal pipeline will be closely watched. Also, the outlook on the banking and financial services vertical, considering weak global macro conditions, is important. The impact of new stringent US H-1B visa norms on sub-contracting costs and hiring plans too will be crucial.
Real estate: Investors will want to know how the transition to new accounting standards and the new goods and services tax regime have impacted the sector. Buyers may have delayed purchases because of the latter. Launch pipelines and inventory data should be watched. Other vital cues will come from real estate pricing strategies and how debt levels are moving."

Analysts expect volatility to continue till the outcome of Lok Sabha elections is known. Lok Sabha elections begin 11 April and will be held over seven phases, followed by counting of votes on 23 May.
""In the near term, we continue to remain cautious on the Indian markets, as we believe choppiness is likely to remain high. In the coming sessions, focus of investors would shift to Q4FY19 earnings season and domestic macro data (IIP, CPI & WPI), which are likely to dictate the trend of the market,"" said Jayant Manglik, president for retail distribution at Religare Broking.
""Further, market participants would closely monitor the progress of central elections, behaviour of crude oil prices and fluctuation in currency, as it would further induce volatility in the markets.""

169,2019-04-11,TCS,"Global analyst projection for next year’s earnings at S&P BSE Sensex Index companies has jumped to a record high'We expect earnings to grow at 15 percent to 20 percent and that should drive markets higher,' said analysts

For stocks worldwide, it may be time to worry about the upcoming earnings season. But there’s one place where profit estimates are surging: India.
The fundamentals of corporate India are improving, and the average analyst projection for next year’s earnings at S&P BSE Sensex Index companies has jumped to a record high -- not just in rupee terms, but also in US dollars. That’s a stark contrast with members of the MSCI All-Country World Index and MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which have seen steady declines in estimates.
“We expect the earnings recovery momentum to continue this quarter as well with aggregate earnings growth expected in mid-double digits,"" said Jyoti Vaswani, the Mumbai-based chief investment officer at Future Generali India Life Insurance Co. overseeing  ₹40 billion ($570 million) in assets. She expects corporate banks to report a significant recovery in earnings, while retail banks are expected to continue with their steady performance.
The beginning of the earnings recovery may be apparent in results for the final quarter of the last financial year, ended March 31, particularly when it comes to banks. With financials accounting for more than a third of the Sensex, good results for the sector could help boost the nation’s stock market. A pickup in credit demand and a recovery in loans is helping the firms now, after a mountain of bad debt — especially at state-run banks — dented profitability last year and took the market down 14 percent from a peak.
“We expect earnings to grow at 15 percent to 20 percent and that should drive markets higher, bringing in foreign investors,"" Vaswani said. “With this, domestic investors, too, should start coming back.""
For the three months ended March 31, profit at NSE Nifty 50 Index members increased 15 percent, almost double the 8 percent pace a year earlier, Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. estimates. JM Financial Ltd. sees earnings-per-share up 17 percent, buoyed by financials and health-care companies, even as telecoms and autos remained a drag.

MUMBAI :
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), India’s largest IT services company by revenue, ended fiscal 2019 with double digit revenue growth as the company reported a 11.4% growth in constant currency terms in the fiscal ending 31 March, the company said in a statement.
For the March quarter, TCS reported a revenue growth of 2.4% from the preceding three months in constant currency terms. Revenue grew 12.7% from the same period a year ago.
This is TCS' fifth straight quarter of year-on-year double-digit revenue growth in constant currency terms.
For the March quarter, the company reported a revenue of  ₹38,010 crore and a profit of  ₹8,126 crore, beating street estimates. A Bloomberg survey of 29 analysts had estimated revenue of  ₹37,829.1 crore and a profit of  ₹7,970.7 crore.
""This is the strongest revenue growth that we have had in the last fifteen quarters. Our order book is bigger than in the prior three quarters, and the deal pipeline is also robust. Despite macro uncertainties ahead, our strong exit positions us very well for the new fiscal,"" said Rajesh Gopinathan, chief executive officer and managing director of TCS.
In terms of markets, growth was led by UK, which saw revenue increase by 21.3%, followed by Europe, where revenue increased 17.5%. North America grew at 9.9%. From a segment perspective banking and financial services segment grew in double digits at 11.6%.
“Double digit growth, higher quality of the incremental business, and best-in-class execution capabilities have helped us expand our operating margin year on year. Our foresight in investing very early on in building digital skills and transformational capabilities has not only gained us market share, but has also resulted in our very resilient, industry-leading margin today,"" said V Ramakrishnan, chief financial officer at TCS.
Shares of TCS closed on Friday at Rs2,013.75 apiece, down 0.26% on the BSE. The announcement was made after market hours."
168,2019-04-12,TCS,"Analysts expect TCS and Infosys to report 'healthy' revenue growth in March quarterMargins may face headwinds from wage inflation

India’s top software exporters, TCS and Infosys, report March quarter results today, kicking off the earnings season. Despite March being a seasonally weak quarter for IT companies, Elara Capital expects India IT services firms to report a good quarter of revenue growth. Another brokerage Motilal Oswal also sees IT companies reporting another quarter of “healthy"" set of numbers. “There is significant revenue acceleration amid strong momentum in deal activity; however, the rupee appreciation can act as a headwind,"" Motilal Oswal said in a note. Infosys and TCS shares edged higher today in early trade. 
Shares of IT companies have outperformed markets in the past one year, with Nifty IT index rising about 24% as compared to 11% gain for the Nifty50 index. Both TCS and Infosys are set to report earnings after market hours today.
The Indian IT sector has also been in the spotlight in the wake of some big deals in the sector. Baring Asia Private Equity has agreed to acquire the founders’ (promoters + NIIT) stake in NIIT Technologies. L&T bought a fifth of Mindtree from coffee baron VG Siddhartha and companies related to him for  ₹3,269 crore and said it planned to raise its stake to 66%.
Here are 5 things to watch out for in TCS, Infosys results:
Growth guidance: Infosys had in January raised its full-year revenue outlook to 8.5-9% in constant currency terms from the earlier 6-8%. Some analysts expect Infosys to guide for a higher growth in FY20. “We expect revenue growth guidance of at least 9-11% in constant currency terms, given the buoyant demand environment,"" Elara Capital said in a note.
TCS in the December quarter had posted a fourth straight quarter of year-on-year double-digit revenue growth in constant currency terms. Analysts say that TCS’ impressive deal wins over the past few quarters should help it maintain growth in the next fiscal.
Margins: The margin prospects of IT companies assume critical importance in the light of major cost headwinds in the form of wage inflation owing to talent shortage, say analysts. “Levers for margin defence are steadily eroding, with utilisation at reasonably high levels, rupee tailwind receding and investments in the business likely to remain a constant need to scale-up digital growth,"" Reliance Securities said in a note. “We would watch the margin picture in FY20, and believe growth, increasing automation and higher digital pricing owing to high demand are the key levers for margin defence.""
In the December quarter, Infosys profitability took a hit while Mumbai-based TCS too saw a contraction in operating margin. Infosys had reported an operating margin of 22.6% in the October-December quarter, 110 basis points narrower than the 23.7% in the July-September period. The operating margin of TCS had also narrowed by 90 basis points to 25.6% in October-December quarter from 26.5% in the July-September period, hurt by cross-currency movement and higher employee costs.
Elara Capital expects Infosys to guide for an EBIT margin guidance of 21-23% for FY20.
Management commentary: The commentary from top bosses from TCS and Infosys will be closely watched to gauge the demand scenario for IT services as global slowdown worries take centre stage. However, some analysts believe that the IT sector is poised for a multi-year spending uptick as it is in the middle of a major technology refresh cycle. “Despite macro headwinds, we expect commentary across most firms to be positive. The US economy continues to do well,"" analysts at Elara Capital said in a recent note.
Share buybacks: Return of cash to shareholders is a theme that continues to play out with many Indian IT services companies resorting to share buy-backs to make better usage of their cash balances. Bengaluru-based Wipro this week said that that its board will discuss buyback proposal on its meeting scheduled on April 16. A buyback can be done only once in 12 months. Infosys had earlier in January this year approved a  ₹8,260 crore share buyback, the second successive repurchase in as many years. In June last year, TCS had approved a  ₹16,000 crore share buyback.
BFSI vertical: IT companies could see a slower growth from the banking vertical for the industry in FY2020, says Kotak Institutional Equities. “Overall we expect broadly similar industry growth for IT services in FY2020 with growth to be front-ended,"" it added.
“The stock returns for IT companies can be muted from here after a strong performance in the past 12 months,"" says the brokerage."

Indian markets closer higher today, lifted by gains in banking, auto and FMCG stocks. Investors await cues from results of Infosys Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd later in the day. Analysts expect the IT bellwethers to report a good quarter of revenue growth but profitability could be hurt due to higher costs. Infosys rose 0.52% while TCS slipped 0.25%.
Investors also eye retail inflation data, which will be released after the close of market hours.
India's retail inflation is expected to have accelerated to 2.80% in March from 2.57% in February on slightly higher food prices, a Reuters poll predicted. It, however, remains under the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 4%.

New Delhi: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd kicked off Q4 earnings season on a strong note Friday, with their March quarter revenues growing by close to double-digits in dollar terms. The Tata company crossed the milestone of $20 billion in annual revenue for the first time while Infosys provided a reasonably acceptable margin outlook for the ongoing financial year.
TCS’ Q4 revenue rose 8.5% year-on-year to $5.39 billion. The net profit was up 7.8% at $1.15 billion, meeting a Bloomberg estimate of 20 brokers.
“Double-digit growth, higher quality of the incremental business, and best-in-class execution capabilities have helped us expand our operating margin year on year. Our foresight in investing very early on in building digital skills and transformational capabilities has not only gained us market share, but has also resulted in our very resilient, industry-leading margin today,"" said V. Ramakrishnan, chief financial officer (CFO) at Tata Consultancy Services.
Infosys’ Q4 revenue rose 9.1% on year to $3.06 billion. The company delivered on the top end of its 9% annual revenue growth outlook in constant currency terms, the outlook having been increased from 6-8% in the last quarter. It delivered on the Ebit margin outlook for FY19 as well, the metric coming at 22.8%, albeit towards the lower end of the company’s guidance of 22-24%.

Ebit stands for earnings before interest and taxes.
Profits of Infosys were up 1.7% at $581 million in the March quarter, higher than the Bloomberg estimate of $570.07 billion.
TCS continued its margin dominance with 25.1% in the just-concluded quarter, while Infosys came with a guidance that chimes with a challenging environment, as currency tailwinds are put behind and the US gets stricter with visa permissions.
Infosys has given an operating margin guidance of 21-23% on a revenue growth outlook of 7.5-9.5% in constant currency terms. In the last quarter, Infosys’ operating margin was 21.5%.
In constant currency terms, the March quarter revenue of TCS rose 12.7%, the fifth straight quarter of year-on-year double-digit revenue growth in constant currency terms for the Mumbai-based company. Infosys’ revenue growth in constant currency terms for the quarter was right behind TCS’s at 11.7%.
Infosys continues to suffer from high attrition, a concern accepted by chief operating officer Pravin Rao during a press briefing. The attrition rate increased to 20.4% in Q4FY19 from 19.5% in the same period last year. The company had net additions of 2,622 staff in the quarter gone by against TCS’s 6,356.
“...Realization per billed employee was steady, which reflects increasing usage of automation in core services and faster growth in newer digital services,"" said Rao. “Overall attrition remains high and we are continuing our focus on arresting the same.""
At a press conference, the TCS management brushed aside concerns on the impact of H-1B visa changes. The concerns arose as the US government had said a few months ago that the H-1B lottery selection process will be reversed to favour advanced degree holders from US universities. There is a yearly cap of 65,000 on new H-1B visa issuance, with an additional 20,000 visas for those with advanced degrees from a US institution.
“From an H-1B point of view, there are some changes, but a local degree was always a criteria. So there will be an advantage for people who have done masters in the US. Wherever we are we have to hire locally, that is the culture, and we have to meet the talent demand of the area,"" said Ajoy Mukherjee, executive vice president and global head of recruitment at TCS.
India is one of the largest beneficiaries of the popular H-1B visa regime that allows professionals to work there.
TCS chief executive officer and managing director Rajesh Gopinathan said that revenue from industry segments such as banking and financial services have improved and are in a much better position than last year.
“All elements of our strategy have worked this year,"" he said.
""We are more focused on opportunities at a customer level. Macro is important but macro doesn’t buy, customers buy. Our new deals have been built on organically invested assets to generate market leading opportunities in order to drive the digital champion status we are seeking.""
On Friday, TCS shares fell 0.26% to  ₹2,013.75 apiece on the BSE while those of Infosys gained 0.63% to  ₹747.85 per share. The benchmark Sensex gained 0.41% to end the at 38,767.11 points. The BSE IT Index gained 0.19% to close at 15,471.41 points.

TCS, which had acquired French SAP service provider acquire Alti SA for 75 million euros (about  ₹533 crore) in 2013, has been focussing on organic growth even as its global and domestic rivals went on an acquisition spree.
Infosys acquired consumer insights agency WongDoody for USD 75 million last year. Wipro's investment in the digital space includes entities like Designit and Cooper.
TCS, in November last year, announced the acquisition of W12 Studios (for an undisclosed amount). A digital design studio based in London, the acquisition of W12 was part of TCS' efforts to bolster its digital and creative design capabilities.
In the same month, TCS acquired the business of BridgePoint Group, LLC, a US management consulting firm (for an undisclosed sum).
Asked about the opportunities in the market, Subramaniam said there are options, especially among startups.
""Some of the startups are doing very well, blockchain is an area where lot of firms have come up. There are many who are working on future of financial services, future of cash, future of payments... so we continue to watch closely some of those technologies and startup firms, how their business models are emerging,"" he said.
Subramaniam asserted that if TCS found the right framework, it ""will not hesitate"" to make an offer.
""It has to make sense in terms of both value and the combined value of TCS and the asset that we are acquiring should really be great,"" he added.
The Mumbai-based company, which reported a 17.7% growth in profits at  ₹8,162 crore and 18.5% rise in March 2019 quarter revenues to  ₹38,010 crore, continues to remain bullish about growth this fiscal.
TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan on Friday described the fiscal as ""picture perfect year"" and stated that despite macro uncertainties ahead, strong exit (from FY19 positions the company very well for the new fiscal."
161,2019-04-14,TCS,"Order bookings at TCS and Infosys are robust, providing good revenue visibilityBut the premium valuations of both companies capture the growth expectations

IT behemoths Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd reported strong growth for the March quarter, clocking 2.4% and 2.1% sequential rises, respectively, in constant-currency revenue. The Street, at best, expected the companies to report a 2% growth.
The performance underscores strong execution and strong order inflows. Infosys signed large deals of $1.57 billion, taking the cumulative size of deals won to $6.28 billion for the full year. This is twice that of FY18. TCS also did well, bagging contracts of $6.2 billion last quarter, higher than the $5.9 billion of deals it secured in the December quarter.
The strong deal wins place both TCS and Infosys in a commanding spot for FY20. “Our order book is bigger than in the prior three quarters, and the deal pipeline is robust,"" said Rajesh Gopinathan, chief executive officer and managing director of TCS.
The commentary reinforces the belief that the growth momentum, which picked up in FY19 will continue in FY20. However, for investors looking for growth acceleration to justify further increases in the valuation of TCS and Infosys, the March quarter results provide limited levers.
The rising cost of business is increasingly undermining profitability. TCS’s operating margin contracted for the second straight quarter. It softened 30 basis points from a year ago to 25.1% in the fourth quarter of FY19. A basis point is 0.01%.
The impact is more pronounced at Infosys, which is behind in digital investments. Its operating margin dropped 3.2 percentage points from a year ago, to 21.5%. The continuing need for more investments means profitability could be suppressed in FY20 as well.
Infosys’s 7.5–9.5% constant-currency revenue-growth guidance for FY20 implies no significant acceleration from the year gone by. Its constant-currency revenue grew 9% in FY19. The company’s guidance may be conservative given the backdrop of its strong order book and guidance revision during FY19. However, it also underscores uneven recovery in its key business verticals.
Comparatively, key business segments at TCS have seen notable acceleration in growth rates from the year-ago quarter (Q4 of FY18). The better performance should help TCS maintain the valuation premium to Infosys. Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities estimates that the TCS stock trades at 22 times FY20 earnings estimates and Infosys, at 19 times. TCS’s valuation hinges on whether it can arrest the profitability erosion.
Investors need to be mindful of the softening business environment. Industry surveys show sluggish manufacturing activity in key markets of the US and Europe. Continued slowdown in the business environment could compel customers to delay execution, potentially delaying revenue accretion, warns Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities. How well these risks, macroeconomic and cost pressures, are managed will determine stock returns in FY20."
156,2019-04-15,TCS,"Infosys has guided for 7.5-9.5% revenue growth in constant currency terms in FY20Infosys operating margin in the March quarter dropped 3.2 percentage points from a year ago to 21.5%

IT major Infosys reported a mixed bag of fourth quarter numbers, with margins coming in below expectations even as revenues came in-line. Infosys also reported strong large deal wins during the quarter which came in more than $1.5 billion. Infosys’ guidance for this fiscal starting April 1, 2019, came in below the Street’s estimates. Infosys shares fell as much as 5% in early trade before closing 3% lower. Infosys' bigger rival TCS, which also reported Q4 earnings on Friday, jumped 5% today. 
Coming back to Infosys' fourth quarter numbers, the company reported strong 2.1% sequential rise in constant-currency revenue, underscoring strong execution and strong order inflows. This is the second successive quarter where Infosys has achieved more than 10% growth year-on-year in constant currency. The Bengaluru-based company said it signed large deals of $1.57 billion during the quarter, taking the cumulative size of deals won to $6.28 billion for the full year. This is twice that of FY18.
In this context, many analysts say that the growth momentum, which picked up in FY19 will continue in FY20. So, they view Infosys’ guidance of 7.5-9.5% growth in constant currency terms as conservative.
“We believe the IT major is being conservative in terms of its revenue guidance for FY19, which is slightly below what we were expecting (8-10%),"" Reliance Securities said in a note.
Ravi Menon, lead analyst for IT at Elara Capital, said that Infosys growth guidance for FY20 was ""disappointing"" given large deal wins in FY19.
In terms of profitability, Infosys operating margin in the March quarter dropped 3.2 percentage points from a year ago, to 21.5%, led by wage hike impact and possibly costs related to large deal integration. This was below the Street’s estimates. The company also expects margins to remain suppressed in FY20 as well, guiding for in a range of 21-23%.
Analysts also remained concern over rising attrition, which was above 20% in March quarter. “Attrition remains a bug-bear. This is an area that Infosys needs to focus given major digital talent shortage and attendant margin pressure due to wage cost inflation,"" Reliance Securities said in a note.
Another brokerage Centrum has revised Infosys ratings to ""Add"", from ""Buy"" earlier. ""Infosys’ Q4FY19 results delivered a steep miss on EBIT margin. The company has also lowered EBIT margin guidance band to 21-23% for FY20. We trim EPS estimates by 4.0/3.8% for FY20E/FY21E owing to the EBIT margin downgrade,"" it said in a note.
Centrum believes that the open-market buyback could act as a medium-term support for Infosys shares. Infosys initiated buyback from March 20, 2019, after receiving all requisite approvals. Out of total buyback size of  ₹8,260 crore, the company has bought back shares worth  ₹1,546 crore so far.
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), India’s largest IT services company by revenue, ended fiscal 2019 with double-digit revenue growth as the company reported a 11.4% growth in constant currency terms in the fiscal ending 31 March, the company said in a statement. For the March quarter, TCS reported a revenue growth of 2.4% from the preceding three months in constant currency terms. Revenue grew 12.7% from the same period a year ago.
This is TCS' fifth straight quarter of year-on-year double-digit revenue growth in constant currency terms.
In terms of deal wins, TCS also did well, bagging contracts of $6.2 billion last quarter, higher than the $5.9 billion of deals it secured in the December quarter.
The rising cost of business also hit TCS' profitability. Its operating margin contracted for the second straight quarter. It softened 30 basis points from a year ago to 25.1% in the fourth quarter of FY19.
Though Q4FY19 operating margin dipped 50bps QoQ, FY19 margin improved 80bps YoY. We attribute the latter to higher growth and excellent execution. Moreover, TCS’ investments in digital capabilities and sales initiatives are now reaping dividends. We believe, margin will sustain at the current level on account of robust revenue growth and tight leash on attrition.

157,2019-04-15,TCS,"TCS posted the strongest revenue growth in 15 quartersMany brokerages have revised TCS target price higher

TCS delivered another quarter of strong results, sending its shares as much as 5% higher. TCS shares settled 4.8% higher at  ₹2,110. TCS reported a better-than-expected 2.4% quarter-on-quarter growth (12.7% on year-on-year basis) in constant currency revenue in its fourth quarter ended March 31, 2019. This was the strongest revenue growth TCS had in the last 15 quarters.
Growth was broad-based, with most verticals showing strong growth. Revenue growth continued to accelerate in the key banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) vertical.
“From vertical perspective, all-round traction was witnessed with the key BFSI vertical growing in-line with the company average. This is a key positive,"" Reliance Securities said in a note.
TCS, India's biggest software exporter, said the company has achieved healthy order flows across multiple segments and from all major markets including Europe, the United Kingdom, India and the Middle East.
TCS bagged contracts of $6.2 billion last quarter, higher than the $5.9 billion of deals it secured in the December quarter.
“TCS’ strong order wins, improving growth in BFSI, all-round vertical growth, rising digital revenue and healthy Q4 exit rate drive confidence on underlying momentum, and we expect the IT major to comfortably post double-digit revenue growth in FY20. We are encouraged with margin management in a challenging environment. High payouts to shareholders in the form of buybacks, along with good visibility will ensure the stock remains at elevated valuations,"" Reliance Securities said in a note.
Reliance Securities has revised TCS target price higher to  ₹2,300, from  ₹2,190 earlier, while maintaining “Buy"".
""Though Q4FY19 operating margin dipped 50 bps QoQ, FY19 margin improved 80 bps year-on-year. We attribute the latter to higher growth and excellent execution. Moreover, TCS’ investments in digital capabilities and sales initiatives are now reaping dividends. We believe, margin will sustain at the current level on account of robust revenue growth and tight leash on attrition,"" Edelweiss Research said in a note. 
Centrum has also raised TCS target prices higher to  ₹2,220/share. ""Q4 revenue beat and a favourable exit revenue run-rate leads us to marginally raise USD revenue growth assumptions,"" the brokerage said. 
""Attrition remained modest at 11.4% and remains a key positive for TCS (vs Infosys reported standalone attrition of 18.3%). TCS’ ability to better retain talent could also have helped it deliver superior margin execution (vs Infosys, which has done multiple wage interventions in FY19 to stem attrition),"" Centrum Broking said."
154,2019-04-15,TCS,"Though there are some macroeconomic headwinds on the horizon, steady growth is expected over the next several years in the Indian outsourcing industry

This February, the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) stopped publishing its yearly estimate for India’s IT exports and refrained from providing guidance for fiscal year 2019-20. Nasscom numbers had long been cited by captains of Indian IT industry for communicating their quarterly results to the world.
Infosys Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd announced their Q4 results last week, and the rest will follow over the coming days. However, investors cannot act upon the information in the absence of industry-wide data. Since Nasscom is refraining from providing a growth benchmark, investors will look for the vacuum to be filled by analysts and consulting firms.
One such is ISG, my former employer. It puts out a quarterly view of the industry called the ISG Index. Since outsiders’ visibility gets murkier as deals get smaller, it refrains from commenting on deals that are smaller than a certain size ($5 million presently) in annual contract value (ACV). Nonetheless, its methodology is robust, and it produces a startlingly accurate view of the deal cycles in the industry.
I recently met Michael Connors, chairman and chief executive officer of ISG, who along with Bret Breeding, ISG’s data czar, proceeded to give me an education.
This column will focus on numbers, since it will highlight some aspects of ISG’s research that are germane to the current earnings season.
According to Connors, though there are macroeconomic headwinds on the horizon, ISG continues to forecast steady growth over the next several years in both the IT and business service segments globally.
ISG’s trailing 12-month growth numbers for the traditional sourcing industry clock in at 8%, yielding a number of $27.5 billion in ACV. Meanwhile, the “as-a-service"" market, which includes everything that is cloud-based, has grown at 37% on a trailing 12-month basis and now almost equals traditional services outsourcing, clocking in at $23.6 billion for the year. Combined, these numbers show a trailing 12-month growth of 20%.
These counts are for the commercial sector only; they do not include government deals and only focus on deals that are above ISG’s $5 million visibility floor. Smaller deals are difficult to trace, but these broader market numbers still suffice as a guide to the overall health of the IT industry.
Interestingly, ISG’s data shows a general decrease in ACV from approximately $20 million to $15 million from 2010 to 2015, followed by stabilization since then at the $15-million mark. The more telling statistic is that there are many more awards coming to the market in the smaller ACV bands. In 2018, the broader market finished with 60% of its awards in the smallest ACV band of $5 million to $10 million versus 2010, when this number stood at 46%. This means that despite splashy headlines, the main battles are not being fought in the mega-deal space, but in the small- and medium-sized bands. For a detailed look at these numbers, I suggest you see the ISG Index here.
What is driving the reduction in deal size?
First, deal duration decreases since software and hardware assets included in previous deals are now accounted for elsewhere and are not depreciated over long-term tenures. The 10-year deal is now a 3.5-year deal.
Second, software applications get replaced or shifted to the cloud. For example, let’s say there were 100 applications that were part of the original deal and that half of those would move to a public cloud during the contract. That means half the service provider’s workload for computing and support would now be shifted to a cloud provider such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft’s Azure. Meanwhile, other software applications would be replaced by cloud solutions like Salesforce or Workday. This results in decreased spend with the traditional service provider.
However, there is some consolation. New digital services counteract to some extent the revenue losses to the cloud. Nobody can go digital without a service provider. Here’s how digital plays out in different verticals:
One, the digital demand trends for banking and insurance are in cloud migration, cybersecurity and intelligent automation. Digital investments have also accelerated in wealth management and commercial banking. As interest rates rise, enterprises should see their profitability expand, and they will be more optimistic about spending.
Two, in manufacturing, digital spending has begun to rise as companies shrink their product development cycle and reinvent the supply chain from research and development to production to sales to customer care. Investments are aimed at 3D printing, autonomous technology and solutions to meet the demand for digital manufacturing and engineering services.
Three, the energy industry’s volatility comes from the fluctuations in crude oil prices, causing companies to continually evaluate their capital spend to manage profitability. Firms in this vertical tend to invest in the Internet of Things and robotic process automation to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.
Four, retail clients continue to strengthen their digital business channels to enhance frictionless omnichannel experiences, personalized “market of one"" retailing and responsive supply chains.
Five, the healthcare and pharma industry shows a growing interest in analytics programmes and an ongoing demand for cloud migration initiatives, but digital has not permeated the sector as much because of stringent regulations in the space. For healthcare providers and payers, the focus remains on improving efficiencies and advancing patient care and satisfaction.
The bottom line is that ISG expects digital growth to stay robust and to top 25% this year while the overall market itself will expand by 3.2% on a constant currency basis. The game has been redefined, but the prize money is still large.

Shares of Infosys Ltd on Monday fell as much as 4.6%, their steepest fall in six months, after many brokerages downgraded the stock on a disappointing revenue forecast.

This week investors are likely to react to TCS and Infosys stocks as the IT majors announced their March quarter earnings after market hours on Friday. Infosys reported a mixed bag in Q4FY19, with margins below expectations even as revenue was in-line. For the full year FY19, Infosys has posted 9% revenue growth in constant currency terms versus a guidance of 8.5- 9% and EBIT margin of 22.8% versus guidance of 22-24%. It has provided 7.5-9.5% growth guidance and has lowered its margin guidance by 100 basis points (bps) to 21-23% for FY20 – both lower than the street’s expectations. Analysts believe that lower-than-expected growth and margin guidance may lead to a cut in street’s earnings estimates.
“We believe Infosys is being conservative in terms of its revenue guidance for FY19, given that YoY constant currency growth was 11.7% in Q4FY19, with robust order wins also reflecting underlying revenue strength,"" Reliance Securities Ltd said.

Mumbai: How times change. About 12 years ago, this column had said that if cash is king, Infosys Ltd ruled the Indian IT industry. Even though its revenues were far lower than those of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) back then, its free cash flow was higher in absolute terms.
In fact, as the chart above shows, this was true even about seven years ago. In fiscal year 2012 (FY12), Infosys’s revenues were about 30% lower compared to TCS, but its cash flows were 23% higher at $1.38 billion.
But all of this was before the leadership crisis at Infosys reared its ugly head. What soon followed was a period of flux, with multiple changes in the company’s top leadership as well as its board of directors. The impact these changes has had on Infosys’ financials qualifies as a classic case study on why companies must take leadership development and succession planning very seriously.
Seven years hence, Infosys has become a shadow of its former self, while TCS has become a far more formidable competitor.
In FY19, Infosys’s free cash flows were less than half of the $4.23 billion TCS generated as cash. This is largely a function of better revenue growth and improving profitability at TCS. In FY19, TCS’s earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) of $5.35 billion was nearly double Infosys’s Ebit of $2.71 billion. In FY12, TCS’s operating profit was only about 40% higher compared to Infosys.
While TCS’s margins have dropped around 200 basis points in the last seven years, Infosys’s margins have fallen by 600 basis points. One of the key differences is the larger spends the latter has had to make to retain employees amid all the uncertainty.
Besides, it has also had to invest higher amounts to drive growth, given the large gap in its growth rates compared to TCS.
Infosys’ troubles also began around the time when industry dynamics were changing, with increased demand for new digital services.
Companies with better capabilities in these new services did better compared to those that relied largely on traditional services.
The struggle to play catch-up, while at the same time managing high employee attrition, has evidently taken its toll. Infosys’s current margin woes are also reflective of the same struggle. While the company’s revenue growth has picked up to decent levels under its new chief executive officer, Salil Parekh, this is coming at a great cost.
All of this is of course also visible in the companies’ market valuations. Infosys is now valued 60% lower than TCS’s market capitalization of  ₹7.9 trillion. In January 2011, its valuation was only 10-12% lower.
Great is the price that Infosys shareholders have paid for the company’s leadership woes."

        The board of IT major Wipro on Tuesday approved a  ₹10,500 crore share buyback programme, its third in four years. In 2017, Wipro had undertaken a  ₹11,000 crore buyback and in 2016, a  ₹2,500 crore programme. A share buyback is a process through which a company purchases equity from its shareholders, usually at a price near to or higher than the prevailing market price. When a company buys back equity, it reduces its outstanding shares in the market.
Here are 5 things to know about Wipro’s latest buyback offer:
Under the buyback, Wipro proposes to buy up to 32.30 crore shares for an aggregate amount not exceeding  ₹10,500 crore, at a price of  ₹325. This constitutes 5.35% of the total paid-up equity share capital of the company

The buyback price is at 16% premium to Wipro’s Tuesday’s closing price of  ₹281. The buyback is proposed to be made from shareholders on a proportionate basis under the tender offer.

Analysts say that the share buyback programme will provide a cushion to the stock price. “Wipro has cash of  ₹32,900 crore as on FY19. Buyback will provide a cushion to stock price in near term. However due to muted revenue growth as compared to peers, Wipro will remain an underperformer,” domestic brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher said in a note. The brokerage has a “Hold” recommendation on the stock. Another brokerage Reliance Securities has a ""Hold"" on Wipro with a target price of  ₹300. ""Owing to the buyback, EPS (earnings per share) will rise by 5% while RoE (return on equity) will rise by 150bps in FY20E. This will support the share price, despite major improvement in growth as yet proving to be elusive."" (With Agency Inputs)

153,2019-04-17,TCS,"Wipro’s revenue growth in Q4 has slowed after just two quarters of acceleration even as TCS and Infosys surged aheadWipro’s guidance of a -1% to 1% revenue growth on a sequential basis in Q1 FY20 provides limited confidence

Mumbai: Just when it was thought Wipro Ltd had recovered from its growth problems, its March quarter (Q4) results have once again raised uncomfortable questions about revenue growth.
Revenue growth slowed just two quarters after acceleration. The sequential constant currency revenue growth stood at just 1% in Q4. In the previous two quarters it grew in the range of 2-3%. This is in contrast to the revenue acceleration theme investors are banking on.
Year-on-year growth rate declined marginally last quarter, unlike its peers, where growth rates had increased last quarter. As was the case with Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, Wipro said it is seeing strong deal momentum and has a healthy pipeline, which should help it deliver better FY20 than FY19. However, mere 5.4% growth in FY19 means the bar is not high. TCS and Infosys clocked 11.4% and 9% growth, respectively, in FY19.
Worse, Wipro’s guidance of a -1% to 1% revenue growth on a sequential basis in the June quarter provides limited confidence. The guidance of revenue contraction in a worst-case scenario goes against the strong deal momentum commentary.
According to the management, some large projects it has won require time to ramp-up. Besides, the healthcare and manufacturing business verticals, which generate a fifth of Wipro’s revenue, are struggling for growth and are impacting overall growth rates.
The management says it is focusing on earnings accretive business and is selectively participating in traditional contracts. This is leading to better quality earnings reflective in margin improvement (FY19 vs FY18) and cash flow generation. But as one analyst with a domestic broking house points out, the margin improvement is coming on a lower base vis-à-vis larger peers TCS and Infosys. And, in any case, the depreciation in the rupee has aided profitability for most IT firms in FY19.
In any case, margin improvement can only take earnings so far. Ultimately, revenue needs to grow at decent rates for investors to be impressed. Wipro’s key business verticals show uneven recovery, with growth largely being driven by the banking financial services and consumer business units. Three business verticals—healthcare, manufacturing, technology—saw a year- on-year fall in revenues in constant currency terms last quarter.
At 16 times estimated FY20 earnings, Wipro is trading at a discount to TCS and Infosys’s price-earnings multiple of 22 times and 19 times, respectively, reflecting subdued expectations on the Street. The widening gap in revenue growth rates may further deepen the valuation discount. And as if this wasn’t enough, Wipro has also reported issues related to cybersecurity. If the matter isn’t contained quickly enough to the satisfaction of clients, it may well have the potential to derail growth further."
151,2019-04-22,TCS,"TCS will transform India Post into a multi-service digital hub and modernise the delivery of mail and packagesIndia's largest IT services company will modernise than 150,000 post offices

India's largest IT services company, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), has partnered with the Department of Posts in a bid to transform it into a multi-service digital hub, modernise the delivery of mail and packages, enhance customer experience, and launch innovative services that will drive new revenues.
At the heart of this transformation is the Core System Integration (CSI) program designed and implemented by TCS. This involved deploying an integrated ERP (enterprise resource planning) solution that caters to mail operations, finance and accounting, and HR functions, and connects its vast network of more than 150,000 post offices, making this the largest distributed ePostal network in the world.
The integrated solution is built to cater to the Department’s immense scale, and future needs. It supports the HR needs of over 500,000 employees, services over 40,000 concurrent users, and processes over 3 million postal transactions a day, making this one of the largest SAP implementations in the world.
On the front-end, TCS has implemented its Point of Sale (PoS) solution across 24,000 post offices with over 80,000 PoS terminals, making this amongst the largest such implementations in the world. Additionally, TCS has built a web portal with consignment tracking capabilities, and set up a multi-lingual call center for customer support.
According to Debashis Ghosh, Business Group Head – Public Services, TCS: “In a digital era, postal services across the world are reinventing themselves to stay relevant to a new generation,"" said . “We are proud to have partnered with the Department of Posts in this pioneering, mission mode initiative to build a world class, future-ready digital platform that the nation can be proud of. With this, the department can offer smart postal services, enriched customer experiences, and innovative value-added services to the citizens of India.""
An important objective of the transformation is to use the department’s nation-wide reach to drive financial inclusion and accessibility of citizen services in remote areas.
This is being accomplished through over 130,000 DARPAN (Digital Advancement of Rural Post Office for A New India) hand-held devices that Gramin Dak Sevaks use to provide postal, banking, insurance, and cash management services in remote villages, even those without network connectivity."

149,2019-04-24,TCS,"Out of the 36 companies that made share buyback offers since April 2018, just about a third have seen a full acceptance ratioNine of the 33 share buybacks where returns were calculated likely lost money for participating shareholders

Mumbai: Investors looking to make a quick buck through share buybacks will have to watch for a few telltale signs. Since April 2018, Indian companies have bought back shares worth  ₹47,696 crore. Besides, last week, Wipro Ltd announced a  ₹10,500 crore buyback.
Share buyback prices are typically higher than market prices when announcements are made. This arbitrage opportunity is driving investors to purchase these stocks in the market and tender them in buyback offers. More so because the market regulator has prescribed a minimal allocation in buybacks to small shareholders.
But shareholders looking to gain from the arbitrage opportunity may not be making money in all buybacks. An analysis by HDFC Securities Ltd shows that nine of the 33 share buybacks where returns were calculated likely lost money for participating shareholders. The losses ranged from -0.2% to -38.5% on an absolute basis.
So what can go wrong with a share buyback? Two important factors influence shareholder returns in share buybacks. Typically, the first and most important is the acceptance ratio. The acceptance ratio is the number of shares that are finally accepted as a percentage of the total that are tendered back to the company.
HDFC Securities research shows that since April 2018, just about 12 in 36 companies accepted 100% of the shares tendered back in an open offer. This is for the companies where the acceptance ratio is available. About 14 companies accepted up to 50% (see chart).
If the acceptance ratio is not 100%, investors looking for quick gains in the market may have to sell the remaining shares in the market at a lower price. This hits investor returns. Typically, shares fall post the completion of a buyback.
Hence, more often investor returns depends on the acceptance ratio. “Once a company announces a buyback, investors buy shares in anticipation of tendering in the offer and making money on the arbitrage available. If a large number of people participate, this tends to reduce the acceptance ratio and the expected returns,"" says Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities.
Besides, in larger buybacks, the acceptance ratio can be higher. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd’s  ₹16,000 crore buyback last year saw a 100% acceptance ratio.
“If the buyback size is large and where the number of shareholders are low, there is a possibility of a better acceptance ratio and decent returns,"" adds Jasani.
Of course, the final acceptance ratio cannot be known in advance, only after the buyback exercise is over.
But one thing is for certain: if the acceptance ratio is less than 100%, investors who bought in the market may have to sell at a lower rate in the market. And that could lower returns or even result in losses."

144,2019-05-08,TCS,"If TCS does surpass DXC, it will only lag behind International Business Machines Corp. and Accenture PlcTCS grew 9.6%, or added $1.82 billion in new business, to end with $20.91 billion in revenue in the year ended 31 March

NEW DELHI :
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) is set to surpass DXC Technology Co. to become the world’s third-largest software services provider in fiscal 2018-19, marking the first change in the pecking order of the information technology (IT) outsourcing industry in two years.
If TCS does surpass DXC, it will only lag behind International Business Machines Corp. and Accenture Plc.
DXC Technology, formed by the merger of Computer Sciences with a division of Hewlett Packard in 2017, needs to clock a 5.06% sequential growth in the fourth quarter to end with $20.91 billion in revenue. Most analysts believe it is unlikely that DXC will manage this growth. DXC declares its fourth-quarter earnings on 23 May.
TCS grew 9.6%, or added $1.82 billion in new business, to end with $20.91 billion in revenue in the year ended 31 March.
In the first nine months of 2018-19, TCS generated $15.52 billion in revenue, more than the $15.47 billion in business done by DXC.
TCS’s strong performance over the two years has seen a change of guard at the top. In 2017, TCS entrusted Rajesh Gopinathan, who was then chief financial officer, to take over as chief executive and succeed N. Chandrasekaran, who was named the chairman of Tata Sons Ltd. Still, the company managed to retain all its senior executives and improved its growth and profitability, with the consensus view that this was one of the smoothest management transitions at an Indian corporate entity.
In contrast, DXC has divested and restructured much of its businesses. DXC had $25.39 billion in revenue when it was set up in 2017, while TCS ended with $17.57 billion in revenue. This implies that over the last two years, DXC has seen its revenue decline by more than $4 billion, while during this time TCS has added $3.34 billion in incremental revenue.
Much of DXC’s lost revenue was on account of the company selling its US public sector business, which accounted for $2.8 billion in revenue, to private equity firm Veritas Capital last year.
IBM, which ended with $79.59 billion in revenue last year, does not disclose business from IT outsourcing services. However, the company got $69.76 billion in business from global business, technology services and cognitive solutions, all of which can be clubbed under IT services business. Accenture ended with $39.57 billion last year.
“TCS is widely described these days as the ‘Walmart of IT Services’—the firm can pretty much win any large deal it wants and deliver it,"" said Phil Fersht, chief executive of US-based HFS Research. “Its size and execution focus put it in a commanding position in the market and this is almost impossible for the likes of DXC to compete with.""
“I see Accenture emerging as its principal competitor with its SynOps platform, and these two will duke it out for market dominance over the next 2-3 years,"" he said. “DXC will likely strip off several business divisions and add more in the future as Mike Lawrie (chairman and CEO of DXC) tries to find a final point to regrow a firm that is, quite frankly, in a lot of trouble trying to compete in an extremely cut-throat market.""
TCS’s industry-leading profitability even while recording double-digit revenue growth is another metric that has helped investors repose faith in the company’s stock. TCS ended last year with a 25.6% operating margin, while Accenture and DXC had 14.8% and 14% profitability, respectively.
The IT outsourcing industry is facing threats from newer technologies such as automation software, cloud computing and artificial intelligence-powered platforms, which are redefining—and making redundant—the traditional approach of vendors deploying armies of engineers to manage the information technology infrastructure work for companies.
This is reflected in the declining revenue (of IBM) or slow growth at some of the other large companies (Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp). Last week, Cognizant, which ended with $16.12 billion in revenue last year, slashed its full-year growth outlook to 5.1% in constant currency terms from an earlier forecast of 9%.
For now, Accenture and TCS are the two companies among the large IT firms that appear to have steered through this disruptive period with any degree of success.
“It’s a beautiful industry. There is no other industry that has multi-decadal growth visibility. All we have to do is execute well and to make sure our capabilities are in tune with where the opportunity lies,"" Gopinathan said in an interview earlier this year."
143,2019-05-08,TCS,"US has complained that PCR will limit PCBs’ access to data, hinder their ability to operate optimallyInstead, it wants India to create a PCR to provide regulators with data to perform supervisory duties

The US administration has objected to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) move to create a new public credit registry (PCR), on the grounds that the non-profit credit information company will be anti-competitive for private credit bureaus (PCBs). The PCR is planned as a repository of loan information of individuals and corporate borrowers to curb bad loans.
A PCR will help banks distinguish between good and bad borrowers and accordingly offer attractive interest rates to good borrowers and lend to bad borrowers at higher interest rates.
The move is based on the recommendations of a task force set up in 2017, headed by Y.M. Deosthalee. The committee submitted its report in April 2018 and the central bank made it public in June last year.
In October last year, the RBI had invited expressions of interest (EOI) for developing the registry from companies with a turnover of more than  ₹100 crore in the last three years. It has shortlisted six major technology companies, including TCS, Wipro and IBM India.
Four PCBs are operating in India, of which TransUnion CIBIL Ltd and Equifax Credit Information Services Pvt. Ltd are US-owned companies. The other two PCBs are Experian Credit Information Co. of India Pvt. Ltd and CRIF High Mark.
A government official with knowledge of the matter said the US has complained that the PCR will limit PCBs’ access to data and hinder their scope and ability to operate optimally in the country. Instead, it wants India to create a PCR to provide regulators with data to perform supervisory duties. However, India in its response to the US has said that its concerns are misplaced and PCR will not affect the functioning of PCBs in India. The official said India has informed the US that PCBs will have access to the PCR data as required to carry out their mandate and as decided by the RBI.
“Private credit bureaus will have to focus on and generate value from analytics, rather than from the unique access to data enshrined by regulation. A PCR, limited to regulatory and supervisory usage only, will not be a ‘public’ credit registry in the true sense of the term and defeat the purpose of democratization of credit information,"" the official said under condition of anonymity.
RBI deputy governor Viral Acharya had said in January this year that globally, PCBs and PCRs both operate in the same space. “PCBs can be legislatively authorized to receive credit data. However, being for-profit enterprises, they may focus primarily on those data segments around which it is most profitable to build a business model. Indeed, it is found internationally that a PCR, being a non-profit enterprise, is able to ensure much better data coverage than PCBs,"" he added.
The PCR is proposed to cover all regulated financial entities in phases and in this way get a 360-degree view of borrowers. It will facilitate linkages with related ancillary information systems outside the banking system including corporate filings, tax systems (including the goods and services tax network or GSTN), and utility payments.
“The PCR will have to be backed and governed by a comprehensive Public Credit Registry Act to be brought in consultation with the government. It will have to follow the latest privacy guidelines based on a laid down consent framework,"" Acharya said.
At present, institutions that report credit information to PCBs include all scheduled commercial banks and cooperative banks, non-banking financial companies, housing finance companies, state financial corporations, all India financial institutions, and credit card companies.
The US has also raised objection to the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill that mandates that either the personal data or at least a copy of it needs to be stored on a server located in India. The US has complained that the proposal would harm companies that rely on cross-border data flows to conduct business, including small and medium-sized enterprises.
The US suggested that India allow companies to transfer data across borders when they certify to binding international codes of conduct, such as the APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules System. India has informed the US that the draft bill is under consideration and will evolve over time."

139,2019-05-13,TCS,"CSC was the IT partner to Transamerica before TCS won the contractTCS has denied any wrongdoing, saying that that CSC was trying to disrupt its $2 billion contract

DELHI :
A US court has rejected a demand from Computer Sciences Corp. asking for a temporary restraining order against Tata Consultancy Services Ltd from working on the US-software firm’s software code as part of contract awarded from from Transamerica Life Insurance Co., a unit of Dutch insurer Aegon NV.
This comes as relief for India’s largest IT services firm which faces a case of misappropriation of trade secrets filed by erstwhile CSC, which merged with the enterprise business of Hewlett Packard to form DXC Technology Co in 2017.
TCS has denied any wrongdoing, saying that that CSC was trying to disrupt its $2 billion, 10-year contract awarded to the Mumbai-based company last year.
CSC was the IT partner to Transamerica before TCS won the contract.
“CSC fails to set forth sufficient evidence that TCS breached its duty pursuant to its obligations under the license agreement between CSC and MSI (Money Services, Inc, a subsidiary of Transamerica)/Transamerica,"" said a 9 May order by a court in the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division.
Mint reviewed a copy of the order.
The court rejected CSC’s earlier charge that TCS copied the source code of Vantage One, CSC’s proprietary software, to build its own BaNCS software.
“CSC makes conclusory allegations that TCS has committed unfair competition and tortuous interference but offers no evidence in support. Accordingly, CSC has failed to make the requisite showing that he is entitled to a temporary restraining order based on these claims,"" said the order.
“TCS is pleased that the Court ruled in its favour and denied CSC's motion for a temporary restraining order,"" said a spokesperson for TCS. “TCS goes to great lengths to safeguard any Trade Secrets with which it is entrusted, from whatever the source. As this case remains pending in the court, we do not intend to comment further on the matter except to reiterate that CSC’s allegations have no merit""

138,2019-05-13,TCS,"Site reliability engineers combine the skills of software coders with the talent of those who operationalize systems for clients

Earlier this week, Mint reported that Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is poised to become the third largest information technology (IT) services firm. This is an important milestone, not just for TCS but also for the Indian IT services sector in general. The firm’s continued strong growth is laudable.
But it’s important to make clear that TCS was compared with firms that are in its current peer group, such as IBM Global Services and Accenture. Some weeks ago, I had written about an orthogonal threat coming at IT service providers from other companies in the Big Tech ecosystem. One example is the entry of firms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, Google, Intel and others into the “cloud"" services space. Informal estimates of the size of these operations—each quarter—for such firms range from $11 billion (AWS) to $6 billion (Intel). That said, these estimates are handicapped by a twofold issue: first, money is fungible, so companies get to put their revenues into different internal buckets based on their own internal preferences and, second, these operations are internal to the Big Tech firms and are opaque, making it difficult for external evaluators to parse the numbers.
Revenue estimates aside, it is accepted that the Big Tech behemoths have taken over the “cloud"" data centre and infrastructure management space. The class comprising the IBMs, Accentures and TCSes has been edged out of the business. This second set of firms only have the consolation prize of being able to migrate their customers’ infrastructure onto the platforms owned and run by the first set.
One might also imagine that after these software applications are made to migrate to the cloud, the second set of IT service providers are still responsible for building and maintaining these applications, while the first set (the cloud infrastructure companies) solely manage the lowest levels of the stack—the software and hardware. Indeed, reflecting this perception, TCS’s tag line for many of its advertisements is “experience certainty"".
Even as recently as 10 years ago, before the cloud phenomenon took hold, outsourcing contracts with data centre providers used “availability"" as the key metric. This metric was usually expressed as a percentage and a service level agreement—with contractual penalties for failure drawn up to police this. The usual expression was in “2 nines"" as in 99% or “3 Nines"" as in 99.9% and so on. All a data centre provider needed to do—cloud or otherwise—was to guarantee this uptime.
This differs from the “reliability"" of the actual application. An application can still be unreliable, even if it runs in a data centre that is available at “4 nines"" or 99.99% of the time. This unreliability of the application is the fault of the programmer, not the data centre.
The traditional model, where the development (dev) and operations (ops) teams were separate, led to the team that writes software code not being responsible for how it works when customers start using it. The development team would “throw the code over the wall"" to the operations team to instal and support. This situation could lead to dysfunction. The goals of the dev and ops teams were not the same—a developer wants customers to use the “latest and greatest"" piece of code, but the operations team wants a steady system with as little change as possible. Ops engineers contended that any change can introduce instability, while a system with no changes should continue to behave predictably (holding constant other factors such as too many concurrent users crashing a system).
This problem finally spawned the “DevOps"" methods for software development that try to ensure that software engineers are responsible not just for the development and buildout of an application, but also for its ongoing operations. In other words, they need to work in tandem with the systems operational environment, thereby guaranteeing not just availability, but also the reliability of their computer programmes.
But even DevOps can’t solve the problem entirely. Nowadays, the trend in software is to give every system an application programming interface. This then turns every software product, even one built on DevOps, into a platform for other applications to use. If an unreliable application is written on a reliable platform, the problem still exists. Customers’ perceptions of how reliable their service is depend on more than just the availability that platform providers guarantee—since reliability is increasingly being driven by the quality of the software that customers bring to the platform.
Google, which through its search engine provides a software platform for many others to write applications, recognized this issue early on and gave birth to a new breed of systems engineer called “Site Reliability Engineers"" or SREs. Google’s Ben Treynor Sloss coined the term in the early 2000s. He defined it as: “It’s what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations function."" Even though the SRE role has become prevalent in recent years, many people don’t know what it is or does.
Google’s stance is that SREs should take joint operational responsibility and go on-call for the systems that customers build on its platforms. Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems, written by a group of Google engineers, is considered the holy grail on site reliability engineering. And yes, my speculation is that Google and the other big tech firms are building large SRE practices—which will eventually compete with the TCSes, IBMs and Accentures of the world.
The Big Tech cloud infrastructure providers are moving up the chain into the application development space.

137,2019-05-14,TCS,"‘Think beyond Industry 4.0,’ says Accenture—the first time a firm in the sector has taken a dig at a rivalTCS launched Business 4.0 at its annual customer event in Europe in September 2017

Accenture Plc is almost twice the size of its nearest competitor Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) but the US firm couldn’t resist taking a swipe at the Indian company’s digital offerings.
As the two companies battle it out to win digital business from the same clients, Accenture, which brands its digital solutions as X.O., seems to have stepped somewhat out of the line to take a dig at its Mumbai-based rival’s Business 4.0. digital offering
“Industry 3.0, 4.0—what’s next?"" reads a statement on the website of Accenture X.O., an umbrella branding under which Accenture offers solutions using data analytics, cloud computing and internet of things to help manufacturers run their business more efficiently.
Accenture’s dig at TCS’s offerings is arguably the first of its kind in the sector as companies typically avoid commenting on rivals.
TCS first launched Business 4.0 at TCS Europe Summit, its annual two-day customer event in Europe in September 2017. This was less than five months after Rajesh Gopinathan took over as chief executive even as the company got a trademark on Business 4.0.
“Stop playing catch-up and start applying digital at the core of your business to reinvent for a new era of industry. Go beyond Industry 4.0: If you think Industry 4.0 is the epitome of industrial digitization—think again. The fact is the very notion of the industry itself is evolving,"" says Accenture as it begins to describe its offerings under X.O.
Accenture first set up X.O. in the September-November period of 2017.
Both Accenture and TCS declined to comment.But TCS executives aren’t pleased.
“Where is the question of playing catch-up when we first launched this framework in September 2017, before Accenture did,"" said a TCS executive on condition of anonymity.
“We don’t want to speculate why some company will play down our offerings. But Business 4.0 framework allows us to give clients personalization and help them create value and is resonating well. This is probably one reason why someone is trying to take a potshot at our offering,"" said a second TCS executive.
Some experts say Accenture’s attempt to mock TCS’s offering means it views the Indian company as a rival in digital deals.
“Accenture has shifted its competitive threat radar from Cognizant to TCS. They definitely see TCS as their main threat across IT delivery areas,"" said Phil Fersht, chief executive of US-based HFS Research, when asked if Accenture is taking a dig at TCS.
So is Accenture facing the heat from TCS?
Not really.
For now, Accenture is almost twice the size of TCS. Accenture, which follows a September-August financial year, reported a 13.5% growth to end with $39.57 billion in revenue. TCS grew 9.6% to end with $20.91 billion in revenue in the year ended March 2019.
Accenture claims over 60% of its total revenue is digital, which is about a third of TCS’s total business. TCS’s build-everything approach contrasts with Accenture’s strategy of buying companies and hiring executives.
“Accenture is not facing the heat. Rather, it is trying to stay ahead of it as it sees the industry consolidating and commoditizing,"" said Fersht of HFS Research.
Historically, there was not much to differentiate between solutions offered by thousands of IT services firms, globally. Hence, most IT firms relied on strong sales and marketing teams. However, over the last few years, clients have pressed their IT vendors to offer them solutions across data analytics, artificial intelligence-power platforms, to help them run their businesses better."

133,2019-05-20,TCS,"India’s IT service firms have various options as they rework their delivery models around tight US norms

There are many weapons used in a trade war. The two used most often are complaints to the World Trade Organization or unilateral changes in tariffs against a trading partner, as we have seen with the US and China. Non-tariff trade barriers are often more potent and can be used with relative stealth. One such non-tariff barrier, often used on people-centric industries, is a restriction of the free movement of labour. India still gets about 70% of US H-1B visas issued each year. US consulates in India have considerable latitude. They can act on Washington’s orders to tighten up the H-1B regime without any drastic change in US immigration laws. Other similar “work permit"" rules in countries such as Australia, Singapore and the UK also vary over time.
I spoke recently with Viju George of JP Morgan, a veteran information technology (IT) sector analyst, whose insights I respect. George has strong data to back his conclusions. His analysis of the H-1B situation reveals that the rejection rate of H-1B visas has sharply increased for Indian IT since 2015. The rejection rates as of April 2019 of H-1B visas filed for by Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services and Cognizant have risen to 35%, 33% and 39%, respectively, versus 2%, 4% and 4% in 2015. The visa rejection rate for India’s TWITCH providers (TCS, Wipro, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Cognizant and HCL Technologies) between September 2018 and April 2019 has spiked to 36%. This is astoundingly high, nine times higher than 2015’s rejection rate of approximately 4%.
Tier-I Indian IT firms are not alone in facing such H-1B denial rates. The authorities have also applied the whip to global IT services firms operating in India such as IBM, Accenture and Deloitte. It appears that the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) authorities are judging the offshore/on-site IT Services business model as taking undue advantage of H-1B visas, regardless of the firm’s heritage.
What is most alarming is that the acceptance rate of applications for extensions from people who are already working on H-1Bs in the US is also sharply declining. It is harder to substitute on-site H-1B resources already working at a client site with local resources at short notice. This is to say nothing of the human costs that affect workers who are suddenly uprooted from the US and have to relocate to India with their families. The US is no longer seen as a plum posting by senior IT services employees.
Big Tech players such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Intel have far lower denial rates. These are still in single-digit percentages. In absolute terms, they are receiving increasing approvals. Captives such as Walmart and Goldman Sachs also have very low denial rates. Clearly, the USCIS does not view such players as “unfair"" H-1B users. According to George, many of their applicants hold US Masters’ degrees and command much higher pay packets than their IT Services counterparts—more than a 50% premium. Also, while about 70% of Big Tech employees applying for H-1Bs have Masters’ degrees, the picture for IT Services employees is inverted. Only 30% of them have Masters’ degrees. It appears that both lower pay and applicants without higher degrees are frowned upon by the USCIS.
US wages have been stagnant for more than a decade. Inflation has also been low, but real wage appreciation is largely absent. The current administration’s desire to push up middle-class wages, since it is this class that votes in large numbers, may be driving its current approach. However, tech, which has near zero unemployment, is probably the wrong sector to choose. Such knee-jerk methods are ineffectual and will end up hurting the US economy in the long run.
The question is whether these rejection rates are high enough to impact the bottom line or delivery operations of IT services firms. As is evident from several providers’ earnings announcements, George sees an impact on costs already but not yet on operations. Yet, if rejection rates continue to rise, can India’s IT players manage the operational risks that go with interrupted service delivery to customers? George’s analysis suggests that such risks will manifest themselves if rejection rates for H1B visa extensions approaches 45%. At the current rate, he says we will hit this point in less than two years.
How, then, can providers mitigate the operational risks if visa denial rates keep rising? Apart from increasing local hiring at higher costs, IT services firms have to structurally change their delivery methodologies to cope with visa pressures. Methods such as location-independent Agile development, extreme offshoring, and automation with bots are some of these.
Such a structural change will take time to play out. For example, location-independent Agile, a new-age delivery system, can be revolutionary since its development today needs team members playing multiple, parallel roles, which is more easily accomplished when they are co-located. Another method is extreme offshoring, where more than 90% of resources sit offshore. Predictable, longer-term annuity engagements are more amenable to this method. Third, the use of bots, instead of human employees, can reduce the reliance on visas for people.
There is increasing buy-in from clients for new delivery models if their execution is satisfactory. Firms have just started on this journey and the results will take time. That said, I have seen the industry face structural problems before, dust itself off and carry on.

134,2019-05-20,TCS,"IT firm targets strong revenue growth in this fiscal without sacrificing its industry-leading profitabilityTCS started FY20 with a 3.6% growth rate in constant currency terms, against 2.8% in April last year

NEW DELHI :
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), India’s largest information technology (IT) services firm, is on track for double-digit growth in the current fiscal year, the second consecutive year of strong growth, without sacrificing its industry-leading profitability, TCS chief operating officer, N. Ganapathy Subramaniam said.
At the heart of TCS’ confidence is the higher growth rate with which it started the current financial year and healthy deal wins.
TCS started the current fiscal year with a 3.6% growth rate in constant currency terms, as against 2.8% in April last year. This is the highest at which TCS has started a financial year in five years since growing 15% in 2014-15.
Additionally, a higher number of deal wins over the last 12 months should also help the company achieve double-digit growth, according to Subramaniam. TCS, which started disclosing the total contract value of deals last year, said it won $21.9 billion worth of deals in 2018-19.
“So now we are roughly a percentage point more this year in exit rate,"" Subramaniam said in an interaction at Mint’s newsroom in New Delhi on Thursday.
“We started last year with 2.8% and we managed to grow double-digit and end with 11.4% (in constant currency terms). Now we are starting the year with higher growth secured, so we should be able to continue, plus with all the deal wins, all the TCVs (total contract value) that we have signed up. There’s no point in going back and losing focus on that (double-digit growth). We are still focused on achieving that double-digit growth,"" said Subramaniam, who clarified that this should not be interpreted as guidance because TCS does not give any quarterly or yearly growth outlook.
A strong exit rate sets up TCS well for the current year. A 3.6% exit growth implies that even if TCS does not report any growth in each of the four quarters of the year, the company will grow at 3.6% or add $753 million in incremental revenue in the current year.
TCS reported an 11.4% growth rate in constant currency terms to end FY19 with $20.91 billion in revenue. Currency fluctuations took away some sheen and the company managed a 9.6% dollar revenue growth, adding $1.82 billion in new business.
TCS’ strong growth is in contrast with its closest competitor, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., which slashed its full-year growth forecast by 44% earlier this month to give an estimate of 5.1% at best. If Cognizant meets its growth forecast, it will add $823 million in incremental revenue in the calendar year 2019, just $70 million more than what TCS has secured even before the end of the first quarter of 2019-20.
“Falling profitability is the issue faced by all the companies,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage.
“TCS has done well on growth but what needs to be seen is if the company can sustain its current margins, especially as its rivals are outlining lower profitability,"" said the analyst.
TCS’ operating margin expanded 80 basis points to 25.6% in FY19. However, it was still 10 basis points lower than 25.7% in the year ended March 2017.
Infosys Ltd, which ended with 22.8% operating margin last year, expects full-year profitability to be between 21% and 23%, while India’s third largest IT firm, HCL Technologies Ltd has also lowered its profitability guidance to be between 18.5% and 19.5%. For now, Subramaniam, who took over in his current role in 2017, tried to assuage concerns over falling profitability.
“I want to stay focused on our 25-26%. There is something called rigour, execution, and operational excellence. We remain focused on these. Also, it is the company’s philosophy that you do not compromise margins for growth as you will get neither. The third point is that we have invested heavily in our business over the decades. What I mean by that is that we were the first one to go to China and other overseas locations to set up development centres in high-cost locations. So there is no reason for me to even want to look at that numbers (of rivals),"" said Subramaniam."

131,2019-05-30,TCS,"Peers say tech spending tied to global growth and any talk of re-rating sector is prematureTCS maintains that its tech solutions are essential to companies across industries

NEW DELHI :
Should information technology (IT) services companies be re-rated?
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd believes that it is time money managers re-look at how they have valued the company, which in the year ended March 2019 overtook DXC Technology Co., to become the world’s third largest IT services firm.
Mumbai-based TCS maintains that its technology solutions are essential to companies across industries, helping its clients from Citigroup Inc. to Walmart Inc. to do their business more efficiently. For this reason, TCS claims its current valuation of trading at 23 times forward price-earnings (PE) is not fair, compared to how money managers value recession-proof companies in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) space such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd and Dabur Ltd, which trade at 63 and 48 times earnings, respectively.
The price-to-earnings ratio is arrived at after dividing the current value of a stock by its annual earnings and is one of the many metrics to measure how expensive a stock is.
“Rajesh (TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan) said sometime back that the IT industry is like the FMCG industry. There is stickiness among clients to services we provide. We have a responsibility to many of the mission-critical applications for our customers. There is a greater affinity for our offerings compared to the FMCG offering and so, the multiples that FMCG sector gets should be comparable to a leader like us,"" said TCS chief operating officer, N. Ganapathy Subramaniam.
At the heart of what many experts believe is one of the most audacious debates in the two-decade IT services industry is the narrative that over the years, global technology spending has decoupled from economic growth. Experts at TCS and Capgemini SE argue that global retailers, carmakers and banks are spending more time and money on digital technologies, like data analytics, artificial intelligence platforms, to ensure that they don’t face annihilation because of disruptive innovation.
Still, most of TCS’s peers, including Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd, and industry lobby group Nasscom maintain that tech spending is still tied to global growth and so any talk of the re-rating of the sector is premature.
For now, TCS’s aggressive approach finds support from only a few analysts like BNP Paribas analyst Abhiram Eleswarapu, who first introduced the term technology staples for describing some of the largest IT services firm in 2015.
“Indian players will continue to gain share within services—the largest tech segment—thanks to their three-pronged advantages of scale, relationships (>95% repeat business for large players) and capabilities/superior training. Over time, we believe they will be increasingly treated as “technology staples"" companies even as revenue growth could slow due to a high base effect, because of the sustainability of their businesses, high quality managements and strong cash flow/ return profiles,"" Eleswarapu wrote in a note, titled, India Strategy 2025: A Stock Odyssey, dated 27 April. Many, however, disagree with TCS and HUL trading at same multiples. “
“Only tech firms that can be compared with FMCG are firms like Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Amazon and others which have moved aggressively into future looking tech for the economy as a whole by making large capital investment in cloud data centres and the like,"" said technology consultant Siddharth Pai, who has personally led over $20 billion in complex, first-of-a-kind outsourcing deals.
TCS claims this will change.
“It is always good to have critics as they make you work harder,"" said Subramaniam.
“It is only a question of time before we get there (becoming recession-proof).""
“Achieving a staple-like positioning is difficult as it requires three foundational elements to fall in place,"" JP Morgan Chase and Co. analyst Viju George wrote in a note dated 8 April.
“(A) Attractive predictable, low-risk revenue growth profile. (B) Rising margin profile (C) Steady, sustainable growth in free cash flows"""

127,2019-06-10,TCS,"The M&A spree of unicorns will help the startup ecosystem of India, according to industry insidersWhile Quikr, the most acquisitive unicorn in India, has made 12 acquisitions since 2016, TCS has made just two

BENGALURU :
The top unicorns—shorthand for startups with valuations of $1 billion or more—in India are also the most acquisitive. Among other things, it indicates how many of these companies have used mergers and acquisitions (M&As) to scale up rapidly in a short period of time.
In contrast, among traditional technology companies in India, such deals are few and far between.
For instance, Quikr, the most acquisitive unicorn in India, has made 12 acquisitions since 2016, according to Tracxn, a technology data tracker. In comparison, India’s largest tech firm, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, has made just two acquisitions, according to Crunchbase data.
Successful acquisitions are also more common among startups than traditional technology companies.
In 2014, when Flipkart bought Myntra for nearly $330 million, little did the unicorn know that its acquisition of the country’s largest online fashion retailer would bear fruit. Last year, when Walmart purchased Flipkart at a valuation of $21 billion, Myntra comprised $5.5-6.5 billion of the deal value, becoming one of the most successful acquisitions by a unicorn in India so far.
Over the past four years, unicorns have been on an acquisition spree even as they were busy raising capital. About 36 acquisitions have been made by five unicorns.
The difference lies in the size of the deals, where traditional tech firms take the lead. While there a few big purchases by the Indian unicorns, a majority of them are in the range of $40-50 million or just acqui-hires, where a startup is bought primarily for the skills or expertise of its employees and not the products or services it may be offering.
Experts say startups such as Quikr, Flipkart, Paytm and OYO Hotels and Homes tend to acquire more as their businesses are consumer-facing and depend on back-end technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and data mining that help in boosting usage experience. Therefore, the appetite is to acquire startups that are doing innovative work in these segments.
“If you have the IP (intellectual property), if you have the human resources, which are perceived as beneficial for the acquirer, then it’s a win-win situation for both the acquirer and the acquiree,"" said Murali Talasila, partner and innovation leader at PwC India.
For hospitality firm OYO Hotels and Homes, a unicorn backed by SoftBank’s Vision Fund, the acquisition strategy is targeted at acquiring entities that help it in enhancing its core tech and business capabilities, and enable market share acceleration in key markets and segments by starting new businesses.
Since inception, OYO Hotels has completed four acquisitions, the latest being that of Amsterdam-based vacation rental company @Leisure Group for $415 million, which helped the company get a foothold in Europe by providing an inventory of more than 300,000 rooms.
“Our other past acquisitions include Novascotia Boutique Homes (a Chennai-based serviced apartment brand), AblePlus (a Mumbai-based Internet of Things technology company) and Weddingz.in (a wedding planning site) and all these businesses continue to play an extremely important role in growing our business across segments,"" said Maninder Gulati, global chief strategy officer and head of global homes business at OYO Hotels.
Unlike in the case of M&As by traditional tech firms, where post-acquisition synergies can play a big role in chances of being successful, in the case of unicorns, the transaction tickets are often not large enough to impact a firm too hard, according to experts. “Most of the time, the acquirer and acquired are cut from the same cloth,"" Talasila said. “The delta, which exists between both of them, is much narrower than in the traditional tech world. You will not hear nasty stories of an acquiree saying the company’s culture is so bad that they will walk out the next day.""
But that’s not to say that all acquisitions by unicorns are successful. ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd-owned Ola has suspended Foodpanda India’s food delivery business, nearly 18 months after it acquired the company. In 2016, Ola shut down TaxiForSure, a year after it acquired the smaller rival for $200 million to maintain lead over Uber.
Experts, however, said Ola might still be able to work something around Foodpanda. “Sometimes you acquire just for the sake of IP… to try things,"" Talasila said. “As a newborn unicorn, one wants to compete with their closest competition on every front. If Uber is doing UberEats, its closest Indian competitor cannot overlook it. They have the IP now and can launch the food services in other countries where Foodpanda is a more familiar name.""
In the meantime, the M&A spree of unicorns is being seen favourably by industry insiders, who believe this will help the startup ecosystem.
“Acquisitions like these help in exits for both new entrepreneurs and investors, which encourage more innovation and dry powder to investors,"" said Harish H.V., managing partner at ECube, an environmental, social and governance fund."

MUMBAI :
Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran on Thursday said there has been some improvement when it comes to group companies working together, but there is both the need as well as the room for more collaboration between them.
Addressing the annual general meeting of TCS, the cash-cow of the salt-to-software conglomerate Chandrasekaran said group companies work at an arm's length and there is full transparency, but exhorted the need to work together more.
""We have seen some improvements, but we need to improve a lot more,"" Chandrasekaran said.
It can be noted that since taking over in February 2017, Chandrasekaran has embarked on a strategy for increased integrations between group companies, which includes getting companies from a particular vertical together like defence, and also merging companies--as he did with Tata Chemicals and Tata Global Beverages.
The $100-billion plus group is working on a comprehensive plan to get down its water usage and carbon footprint, he said.
Chandrasekaran, a career TCSian who rose to the top of the group, said there is a case for senior employees at the largest software exporter to be paid more.
Replying to shareholders' queries on a rise in the number of employees drawing a salary of  ₹1 crore and above, he said the staff cost is only 53 percent of the revenue, which is very low compared to the peers.
To a specific query on his brother and TCS chief operating officer N Ganapathy Subramaniam getting an extension, he said all the related party decisions are done at the appropriate fora.
He said while TCS has a retirement age, the presence of extraordinary skillsets essential to negotiate the market landscape has resulted in 10-15 employees like Ritu Anand and Barindra Sanyal and others getting extensions.
Chandrasekaran said while TCS has adequate women representation on the board and also 36 percent of the over 4 lakh employees are from the fairer sex, there is a need for more diversity among the management team.
On the massive rise donations to political parties, by the Tata Trusts in the just concluded hustings, he said all the group firms contribute for the trusts ahead of an election every five years and the combined pool is split between political parties as per their strength in the Lok Sabha.
It can be noted that the Tatas gave around  ₹600 crore in political funding in the 2019 hustings, which is over 20 times of what it had given for the 2014 polls. Of this, as much as  ₹220 crore was contributed by TCS.
The company has thousands of patents, but those are largely to claim rights over new technologies such that they can be deployed for customers, he said, adding TCS is not looking at licensing the patents now.
He said it is the shift to digital which is at the core of driving the business and that the company has invested in retraining all employees in the past few years.
""We are seeing beginning of a new cycle, demand environment will be strong. TCS is in for a multi-year cycle, help customers and grow its revenue,"" he said.
TCS managing director and chief executive Rajesh Gopinathan said digital revenue has been growing at 50 percent annually and constituted over USD 6 billion of the overall USD 20 billion revenue in FY19.
He said the company was able to close new deals of over USD 21.9 billion in the last fiscal.
On the demand situation, he said it continues to be robust structurally but there are ""lingering issues"" on various fronts like Brexit or trade wars, and added that technological investments are high.
There is volatility in deal pipeline, but the overall trend is strong, he said.
The company expects the new finance minister to present a growth-oriented budget and re-ignite the digital India initiative with investments in technology, he said."

Bengaluru: The United States' plans to cap H1-B work visas, used by Indian IT firms to send employees there, would imply a ""further crunch"" for businesses to access skilled workforce, industry lobby group Nasscom said on Thursday.
The United States told India it is considering caps on H-1B visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally days ahead of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's visit to New Delhi, Reuters reported on Wednesday citing three sources with knowledge of the matter.
The warning comes as trade tensions between the United States and India have resulted in tit-for-tat tariff actions in recent weeks. From Sunday, India imposed higher tariffs on some U.S. goods, days after Washington withdrew a key trade privilege for New Delhi.
The $150 billion Indian IT sector uses the work visas to fly engineers and developers to service clients, including software giants such as Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc in the U.S., their biggest market.
If Washington made it more difficult to hire advanced tech workers, it would only weaken the U.S. companies that depend on them to help fill their skill gaps and put jobs at risk, Nasscom said in an emailed statement.
However, the lobby group, which counts Wipro Ltd Chairman Rishad Premji and Infosys Ltd Chief Operating Officer U.B. Pravin Rao among its governing members, said it awaited clarity from official sources on the matter.
""The American companies themselves need Indian talent, so if there is a cap on these visas, this will impact U.S. companies also and hurt their business interests,"" said Sudheer Guntupalli, an analyst with Ambit Capital in Mumbai.
""Clearly this seems to be a retaliatory measure from the U.S. government.""
Shares of sector heavyweights Infosys fell as much as 2.13% on Thursday, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) lost 2.12% and Wipro fell over 3% in early trade, following the report, before recouping losses later in the day.
Infosys and Wipro did not comment on the matter, while TCS did not immediately respond to requests for their views on the report."

Hotels in Chennai are rationing water for guests amid searing heat while companies limit showers as the city of 4.6 million faces its worst shortage in years.
All four reservoirs that supply Chennai, known as the Detroit of South Asia for its flourishing automobile industry, have run dry this summer, largely because of poor monsoon rains last year.
Chennai is one of 21 cities that a government think-tank warned last year could run out of ground water by 2020. This year's monsoon is delayed, further compounding problems across a swath of western and central India.
Employees in Chennai-based companies such as Fiat Chrysler, TCS, Wipro and Cognizant said they had been asked to cut back on water use in canteens and restrooms.
US-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS), which employs thousands in the city, said it had cut down on water at its canteen and gym.
""We have also switched to biodegradable plates in all our cafeterias, temporarily closed shower facilities in our gyms, and minimised the washing of utensils in our campuses by our cafeteria vendors,"" CTS said in a statement.
Water storage levels in the city's four major reservoirs were one-hundredth of what they were this time last year - and at a mere 0.2% of capacity, according to state government data.
Chennai is entirely dependent on the northeast monsoon which begins in October. The last three months of 2018 received lower than average rainfall, with the deficit rising to as much as 80 percent in the month of December, according to India's weather office.
Ananda, a small hotel in southern Chennai, had a notice at its entrance warning of a water shortage.
""It's not just us, all the hotels run the risk of shutting down because there's hardly enough water,"" said P. Chandrasekhar, a supervisor at the hotel.
State authorities said they had stepped up water supplies to the city each year. ""In 2017, we were supplying 450 million litres of water. Now we are supplying 525 million litres per day,"" S. P. Velumani, the minister for municipal administration, said.
But across town, residents could be seen crowded around water tankers in temperatures of over 40 degrees Celsius, holding buckets as media reported scuffles."

Singapore/Mumbai: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Hindustan Unilever Ltd. are among at least 100 Indian companies that may need to sell shares worth billions of dollars after the government proposed to raise the minimum public shareholding.
Companies must increase shares held by the public to a minimum 35% from 25% at present, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her maiden budget, asking the market regulator to “mull"" the proposal.
The rule may result in equity sales of about  ₹3.9 trillion ($57 billion), creating a supply overhang on the market that’s trading near a life-time high, according to analysts including Centrum Broking Pvt. The proposal may have another side-effect: it could prompt domestic units of multinationals, who don’t rely on local funding, to delist from exchanges.
“The detail to watch out for is the time allowed to meet this new rule,"" said Rajiv Singh, who heads broking at Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. “This will mostly impact multinationals and state companies, but in the long term, it will help get more retail money in equities."" There are at least 40 state companies with public holding lower than 35%, he said.
Adequate liquidity
This isn’t the first time the government has forced founders to reduce their holdings to boost liquidity. In June 2010, the regulator gave companies three years to a ensure a minimum public float of at least 25%. That spurred share sales of at least $1 billion in June 2013 alone from companies including property developer DLF Ltd. and JSW Energy Ltd.
Exchanges globally have also introduced free-float rules to ensure liquidity for investors in a publicly traded stock. And index compilers such as MSCI Inc. take into account the percentage of shares available to investors when determining a stock’s representation in stock gauges.
“Timing and applicability need to be closely evaluated -- we don’t want this to be another forced sale,' said Vivek Gupta, partner and national head at KPMG in India.
Shares in Wipro Ltd. slumped 4.2%, the most since March 8. Coal India Ltd. slipped 3.7% and TCS ended 3.6% lower on Friday.

115,2019-07-08,TCS,"The Nifty IT index fell 2.5% on Friday after the budget was announced, double the rate at which the Nifty 500 index fellConstraining the outlook are growing headwinds for the financial services, a large business vertical for Indian IT

Mumbai: The Union budget dealt a painful blow to investors in Indian information technology (IT) stocks by imposing a tax on buyback of shares. IT companies have increasingly resorted to buybacks to return cash to shareholders, since they were more tax efficient. The new 20% tax has put a spanner in the works.
Considering that a high rate of cash return in recent years had propped up IT stocks, it isn’t surprising that investors are disappointed. The Nifty IT index fell 2.5% on Friday after the budget was announced, double the rate at which the broad Nifty 500 index fell. And that wasn’t all. The finance minister also said the government would propose to markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India that minimum public shareholding in listed companies be increased to 35% from the current 25% threshold. If implemented, this would require large stock sales by companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Wipro Ltd, where promoter holding is above the threshold.
With these twin setbacks, the focus would necessarily shift to the financial performance of IT companies. And the picture here is not pretty. While revenue growth has steadied for some companies, margin woes continue.
Indian companies are adversely placed, with utilization levels already at optimal levels and talent crunch leading to higher wage costs, said Ashish Chopra, senior group vice president-institutional research (technology) at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.
“(Profit) margin will likely decline across companies on a year-on-year comparison,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a June quarter results preview note. “While the reasons for decline will vary across companies, the broad factors are localization and increase in cost structure in the US, investments in digital and large deal-transition costs. Expect moderation in earnings assumptions ahead.""
As the chart shows, margins of IT companies have fallen in the past five years, across large-sized and mid-sized firms.
While normally, the annual depreciation in the rupee took care of cost inflation, this hasn’t been the case in recent years. Companies have struggled on the margins front because of multiple factors such as pricing pressure in the traditional IT services business, where they had a large exposure; higher on-site costs due to US visa restrictions; and a relatively low scale of operations in the upcoming digital services space.
While margins are under pressure, it’s not as if revenues are growing at an impressive pace either. No company is talking about a better FY20 when compared with FY19, barring a few who are coming from a low base, said Chopra.
Constraining the outlook are growing headwinds for financial services, a large business vertical for Indian IT. The uncertain global economic environment is undermining the recovery.
“Banking (and) financial services firms continue to face challenges from slowing global growth, a low interest rate environment, escalation of trade tensions and Brexit uncertainty,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note. “We expect demand in the financial services vertical to moderate through the course of FY2020E.""
The growing spends on new-age technologies will help the firms mitigate the impact of the sluggishness in the banking and financial services sector to some extent. “We also expect Indian IT outsourcing firms to continue to get a good share of the spending on new technology,"" said Ravi Menon, an analyst at Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd.
But since overall earnings growth expectations are unexciting—earnings are likely to grow by about 10% on average in the next two fiscals for large IT firms—there isn’t much reason to get excited about IT stocks. In the past, investors were drawn to these counters because of the generous cash return policy. But the buyback tax has upset the cart.
Kotak’s analysts said buybacks for firms with a post-tax yield on cash of 5% would be earnings per share (EPS) accretive if they are done at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of less than 20 times. The hurdle rate now rises considerably, with EPS accretion guaranteed only when the buyback is done at a P/E multiple of less than 16.7 times. With large IT stocks trading at higher valuations, gone are the days of buybacks providing a boost to EPS and return ratios."
114,2019-07-08,TCS,"TCS and Infosys will announce their results this weekTax on buyback of shares from companies and move to raise public float have hurt market sentiment: Analysts

Indian markets fell sharply today, extending losses to the second day. At day’s low, the Sensex fell over 900 points and breached the 39,000 mark, extending its two-day loss to over 1,300 points. The Nifty slumped below 11,600. On Friday, both the Sensex and Nifty fell nearly 1% after some Budget proposals spooked market sentiments. Global cues were also weak today after strong US jobs data tempered expectations for a Fed rate cut. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost more than 1%, with every market in the red.
Among the Sensex stocks, Bajaj Finance was the biggest loser, falling nearly 9%. NTPC, L&T, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki and ONGC fell between 4% and 6%.
Here are 5 things to know about market fall today:
1) In Budget 2019, “tax on buyback of shares from companies and move to raise public float to 35% are fresh surprises and that would lead to some more adjustment of prices on the down side,"" says Ashish Nanda, EVP at Kotak Securities.
2) Rajiv Singh, CEO of stock broking at Karvy Broking, said many companies would need to increase their public shareholding, mostly by selling of promoters' stakes or additional equity issuance. ""The detail to watch out for is the time allowed to meet this new rule,"" Singh added.
3) Though many analysts have welcomed the Budget proposals, they say there’s no big fiscal stimulus plan, quite contrary to what many investors had expected.
4) A higher income tax levy on high net individuals has also hurt sentiments further, say some analysts. Amar Ambani, president and research head at Yes Securities, said: “Union Budget FY20 was well detailed and in the right direction in terms of focus of this government. However, higher tax on high net-worth individuals reduces their investible surplus in stocks directly, through MFs and PMSes, especially in the midcap space."" The BSE midcap index fell 2% today.
5) Analysts say that after the initial overhang of the Union Budget, focus would shift to the earnings season. IT heavyweights TCS and Infosys will announce their results on July 9 and July 12, respectively. On the macroeconomic front, IIP and CPI inflation will be unveiled on July 12. Besides, progress of monsoon and global developments will also be on participants’ radar.
Nifty has support at 1,500 levels and in case of any rebound, 11,900-12,000 zone would act as hurdle, says Religare’s Mishra, who advises stock- specific trading approach."
106,2019-07-09,TCS,"Apart from the life sciences and healthcare business, all other TCS verticals saw only single-digit revenue growthThe June quarter growth of 10.6% comes on the back of a high base of 9.3% growth in the year-ago period

Hyderabad: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd reported revenue for the June quarter that was materially below the Street’s estimates. Revenue stood at $5.49 billion, an increase of merely 1.6% over the seasonally weaker March quarter. Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd and Kotak Institutional Equities had estimated revenue growth of 2.6-2.7% in dollar terms. A miss of about one percentage point sequentially is considered huge by the Street, and has historically resulted in sharp declines in valuations.
Year-on-year growth in revenue fell to 10.6% in constant currency terms in June, from 12.7% in the March quarter. Apart from the life sciences and healthcare vertical, which grew revenues by 18.1%, all other industry verticals saw only single-digit growth in revenue. Growth was much stronger across verticals in the March quarter.
Besides, TCS reported an operating profit margin of 24.2%, slightly lower than estimates of Jefferies and Kotak. This miss on revenue growth and margins is likely to result in downgrades by analysts in earnings estimates. In the first quarter, TCS reported a net income of  ₹8,131 crore, a year-on-year growth of 10.8%. But thanks to the company’s buyback which reduced its equity capital, growth in earnings per share rose 13% year-on-year.
The company management said on a call with analysts that revenue was softer than what it had envisaged at the beginning of the quarter.
The revenue performance is particularly disappointing in the light of the large deal wins TCS has been reporting for many quarters now. As it turns out, it reported deal wins worth $5.7 billion in the June quarter, too, higher than the $4.9 billion in the year-ago period.
As one analyst put it, TCS’s book-to-bill ratios have deteriorated significantly, referring to the proportion of the company’s order book that translates into revenues that are billed.
Growth at the biggest business vertical—banking financial services and insurance (BFSI), which had witnessed a recovery in the previous fiscal—moderated to 9.2% in June from 11.6% in the March quarter.
“We think weak spending has already started to reflect in weaker outlook for tech budgets, which for 4 of the large US banks is expected to grow slower at ~4% in CY19F vs ~8% in CY18,"" analysts at Nomura said in a note.
Growth in another large business vertical—retail and consumer packaged goods—dipped to 7.9% in June, from 9.9% in March. Together, these segments generated 47% of the company’s revenues last fiscal.
A more sanguine view is that a high base effect has caught up with TCS. The growth rate of about 12% in the preceding two quarters came off a base where growth was happening at around 6-7%. The June quarter growth of 10.6% comes on the back of a higher base of 9.3% growth in the year-ago period.
Still, all of this raises questions about the double-digit growth assumptions that investors are banking on for the current fiscal. “Led by a soft start in Q1, we see US dollar revenue growth being downgraded for FY20E,"" an analyst at a domestic broking firm wrote in a note to clients.
On the company’s part, the management wants to wait for another quarter (Q2) before commenting on its growth outlook. The weakness in the BFSI business has been more pronounced, the management told analysts.
But with healthy order inflows and deal pipeline the management sees positive momentum in revenue growth continuing. “If Q2 comes in strong, then we are set for double digit growth,"" Rajesh Gopinathan, TCS’s chief executive officer and managing director, told analysts.
As such, all hopes are pinned on the Q2 performance, because the second half of the fiscal year tends to be soft in terms of demand growth.
The silver lining is that TCS hasn’t given up hopes of a revival in growth rates. In a sign of growing confidence about future growth, the company stepped up hiring, adding 12,356 personnel, the highest in the last five years. “We are gearing ourselves for the demand we see out there,"" Gopinathan told analysts.
Even so, given the notable outperformance of the TCS stock and its premium valuations (reflecting its superior growth profile) investors may as well wait for further clarity on the growth outlook."

3) EPS rises: The Earnings Per Share (EPS) was at  ₹21.67, up 13% year-on-year. ""Sustained rigour in operations helped deliver strong cash conversion and EPS expansion,"" Ramakrishnan said. The Board has recommended a dividend of  ₹5 per equity share for the June quarter.
4) Broad revenue growth: Revenue growth was broad-based across verticals during the quarter ended June 2019. Lifesciences and healthcare led the pack, growing 18.1%. The other verticals — BFSI grew 9.2%, retail & consumer packaged goods grew 7.9%, communications and media grew 8.4%, technology and Services increased 7.8% and manufacturing rose 5.5%) – all showed industry-leading growth rates. Revenue of the Mumbai-based firm grew 11.4% to  ₹38,172 crore in the June 2019 quarter, compared to  ₹34,261 crore in the same quarter of 2018-19, it added.
5) Multiple foreign orders: Digital revenue accounted for 32.2% of the topline, growing 42.1% in the said quarter over the previous year. The company added four customers in the $100 million or more category in April-June quarter. The company's focus on artificial intelligence helped it bag major deals across the globe. TCS was selected by a large European bank as a strategic partner for operating model transformation across application development, application management and infrastructure services. The company was engaged by a major US airline as a strategic partner for a multi-year engagement to provide application management & quality assurance services. TCS has also been engaged by a major Australian telecommunications company to deliver greater efficiency and improve net promoter score using a TCS-built digital twin, supported by cognitive and AI-enabled automation interventions. TCS has also been selected by a large airline group in South America to transform customer experience on its omni-channel digital commerce platforms, with TCS Interactive design, implementation and maintenance services."

111,2019-07-09,TCS,"With the rupee hardly providing any buffer, and with rising wage costs, margins are expected to fall for nearly all IT services companiesTCS, however, is projected to report a relatively better financial performance among the top tier IT companies

Shares of TCS Ltd are trading 2.3% lower ahead of its June quarter results announcement. The company is scheduled to announce financial results for the June quarter after market hours on Tuesday.
The softness in the company’s shares isn’t surprising, given investors’ concerns on the margins front. With the rupee hardly providing any buffer, and with rising wage costs, margins are expected to fall for nearly all IT services companies.
TCS, however, is projected to report a relatively better financial performance among the top tier IT companies. Revenues in constant currency terms are projected to rise 3% sequentially; i.e. compared to the March quarter.
Given the headwinds to the global economy, the focus will undoubtedly be on management commentary on the business environment and sustainability of the double digit revenue growth momentum. “While TCS does not give an explicit growth guidance, management has been optimistic about continuing double-digit growth in FY20 despite some macro headwinds - our estimate implies 12% YoY constant currency growth in 1Q. Deal TCV (total contract value) has been averaging $6 billion over the last 2 quarters and will be the other key metric to look out for,"" Jefferies India Pvt Ltd said in a results preview note.
Analysts at Jefferies and Kotak Institutional Equities expect TCS’s profitability margins to drop 60-70 basis points from March quarter. This will be true for most IT companies. “While the reasons for decline (in margins) will vary across companies, the broad factors are localization and increase in cost structure in the US, investments in digital and large deal-transition costs,"" analysts at Kotak said in a note.
Companies are facing a talent crunch at a time when utilisation levels are already at optimal levels. Costs related to visas and increased onsite hiring are not helping either. The depreciation in rupee used to offset the impact of wage hikes to some extent. But companies have no such benefit this time. The rupee has appreciated 1.2% against the US dollar last quarter.
Analysts say cost pressures will be more pronounced for some other companies who are lagging behind in digital investments and developing new business capabilities. “We expect divergent growth performance across top tier IT cos in 1QFY20E with TCS & Infosys leading at 3% QoQ constant currency and Tech Mahindra & Wipro the laggards. EBIT margins are likely to decline 14-230 basis points QoQ due to wage hikes (seasonal), rupee appreciation, higher visa costs and company-specific factors,"" Jefferies adds."

NEW DELHI :
TCS iON, a unit of IT major Tata Consultancy Services, Wednesday said it has partnered with All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to provide students with a digital learning course to equip them with career skills.
TCS iON has curated a free, 20 hour-career skills course that will cover topics like corporate etiquette, effective e-mail writing, impactful presentations and IT awareness that will be available to students throughout the duration of their degree course.
The course, which will be available for students of more than 10,000 AICTE approved institutions, can be accessed on TCS iON Digital Learning Hub through any device.
""We are one of the largest recruiters of engineering graduates in the country. We have noticed that there is a gap in students' competencies in terms of career skills. While students may have strong academic performance, the lack of basic soft skills such as effective communication and interpersonal skills may result in these students missing out on job opportunities,"" TCS iON Global Head Venguswamy Ramaswamy told PTI.
Through the partnership, TCS, together with educational institutions, intends to help students develop better career skills, he added.
Ramaswamy said the company had last year selected 63,000 students from over 2.8 lakh applicants through its National Qualifier Test, but could extend offer letters to only about 30,000. Many of those not selected lacked these career skills.
""With this programme, we want to enhance the quality of talent pool. It is not only for us but will help the industry at large,"" he said.
AICTE Chairman Anil D Sahasrabudhe said the course will empower students with career skills to help them stand out in the competitive hiring scenario.
""The unique course will help improve placement opportunities for our institutions, thereby initiating a strong start to the professional careers of the students. The guidance provided by TCS iON will prepare students for their professional endeavours and help cultivate a highly qualified, competent, and proficient workforce,"" he said.
AICTE is the national-level apex advisory and regulatory body for technical education.

103,2019-07-14,TCS,"Investors hailed Infosys’ strong results and its move to increase payouts to shareholdersThe company upped its annual revenue guidance, thanks to an increase in large deal wins

After Tata Consultancy Services Ltd reported a disappointing set of numbers for the June quarter, all eyes were on Infosys Ltd's results to see if the entire industry is witnessing a drop in growth rates. But Infosys has bucked the trend, with a strong performance for the June quarter. Revenues increased 2.8% sequentially in constant currency terms. On a year-on-year basis, they are up 12.4%, better than the 11.7% growth in the March quarter. What’s more, Infosys has announced it will increase its cash return ratio to as high as 85% of free cash flow, from 70% earlier.
It’s little wonder Infosys shares were up about 8% in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. To be sure, growth was propped up partly by the Stater N.V. acquisition, which added about 60 basis points to sequential growth. Excluding this, the constant currency growth stands at 2.2%, which more or less similar to the 2-2.1% growth TCS is estimated to have clocked in June quarter. TCS didn’t report a sequential growth number in constant currency.
But unlike TCS, whose management gave a somewhat guarded commentary, Infosys put up a more optimistic face. TCS had pinning the sustainability of double digit revenue growth on business momentum in the September quarter. Infosys has gone ahead and increased its annual revenue growth guidance, on the back of an increase in large deal wins since April, the management said on a call with analysts. Infosys raised the revenue growth guidance for the current fiscal by a percentage point from 7.5-9.5% to 8.5-10%.
A moot question is if all this tilts the scales in favour of the Infosys stock, also given its valuation discount vis-à-vis TCS. That would be a premature call, says an analyst, citing that Infosys’s earnings per share growth continues to be weak at just 6% on the back of falling margins. On a year-on-year basis, Infosys margins fell by 320 basis points to 20.5%. TCS had reported a 13% increase in earnings per share in the June quarter, and its margins had declined only 80 basis points year-on-year in Q1.
Infosys has said it has completed the one-off investments it had outlined last year. From now, the focus is on cost discipline and deriving operating efficiencies, it added on the call. The recent appreciation in the Indian rupee notwithstanding, the company has maintained its operating margin guidance range of 21-23%. Of course, it remains to be seen whether the company delivers on this. Analysts are particularly worried about the high attrition rates at the company, and its impact on margins.
For now, Infosys has done well to improve deal flow. Last quarter the company saw record deal bookings of $2.7 billion. In the preceding two quarters, large deal bookings averaged at around $1.5 billion. Infosys highlighted that the upgrade in revenue growth guidance is driven more by improving traction in large deal pipeline, rather than the contribution from acquisitions.
For the stock to narrow its valuation discount with TCS further, it would need to deliver not only on deal flow and revenue, but on margins as well."

Infosys shares today rallied near 7% to a new high of Infosys shares hit record high on strong Q1 earnings. What experts sayover 4% after the IT company started FY20 on a strong note with constant currency revenue growth of 12.4% YoY. The Bengaluru-based IT company also raised its revenue forecast for the year on upbeat demand for digital services. Infosys, lifted the revenue forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2020 to between 8.5% and 10% on constant currency basis as its first quarter net profit beat analysts' estimates. This compares with its previous guidance of between 7.5% to 9.5%.
Infosys also reported record deal wins of $2.7 billion in the quarter. Infosys posted a net profit of  ₹3,802 crore, ahead of analyst expectations of  ₹3,612 crore. Infosys maintained its operating margin guidance for 2019-2020 in the range of 21% to 23%.
Some analysts however pointed out to the higher level of attrition in the company. With a churn rate of 23.4%, Infosys said it would hire 18,000 staff from university campuses this year.
Infosys has revised its capital allocation policy upwards to distribute about 85% of free cash flows cumulatively over a 5-year period, from 70% earlier, a move which is positive for the stock, say analysts.
Brokerage Views on Infosys Shares
Reliance Securities: ""Attrition remains a bug-bear and this is an area that the IT major needs to focus (on) given major digital talent shortage and attendant margin pressure due to wage cost inflation,"" said Harit Shah of Reliance Securities.
Sharekhan: “Infosys has delivered inline revenues, while EBIT margin was above our estimates. On the positive side, TCV wins of $2.7 bn in Q1 on top of $1.56 bn in Q4FY19, broad based growth in industries vertical and strong 42% growth in digital revenue looks promising. On the flip side, elevated attrition numbers continues to remain a sour point for the company. Overall, earnings performance was healthy and increase in revenues guidance to 8.5-10% has positively surprised us. Also, company new stated objective of capital allocation to investors at 85% of Free cash flows vs 75% earlier is quite comforting, we have a BUY rating on the stock with target price of  ₹840,"" said Sanjeev Hota, AVP Research at Sharekhan, by BNP Paribas.
Motilal Oswal: This brokerage said that Infosys Q1 performance was marginally ahead of expectations and ""more significant for valuations was the capital allocation policy change, which will enhance its pre-tax payout yields."" Motilal Oswal, which has a 'Buy' on the stock, says the case for narrowing of the valuation gap with TCS gets stronger.
SBI Cap Securities: ""Broad-based growth, robust deal intake, growing deal pipeline and continued strong traction in digital inspire confidence that growth challenges are largely behind for the company. The management exudes confidence that margin trajectory will improve in the coming quarters as the specific investment phase to expand digital capabilities and address gaps in the sales engine is largely behind. We believe growth convergence and return of margin stability at Infosys will narrow the valuation discount to TCS over the medium term,"", the brokerage said in a note.

92,2019-08-12,TCS,"Profitability softened at large companies as well, with HCL Tech suffering a significant hitExcept Infosys Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, revenue growth at most front-line IT firms lagged Street estimates

Global headwinds and the resultant weakness in financial services, a large business vertical, weighed on the growth rates of IT firms in June quarter. However, order wins and deal pipelines remain strong to keep growth hopes alive.
Except Infosys Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, revenue growth at most front-line IT firms lagged Street estimates. Growth at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), the largest company, moderated from the March quarter. Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd reported lacklustre performance.
The slowdown is more pronounced at second-rung firms. High client concentration and slowdown in revenues adversely impacted the profitability of these firms compared to their larger peers. “Mid-tier companies witnessed slowdown in revenue growth on year-on-year comparison to low teens from high teens earlier. Slowdown in growth from large clients and a few client-specific challenges contributed to weak results,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note. “Mid-tier companies have a strong leverage to growth; slowdown in the same has resulted in margin contraction across all companies.""
Profitability softened at large companies as well, with HCL Tech suffering a significant hit. Talent crunch, high subcontracting, deal transition and visa costs impacted profitability. Without the support of currency, profitability can remain under pressure for FY20, said the Kotak analysts.
Even so, as one analyst at a domestic broking firm pointed out some time back, relative to other sectors IT companies’ earnings have been less volatile.
Further order bookings and pipeline across the firms remain strong, providing good visibility. “Total contract value (TCV) of deal wins has been strong across all companies, reflecting a demand environment that is still reasonably good,"" analysts at Kotak said. “We appreciate that TCV may not be a reliable indicator for growth due to lack of clarity on renewals of existing business. On the other hand, it is a good indicator for momentum in wins, something that has been comforting up to now.""
Tracking the strong deal momentum, Infosys raised its lower end of the revenue growth guidance for FY20 by one percentage point. HCL Tech is confident of meeting its revenue growth guidance for the full year. TCS, despite pinning growth momentum hopes on the second quarter, is confident about prospects and is stepping-up hiring. Similarly, Tech Mahindra reported strong deal wins for the June quarter.
In comparison, Wipro announced tepid sequential revenue growth guidance of 0-2%. Similarly, company-specific troubles mean growth at Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. is expected to remain subdued in the near term. The variation in performance and growth profiles explain the valuation gap between Wipro, Tech Mahindra and others. But valuations of other front-line companies at one-year forward earnings estimates are not cheap either."

Indian stock market indices Sensex and Nifty recovered from sharp early losses to end higher today, though marginally. Banking and auto stocks led the gains. But losses in some IT stocks like TCS capped the gains. The Sensex ended 38 points higher at 37,350, recovering from day's low of 36,974. The Nifty settled 0.17% higher at 11,047.
Among the banking stocks, Yes Bank rose 4%, IndusInd Bank 2.7% and Axis Bank 2%. Select auto stocks also saw some buying. Maruti Suzuki rose 2.7%, Hero MotoCorp 1.3% and Bajaj Auto 1.3%.
Among the losers, TCS fell 2% while HCL Tech slipped 1.3%. Other market heavyweights like Reliance Industries and Hindustan Unilever also ended lower.
However, shares of Reliance Industries Ltd climbed 10% during the week, their best weekly performance since July 2018. Reliance unveiled the sale of a portion of its oil-to-chemicals business to Saudi Aramco and introduced new high-speed internet services earlier this week.
Sanjeev Zarbade, VP of PCG Research at Kotak Securities, said: ""The macro-economic fundamentals of the economy are good (inflation and forex reserves) but consumer demand has continued to weaken in recent months. The just concluded earnings season was not encouraging either. This will restrict upside for the Nifty/Sensex in the near term. Trade disputes, Global bond yields and currency will be the main monitorable for the market in coming weeks.""

86,2019-08-29,TCS,"The proportion of Ebitda that converted into operating cash flow in FY19 was 98%, most among large IT firmsThe variation in growth rates may be part of the reason

The story at Wipro Ltd in recent years has been a series of false starts. Even as revenue growth for its larger peers, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, accelerated, Wipro lagged. But one metric where the company is scoring is cash conversion.
The proportion of Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) that converted into operating cash flow stood at 98% in fiscal year 2019, the highest among large IT companies. Wipro maintains this lead with cash flows to Ebitda staying at 95% in the 12 months ended June 2019, showed an analysis by Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd.
Wipro’s growth in operating cash flow and free cash flow exceeded Ebitda growth in 12 months to June. Free cash flow adjusts for capital expenditure as well, apart from cash operating expenses.
Importantly, this is not a recent phenomenon. Cash flow growth is far superior at the company even using three-year annual average growth rates. “Over the last three years, cash conversion has been stable for Infosys/TCS, deteriorated at HCL Technologies Ltd and improved for Wipro,"" analysts at Nomura India said in a note.
What explains the variation in performance is better receivables management. Comparatively, the receivables position increased at other large IT companies, with Infosys seeing material deterioration in recent quarters.
The variation in growth rates may be part of the reason. Constant currency revenue growth year-on-year remains in mid-single digits at Wipro, while its larger peers are growing in double digits. “Typically, a growth-focused company may give some leeway to customers on payment terms,"" said an analyst on condition of anonymity. Even so, as the analyst added, Wipro is doing a decent job in getting money quickly from customers.
Of course, all of this is but a silver lining on the dark cloud of poor growth. Most analysts remain sceptical about Wipro’s growth outlook. The September quarter revenue growth guidance indicates no major improvement. The pressure on legacy business is more pronounced at Wipro than at other large companies, showed an analysis by HDFC Securities Institutional Research.
This is reflected in the valuation discount vis-à-vis other large peers. “TCS and Infosys trade at premium valuations due to revenue predictability and stable performance,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in the June quarter results review note, referring to the valuation gap in IT stocks. For Wipro’s returns to pick up, revenue growth will have to inch up as well."

Hyderabad: Built with over 2.5 times more steel than the Eiffel Tower, a built-up area spanning about 65 football fields, a helipad and 49 elevators which move one floor per second, e-commerce giant Amazon's largest campus building in the world is the latest landmark in Hyderabad.
Built in the Financial District, a key IT cluster, this campus with 1.8 million square feet office space is Amazon's first owned office building outside the US and its single largest building globally.
Spread over 9.5 acres, this 282-feet tall building can house more than 15,000 employees.
The massive campus, built amid the gleaming towers of various corporate giants, is equipped with 49 elevators, which can move a floor per second. Built on three million square feet of construction area, it is also Amazon's single largest building in the world in terms of area.
Amazon officials say the total built-up area, when spread out, will span over 68 acres or approximately 65 football fields. Out of total built-up space, 1.2 million square feet is earmarked for recreation and parking.
""The campus contains over 2.5 times more steel than the Eiffel Tower, measured by weight,"" revealed Amazon Vice President and Global Real Estate and Facilities Director John Schoettler at the inauguration of the facility recently.
Interfaith prayer rooms, a mother's room, quiet rooms, showers, helipad and an all-day open cafeteria are some of the key features of the campus, built in a short span of three years. The company officials say the structure is designed to facilitate inclusion and diversity.
It also features casual, collaborative workspaces, as well as private areas for concentration and confidentiality.
""Every detail is aimed at improving well-being and efficiency, from Destination Control Systems to manage elevators that can move 972 people simultaneously, to 290 conference rooms and 3 scrum areas per floor to foster collaboration,"" the company said.
As many as 2,000 persons were on site every day for 39 months to construct the building, spending 18 million man-hours.
Last year, the construction was awarded the Golden Trophy and Certificate from National Safety Council for safe construction process.
The building meets stringent safety standards, with 110 km of fire protection system conduits.
The campus has one conference room seat for every 3.25 workstations, higher than the global ration of 1:5.
With sustainability at its core, the campus has more than 300 trees dotting its grounds with three specimen trees aged over 200 years. It also has a 850,000 litre water recycling plant.
The company officials declined to divulge the investment made in this campus but said hundreds of millions of dollars were spent to create the facility.
Stating that the facility reaffirms their long-term commitment to India, they pointed out that Amazon already announced $5 billion investment in the country and another 500 million dollar in food retail.
Amazon already houses its largest India fulfillment centre in Hyderabad. Spread over four lakh square feet, the centre is located near Rajiv Gandhi International Airport. The company last month announced that it will be expanded to 5.8 lakh square feet.
Hyderabad is already home to giants like Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook, Deloitte, Accenture, TCS, Wipro and Infosys.
After Apple Inc opened its development centre in 2016, IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao had declared that Hyderabad became home to four of the top five most valued tech companies to have their largest offices outside the US.
Software giant Microsoft already has largest presence in Hyderabad outside their headquarters in the US.
Search giant Google also plans to build its biggest campus outside its US headquarters. Coming up on 7.2 acres in the Financial District, it is expected to house 13,000 employees. An agreement for this was signed between Google and the Telangana government in 2015.

78,2019-09-18,TCS,"Given our ahead-of-the-curve investments in digital, Cognizant is well positioned to capitalize on this substantial market, says Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, CMD, Cognizant India

BENGALURU :
Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. named Ramkumar Ramamoorthy as chairman and managing director of Cognizant India on Tuesday. Ramamoorthy, a Cognizant veteran with over 21 years experience in the company, has risen up the ranks to report to the global executive committee. In an interview, he spoke about his journey, priorities and the demand environment. Edited excerpts:
Tell us briefly about your journey with Cognizant?
I joined Cognizant in early 1998 from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), when Cognizant’s revenue was under $50 million and it just had about 1,000 employees. Cognizant then was preparing to take the company public on the Nasdaq. I initially took on the responsibility of building a dedicated corporate marketing and communications function as well as supporting the chief financial officer with investor relations. The rapid growth of Cognizant presented each one of us with abundant opportunities to spearhead newer initiatives.
The first new opportunity that came my way was to build out the company’s interactive business (then called Content and Design Services).
Likewise, when knowledge management became a competitive advantage, I was appointed Chief Knowledge Officer to evangelize a culture of knowledge sharing within the company and build a knowledge management platform. I then went on to incubate and handle several other portfolios including Market Research and Intelligence, Public Affairs and Purpose. Two years ago, I was elevated as executive director to provide strategic direction to all of Cognizant’s business-enabling functions in India.
What are your immediate priorities as the new head of India operations?
I have three key priorities. The first is to build a management committee and an operating committee in India to further strengthen our operations across 13 cities, drive greater diversity and inclusion, and extend our corporate citizenship efforts. The second is to strengthen all corporate functions in India to enable the most admired delivery engine in the world, blending efficiency and innovation, while driving high levels of client satisfaction. And given the digital disruptions happening across industries, the third priority is to sustain our position as an employer of choice in campuses and the lateral market, and extend our recruiting engine beyond engineering and management to data science, artificial intelligence (AI), information security, internet of things (IoT), and human sciences.
What are the key trends in the market? How does the demand environment look?
With digital technologies impacting every industry, clients are eager to become the disrupters and not the disrupted. Given this situation, clients are looking to re-imagine their business, operating and technology models.
Given our ahead-of-the-curve investments in digital, Cognizant is well positioned to capitalize on this substantial market opportunity driven by AI, IoT, Augmented Reality, Digital Engineering, and Blockchain, among others.
For example, Digital Engineering is a large, attractive market, with growth rates of more than 20%. Our 2018 acquisition of Softvision cemented our position as an industry leader in Digital Engineering.
As part of our Digital Engineering business today, which generates revenues of approximately $800 million, nearly 12,500 professionals are delivering a powerful combination of software product development and application modernization services to clients across the globe.
Give us a sense of the nature of deals and sizes. Which markets are you focusing on?
As investments are shifting to digital, client engagements are becoming more project oriented, which means more contracts with lower total contract value. To win in this new model, Cognizant account teams are building relationships with the broader C-suite, as budget owners, decision-makers and influencers extend beyond the CIO. Likewise, we are building more consultative selling skills, more digital talent, more intellectual property and thought leadership aligned by industry vertical.
In the last 18 months alone, we have reskilled and upskilled more than 140,000 of our employees.
On geographies, while we will continue to focus on and invest in North America, we have also been increasing our focus on growth markets including the UK, Continental Europe, APAC, Australia, Japan, the Middle East and India. Today, markets outside North America are contributing approximately $4 billion in revenue and continue to grow faster than North America."

BENGALURU: :
Infosys Ltd, India’s second-largest software exporter by revenue, aims to reduce high attrition levels with skilling programmes and compensation-based incentives.
The attrition rate at Infosys was 23.4% in the April-June quarter, up from 20.4% in the previous quarter. This is much higher than competitor Tata Consultancy Services Ltd’s attrition rate that stood at 11.5% in the June quarter.
The attrition rate at Infosys increased in the June quarter despite measures such as variable compensation, higher promotions, overseas postings and retention bonuses and is “beyond the comfort range for the company"", according to a 29 August report by brokerage firm Sharekhan. “The high attrition has negative impacts like higher recruitment costs, dissatisfaction among the employees, lower client satisfaction, and lower utilisation,"" the report stated.
The company’s attrition rate has been the highest among employees with 3-5 years’ experience, Krishnamurthy Shankar, executive vice president and group head of human resource at Infosys said in an interview. “The Bengaluru numbers are even higher,"" he said.
Infosys has taken various steps in terms of skilling its workforce, to address the rising attrition levels. “We are very confident attrition will come down. A lot of emphasis is being put on training,"" Shankar said.
Infosys has created something called digital tags—essentially digital skill sets that you can learn and tag yourself to. “We have identified a set of 32 skill sets in areas such as cloud architecture and internet of things, wherein we have created specific learning pathways for each of these skills sets. The employees get a certification and a skill tag. We also incentivize them through a skill bonus,"" he said.
Infosys is also focusing on early career growth of employees with incentives such as “early career rewards"" so that they are clear about their growth path within the organization in the first few years itself, Shankar said.
The company has also launched what it calls “bridge programmes"", which enable employees to pick up alternative skills, which in turn brings higher compensation. The scheme is expected to help in upskilling to meet the demands of the future as well as open up more career options, especially for young employees.
A recent trend is employees quitting jobs to pursue entrepreneurship. Infosys specifically doesn’t have any ‘intrapreneurship’ programmes, but “we have something called the Infosys Innovation Lab and hackathons where we help create proof of concepts,"" Shankar said.
The company’s ‘Be the Navigator’ programme helps in “continuous improvement for the client."" The objective of the programme is that clients should look upon Infosys business process management (BPM) as business partners who own their end-to-end process and drive business outcomes, the company said.
“While reskilling by companies can solve part of the problem, it’s not enough. Today, many people do reskilling on their own and when they switch jobs, they easily get a 30% hike, which a normal appraisal within the company can never match up to,"" said Sanchit Vir Gogia, chief analyst, Greyhound Research."

Mumbai: Shares of information technology companies fell on Monday after investors booked profit as analysts see no material impact on tax rates after the government cut tax rates for domestic companies.
Analysts said IT stocks had traded at a premium to other stocks as investors took to defensive plays due to concern over an economic slowdown and liquidity crunch.
On Monday, shares of Infosys Ltd fell 3.2%, Wipro Ltd declined 2.2%, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd 2%, Tech Mahindra Ltd 1.7%, HCL Technologies Ltd 1.3%. Nifty IT Index slumped 2%.
According to a Credit Suisse report, there will be no material impact on tax rates on IT services companies following the tax cuts. The current blended effective tax rates of 22-27% are a combination of higher tax rates paid outside India and much lower tax rates paid in India. IT companies, thus pay lower than 25% tax rates in India and the cuts announced Friday will not lower their overall tax rates.
Brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher said it has increased underweight on the sector to 390 basis points and remains cautious as growth in tech spends in BFS clients in the US and European geography will be muted compared to last year due to trade war concerns, uncertainty on central bank policy and interest rates, Brexit related uncertainty. The rupee advantage will also weaken now.

BENGALURU :
Indian IT services companies are increasing their local hiring numbers in the US, despite higher costs, to counter the increasingly stringent norms of the H-1B visa programme that allows companies to temporarily employ foreign workers in the US in specialty occupations.
On 13 September, Infosys Ltd said it plans to hire 1,000 people locally by 2023 for its just-launched Technology and Innovation Center in Arizona. The company has surpassed its “spring 2017 commitment to hire 10,000 American workers as part of its ongoing efforts to accelerate the pace of innovation for US enterprises"", it said.
In June, Wipro Ltd announced the opening of a new centre of excellence in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area of the US, for which it will hire 100 people locally over the next two years to boost its already substantial presence in the region. “Wipro specifically plans to leverage local Minnesota talent in addition to providing opportunities for recent university graduates and experts keen on developing their technology-related skills,"" Wipro said in a press release on 13 June.
India’s largest IT services provider Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), already has about 30,000 US employees, making it the largest employer in the US among Indian peers.
Cognizant, too, continues to hire in the US, “keeping up with the needs of our business growth. Nearly 76% of our revenue is from North America. We have nearly 60 US facilities and clients in 49 states. In 2017, we committed to hire at least 25,000 professionals over a five-year period,"" said a Cognizant spokesperson.
HCL Technologies Ltd, too, has brought down its dependencies on H-1B visas by hiring more people locally. The company has about 17,000 employees in the US and 64.7% of them are US citizens, according to estimates from industry insiders.
At present, there is a yearly cap of 65,000 on new H1-B visas, with an additional 20,000 visas for those with advanced degrees from a US institution.
The number of H-1B visas issued during September-October 2018 dropped 10% year-on-year from 373,400 to 335,000 because of tighter scrutiny, which led to higher on-site hiring in FY19, according to a June report by rating firm ICRA. The number of H-1B visas for initial employment that these companies have received has fallen by as much as 40% between 2014 and 2017, according to a report by Nasscom.
“As a result, the share of H-1B employees in total employment in the US has declined and the share of US-born employees has risen by 5-7%,"" it said.
The high visa denial rates are a key contributor to the increase in on-site hiring.
The visa denial rate for Wipro was highest at 62% in the first quarter of FY19 up from 7% in FY15, according to an analysis of data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) by the National Foundation for American Policy, a non-profit body engaged in public policy research. Infosys had a denial rate of 57% in October-December 2018, followed by HCL Technologies (43%), and TCS (37%). USCIS follows an October-September fiscal year.
ICRA said on-site hiring increases the cost for Indian IT services players and adds to higher visa fees and compliance cost associated with enhanced scrutiny of visa applications. “There have been several proposed legislations to substantially increase the minimum wages for H1B visa holders, which will impact the margins adversely, if implemented."" Higher on-site hiring results in higher wage bills and lower margins, it added."

US Treasury yields inched higher as Friday’s data on the US jobs market suggests the Federal Reserve may not need to cut interest rates further. Sentiment around the US economy deteriorated sharply last week after disappointing data on manufacturing and services suggested the trade war was taking a toll, and more rate cuts would be needed to avert a potential recession in the world’s biggest economy.
The modest increase in US jobs eased some of these concerns, but traders warn that downside risks loom large on the horizon. Unemployment rate in the US fell to 3.5% in September to reach the lowest since December 1969. Non-farm payrolls also grew in September, but slightly less than expected.
The focus will shift to the next round of US-China trade negotiations expected in Washington on 10-11 October to see if the two sides can end a bruising year-long trade war that has hurt global growth and raised the risk of recession.

66,2019-10-07,TCS,"Yes bank in talks with three top technology companies to induct one of them as a strategic shareholderAuto stocks may remain under pressure as the sector is grappling with weakening demand

New Delhi: Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may remain in focus today:
TCS: The IT major will kick start the earnings season for the September quarter on Thursday. This is likely to set the tone and steer the Indian equity market this week. Equity markets will be closed on Tuesday for Dussehra. Along with TCS Ltd, Infosys Ltd will also announce its earnings this week. Global factors such as crude oil prices and investment by overseas investors will drive the markets.
Bosch: The company, one of the leading automotive component suppliers, said it will observe no production days ranging upto 10 days per month per plant belonging to its powertrain solutions division during Q3FY2020. Bosch Ltd wants to align its production with sales requirements. The company had in August suspended production operations to avoid inventory build up.
Glenmark Pharma: The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning letter to the company’s manufacturing plant in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh. This after the regulator made adverse observations during an inspection in April. The company does not expect a significant financial hit from the warning letter, as there are no major pending product approvals from the facility in the next 12 months.
Zee Entertainment: Essel Group-owned Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL), at a conference call on Saturday, told investors that none of ZEEL’s shares were pledged to Russian media conglomerate VTB Capital Plc, in the structured loan arrangement inked between the firms in September 2017. Additionally, ZEEL Chief Executive Officer told investors that VTB Capital has not invoked any of those pledged shares.
Yes Bank: The bank is in talks with three top technology companies, including Microsoft Corp, to induct one of them as a strategic shareholder as part of the bank’s strategy to get fresh capital infusion and augment its digital ambitions. In another development, the bank filed a complaint with Mumbai Police and cyber cell against circulation of fake news and spreading of rumours about the bank’s financial credibility.
Pharma stocks: The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is examining a proposal to change effluent treatment norms for pharmaceutical companies after a submission by an industry body sought tweaks to existing regulations that are acting as hurdles for manufacturing. The government also plans to hold a consultation with various stakeholders to discuss ways of reducing the time taken for environment approval.
JSW Steel: The company is positive that the post-budget measures announced by the government and the ongoing festival season will boost demand sentiment, leading to better days ahead for the alloy major. Metal stocks have been under pressure due to slowdown in real estate, auto and infrastructure sectors. The company, however, remains cautious in investing in new mines.
BPCL: For a hassle-free privatisation of the state-owned firm, the government has quietly repealed the legislation that had nationalised the company, doing away with the need to seek Parliament nod before selling its off to private and foreign firms. The government has proposed to entirely sell its 53.3% stake in Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL).
Auto Stocks: Shares may remain under pressure as the sector is grappling with weakening demand. Toyota Kirloskar Motor Vice-Chairman Vikram Kirloskar said Indian auto industry is facing a big structural issue with affordability becoming one of the most serious challenges due to several factors, including headwinds created by government policies.
HDIL: The company may remain in focus as investigations in alleged financial irregularities by promoters—Sarang and Rakesh Wadhawan—will continue in the Punjab and Maharashtra (PMC) Bank case. The Economic Offenders Wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police arrested the two promoters last week for non-cooperation with officials in probe. More than two-third of the bank’s total loan book has exposure to Housing Development Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL)."
64,2019-10-10,TCS,"Organic growth is estimated at 2.4% sequentially for top four IT firms, almost same as growth in Q1Growth at TCS is likely to fall to single digits, after four straight quarters of double-digit growth

The July-September quarter has historically been the strongest one for Indian IT services companies. But in this fiscal year, there is unlikely to be any show of strength when companies announce second quarter (Q2) results.
“Organic growth is estimated at 2.4% sequentially for the top four IT firms— TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Wipro—in the September quarter, barely higher than the 2.3% growth reported in each of the preceding two quarters,"" says an IT sector analyst at a domestic institutional firm, who declined to be named.
What’s more, year-on-year revenue growth at industry leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) is expected to fall to single-digit levels, after four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth.
“We see risks to double-digit growth guidance at TCS,"" analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a results preview note to clients. Analysts expect the company to report 9-9.5% growth, down from 10.6% in Q1. While TCS doesn’t give guidance, its management had earlier sounded confident of achieving double-digit growth in FY20.
If the company’s growth falls to single-digit levels in what is meant to be the strongest quarter in the year, it’s fair to conclude that investors would need to settle for lower-than-anticipated growth for the whole year.
Indian IT companies have been sounding cautious about tech spending in the banking and financial services (BFS) vertical, pointing to weakness in areas such as capital markets, European banks and some US regional banks that are going through mergers and acquisitions.
This was attested to when Accenture Plc. reported results for the quarter ended August late last month. Revenues from its financial services vertical grew 4%, far lower than the 7.2% company-wide growth. This was mainly owing to a continued decline in revenues from European banks.
Since the BFS vertical is a mainstay for most Indian IT services firms, it isn’t surprising that overall growth rates are under pressure. “We believe that IT spending will moderate in financial services in 2019 after a strong year in 2018. IT services companies face pressure from higher squeeze on run spends (i.e. traditional services), while spending in new areas remains steady,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients last month.
While revenue growth is coming under pressure, profit margins, too, have been falling. Increasing protectionism has resulted in a higher cost structure in these companies’ US on-site operations.
To be sure, the impact of these headwinds will be felt differently across different companies. In TCS’s case, a high-base last year will also impact growth. Infosys, on the other hand, had a relatively lower base; besides, it has a set of BFS clients that are reportedly increasing tech spend. It’s little wonder shares of the latter have outperformed TCS by a wide margin in the past three months."
63,2019-10-10,TCS,"IT major will kick start the earnings season for the September quarter on ThursdayReserve Bank of India (RBI) has rejected the proposed merger of Lakshmi Vilas Bank Ltd (LVB) with Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd (IHF)

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Thursday:
Indiabulls Housing: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has rejected the proposed merger of Lakshmi Vilas Bank Ltd (LVB) with Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd (IHF), puncturing the shadow bank’s attempt to get a banking licence. This comes after the RBI in September placed LVB in the prompt corrective action (PCA) list due to inadequate capital ratio, high level of bad loans and negative return on asset (RoA) for two years in a row.
TCS: The IT major will kick start the earnings season for the September quarter on Thursday. This is likely to set the tone and steer the Indian equity market. A slowdown in the economy combined with liquidity concerns in non-banking financial companies(NBFCs) may not bode well for the earnings season. IndusInd Bank Ltd will also announce its earnings today.
RIL: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio on Wednesday announced it will charge customers 6 paise per minute for voice calls made to rival phone networks, but will compensate them by giving free data of equal value. The decision came in the wake of regulatory uncertainty over review of sunset clause for call termination charges.
Lakshmi Vilas Bank: Shares of the bank are seen under pressure as RBI has rejected its proposed merger with IHF. The stock has lost 71% value since the all-stock merger was announced in April. The bank has been placed in the PCA list as it is way below the capital adequacy, RoA and non-performing asset (NPA) thresholds.
Yes Bank: The private lender was the top loser in Wednesday’s trade. Shares tanked after the company declined commenting on a Mint report that the bank was in talks with Microsoft Corp to raise funds. The bank said it was not aware of the news source. The stock has been losing value due to concern over exposure to stressed sectors, especially housing-finance companies, and weak financials of the bank.
Bharti Airtel: The company on Wednesday said it has raised $750 million (about  ₹5,330 crore) from investors based in Asia, Europe and the US through a hybrid financial instrument. The telecom operator will use the proceeds for refinancing, investments in subsidiaries and general corporate purpose.
Lupin: The pharmaceutical company has received a good manufacturing practice (GMP) certificate from Japan’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) for its bulk drug manufacturing facility at Mandideep in Madhya Pradesh. The certificate was issued after PMDA did not make any critical observation in an inspection at Mandideep Unit II from May 14-17, 2019.
JBM Auto: Shares of JBM Auto Ltd surged, ending up 20% on Wednesday after the company said it had received orders for supply of 300 buses. In an exchange filing, the company said it has bagged orders from Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System Limited (DIMTS), Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport Corporation (NMMTC) and two airline companies.
MTNL: Shares of the state-owned telecom company have been under pressure as the finance ministry is not keen on infusing fresh capital to bail out Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL). According to a Financial Express report, the ministry has rejected a massive bail-out package worth Rs.74,000 crore sought by the Department of Telecommunications to revive the debt-ridden company.
Bank of Maharashtra: The state-owned bank on Wednesday said the RBI has denied permission to settle its accumulated losses of  ₹7,360 crore against the balance lying in its share premium account and revenue reserve account."

Indian stock markets are likely to be pressure on Thursday as September quarter corporate earnings kickstart. Global equity markets tumbled and the safe haven yen and Swiss franc gained in early Asian trade on Thursday, on signs that Washington and Beijing still have a long way to go on resolving trade issues, with little progress made in deputy-level talks.
The South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported the Chinese delegation, headed by Vice Premier Liu He, planned to leave Washington just a day after minister-level meetings, instead of as originally planned on Friday.

The SCMP report on the US-China trade talks came less than a couple of hours after US President Donald Trump told reporters he thought China wanted to make a trade deal more than he did. Chinese government officials told Reuters that Beijing has lowered expectations for significant progress from this week’s trade talks with the United States, upset by the blacklisting of Chinese companies.

60,2019-10-10,TCS,"The record date of dividend is 18th October and payment date 24th OctoberThe July-September quarter has historically been the strongest one for Indian IT services companies

India's biggest IT company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) today reported a constant currency revenue growth of 8.4% year-on-year for the quarter ending September 30, 2019. This was below the Street's expectations. TCS announced a dividend of  ₹45 per share, including special dividend of  ₹40 per share. The record date of dividend is 18th October and payment date is 24th October.
The July-September quarter has historically been the strongest one for Indian IT services companies. Analysts expected TCS to report 9-9.5% year-on-year growth in revenue in constant currency terms.
TCS reported an operating margin of 24%, which was also below the Street's estimates.
CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said its Q2 order book was the highest in the last six quarters.
Here are highlights of TCS Q2 results:
Revenue at  ₹38,977 crore, +5.8% YoY
Constant Currency revenue growth: +8.4% YoY
Net profit at  ₹8,042 crore, +1.8% YoY
Operating Margin at 24%
Earnings Per Share at  ₹1.43, +3.8% YoY
Digital Revenue at 33.2%, Growth of 27.9% YoY
Net addition of 14,097 employees in Q2
IT Services attrition rate at 11.6% LTM
Revenue growth was led by Life Sciences & Healthcare (+16%) and Communications & Media (+11.8%).
BFSI revenues grew 8%, manufacturing 7.8%, technology & services 5.6% and retail and CPG 4.8%
Commenting on the Q2 performance, CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said: ""We ended the quarter with steady growth despite increased volatility in the financial services and retail verticals. We remain confident as the medium and longer term demand for our services continues to be very strong, as evidenced by our Q2 order book - the highest in the last six quarters.""
TCS shares ended 0.80% lower today. The IT company announced its earnings after market hours.
CFO V Ramakrishnan said: ""We have been gearing up for growth despite the volatility. Our margins in Q2 reflect our continued investments in our people, and in building the capacity we need to fulfill our strong order book."""
51,2019-10-11,TCS,"Even as operating profit growth remains weak, investors are seeing Infosys as a company in an investment phase, and are willing to overlook weak profit growth, for nowWhile TCS’s earnings disappointed the Street, Infosys’ Q2 earnings were marginally ahead of estimates

Mumbai: In the past three months, shares of Infosys Ltd have outperformed those of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd by about 22%. The September quarter results announced by the two companies support this shift in investor preference. While TCS’s earnings disappointed the Street, Infosys’ Q2 earnings were marginally ahead of estimates.
While Infosys’s revenues were more or less in line with expectations, growing by 3.3% in constant currency terms, operating profit margins were better than expected at 21.7%.
Of course, operating profit growth remains weak at 0.4% year-on-year, but investors are seeing Infosys as a company in an investment phase, and are willing to overlook weak profit growth, for now. Besides, margins did improve by 120 basis points sequentially, unlike TCS, whose margins fell to a nine-quarter low in Q2.
On the main metrics that investors are focused on, such as deal wins and revenue growth, Infosys continues to do well. Revenues grew 11.4% in constant currency terms, which translates to slightly under 10% growth after adjusting for the impact of acquisitions. It reported strong double-digit growth in nearly all of its business verticals, barring retail, which grew just 1% and dragged down overall growth. “Business in the retail vertical is closely linked to consumer sentiment, which has been weak lately owing to uncertainties in the global economy,"" the company said in a press conference.
Importantly, it announced large deal wins worth $2.8 billion, which is far higher than preceding quarters, although it must be noted that only 10% of these were from new deal wins.
Infosys’s guidance for the year, however, remains conservative. It expects to grow by 10% at best this year, despite growing by over 11.5% in the first half of the year. This implies growth of about 8% in the second half in reported terms, and only about 6.5% growth on an organic basis.
But as an analyst at a multinational brokerage says, “It does look like Infosys is being overly conservative, as the current guidance implies nearly no growth in the remaining two quarters on a sequential basis.""
Given the disappointment at TCS, and with limited options in the markets, investors may well continue to keep the faith in Infosys. Infosys shares were trading 3.3% higher in the pre-market session on the New York Stock Exchange at the time of writing."

Here is a list of top five stocks buzzing in early trade on Friday:
Bandhan Bank: Shares of the Kolkata-based bank surged 20%, hitting an upper circuit, today amid reports that the stock will be added to the MSCI index, effective 16 October. According to Motila Oswal Financial Services, Bandhan Bank will be added to the index due to its impending merger with Gruh Finance Ltd, a subsidiary of HDFC Ltd. The merger should be completed by this month.
Gruh Finance: Tracking Bandhan Bank Ltd, shares of the company jumped more than 10% in early trade. Reports that Bandhan Bank’s stock will be added to the MSCI index following its merger with Gruh Finance Ltd buoyed investor sentiment. The National Company Law Tribunal recently approved the merger of both companies, clearing all hurdles for the amalgamation to go through.
Tata Steel: The steel-manufacturing giant’s India production rose 4.7% year-on-year to 4.50 million tonnes in the quarter ended September. Tata Steel Ltd had produced 4.3 million tonnes of crude steel in the same period last fiscal. The company’s steel production rose due to addition from Tata Steel BSL Ltd. The stock was up more than 3% in early deals today.
Cipla: Shares of the pharmaceutical company slumped in early deals today as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made critical observations related to cleanliness of equipment and utensils at the company’s Goa manufacturing facility. The US FDA, which inspected the plant during 16-27 September, said equipment and utensils were not sanitized properly to avoid contamination. The stock pared early losses, and traded largely flat at Rs418.
TCS: The stock was down 2.5% after the software major announced its July-September earnings after market hours on Thursday, missing the Street’s estimates on various parameters. TCS reported a constant currency revenue growth of 8.4% year-on-year compared with expectations of 9-9.5% rise. Profit was at Rs8,040 crore for the September quarter, lower than the estimated Rs8,300 crore by 22 Bloomberg analysts."

Mumbai: Shares of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd fell 3.8% on Friday after the company reported lower-than-estimated earnings for its September quarter.
The IT major reported a profit of  ₹8,040 crore for the September quarter compared with an estimated  ₹8,300 crore by 22 Bloomberg analysts. TCS reported a revenue growth of 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in dollar terms to $5,517 million. This is the weakest second-quarter growth (seasonally the strongest quarter) since the July-September quarter of FY17. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin was also lower than expectation by 114 basis points on the back of higher employee costs, leading to a 6% miss on EBIT.
At 10am, the stock was trading at  ₹1,958.95 on the BSE, down 2.27% from its previous close while the Sensex rose 1.2% to 38,323.78 points.
Here are the brokerage views of the results:
Nomura
1. See limited scope for revenue acceleration in the second half of fiscal year 2020, given the incremental weakness in retail and regional markets, and continued softness in BFSI (combined 70% of revenues), though some improvement in telecom and manufacturing is visible;
2. Forecast 8% year-on-year growth in FY20F in constant currency terms (vs 8.8% previously) and see risks to the Street’s near double-digit growth estimates.
3. On EBIT margins, the brokerage firm sees near-term levers from utilization as hiring momentum slows and rationalization of SGA, over the medium term margins are likely to be under pressure on rising onsite costs, pricing pressure in legacy and higher subcontractor expenses
4. Cut revenues by 1% and EBIT margins by 20-40 basis points over FY20-22E
5. Rating remains at neutral and lower target price by 3% to  ₹1950 a share.
Jefferies
1. Continued weakness in retail, parts of BFSI, and many regional markets affected growth
2. Retail weakness also led to deceleration in digital growth in the second quarter
3. With weak earnings it is now almost confirmed that the company will grow in single digits in FY20E — we cut our year-on-year constant currency growth estimate to 8.4%; also cut EBIT margin to 24.3% to reflect weak H1. This leads to 4-6% reduction in our EPS estimates over FY20-22E
4. Maintains buy rating but reduces target price to  ₹2,300 from  ₹2,500 earlier.
Emkay global
1. We see earnings as a confirmation for the moderation in revenue growth across the sector that we have been highlighting in our notes due to global macro weakness which is also leading to incremental offshore shift, reversing the multi-year trends toward higher local delivery
2. Weak financial services and retail reflect macro weakness and possible slowdown in decision making
3. Rupee depreciation and improvement in macros remain key risks
4. The brokerage firm continues to be under weight on the stock and cut its target price to  ₹1980 a share from  ₹2004 earlier.
Nirmal Bang
1. The slower growth was due to continued softness in BFSI and unexpected weakness in the retail vertical.
2. With limited margin levers in the light of weak growth in H2 other than INR depreciation, we think margin recovery will be challenging
3. We believe with the new buyback norms in place, capital return from here on will likely be more in the form of dividends.
4. We retain out sell rating with a target price of  ₹1593 a share
Bob Caps
1. The revenue miss stemmed from continued weakness in the BFSI and retail verticals, while a double whammy from cost-revenue mismatch and the absence of currency tailwinds cramped margins.
2. This virtually rules out the possibility of double-digit growth for FY20 and marks a deepening revenue slowdown
3. We trim FY21/ FY22 EPS by 5-6%, lower our target P/E to 22.5x (vs. 23x)
4. We like the company’s strong structural backbone but expect near-term stock weakness on growth concerns
5. We cut target price to  ₹2,230 from  ₹2,360 earlier."
55,2019-10-11,TCS,"TCS announced dividend of  ₹45 per shareSome brokerages have downgraded their earnings estimate for TCS

The second-quarter earnings of TCS missed analyst expectations on many fronts, pushing its shares down 3% at  ₹1,944 in early trade today. TCS, which announced Q2 results post market hours on Thursday, reported a net profit of  ₹8,042 crore in the three months ended September 30, missing the average analyst estimate of  ₹8,255 crore. battled sluggish spending by financial clients. Operating margins dropped to 24% from 26.5% from a year ago.
TCS said its revenue in its key banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) segment rose only 5.3% to  ₹15,427 crore. TCS heavily relies on banking clients in the West for revenue like its peers in the $180-billion IT services sector.
After four quarters of double digit growth, TCS reported a growth of 8.4% in constant currency. Q2 is typically a seasonally strong quarter for Indian IT companies.
Some brokerages have downgraded their earnings estimate, post its Q2 earnings announcement.
""We downgrade our operational earnings estimate by 2-4%. Growth performance this quarter only dampens the FY20 growth prospects further. EBIT margin contraction of 250bp YoY is a reflection of high pressure on earnings growth,"" Motilal Oswal said in a note. The brokerage has maintained its neutral rating on TCS stock, with a target price of  ₹2,000.
""However, margins are likely to recover to an extent because of normalization of utilization. Demand outlook for the medium term remains healthy considering strong deal wins. We expect USD revenue/EPS CAGR of 7%/7.5% over FY19-21,"" the brokerage added.
TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan in a statement said that the company's Q2 order book was the highest in the last six quarters. TCS announced a dividend of  ₹45 per share, including special dividend of  ₹40 per share.
This is the second successive quarter when the IT major has missed estimates on both revenue and margin.
Harit Shah, research analyst at Reliance Securities, in a note said that ""this is the second successive quarter when the IT major has missed estimates on both revenue and margin.""
""While TCS continues to see healthy orders, conversion to revenue is taking time, partly owing to participation in clients’ digital journeys and rising deal sizes, leading to involvement of more executives in decision making. With the near-term outlook sticky and growth hard to come by, there is a case for a multiple derating, given rich valuations of 21.5x/19.7x FY21E/FY22E EPS,"" he added."

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may remain in focus on Friday:
TCS: The IT major, in its July-September earnings announced on Thursday, reported a constant currency revenue growth of 8.4% year-on-year, missing the Street's estimate of 9-9.5%. This may not bode well for the stock. The company along with IndusInd Bank Ltd kick started the earnings season for the September quarter and is likely to set the mood for the Indian equity market.
Yes Bank: The private lender on Thursday said it has appointed Anita Pai as its chief operating officer and Jasneet Bachal as chief marketing officer. Despite the announcement, shares remained in the red due to worries over the bank’s exposure to stressed sectors, mainly housing finance companies (HFCs) and weak financials.
IndusInd Bank: Shares of the bank slumped more than 6% on Thursday after it announced its earnings for the September quarter. Though the bank saw a 52% year-on-year jump in net profit, a sharp rise in provisions dragged the stock lower. The net profit number also missed analysts’ estimate. The bank’s exposure to a large HFC has been weighing on the investor sentiment.
Lupin: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has pulled up Lupin Ltd for failing to maintain records of batches of manufactured medicines and their sales at the company’s Tarapur plant. The regulator also pointed out that the batch production and control records at the plant do not include complete information relating to production and control of each batch.
Indiabulls Housing: Shares of the company plunged on Thursday, closing down more than 19% as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rejected its proposed merger with Lakshmi Vilas Bank. This has spoiled the non-bank’s plans to get a banking licence amid concerns over tight liquidity and weak asset quality faced by housing finance companies.
Lakshmi Vilas Bank: The stock hit an all-time low on Thursday and was locked in the lower circuit limit of 5% at Rs.25.65 on the BSE as the Reserve Bank did not approve its merger with Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd. In September, the bank was placed under the prompt corrective action list by the RBI for not meeting certain regulatory thresholds.
Infosys: The IT company will report its second quarter earnings today. Experts believe that this earnings season may not do well due to weakness in demand that has led to a slowdown in the economy along with liquidity crisis that has affected the non-banking financial companies, automobile and real estate sectors.
Bharti Airtel: The company on Thursday was the top gainer among the Nifty 50 stocks as investors cheered Reliance Jio’s announcement that it will end free voice calls. The most profitable operator Jio will now charge customers 6 paise per minute for voice calls made to rival phone networks.
SpiceJet: The company on Thursday said no cracks have been found in its fleet of older Boeing 737 NG after the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ordered inspections following a similar move from the US Federal Aviation Administration's to conduct checks for structural cracks on a portion of the 737 fleet operating in the country.
IOB: Indian Overseas Bank said on Thursday it would reduce the interest rates in retail and micro small and medium enterprises by 25 basis points with effect from 1 November. This after the RBI cut the key lending rate by 25 basis points in the October monetary policy meeting."
58,2019-10-11,TCS,"Slump comes after four straight quarters of double-digit growth amid finserv, BFSI volatilityTCS posts revenue of  ₹38,977 cr, a rise of 8.4% y-o-y, and a profit of  ₹8,042 cr, up 1.8% y-o-y

MUMBAI :
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), India’s largest IT services firm by revenue, on Thursday reported single-digit revenue growth in the quarter ended 30 September, after four successive quarters of double digit growth, mainly on account of volatility in the financial services sector.
Revenue growth in constant currency terms was recorded at 8.4% year-on-year. The company posted a revenue of  ₹38,977 crore and a profit of  ₹8,042 crore, up 1.8% year on year (y-o-y).
Both the revenue and profit figures were below analyst estimates. According to Bloomberg estimates, analysts expected TCS to achieve a revenue of  ₹39,435.20 crore and a profit of  ₹8,299.2 crore.
Mint reported on 10 October that while the July-September quarter has historically been the strongest for Indian IT services companies, in this fiscal year, there is unlikely to be any show of strength when companies announce their second quarter results. Indian tech companies have been cautious on tech spending in the banking and financial services vertical because of weakness in capital markets and in European banks.
“Growth was definitely lower than what we originally thought because of volatility in the BFSI and retail sectors,"" said chief executive officer (CEO) Rajesh Gopinathan, at a press conference in Mumbai on Thursday. “However we are still seeing strong deal flow, particularly with opportunities in emerging markets,"" he said.
Revenue growth for the IT services firm was led by Europe and the UK, which grew 16% and 13.3% respectively in the quarter, followed by North America and the Asia Pacific, which grew 5.3% and 6.5% respectively.
“We have been gearing up for growth despite the volatility. Our margins in Q2 reflect our continued investments in our people and in building the capacity we need to fulfil our strong order book,"" said V. Ramakrishnan, chief financial officer, TCS.
From an industry segment perspective, growth in Q2 was led by Life Sciences (16%) and Communications and Media (11.8%). Growth was also driven by digital revenue, which accounted for 33.2% of total of total revenue, growing 27.9% year-on-year.
The CEO said the company hopes to return to double-digit growth next quarter, but the second half of the year generally tends to be weaker for IT firms, given that there are more holidays in that period.
“We remain confident as the medium and longer term demand for our services continues to be very strong, as evidenced by our Q2 order book - the highest in the last six quarters"" said Gopinathan.
Some of the key contracts the company acquired in Q2 included a strategic partnership with General Motors for future global vehicle design and development. TCS also won work from airline operator Lufthansa and Reserve Bank of India in Q2.
TCS said it witnessed a net addition of 14,097 employees in the September quarter, the highest ever number on-boarded in a quarter."
59,2019-10-11,TCS,"TCS reports operating profit of  ₹9,361 crore, almost 6% lower than the Street’s estimatesOperating profit falls year-on-year in Q2, for only the second time in more than 50 quarters

There is a running joke in the financial markets about how earnings beats and misses are reported. “The company missed analysts’ estimates..."" is the phrase that is typically used, whereas, in fact, it is analysts who would have missed earnings with misguided estimates.
As it turns out, there is an unusually large difference between analysts’ estimates of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd’s (TCS) earnings in Q2 and the actual reported earnings. While there is little doubt that analysts missed earnings by a mile, it also appears that the company missed some of its own internal estimates by a great extent.
Using consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg, TCS was expected to report an operating profit of  ₹9,933 crore. Instead, it reported earnings before interest and tax of  ₹9,361 crore, which is almost 6% below the consensus estimate. “Such a large miss on earnings is rare; any variance of over 3% will trouble investors,"" said an analyst at a multinational brokerage firm, who declined to be named. In his books, evidently, the miss was on the part of the company. Either way, it is clear that the TCS stock will fall when trading resumes on Friday.
TCS disappointed both in terms of revenue growth as well as on profit margins. The upshot: operating profit fell by 4.2% year-on-year, which is a rare occurrence in the company’s history. Quarterly data since FY07 shows that operating income has fallen on only two occasions in a period of over 50 quarters.
While revenues were expected to fall to single-digit levels in Q2, after four successive quarters of double-digit growth, hardly anyone, including the company, expected growth to fall to the reported 8.4% levels in constant currency. Q2 is considered to be a seasonally strong quarter, and growth rates typically pick up during this period. While there was continued weakness in the banking and financial services sector, as reported earlier by Accenture Plc., TCS’s revenues were also hit by a large drop in momentum in its retail and consumer packaged goods division. The uncertainty caused by factors such as the trade war and Brexit is impacting tech spending across various verticals.
The worry for investors is that apart from the drop in revenue growth rates, profit margins fell to a nine-quarter low. Typically, margins bounce back in Q2 when compared to Q1, which is when wage hikes and higher visa costs typically depress margins.
The company suggested in its post results commentary that it had positioned itself for higher growth, and that margins fell because growth was lower than expected. Margins are also lower because of higher costs in on-site operations, owing to the need to hire more locals in the US.
The silver lining for TCS shareholders is that cash generation has been robust and the huge dividend payout the company announced is a positive. Besides, since the stock has underperformed in the past month, at least there isn’t the burden of very high expectations."
61,2019-10-11,TCS,"The company is expected to increase its revenue growth guidance for FY2020 on the back of strong large deal momentum and market share gainsInfosys is likely to post strong revenue growth for the quarter ended September as Q2 is a seasonally strong period

Bengaluru: In January 2018, Salil Parekh became the second non-founder CEO and MD of Infosys Ltd after Vishal Sikka who resigned over visible differences with the founders. So far, Parekh has been largely successful in maintaining peace between the management and the founders and keeping Infosys away from media speculations. He has managed, what co-founder Nandan Nilekani said, to make Infosys “boring"" again. But, industry-leading growth rates and high attrition remain serious concerns for the company, more so when its closest competitor Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd, which will declare its results today, has fared better. Can Infosys being cheer investors ahead of Diwali?
Mint highlights five things to watch for in Infosys’ second quarter (Q2) results that will be declared on 11 October.
Guidance for FY20
The company is expected to increase its revenue growth guidance for FY2020 on the back of strong large deal momentum and market share gains, given the visibility in revenue growth. “We expect Infosys to raise its constant currency FY20 revenue guidance from 8.5%-10% growth currently by at least ~50 basis points given reasonable arithmetic and momentum from the recent large deal wins,"" brokerage firm Emkay Global said in an earnings preview note. Prabhudas Liladher expects Infosys to raise its guidance to 9-10% from 8.5-10% it had guided during Q1 for FY2020, led by strong large deal wins in the past which helps provide visibility ahead.
Revenue growth
Infosys is likely to post strong revenue growth for the quarter ended September as Q2 is a seasonally strong period. Most analysts see a constant currency revenue growth in the range of 3.1-3.6% and cross currency headwinds of 58-70 basis points (bps). One bps is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Analysts expect the Stater deal to aid revenue growth. “We expect full quarter consolidation of Stater to add 60 basis points to revenue growth. Revenue growth will be broad-based in our view,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a Q2 preview note. In March this year, Infosys acquired 75% stake in ABN AMRO Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Stater to strengthen its mortgage servicing capabilities through digital platforms.
Performance in key geographies and industry segments
The US market accounts for 60% of Infosys’ total revenue. Clients in the banking and financial services industry, or BFSI, bring 32% of the business. In the previous quarter ended June, growth remained largely flat in both these segments. So, investors will keep a watch on management commentary on the BFSI vertical and the North American business, especially any commentary on the US-China trade war. General commentary on the demand environment and deal win momentum will also be monitored.
Growth in digital business
Infosys’ digital revenue accounted for 35.7% of total revenues during the first quarter ended June, a marginal improvement against 33.8% in the March quarter. Its digital revenue in April-June grew 8.1% sequentially to $1,119 million from $1,035 million in the previous quarter ended March. On a year-on-year basis, it grew 39.3% from $803 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2018. So, investors will closely watch out for growth in digital revenues. Analysts expect margin pressure to remain due to pricing pressure in legacy and investments in digital. Nomura expects Infosys to retain its margin guidance of 21-23% for the full year of FY20.
Attrition rates and retention measures
The attrition rate at Infosys stood at 23.4% in the April-June quarter, up from 20.4% in the previous quarter. This was much higher than competitor TCS’ attrition rate that stood at 11.5% in the June quarter. The management has taken various steps in terms of skilling its workforce and offering skill-based incentives, to address the rising attrition levels. Therefore, the company’s ability to retain talent and contain the attrition numbers will be closely watched."

New Delhi: Eight of the 10 most valued domestic companies together added  ₹80,943.32 crore in market capitalisation last week, with RIL taking the pole position.

49,2019-10-14,TCS,"Infosys’s forecast for the current year suggests a sharp drop in growth rates in the second half of the fiscalShares of Infosys have outperformed those of TCS by about 22% in the past three months

Mumbai: Momentum is on the side of Infosys Ltd. After Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) reported a drop in revenue growth to single-digit levels in the September quarter, Infosys Ltd continued with double-digit growth for the fourth straight quarter.
Infosys’s revenue grew 11.4% in constant currency terms, on the back of strong double-digit growth in nearly all of its business verticals. At TCS, growth in constant currency fell to 8.4% in the September quarter, from 10.6% in the preceding three months.
While Infosys may be better off than TCS, growth is unmistakably slowing down for both of India’s largest IT services companies. After adjusting for the impact of acquisitions, organic growth at Infosys is estimated to be around 9.9%, say analysts. In the June quarter, Infosys’s organic growth was estimated at about 11.8%.
“We had expected weak financial services, and that did play out. However, the slowdown spread to other verticals, viz. retail and parts of manufacturing. Profit margin declined sharply y-o-y, with elevated impact due to aggressive hiring at a time of an unanticipated slowdown,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note on TCS results.
Infosys’s forecast for the current year suggests a sharp drop in growth rates in the second half of the fiscal. It expects to grow by 10% at best this year, despite growing by more than 11.5% in the first half of the year. This implies growth of about 8% in the second half in reported terms, and only about 6.5% on an organic basis.
Of course, Infosys appears to be too conservative with the forecast and growth may end up being higher. An analyst at a multinational brokerage, who requested anonymity, said, “It does look like Infosys is being overly conservative, as the current guidance implies nearly no growth in the remaining two quarters on a sequential basis."" Even so, the fact remains that growth is slowing down.
This isn’t entirely surprising. “Tier-1 IT companies had provided a cautious outlook on BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) spends due to weakness in capital markets and European banks and soft spends in US regional banks undergoing M&A,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a 30 September note to clients. “Tech spends will be volatile in the short term as firms balance short-term priorities with long-term need for investments.""
Even so, the sharp slowdown in growth at TCS has taken both analysts and the company itself by surprise. TCS had hired and invested assuming a certain level of growth, which didn’t come by, and as a result, its profit margins narrowed to a nine-quarter low. In contrast, Infosys’s margins widened 120 basis points from the lows of the June quarter.
TCS also told analysts that visibility for the second half of the year is not very strong. Analysts at Kotak say the verticals facing a slowdown such as BFSI, retail and parts of manufacturing, contribute 56% to TCS’s revenue. The surprise element in its results was the sharp slowdown in business from the retail segment. In Infosys’s case, revenue from this vertical grew just 1%, in stark contrast to double-digit growth in most of the other segments. “Business in the retail vertical is closely linked to consumer sentiment, which has been weak lately owing to uncertainties in the global economy,"" the company said in a press conference.
“Going by TCS’s commentary, there is a slowdown in quite a few areas. While Infosys may have weathered the storm in the first half of the year, it is likely things will catch up in the second half,"" said the analyst from the multinational brokerage.
For now, investors seem to be betting that the momentum in Infosys will continue to reap dividends. In the past three months, shares of Infosys have outperformed those of TCS by about 22%. The September quarter earnings announced by the two companies also will be seen as supporting this shift in investor preference."
48,2019-10-16,TCS,"Wipro reports a steady revenue growth after a sequential decline in Q1 revenuesNet profit was higher than expectations on better operating margins and a drop in tax rates

Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed,"" said the English poet Alexander Pope.
Investors in Wipro Ltd will not only be not disappointed, they will be quite pleased with the company’s September quarter results.
While revenue growth was more or less in line with what analysts expected, at 1.1% sequentially in constant currency terms, profit margins were better than expected.
What’s more, there was a surprise drop in the effective tax rate in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, and the company now expects an effective tax rate of about 20-21% on an annual basis. This is lower than analysts’ estimates of a 22-23% effective tax rate for FY20 and FY21. As a result, earnings estimates are expected to be upgraded by analysts.
Wipro expects its tax rates to drop as a result of the government’s cut in minimum alternate tax rates. This sets it apart from other software services companies who have decided to stay with the previous tax regime, and hence won’t see an increase in earnings estimates as a result of the government’s tax cut.
This comes against the backdrop of a massive underperformance by Wipro shares in the past six months. While the Nifty IT index fell by 5.6% during this period, the company’s shares have slumped by 15.3%. Wipro’s shares were trading at only around 13 times FY21 estimated earnings, far lower than the more than 20 times valuation in the case of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). “Given the rock-bottom expectations from the company, its performance will be cheered by investors,"" says an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm, on condition of anonymity.
Note that Wipro’s revenue had fallen by 0.7% in the June quarter, after which its stock posted losses vis-à-vis peers.
But while the Q2 show looks decent against the backdrop of the weak Q1 performance and generally low expectations, there are still concerns about growth. Year-on-year growth stood at merely 3.8% in Q2. Adjusted for the contribution from acquisitions, the sequential revenue guidance for Q3 is only 0-2%.
Revenue from the banking and financial services vertical fell sequentially, which is a worry for prospects for growth going forward. Besides, the steady operating profit margins in Q2 were aided by some one-off factors that may not repeat going forward.
As such, investors would do well to not extrapolate the earnings in Q2 as a sign of things to come. Wipro’s year-on-year growth rates remain far lower than those of peers, and a large differential in valuations compared to large peers such as TCS and Infosys Ltd looks justified.
But as pointed out earlier, the fact that things improved compared to the June quarter, and considering the surprise bump in earnings owing to the tax change, the valuation gap can be expected to narrow a bit."
47,2019-10-16,TCS,"IT, pharma and energy stocks led markets higherTCS, Wipro, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra led gains in IT pack

Indian markets ended higher today amid volatile trade, extending gains to the fourth day after Wipro boosted investor optimism with earnings that beat all estimates. The Sensex ended 93 points higher to 38,598 as the benchmark index posted its longest winning streak in more than three months. The broader Nifty settled at 11,471, up 0.38%. Shares of Wipro rose 2% after the IT major reported a better-than-expected September-quarter earnings, driven by higher margins. 
Shares of Bajaj Consumer Care surged 20% to  ₹234 after the personal care firm's promoter group, on Tuesday, sold about 22% stake for around  ₹630 crore in a single block deal. 
IT, pharma and energy stocks led gains today. Bajaj Finance advanced 4% while ONGC and Yes Bank rose around 3% each. HDFC Bank, HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra and TCS advanced between 1% and 2%
Sahaj Agarwal, head of derivatives at Kotak Securities, said that Nifty has support at 11050. ""On the higher side we expect the index to conquer 11700 in the near term. Private banking and IT are expected to outperform while selective buying is suggested in midcap stocks,"" he said. 
Ajit Mishra, vice president for research at Religare Broking, said: ""In a volatile trading session, the Indian markets swung both ways before ending the session with decent gains. The earnings season is likely to gain momentum as some of the front liners would be declaring their results in the next few days. We expect that investors and traders would focus more on the management outlook especially for consumption driven companies. Further, market participants would keep a close watch on trade talk developments between US and China, currency and crude oil price movement.""
The global backdrop for Indian markets remained positive. Asian shares  mostly ended higher today as investors looked to whether Britain can secure a deal to avoid a disorderly exit from the European Union.

The September quarter results of HCL Technologies Ltd will reinforce investors’ faith in the stock. The stock has gained 7.6% since its June quarter results even as concerns over acceleration in revenue growth rates undermined shares of its larger peers. While the NSE IT index fell 4%, shares of TCS Ltd and Infosys Ltd have lost 6-16% since HCL announced its April-June earnings in the first week of August. On Thursday, HCL Tech shares gained another 4.5% in early trades.
In the September quarter, revenue in constant currency jumped 20.5% as HCL began integrating acquisition of select IBM products. On a sequential basis, revenue grew 6%. Much of the sequential growth was driven by the integration of IBM products. Even so, a 14% expansion in organic revenue from a year ago is nothing to sneeze at.
More importantly, the upgrade in annual revenue growth guidance underscores the improvement in core business. The company now expects its organic business to grow in double digits at 10-11% against 8-10% estimated earlier.
In constant currency terms, the full-year revenue growth guidance has been raised by one percentage point to 15-17%. Last fiscal, constant currency revenue grew 11.8%. “This revision in guidance comes on the back of acceleration in organic growth momentum in H1, robust deal wins, and order book, even as the company faces renewal pressure in the IMS (infrastructure management services) business,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note.
The revenue guidance upgrade will please investors. Also, the company has been witnessing a good deal-winning momentum.
Deal flows have improved significantly compared with the June quarter. The company signed 15 transformational deals and added a $100 million client in July-September. Overall caution about banking and financial services business vertical notwithstanding, the company has a good deal pipeline in Europe. Four of the seven business verticals clocked double digit revenue growth last quarter.
The newly formed products and platforms (HCL Software) also got to a good start clocking $100 million of revenues. The platform created after integrating IBM products gives access to 20,000 customers across the globe. The management expects the enhanced reach to aid business momentum.
Operating profit margins jumped to multi-quarter high of 20% in July-September. Margins were boosted by lower amortization expenses and full recognition of revenues from IBM products, expenses of which are partly booked in earlier quarters. Margins may moderate as revenue flow from acquisitions normalize. The management expects full-year profit margins in a range of 18.5-19.5%.
The performance will add heft to HCL’s valuations. How well the company will be able to narrow the valuation gap with larger peers depends on its ability to scale up the products business and maintain revenue momentum. “HCL Software (Products unit) ability to successfully convert IBM customers into its own fold over the next few quarters would be the key for further re-rating,"" analysts at Centrum Institutional Research said in a note."

A mixed bag of quarterly earnings performance and hopes of lower taxes raised hopes among investors. Global markets were mostly cautious ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting ending later on Wednesday.
Ajit Mishra, vice president of research at Religare Broking, said, “Indian indices continued their upward trend on the hopes of more tax sops for the equity markets from the government."" He said that in the near term, the market will be driven by corporate earnings and, thus, stock-specific volatility may remain high. “Further, any favourable announcement from the government could help sustain the momentum. On the global front, expectations of an interest rate cut by the US Fed are high and the Fed’s guidance will be keenly watched by investors. In addition, other factors such as oil prices and currency movement may have a bearing on the markets.""
The Fed is expected to cut interest rates by a quarter point on Wednesday for the third consecutive time to provide insurance against global risks, while signalling that the committee has probably done enough for now. Investors are pricing in a 90% likelihood of a cut, though economists surveyed by Bloomberg put the odds at 75%. While policymakers see risks from trade uncertainty and weakness abroad, some view the Fed’s cuts in July and September as sufficient to offset those headwinds, absent more shocks.
Higher interest rates in the US typically lead to foreign money flowing out of emerging markets, considered to be riskier assets, while in the case of lower interest rates in the US, there are inflows to emerging markets.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have bought Indian shares worth $710.72 million in October after aggressively selling them following tax proposals in the Union budget that were later rolled back. The budget had raised the surcharge on the ultra-rich that was also applicable to some FIIs. Year to date, FII investments net of selling in Indian markets are worth $8.87 billion.
Rahul Gupta, head of currency at Emkay Global Financial Services, said: “We expect the Fed to cut rates to 1.5-1.75% for the third consecutive time as the unsettled US-China trade war has started taking a toll on the US economic data. The rupee will continue to trade between 70.70-71.30 until we get more clarity on a US-China trade deal.""
Domestic institutional investors have been net buyers of shares worth  ₹51,590.33 crore so far this year, including  ₹5,380.49 crore bought in October.
The rupee on Wednesday ended at 70.90, down 0.07% from the previous close.

NEW DELHI :
With the United States government becoming tougher on immigration rules under Donald Trump's rule, several Indian IT companies including Infosys and Wipro are having a tough time in sending their employees on H-1B visa to work in the US, according to a latest report.
Even as the denial rate for new H-1B visa applications was as high as 45% for India's IT bellwether Infosys, Google was somehow lucky as only 3% of its petitions were rejected by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), according to National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP).
The data pertains to the first three quarters of FY 2019 (October-June). In the US, the financial calendar runs from October-September.
For American multinationals like Amazon, Microsoft, Intel, Google, Apple and Facebook, the rejection rates varied between 2% to 8%. Employees of Apple and Facebook had the lowest denial rate.
The NFAP report, which provides a detailed break-down of company-wise rejection rates, shows that when it came to Indian IT companies, the rejection rates went up manifold.
In 2015, 4% of all H-1B visa applicants sent by Tech Mahindra Americas were rejected but the figure shot up to 41% this year. For TCS, the denial rate was as high as 34% this year, Wipro 53% and Infosys 45%. In 2015, during the earlier dispensation, the rejection rates varied between 2%-7% for these Indian companies, according to the report.
A change in US policy is also reflected in cases where an existing H-1B visa holder applied for a renewal of his or her work visa. Infosys employees faced the highest rejection rate of 29%, according to the report. For Wipro, the figure stood at 19% and TCS 22%.
If we look at the overall figures, every fourth H1-B visa application got rejected. The US government issues about 85,000 such visas every year out of which an estimated 70% goes to Indians alone. Most H-1B applicants from India are IT professionals."

Four IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro, are in the fray to manage and operate the Business Analytics Project (BAP) of insurance sector regulator Irdai.
Irdai said TCS, Larsen and Toubro InfoTech, Wipro and EIT Service India Private Ltd (a DXC Technology company) have been shortlisted for the next round of bidding.
The four companies had submitted their initial bids in response to an 'expression of interest' floated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) in August.

Irdai said BAP was implemented for automation of registration and other connected activities for insurers, brokers, surveyors and third party administrators, as well as automation of product approvals, branch office opening and advertisements, among others.
In addition to providing the BAP services, the selected company will also be responsible for enhancing the services/functionality of the platform.
While inviting the expression of interest, Irdai had said 'BAP 2.0' will be the next version of the project with additional business and administrative processes designed to provide a significantly enhanced experience to end-users through a major revamp of some of the current interfaces.
The regulator said the BAP system has been designed for effective supervision and regulation including compliance, monitoring trends of the insurance industry, risk based assessment of functioning of insurers, providing early warning signal and initiating corrective action.
As part of BAP, Irdai had introduced the concept of e-filing, doing away with manual filing and paper based records in its departments."

“In the next two to three years, IT spending will increase as the economy benefits from the goods and service tax (GST) implemented by the Indian government in 2018, and as policies supporting consumer spending come into practice,"" said Roy.
Among technologies, automation-enabled areas such as robotic process automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and chatbots are seeing huge uptick, Roy said. “Cloud still remains quite strong, along with data and analytics."""

20,2019-11-25,TCS,"They do not seem to have engaged startups with the same urgency as foreign firms

It is now becoming better accepted that India’s engine of growth for the future will be driven by its entrepreneurial class, and that the “organized sector"", as generally defined, will be less of a contributor to future growth. This is coupled with the fact that the country’s other large employer, our government, has realized that privatization of assets is the way forward, as evidenced by recent news reports of public sector disinvestment of state-owned companies.
Nasscom recently released a report on startups in India. The study indicates that more than 1,300 startups have been set up thus far in 2019 and that their number has been growing at a healthy clip of 12-15% over the past five years. Seven of these startups reached “unicorn"" status this year (a unicorn is a start-up whose private market valuation is greater than $1 billion), and 24 of these companies are already active in India. The report also counts 60,000 new jobs directly added by these startups, with a knock-on effect of twice-to-thrice that number of indirect jobs getting created. In what is good news to a deep tech/science investor like me, the report says that the share of these startups leveraging deep tech has grown by a compounded annual rate of 40% since 2014 to over 1,600.
It is also evident that startup founders who have successfully cashed out of their first forays are now reinvesting at least some of those proceeds in the startup ecosystem. For instance, over 20 startups were founded by former members of Zoho’s team and over 10 startups by the alumni of FreshWorks.
Outside India, large organizations are engaging startups in growing numbers. This willingness to engage with the startup ecosystem is in part due to a general realization among senior management that their companies are not “agile"" and, as a result, not organized efficiently enough to respond timely to fast-paced technological change.
In addition to the slew of quarter-by-quarter investor demands, employees who have been coddled by an internal bureaucracy pose significant resistance to change in existing corporate cultures. While some lip service has been paid to “internal disruption"", the truth is that the lumbering nature of large enterprises makes them ill-equipped to handle innovation. Engaging with startups instead makes more sense for most large organizations, given that while startups tend to explore low-margin, high-risk and small-market propositions at first, such efforts do not support short-term company growth targets. Given time and money, they may well “disrupt"" or shrink the market share of today’s large firms a few years later, though.
There are many ways for established companies to engage startups. The first is through corporate venture funds and accelerators. These need clear objectives and often require a leader from outside the organization. Balancing collaboration with operational independence from the mother entity is crucial. Other popular modes of engagement are for corporations to pitch their problems to startups, asking for solutions, and offer themselves as early customers so as to gain insights into emerging technologies and guide their product evolution processes.
There are two examples from Germany that have been in the news recently: Bayer, with its focused programme to engage digital health startups called Grants4Apps, and BMW’s Start-Up Garage programme, which offers startups an opportunity to gain BMW as an early client.
Interestingly though, India’s corporate houses don’t seem to have responded with the same level of urgency as their foreign counterparts. Nasscom’s report suggests that 90% of the corporate investors who are active in equity funding are global multinational corporations. Further, while there were about 35 acquisitions in 2018 and 2019, it appears that it is mainly Reliance Industries that has increased its acquisitions this year.
Also, some casual research on participation from Nasscom’s original member firms, such as the big five Indian information technology (IT) service providers, throws up interesting findings. These stack up quite differently from the efforts of Big Tech firms.
In addition to Bayer and BMW, Microsoft, Google and Amazon are extremely active in the space. All three of these Big Tech firms actively provide credits to startups to use their colossal cloud computing environments. They also provide financial assistance via investment through corporate venture funding arms, in addition to assistance via joint go-to-market and sales enablement. For a startup focused on a business-to-business (B2B) technology value proposition, a joint go-to-market offer from a firm like Microsoft, which has an almost unassailable market share for its Windows products, can prove irresistible. The Redmond, Washington-based tech behemoth, is willing to provide over $120,000 in credits for the use of its Azure cloud platform for qualified startups to boot.
By contrast, IT services players such as Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys primarily engage startups via financial assistance through corporate venture capital and by granting them access to their client network. They lack the extra cloud operation platforms that are critical to getting startups up and running in the first place. These IT firms may risk getting left behind, given the attractiveness of Big Tech’s value propositions to B2B startups. It might be time for many companies to rethink their engagement of startups, especially in India.

Gains in heavyweights TCS and ITC helped cap losses. TCS shares gained 2% while ITC rose 1.5%. 
Expectations of a rate cut were fueled after India's economic growth slowed to 4.5% in the July-September period, its weakest pace since 2013. The Sensex has risen over 8% since the last rate cut in October, mainly due to measures such as reducing the corporate tax rate and hopes of more stimulus.
Ajit Mishra, VP for research at Religare Broking, said,"" We expect consolidation to extend further in the benchmark thus traders should continue with the stock-specific trading approach.""

15,2019-12-10,TCS,"The TCS is one of the self-policing tools of the GST system to track the extent of suppliesExperts said one needs to analyse the results thrown up by data analysis done by tax officials

New Delhi: The indirect tax administration has detected under-reporting of online sales by several companies when their reported online sales were matched with tax collected at source (TCS) on these transactions furnished by e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart, the Financial Express reported on Tuesday.
The finding implies that the actual under-reporting of sales and the GST (goods and services tax) liability of many companies selling their wares through e-commerce portals may actually be higher considering these players also have off-line sales. An email sent by Mint to the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), the central government’s indirect tax administration, remained unanswered at the time of publishing.
Experts said one needs to analyse the results thrown up by data analysis done by tax officials. “The mismatches shown by data analytics need to be further analysed to see if these are issues related to reconciliation or are instances of sellers actually not reporting it and if so, what are the reasons for it,"" said Abhishek Jain, tax partner at EY.
Companies have the opportunity to make sure that their reported monthly sales are in agreement with the final figures reported in the annual return through reconciliation of accounts. However, if any tax evasion is detected, the authorities will claim interest and penalty. The due date for filing annual returns for FY18, the year of GST rollout, is 31 December.
E-commerce platforms collect a 1% tax at source (TCS) when a consumer pays for a product bought online and deduct the same from the payment to be made to the seller of goods. This amount, paid to the government by the e-commerce platform on behalf of the seller, establishes an electronic trail of transactions and is available as credit for the seller at the time of meeting his final tax liability. The TCS is one of the self-policing tools of the GST system to track the extent of supplies.
After handholding the industry and traders for more than two years of GST rollout, authorities are now scaling up anti-evasion measures by using data analytics and technology. The idea is to use non-intrusive, electronic steps to identify areas of revenue leakage, for enforcement action. GST’s electronic return processing system shows red flags wherever it notices mismatches and enables the authorities to profile taxpayers and identify potential cases of tax evasion."
14,2019-12-12,TCS,"North America contributed 50.6% to the company’s total revenue in the second quarter ended SeptemberAnalysts believe local hiring is part of the shift from Indian companies operating internationally to becoming truly global firms

Bengaluru: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd will complete its target of hiring 1,500 freshers from campuses in the US by March 2020, said a company executive. This is in continuation of its localisation efforts to hire more people in the US, the largest market for TCS.
North America contributed 50.6% to the company’s total revenue in the second quarter ended September.
“Our localisation efforts in the US as well as other geographies have been an integral part of our long-term planning and talent strategy and helps us in being closer to our customers and agile in responding to their needs,"" Milind Lakkad, global head of HR, TCS said in a telephonic interview.
While TCS does not disclose the number of its employees in the US, industry experts estimate the company has about 40,000 people in the US out of its total headcount of 450,738 people.
“The numbers are substantial and it has gone up year-on-year…In last few years, TCS has created more than 20,000 jobs in the US,"" Lakkad said.
Lakkad believes localisation is part of TCS' strategy to “grow roots"" in the communities and markets where it operates. “We believe that assimilating local talent will lead to greater diversity in the talent pool, energising it while creating the capability to react rapidly to business opportunities.""
Apart from rising visa costs and complexities, IT companies are increasingly hiring locally to meet specific client requirements. “The point is, we along with customers figure out where a particular job needs to be done…whether it can be done locally or from any other global location. It is not driven by supply, it is driven by demand and how the execution needs to take place,"" Lakkad said.
Analysts believe local hiring is part of the shift from Indian companies operating internationally to becoming truly global firms. “Local hiring is the only way companies like TCS can add value to the clients as well as contribute to the local economy which is necessary in the long term,"" said Siddharth Pai, IT consultant and venture capitalist.
On the impact of margins due to the higher wages, Pai said, “Over the years, these companies will have to get used to a lower margin regime and focus on clients and growth.""
TCS’ HR initiatives such as the goIT programme have significantly contributed in building local talent in the US especially in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) skills. According to Lakkad, as part of its goIT program, 3,800 TCS employees have mentored more than 25,000 students across the US and Canada, helping them gain in-demand skills for 21st century careers."

9,2019-12-19,TCS,"Any decision by majority investors will now have to be taken in the interest of all stakeholders, say analysts

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI :
An appeals court order reinstating Cyrus Mistry as Tata Sons Ltd chairman may have caused uncertainty about the management of the holding company of Tata group, but market experts say the net impact is likely to be positive for group companies.
Shares of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd and Tata Global Beverages Ltd—the key units of Tata Sons—gained on Thursday on BSE. TCS rose 2.83% to close at  ₹2,229.05, Tata Steel gained 0.45% to close at  ₹446.75, Tata Motors advanced 2.49% to  ₹179.15, Tata Global gained 0.51% to ₹313.95 while Indian Hotels lost 2.20% to  ₹142 per share.
The market sees the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s (NCLAT) order as positive for Tata firms as it amounts to saying that Tata Sons will be a deemed public company. This means there will be greater accountability ensuring that any decision by the majority shareholders will have to be taken in the interest of all stakeholders, including minority shareholders such as the Shapoorji Pallonji group, said lawyers and analysts.
“Once a company is public, all shareholders get more freedom in terms of exercising their rights by virtue of their stakes in the firm. There are better disclosures to all classes of shareholders and the company’s promoters are unlikely to take decisions detrimental to minority shareholders in a public company,"" said a fund manager at a large asset management firm, who declined to be named.
With Tata Sons being the holding company, the order is bound to have a ripple effect on governance of all group companies. The order on Mistry’s chairmanship will however take effect only in four weeks, which is the time granted if the Tata group wants to appeal the decision.
An executive in a Tata group company, who did not want to be named, said Tata Sons is likely to soon move the Supreme Court to get a stay on the judgement to make sure the order does not take effect.
The NCLAT also ruled Mistry can take over as director on three Tata group firms forthwith. These are TCS, Tata Industries and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd.
However, Siddharth Mahajan, partner at Athena Legal, said as directors owe a “fiduciary duty"" towards the company and shareholders, they cannot do anything against their interests and “hence any significant disruption in day-to-day functions is unlikely.""
Also, as per Securities and Exchange Board of India’s listing norms, any change in the board of any listed firm due to any event can be effected only after informing the stock exchanges. So far, no Tata company has informed the exchanges about reinstating Mistry on their boards.
Mahajan, however, said the order “no doubt creates uncertainty for Tata group as many key decisions would have to be kept on hold unless there is clarity on position of chairman""."
10,2019-12-19,TCS,"NCLAT also ordered that Cyrus Mistry be restored as executive chairman of Tata SonsIn a surprise move on 24 October 2016, Mistry was removed as chairman of Tata Sons

Shares of Tata group companies traded mixed on Thursday following an appeals court holding illegal the appointment of N Chandrasekaran as chairman Tata Sons. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Wednesday also ordered that Cyrus Mistry be restored as executive chairman of Tata Sons in lieu of Chandrasekaran although the implementation of this has been suspended for four weeks.
The company has the option to challenge the ruling in the Supreme Court.
While shares of Tata Motors and Tata Consultancy Services rose 1% each today, Tata Metaliks was up 0.7%, Nelco Ltd advanced 0.4%, Voltas, Tata Chemicals and Tata Investment Corp were 0.08-0.2% higher. On the other hand, Tata Steel Ltd fell 0.9%, Rallies India 0.6%, Titan Co Ltd was down 0.5%, Tata Power Co 0.5%, Tata Global Beverages ltd 0.3%, Trent Ltd 0.2%, Tata Elxsi 0.3%, Tata Coffee Ltd 0.3%.
According to a Mint report, with the appellate tribunal ruling in favour of ousted Mistry, the odds have changed dramatically for the diversified conglomerate. This is likely to show in weakened investor confidence and potentially higher cost of capital until there is clarity on the final outcome of the ongoing legal tussle.
The order casts uncertainty over Chandrasekaran’s plans to simplify the group’s structure, revive growth, cut costs and invest in future growth areas.
In a surprise move on 24 October 2016, Mistry was removed as chairman of Tata Sons and later also ousted as a director from the holding company's board."
8,2019-12-20,TCS,"The Tata group is said to be seeking legal clarity on the NCLAT orderThe companies can convene an EGM to consider the NCLAT ruling and shareholders can decide to not reinstate Cyrus Mistry

MUMBAI :
The Tata group is likely to approach the Supreme Court in the first week of January to obtain a stay against the immediate reinstatement of Cyrus Mistry as the director of three Tata group companies from which he was ousted, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The three group companies are Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Tata Industries Ltd and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd. The appeal will also seek a stay on the other directions laid down in the NCLAT order.
The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order of Wednesday mandates restoring Mistry as a director immediately in these three companies. So, while Mistry technically becomes a director of these companies from the moment of the NCLAT order, in reality he will have to wait till the boards of these companies meet during the third or fourth week of January to consider the December quarter earnings.
The Tata group hopes to obtain a stay from the Supreme Court on the NCLAT order before the board meetings.
In the meantime, the Tata group is also seeking legal clarity on whether the NCLAT order can supersede shareholder rights and processes, the two people said, requesting anonymity.
Legal opinion is divided on this. While some experts say that shareholder rights rule supreme, others say that the NCLAT order has only gone into the merits and legality of Mistry’s removal as a director.
The NCLAT has ruled that Mistry’s removal from Tata Sons on 24 October 2016 was illegal and that he should be restored as executive chairman of Tata Sons. The court also held the appointment of N. Chandrasekaran as the new chairman of Tata Sons as illegal. The implementation of this order has been suspended for four weeks to allow Tata group to appeal.
The second part of the judgement directed that Mistry’s directorship in the three Tata group companies should be restored with immediate effect. The order applies to only three companies as Mistry’s directorship was revoked following an extraordinary general meeting and a shareholder ballot. In the rest of the group companies—Tata Motors Ltd, Tata Chemicals Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd and Indian Hotels Ltd—he had stepped down.
According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s listing norms, any change in the board of a publicly traded firm can be effected only after stock exchanges are informed about it. So far, no Tata Group company has told stock exchanges about Mistry’s reinstatement as a director.
A spokesperson for Tata Sons said the company is “evaluating and will take appropriate legal recourse"". An email sent to the spokesperson for TCS, the most valuable company in the Tata group, was not answered immediately.
“Companies Act provides for shareholders to decide on who should be the director and who should not. All these companies had gone through the processes required under the Act. It should be very difficult to implement the order of NCLAT for these group companies to reinstate his directorship,"" said Mohit Saraf, a partner at law firm Luthra and Luthra Associates.
The companies can, however, convene an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to consider the NCLAT ruling, and shareholders can still take a decision of not restoring his directorship.
Pavan Kumar Vijay, founder of Corporate Professionals, a legal and corporate advisory firm, has a similar view. “The decision to revoke his directorship from the board of these three companies was taken in an EGM and ratified by majority of the shareholders; it is unclear how the decision can be reversed now. It will be now up to the apex court to adjudicate whether the NCLAT order prevails or shareholder rights and board processes are supreme.""
However, not all agree. Ramesh Vaidyanathan, a partner at Advaya Legal, argued that Mistry’s removal as a director cannot be looked upon in isolation. “The act of his removal as Tata Sons’ chairman has been viewed as oppressive, so the circumstances which prevailed in his subsequent removal from three companies cannot be ignored. It was a continuous and cumulative action as the NCLAT order was preceded by an act of oppression. Mere compliance with shareholder approval may not be correct,"" said Vaidyanathan.
Corporate lawyer H.P. Ranina said that the NCLAT order is very clear that the four-week pause to restoring Mistry as chairman applies to only Tata Sons and not for other companies. “Supreme Court has to adjudicate no party can take a unilateral call,"" he said.
The second concern that stems from the NCLAT ruling is whether the decisions taken by Chandrasekaran as chairman of Tata Sons since February 2017 also stand invalidated, considering that his appointment has been termed illegal.
However, the Companies Act 2013 provides protection against this. Defects in appointment of directors do not invalidate actions taken. Section 176 of Companies Act says, “No act done by a person as a director shall be deemed to be invalid, notwithstanding that it was subsequently noticed that his appointment was invalid by reason of any defect or disqualification or had terminated by virtue of any provision contained in this Act or in the articles of the company"".
The order also throws up concerns over affirmative rights granted to Tata Trusts in Tata Sons, particularly with respect to section 75 of its Articles of Association (AoA). NCLAT held it to be oppressive. The section gave Tata Sons the power to ask shareholders to sell their holdings by passing a special resolution. The Mistry family firms—Cyrus Investments Pvt. Ltd and Sterling Investments Pvt. Ltd—own 18.4% of ordinary shares in Tata Sons. In case, the Tata Sons board decides to invoke Article 75, the Mistry family will be unable to stymie it because 25% shareholding support is needed to block a special resolution.
“NCLAT has not struck down the section but cautioned against any misuse. So, such power can be exercised only in exceptional circumstances and in the interest of the company, even before that the reasons should be recorded in writing and intimated to the concerned shareholders,"" said Vaidyanathan."

3,2019-12-29,TCS,"Banking, financial services, insurance and retail verticals will drag revenue growthRevenue growth of IT services companies in FY21 will decelerate to about 7.5%, according to ICICI Securities

BENGALURU :
Top Indian software services companies are expected to have a tough year in FY21 amid continued weakness in demand from the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) and retail verticals.
“With continued challenges in the capital markets segment and large banks in US/Europe, and heightened volatility in the retail vertical, we clearly expect revenue growth to decelerate in FY21 to about 7.5% in constant currency terms for our large cap coverage,"" ICICI Securities said in a 15 December note. The BFSI sector has been relatively weak for the past few quarters. Tata Consultancy Services’ (TCS’) BFSI vertical witnessed slow single digit growth at 8% year-on-year for the quarter ended September.
For Infosys, BFSI revenue grew slightly higher at 10.3% year-on-year in constant currency terms, which is “pretty decent"", according to an equity analyst. However, he said that “one should also consider that this includes the impact of the Stater acquisition, which obviously boosts growth."" Infosys, which acquired 75% shareholding in ABN AMRO Bank’s wholly owned Stater NV in May, aims to strengthen its position in the mortgage services value chain.
“The financial services vertical continued its growth momentum aided by the recent Stater acquisition,"" U.B. Pravin Rao, chief operating officer, Infosys, said during the September quarter post-earnings call with investors.
“We expect performance in the vertical to be affected in the next couple of quarters driven by seasonality, sluggishness in capital markets and the European banking space. The recent reduction in interest rates in major geographies can have an impact on client revenues, which may also impact their IT spending,"" he said.
Harit Shah, a former equity analyst with Reliance Securities, corroborated Rao’s views. “BFSI spending is seeing some softness mainly in the capital markets segment. With interest rates at very low levels, the impact of trade wars likely to be felt, slowing gross domestic product growth, and overall macro challenges, it is likely that the BFSI spend will remain soft in the near term,"" Shah said.
Revenue from retail grew in single digits across TCS, Infosys, and Wipro at 4.8%, 1.1%, and 6.1%, respectively year-on-year on a constant currency basis for the September quarter. “Retail segment performance was muted as clients turned cautious because of an increase in perceived risks stemming from trade wars and geopolitical developments,"" Rao said about the Q2 earnings of Infosys.
Analysts believe retail will continue to be a drag in the coming quarters. “The IT companies’ commentaries have been soft on the retail sector because of factors such as the US consumer confidence index going down quarter on quarter. Also, the retail sector is creating pricing pressure for IT services firms, especially for the managed services which includes mandatory services such as application development and maintenance,"" said Anmol Garg, equity research analyst, Motilal Oswal Securities.
The digital business will follow the trend in 2019 and continue to drive growth for IT services companies as clients will invest in emerging technologies despite a flat budget. “The IT budget is expected to remain almost flat globally in 2020 for many organizations (based on a survey conducted in 991 organisations globally),"" said D.D. Mishra, senior director analyst, Gartner. However, he said that “net investment in certain areas such as analytics, data and information strategy, application support, and end user computing, across verticals is expected to increase.""
Banks will continue to invest in new technology as part of their digital transformation initiatives, according to a Deloitte Insights report. North American banks are expected to spend 40% of their total IT budget on new technologies in 2020, while European banks would spend about 29%. This number would increase to 48% and 33%, respectively for American and European banks in 2022."
2,2019-12-30,TCS,"Tata Consultancy Services got nearly 46% of its revenues from BFSI and retail business verticals in the past quarterDeal win momentum remains strong, providing good revenue visibility beyond this fiscal year

For Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) shareholders, 2018 was remarkable—after all, the stock had appreciated as much as 43%. In comparison, 2019 has been slower. But that isn’t much to crib about, considering that the stock has increased by 15%.

Given the premium valuations, investors’ focus is invariably on the growth momentum. On this front, year-on-year constant currency revenue growth has slowed to high single digits in the September quarter to 8.4%. For the June quarter, it was at 10.6%. If the recent interactions of the TCS management with analysts are anything to go by, business environment may remain soft for some more time.
For one, the year-end holiday season in the US and Europe, or the December quarter, usually slows the activity for Indian IT services companies. Add to this the continuing weakness in certain pockets of the banking financial services insurance (BFSI) and retail business verticals, which could mean a subdued Q3FY20.
“Management cited that both BFSI and retail verticals would continue to decelerate in Q3FY20E as well. Management also expects overall growth to be affected by furloughs, lower working days and certain macro issues,"" Sharekhan Ltd said in a note. TCS derived nearly 46% of its revenues from BFSI and retail business verticals last quarter.
What’s more, the softness may percolate down to the next quarter. Customers are delaying or optimizing their spending on the legacy business, especially on some large maintenance contracts, said analysts who met the TCS management.
This means even as the order inflows and pipeline remains strong, revenue momentum can remain soft for the rest of the fiscal year, or at least till the time clients finalize fresh spending budgets for 2020. “In spite of strong total contract value (TCV), conversion of backlog into revenues is happening slower than expected as clients try to optimize their run spends in an uncertain macro,"" analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd said in a note. In the September quarter, TCV, or the order inflows, stood at $6.4 billion, the highest in the past six quarters.
Nonetheless, the company is withstanding the challenges better. Deal win momentum remains strong, providing good revenue visibility beyond this fiscal year.
The life science and healthcare vertical, which grew 16% last quarter, should maintain the momentum. Ramp-up of large deals is expected to aid other business segments (manufacturing and energy). Therefore, any notable improvement in pressured business verticals can easily lift the company’s growth rates. “Management is hopeful of FY21 being better and expects momentum in large verticals like BFSI/retail to improve as pressure on run business recedes,"" Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd research said in a note."
1,2019-12-30,TCS,"Tata Motors, TVS Motor, Ashok Leyland, M&M and Bosch Ltd were among the top gainers in the auto packSome selling pressure in TCS, SBI and ICICI Bank weighed

Indian stock markets ended flat in the penultimate session of the year. The Sensex ended 17 points lower at 41,558 while Nifty settled marginally higher at 12,260. Auto stocks were in the limelight today with the Nifty auto index logging 1.5% gain. Among the auto stocks, Tata Motors rose 4.3%, TVS Motor 3.53%, Ashok Leyland 2.8% while both M&M and Bosch Ltd logged nearly 1.5% gain.
The Nifty Bank index ended flat after hitting a record high of 32,613 during the session. 
Some selling pressure in TCS, SBI and ICICI Bank weighed. TCS fell 0.7%, SBI 0.9% and ICICI Bank 1%.
Broader market continued to show traction. The BSE midcap index today rose 0.29% while the smallcap index advanced 0.75%. 
""Market was range bound, premium valuation and lack of fresh triggers influenced investors to take cautious approach on heavyweights. But reasonable valuation of mid and small caps attracted inflows leading to outperformance in the broad market. We expect this polarized valuation not to sustain, there could be shift of money from the overvalued large caps to midcaps in 2020,"" said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.
Ajit Mishra, VP for research at Religare Broking, said he expects markets to remain range bound this week due to lack of any major domestic as well global triggers. 
""The market participants would keep a close watch on auto sales data. Recently, auto stocks have seen a decent run up in the recent past in anticipation of revival in volume growth. However, December has always been a soft month especially for the passenger vehicles and the two wheeler industry. Apart from this, movement in crude oil and currency would be actively tracked by traders,"" he added. 
Asian shares were mixed today as investors awaited updates on the signing of a trade deal between the US and China and kept a wary eye on North Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has set an end-of-year deadline for the US to make major concessions to salvage a fragile nuclear diplomacy that hit a major setback at a summit meeting with President Donald Trump in Vietnam's capital Hanoi.
A truce in the 17-month U.S.-China trade war and positive signs for the economy have helped keep investors in a buying mood. (With Agency Inputs)"
0,2019-12-30,TCS,"Performance over the past year shows IT companies are withstanding the market changes betterOutperformance of the NSE IT index waned since September, partly because the govt’s tax cuts did not benefit IT firms

The outperformance of the NSE IT index waned in 2019 since September, partly because the government’s tax cuts did not benefit software services companies. But investors are also concerned about the moderation in revenue growth during the year. The NSE IT index had gained 24% in 2018, while the Nifty had risen 4%. So far in 2019, the NSE IT index has risen 9%, whereas the Nifty gained 12%.
The year-on-year constant currency revenue growth of industry leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd dropped to single-digits in the September quarter. Growth at Wipro Ltd remained sluggish. Infosys Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd kept up the momentum during the quarter. But many doubt if the one-off large deals that have powered Indian IT in the past year will be replicated in 2020.
The reasons are partly cyclical. Uncertainty on government spending, taxation and regulation ahead of the US presidential elections in November 2020 can delay decision-making at clients’ end, some fear.
“Besides inherent immigration rhetoric, we find that slow, delayed decision-making by clients in election years (FY09, FY13, FY17) has translated into cyclical growth moderation for the IT services industry,"" BOB Capital Markets Ltd said in a note.
There are structural headwinds as well. Sluggish economic activity and low bond yields in Europe are hurting spends in the key banking and financial services segment. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities warned that if spends of clients facing disruption in their respective industries can take a hit.
“While maturity of digital spends augurs well for medium-term growth delays/decline in spends of challenged clients can create near-term headwinds. Tier 1 IT has provided cautious outlook on near-term growth in spends from the (retail) vertical,"" analysts at Kotak said in a note.
Separately, an analysis of the client financials by Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd shows a steady state at the US banking, financial services, insurance and consumer verticals. But troubles in retail, softness in oil and gas, manufacturing, in Europe means a large part of the IT companies’ target market is facing growth headwinds.
Of course, it is not all gloom and doom. Performance over the past year shows IT companies are withstanding the market challenges better. Digital and new-age services, which are seeing strong client spends, now constitute a large part of the IT companies’ revenues. In the September quarter, more than 38% of Infosys’s revenue came from digital. For TCS, the share stood at 33%.
With deal sizes also increasing, digital has become a key growth driver for Indian IT. However, the rapid expansion of this business has caught companies off-guard on the human resources side. Companies rushing to recruit employees with required skillsets is driving up costs, and hurting profitability. The trajectory of margins is another aspect investors will keenly track in 2020."
