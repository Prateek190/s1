41,2018-01-05,Hindalco,"Hindalco made a non-binding offer  for US aluminum producer Aleris Corp through its US unit, Novelis Inc., and will now conduct due diligence

Mumbai: Hindalco Industries Ltd. is among potential buyers that submitted bids for US aluminum producer Aleris Corp., people with knowledge of the matter said, as Indian billionaire owner Kumar Mangalam Birla moves ahead with plans to expand his overseas operations. 
Mumbai: Hindalco Industries Ltd. is among potential buyers that submitted bids for US aluminum producer Aleris Corp., people with knowledge of the matter said, as Indian billionaire owner Kumar Mangalam Birla moves ahead with plans to expand his overseas operations.
Mumbai-listed Hindalco made a non-binding offer through its US unit, Novelis Inc., and will now conduct due diligence, according to the people. A deal could value Aleris at around $2.5 billion including debt, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
Ohio-based Aleris, which is owned by Oaktree Capital Group LLC and Apollo Global Management LLC, had earlier agreed to sell itself to Zhongwang USA LLC for an enterprise value of $2.3 billion. The transaction, left in limbo after US officials raised national-security concerns about the Chinese-backed bidder, was called off in November after multiple extensions.
Any deal could help buck the decline in overseas acquisitions by Indian companies, which fell to an eight-year low of $4.25 billion in 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Novelis swung to a profit in the quarter ended 30 September and raised its pretax earnings guidance for the financial year, buoyed by a rally in aluminum prices.
Capacity expansion
There’s no certainty Novelis will proceed to make a binding offer for Aleris, and other bidders could emerge, the people said.
A representative for Aditya Birla Group, the parent company of Hindalco, didn’t immediately reply to emailed queries. Spokesmen for Aleris and Oaktree declined to comment, while a spokesman for Apollo said he couldn’t immediately comment.
Novelis President Steve Fisher said in November the company’s strong balance sheet and record free cash flow are giving it the flexibility to evaluate potential growth opportunities. As part of its strategy, the company is “always going to be evaluating the opportunities in the marketplace"" in addition to organic capacity expansion, Fisher told analysts on an earnings call.

40,2018-01-18,Hindalco,"Apart from Vedanta, a Japanese metals company may also join the race for acquiring Aleris

Mumbai: Mining mogul Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Resources Plc. is considering a bid for Aleris Corp., a move that may pit it against Hindalco Industries Ltd’s $2.5 billion bid for the US-based aluminium products maker, two people aware of the development said. 
Mumbai: Mining mogul Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Resources Plc. is considering a bid for Aleris Corp., a move that may pit it against Hindalco Industries Ltd’s $2.5 billion bid for the US-based aluminium products maker, two people aware of the development said.
Apart from Vedanta, a Japanese metals company may also join the contest for Aleris, a third person familiar with the development said on condition of anonymity. The name of the Japanese company could not immediately be ascertained. 
“While there is no certainty that Vedanta will eventually make a bid for Aleris, competitive bidding, if it happens, can make the deal expensive for the acquirer,"" said one of the two people cited in the first instance, requesting anonymity.
Requests for comment sent to Vedanta group remained unanswered until press time on Wednesday. A spokesperson for the Aditya Birla Group, of which Hindalco Industries is a part, said that “in line with our policy we do not comment on market stories"". A spokesperson for Aleris said the company did not comment or speculate on rumours.
Vedanta Resources has mines across the world and oil and gas operations in three countries. Its main products are copper, zinc, aluminium, lead, iron ore and petroleum. 
Vedanta group, which has raised close to $2 billion in the past one year, has been on an acquisitive mode in India as well and has shown interest in at least two distressed steel companies. 
Mint reported in December that Vedanta group was among the potential suitors for debt-laden Essar Steel Ltd, which is currently under corporate insolvency proceedings.
Apart from Essar Steel, Vedanta has also made a bid to acquire Electrosteel Steels Ltd, which is also under corporate insolvency proceedings, the people cited above said.
Mint reported in September that the Aditya Birla Group was among potential bidders for the Cleveland, Ohio-based Aleris for which the group was looking to assign a $2.5 billion enterprise value.
The offer is expected to include an investment of close to $1 billion through equity and debt, and refinancing of the company’s debt of around $1.5 billion, Mint reported, citing people aware of the matter. 
Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Hindalco Industries had made a non-binding offer for Aleris through its US unit Novelis Inc. 
“The transaction is likely to be driven from the US by Novelis, which will raise bulk of the acquisition funding whereas its parent Hindalco will only fund a smaller chunk if the acquisition goes through,"" said the second person cited above, also requesting anonymity.
Aleris’s private equity owners Oaktree Capital Group LLC and Apollo Global Management LLC had earlier agreed to sell the company to Zhongwang USA LLC for an enterprise value of $2.3 billion.
The transaction was called off in November after US officials raised national-security concerns about the Chinese-backed bidder, Bloomberg reported in January."

Mumbai:  Aluminium major Hindalco Industries Ltd on Wednesday reported a 24.98% drop in its standalone quarterly profit during the recently concluded March quarter to Rs376.97 crore. 
Mumbai:  Aluminium major Hindalco Industries Ltd on Wednesday reported a 24.98% drop in its standalone quarterly profit during the recently concluded March quarter to Rs376.97 crore.
The leading aluminium and copper producer had clocked a standalone profit of Rs502.52 crore during the last quarter of 2016-17.
The company’s total standalone income dipped marginally to Rs11,886.02 crore in the January-March quarter of 2017-18 fiscal, compared to Rs11,969.66 crore in the same period in 2016-17, it said in a regulatory filing.
Its total expenses in the March quarter was almost stagnant at Rs11,329.68 crore.
On a consolidated basis, the company reported a profit of Rs6,082.87 crore during FY18, as compared to Rs1,882.30 crore reported by the company during the previous year.
The company reported a consolidated yearly revenue of Rs116,913.16 crore during FY18 up from Rs103,742.45 crore the previous year.
The costs during Q4 hit the peak and were about 6% more than Q3 costs, said Hindalco’s managing director Satish Pai.
“With the costs flatting out in April-May, we could see a fall through in aluminium prices,"" Pai said, adding that the company has secured 60% of its alumina and coal requirements for the year and expects input costs to further go down as the year progresses.
Hindalco, which has earmarked its capex at Rs1,600 crore for FY18, will expand its downstream operations.
“It will take me four-five years to double the existing downstream capacity for which we are making investments,"" Pai said, adding that the company is expected to add at least 12% more value added products like foil and rolled products to its portfolio in the coming years.
The company, which produces about 450 million tonnes of value-added products and wire rods, plans to increase this figure to more than a million tonnes over the next five years.
Pai said that both Hindalco and Novelis are looking at their next phase of growth, which is largely likely to be organic.
“We will certainly look at inorganic opportunities if they come up,"" Pai added.
Pai said that India needs to be wary of dumping of Chinese and Russian metals that are looking at markets to dump their products after getting various concessions from their respective governments thus making their prices very competitive or cheaper than products manufactured by local units.
“We have made a representation to the government and have got a favourable response from them,"" Pai said."
35,2018-05-17,Hindalco,"While things are looking up the raw material front, Hindalco faces uncertainty is market conditionsespecially in light of US tariffs on aluminium imports and the prospect of a US-China trade war

Analysts were expecting Hindalco Industries Ltd to post a subdued performance for the March quarter, tracking the rise in its raw material costs. But as it turns out, the headwinds were stronger than expected. Operating profit (Ebitda) at the standalone level increased just 1% in the March quarter. The performance is weighed down by high costs at the aluminium business. 
Analysts were expecting Hindalco Industries Ltd to post a subdued performance for the March quarter, tracking the rise in its raw material costs. But as it turns out, the headwinds were stronger than expected. Operating profit (Ebitda) at the standalone level increased just 1% in the March quarter. The performance is weighed down by high costs at the aluminium business.
The copper business also lagged due to a plant shutdown and low DAP (diammonium phosphate) production. Also, the benchmark treatment and refinery charges in the copper industry moderated. As a consequence, operating profit at the copper division fell from both the previous quarter and the year- ago period (see chart).
The good news is the management expects cost pressures to ease or remain flat in the coming quarters. Domestic coal prices are more or less stable and Hindalco is said to have tied up raw material supplies. A closed plant is expected to come back on stream in the current quarter. And with the new continuous cast rod plant commissioned, it is expected to help improve business mix for the copper business in the coming quarters.
But where the company faces uncertainty is market conditions—especially on the demand and pricing fronts. Beginning 2018, aluminium prices have turned volatile. While domestic demand is strong, there remains oversupply. With the US imposing tariffs on imports and countries like China retaliating with counter-tariffs, the fear is that a trade war can worsen the demand-supply balance. “The worry is that a certain amount of dumping can take place in India,"" the management told analysts. 
Of course, the situation is still evolving and the industry is said to be in talks with the government for protective measures. But if it turns for the worse, then it can upset Hindalco’s financials.
With the company’s US-based subsidiary Novelis Inc. on the growth path, analysts were hoping a steady performance at the stand-alone level will place Hindalco in a sweet spot.
Novelis is seeing strong profitability thanks to better operating leverage and improving demand. “Strong demand outlook in US and revival in demand in Europe/South America/Asia, aided by quality operations and sound balance sheet sets robust outlook for Novelis. Underpinned by firm outlook on Novelis and stable India operations (benefitting from high aluminium prices and integrated business model), Hindalco would continue to post stable earnings growth,"" Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd said in a note last week after Novelis’s March quarter results.
The Q4 results and commentary does not provide any concrete reasons to alter this scenario. But a 22% gain in the share price over the past one year and notable contribution from domestic business (generates roughly half of Ebitda) means favourable local market conditions remain crucial for this scenario to play out."
34,2018-07-26,Hindalco,"Post the Aleris acquisition, Hindalco-Novelis will become the world's largest aluminium downstream player with a combined capacity of 4.7 million tonnes

Mumbai: Billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Hindalco Industries Ltd has agreed to buy US aluminium sheet maker Aleris Corp. at an enterprise value of $2.58 billion to create the world’s second-largest aluminium maker.  
Mumbai: Billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Hindalco Industries Ltd has agreed to buy US aluminium sheet maker Aleris Corp. at an enterprise value of $2.58 billion to create the world’s second-largest aluminium maker. 
The acquisition will help Hindalco expand sales in the lucrative automotive and aerospace segments, and is the Indian aluminium maker’s second major overseas acquisition after the purchase of Novelis for $6 billion in 2007. On completion of the purchase of Ohio-based Aleris, Hindalco’s consolidated revenue will rise to about $21 billion.
“The acquisition of Aleris is a great strategic move by Hindalco-Novelis,"" said Anjani K. Agrawal, partner and global steel leader, EY. “The timing seems opportune as capital investments by Aleris within the US will be leveraged in a more favourable trade policy environment.""
Agrawal was referring to the Trump administration’s decision to impose a blanket 10% tariff on aluminium imports. 
Hindalco agreed to pay $775 million in cash for Aleris and absorb debt of $1.8 billion. The purchase will be fully debt-funded.
“The acquisition of Aleris is the next phase of our aluminium value added products growth strategy. This will solidify our position as the world’s No.1 aluminium value-added products player,"" Birla, chairman of Hindalco, said on Thursday. “Post this acquisition, we are well placed to serve our customers across geographies in automotive and now the high-end aerospace segments.""
Aleris has long-term supply contracts with plane makers Boeing, Airbus and Bombardier. The acquisition will also give Hindalco access to the aluminium supply market for the building and construction segments.
Mint first reported about Hindalco’s interest in Aleris in September.
The acquisition adds debt of around $2.6 billion to Hindalco’s book, taking its total debt to around $6 billion. However, the company expects to halve debt to about $3 billion in the next two years as investments in Aleris start to generate returns.
In the past five years, Birla has realigned his businesses to reduce debt, unlock value and improve returns to investors. Birla’s UltraTech Cement Ltd has moved aggressively to acquire local cement makers anticipating a demand pick-up led by the government’s thrust on infrastructure development. While the merger of group companies AB Nuvo and Grasim and demerger of Aditya Birla Finance was aimed at unlocking value for investors, the move to merge the group’s telecom unit, Idea Cellular Ltd, with Vodafone India Ltd is aimed at taking on Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. On Thursday, the Vodafone-Idea merger got the final approval from the government. 
The company said the acquisition of Aleris will be through Hindalco’s US subsidiary Novelis. 
There is also an earn-out clause, which rewards both parties for performance beyond the base business plan during CY2018-20 for North America. Any excess revenue during this period will be split evenly between Novelis and Aleris, with the cap set at $50 million.
The deal is expected to close in 9-15 months, subject to regulatory approvals in the US, European Union and Asia.
Since last summer, Birla has been scouting for acquisition targets to shore up overseas sales of value-added products. US-based Aleris and Constellium, a Dutch maker of aluminium products, were reportedly on the radar. The owners of Aleris—Oaktree Capital Group and Apollo Global Management—were on the verge of selling the company to Zhongwang, China’s largest aluminium maker but the deal collapsed at the last minute because of national security concerns raised by American authorities."
33,2018-07-27,Hindalco,"The consideration of $2.58 billion to buy Aleris is what would worry investors most, as Hindalco's net debt is likely to increase by about 40%

How should investors view the gigantic investment made by Hindalco Industries Ltd to acquire Aleris Corp., through its subsidiary Novelis Inc.? 
How should investors view the gigantic investment made by Hindalco Industries Ltd to acquire Aleris Corp., through its subsidiary Novelis Inc.?
Nervousness is already visible in Hindalco’s share price, which has fallen by 6% since news emerged that the deal was close to being concluded. The consideration of $2.58 billion to buy Aleris is what would worry investors most, as Hindalco’s net debt is likely to increase by about 40%.
While that is significant, the deal also values Aleris at an enterprise value (EV)/Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of 12.8 times. That’s high when you consider that Hindalco itself trades at a valuation of 5.7 times. Then there is also the question of Aleris’s relative underperformance. It earned an adjusted Ebitda of $250/tonne in calendar 2017 compared to Novelis’s $381/tonne in FY18. 
While the gap is significant, bridging it is where Hindalco sees the opportunity, and possibly explains the valuation as well. For instance, the company expects that when it will complete the acquisition, the $202 million Ebitda figure will actually increase to $360 million. If achieved, the deal’s EV/Ebitda reduces to a more reasonable 7.2 times.
Why will the Ebitda increase that much? There were some outages in Aleris’s current operations which affected profits. This will get added back. Then, new capacity is expected to ramp up and also contribute. After all, the consideration factors new investments made by Aleris of about $900 million. The combined entity also expects to earn $150 million in savings across its global operations in three-five years.
In the aluminium rolled products business, capacity addition is a continuous process tied to your customers’ plans. For instance, as an automobile company charts out its expansion, suppliers such as Novelis and Aleris also invest accordingly. That’s the only way to grow. Novelis had also planned its own investments for growth.
Why acquire Aleris then? Size is one. Aleris adds one million tonnes of processing capacity to Novelis’s, increasing its capacity by a third. It brings new segments into Novelis’s fold, especially in a critical industry such as aerospace, but also in others such as building and construction, and trailer truck segments. The acquisition saves the time Novelis would have taken to create a presence in these segments by itself and then build scale. Also, since Aleris was in play to be acquired, Hindalco also protects its own market position to an extent by this acquisition.
The one difference between Hindalco in 2007 when it acquired Novelis and now is that it has hands-on experience in this field in those markets. While the years since that acquisition have been challenging, particularly due to the global financial crisis, it has turned around Novelis. In FY18, Novelis’s Ebitda was $1.2 billion compared to $867 million five years ago, and it generated free cash flow of $406 million, compared to a negative $16 million a year ago.
That should give investors the confidence that Hindalco can integrate Aleris well, and achieve the Ebitda target and projected cost savings. The main risk it faces is on the external front. The rolled products business is relatively insulated from the trade wars, since metal price is a pass-through (albeit with a lag).
But some global auto giants have already warned that their earnings may be affected by the tariffs. Other user industries of aluminium products may follow suit. If these industries cut back on output as a result of a less-rosy outlook, that can affect suppliers such as Novelis and Aleris.
This was a risk that Novelis faced even without Aleris. But it was well-placed to weather such shocks because its performance had improved significantly over the years. Now, it will become a little more vulnerable to such severe external shocks, at least till the time it brings Aleris’s performance on a par with itself. That’s what may worry Hindalco’s shareholders in the near term."
32,2018-07-30,Hindalco,"The Aleris acquisition by Hindalco's Novelis was sealed only after Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla stepped in to address contentious issues

Mumbai: Till March this year, there was no way that Aditya Birla Group was getting to acquire Aleris Corp.—an ambition it first harboured in August 2017 when symptoms of a potential failure started to crop up between an earlier agreed upon merger between China’s Zhongwang USA LLC and the Cleveland-based American company. 
Mumbai: Till March this year, there was no way that Aditya Birla Group was getting to acquire Aleris Corp.—an ambition it first harboured in August 2017 when symptoms of a potential failure started to crop up between an earlier agreed upon merger between China’s Zhongwang USA LLC and the Cleveland-based American company.
Zhongwang was to buy Aleris for $2.33 billion. 
The US Department of Justice was closing in on Liu Zhongtian, majority owner of Zhongwang USA, whose affiliate Perfectus Aluminium Inc. was accused of evading $1.5 billion in tariffs by illegally importing aluminium into the US. This development happened even as president Donald Trump was readying ground for a trade war with China and sought ways to turn its economy inwards. Several Chinese takeovers of US companies faced heightened scrutiny by the Trump administration.
In September, the administration blocked a Beijing-backed fund’s attempt to buy an American chip maker, Lattice Semiconductor Corp. In July, Chinese conglomerate HNA Group Co.’s planned $416-million purchase of a Los Angeles in-flight entertainment company, Global Eagle Entertainment Inc., collapsed because the companies didn’t get approval from the country’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS). The same CFIUS refused approval to Zhongwang USA after 27 US senators urged the Treasury to reject the sale, calling it a “strategic misstep"".
In November, Aleris and Zhongwang called off the deal, paving the way for the 51-year-old Kumar Mangalam Birla to acquire the company for $2.58 billion, making Hindalco the world’s second-largest aluminium company and the world’s largest aluminium company outside of China.
“There was a period when talks had almost come to a standstill in Aleris and bankers were told that the acquisition in all likelihood may not happen,"" a person aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.
Reason: A hike in valuation being sought by Aleris, apart from clarity on regulatory and people-related issues.
In fact, this was the second time the Group was pulling out from the race. Aditya Birla Group had first evaluated the transaction in 2008 when it was deciding to bid for Novelis for $6 billion 10 years ago. In 2009, Aleris filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and was acquired by private equity funds Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management, and Sankaty Advisors in the following year.
“K.M. Birla himself stepped in to address some contentious issues...,"" the person cited above added. In an interview on Thursday, Birla confirmed that he had to intervene at some point. “I think it was required and expected. Our acquisitions are about value-creation,"" Birla said.
Zhongwang was to buy Aleris for $2.33 billion. So, why did Birla pay a premium—as many believe? Because, Aleris has made investments of $900 million, which are yet to reflect in its earnings. In two years, once these investments start to yield returns, the total debt of Hindalco, which will almost double to $6 billion after this acquisitions will come down to $3 billion—significantly lower than its current debt of $3.5 billion.
That aside, “Most others were only interested in the US’s Lewisport asset while we were also interested in getting into aerospace and China, which is going to be our biggest synergy,"" said Steve Fisher, chief executive of Novelis Inc.
Nevertheless, the deal bore the hallmark of a long tradition of group founders stepping in to steer negotiations whenever potential acquisitions appeared to collapse, whether due to differences on valuation or other issues. Another example of Birla stamping his authority on such crucial issues is one of the most complex mergers between Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd, where he proposed to Vodafone India to merge with Idea Cellular—a deal for which Vodafone Group Plc readily agreed even as it virtually meant that Vodafone will exit the telecom company business and reap dividend as a shareholder while Birla will continue to run the show in a battle for supremacy against Sunil Mittal-controlled Bharti Airtel Ltd and Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
“Mr. Birla understands the sensitivities involved at late-stage negotiation of such cross-cultural transactions and the significant difference it makes when promoters are involved themselves at such stage,"" said Bharat Banka, a former head of Group Finance at Aditya Birla Group, who now runs a niche business and management consulting practice. “It cuts down negotiation time significantly and it gives a different level of comfort to the seller(s) reassuring them of the seriousness and intent commitment of the buyer,"" he added.
Birla is playing a similar role with the acquisition of Dalmia Cement now. About Aleris, Aditya Birla Group had sounded off bankers as early as August last year about the potential deal.
“What worked to the advantage of Aditya Birla Group is that apart from China’s Zhongwang, there were no bidders for the whole company,"" said the person cited above. “Aleris operates close to 40 small and large plants spread across North America, Europe and Asia. Potential bidders included Japan’s Kobe Steel and India’s Vedanta group, but none of them it seems wanted all the facilities"", said the first person cited in the story.
“I am not aware of who the other bidders were but we were given to understand that much of the interest was centred around the Lewisport plant only, which is the company’s largest facility in North America,"" said Satish Pai, managing director of Hindalco.
Pai in a January interview said that Novelis will now focus on organic growth by investing $300 million to build an automotive aluminium sheet manufacturing facility in Guthrie, Kentucky.
The timing of the Hindalco-Aleris deal too was crucial for Aditya Birla Group. After almost a decade-long lull commodity prices had begun recovering, thereby freeing up cash flows of both Novelis and Hindalco. “For the private equity owners of Aleris, this coincided with the timing of their exit from the asset,"" said another person aware of the matter.
Birla understood this and pushed for the Hindalco-Aleris deal aggressively.
At the promoter level too, the timing seems to have worked well. Unlike the Novelis acquisition where promoters had to infuse close to $350 million in equity, Aleris will be 100% debt funded with most of Aleris existing debt to be refinanced.
Also read: A confident Hindalco pays top dollar for Aleris acquisition
“The entire debt should take care take of itself from the cumulative cash flows of Aleris and Novelis and I am of the view that some potential some downward corrections in the commodity prices owing to collateral damage from global trade war will not impact the margins in a major way, especially in the context of much larger size of cash-flows and balance sheet"" said Banka. 
“Almost all of the large entire capex cycle for of Hindalco and Aleris seems to be completed and overall EBITDA will only improve from here on, which should give the Birla Group all the firepower he may need to fund future expansion without equity dilution,"" he added."
31,2018-08-10,Hindalco,"Revenues at Hindalco's US subsidiary Novelis grew 16% to $3.1 billion

Mumbai: Aditya Birla Group’s metals flagship Hindalco Industries Ltd clocked a 43% rise in standalone quarterly net profit to Rs413.53 crore, thanks to better realisations in its aluminium and copper businesses and improved operating efficiencies. 
Mumbai: Aditya Birla Group’s metals flagship Hindalco Industries Ltd clocked a 43% rise in standalone quarterly net profit to Rs413.53 crore, thanks to better realisations in its aluminium and copper businesses and improved operating efficiencies.
Revenue growth however remained flat at Rs10,698.68 crore in the three months ended June 30.
For the entirety of its India business, which includes the operations of wholly-owned refinery subsidiary Utkal Alumina, the company doubled its net profit to Rs734 crore from Rs364 crore a year earlier. India revenue stood at Rs10,670 crore while quarterly EBITDA rose 17% on-year to a record Rs1,951 crore.
“Operational efficiency, cost controls and taking advantage of good LME prices have led to our good performance,"" Satish Pai, Hindalco’s managing director, said in an interview on Friday. “We’re seeing strong demand from electrical, building and construction, auto and the packaging industries,"" he said. 
Pai raised concerns about surge in low-cost imports of fake semis and wire rods from China and ASEAN nations, hitting demand for domestic primary metal. 
The company achieved aluminium metal production of 323 KT in the June quarter. Alumina (including Utkal Alumina) output was marginally lower at 695 KT compared with 724 KT a year earlier.
Revenue from the copper business fell to Rs5,006 crore last quarter, from Rs5,403 a year earlier. This was because of lower volumes following a planned maintenance shutdown at one of the smelters during the quarter.
Revenue at Hindalco’s wholly-owned US subsidiary Novelis grew 16% to $3.1 billion on higher average aluminium prices, higher shipments and better product mix. The key growth stimulants were higher automotive sheet shipments, operating efficiencies, with higher recycled contents and better cost management, the company said. 
Novelis’ net income surged 36% to $137 million in the June quarter, from $101 million a year earlier.
The company informed investors that work on the New Copper Continuous Cast Rod Plant (CCR-3) ramp up, Utkal Alumina’s brownfield capacity expansion of 500 Kt and Novelis’ plans of 200 KT expansion of automotive finishing facility in Kentucky, US, and 100 KT in Changzhou, China, are on schedule.
In July, Novelis signed a definitive pact to buy US-based Aleris Corp for an enterprise value of $2.58 billion. The deal will boost Novelis’ position in the auto segment and mark its entry into the high-end aerospace segment, the company said."
30,2018-08-13,Hindalco,"Hindalco's US Novelis, which recently acquired Aleris Corp., seems to be on a steady footing, but the concern is if the trade wars will affect volumes or profitability

While Novelis Inc. was always an important part of Hindalco Industries Ltd’s consolidated financials, its relevance is set to increase. Firstly, Novelis is making significant investments in its operations, both to add to capacity and increase value addition. Its management said capital expenditure in FY19 is pegged at $450 million, or  ₹  3,105 crore. Then, the acquisition of Aleris Corp. itself will cost $2.58 billion.

Its management said capital expenditure in FY19 is pegged at $450 million, or  ₹  3,105 crore. Then, the acquisition of Aleris Corp. itself will cost $2.58 billion.
In India, Hindalco is reaping the benefits of its investments in previous years, with no major capex plans lined up.
There is a 500 kilotonne expansion at its Utkal alumina facility while a new, continuous cast rod plant is lined for a ramp-up. As Novelis’s expansion and acquisition result in higher volumes, its importance in the consolidated mix will step up even further.
Consider the June quarter (Q1) results. Hindalco’s India business—including Utkal alumina—saw its Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) increase by 17.5% to  ₹  1,951crore and by 8% sequentially. In the same period, Novelis saw its adjusted Ebitda increase by 14.9% to $332 million, or  ₹  2,291 crore. As Novelis’s output increases over the next few years, and Aleris is combined, its Ebitda will go far ahead of the India business.
Novelis said trade-related fears and market disruption due to sanctions have not affected its business. This quarter, Ebitda rose despite output getting affected due to downtime at one of its customer sites and a truckers’ strike in Brazil that disrupted its supply chain. As the situation normalizes, it expects full-year output to normalize.
India remains a key part of the business as is visible in the current quarter as well. The aluminium business is the one driving performance, as the US sanctions on United Company Rusal Plc roiled the market. Aluminium and alumina prices have both risen as a result, adding to profitability, despite relatively flat output as it is operating at full capacity. Another tailwind for the Indian business was the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar.
However, the copper business Ebitda has been relatively flat. A maintenance shutdown at one smelter resulted in lower output, but this should recover. Also, the share of continuous cast rods will increase, as utilization ramps up. This should see profit benefit from higher and value-added output. But treatment and refining charges continue to trend lower, which is a dampener.
Its standalone results also showed a stable situation on the power and fuel costs. Reported net profit rose by 43% to  ₹  414 crore over a year ago, and by 9.8% sequentially. Since it sources alumina from its own subsidiary, this purchase cost affects standalone margins. The combined (Hindalco+Utkal) results show that profit doubled to  ₹  734 crore over a year ago and by 19% sequentially.
The risks to Hindalco’s domestic business are primarily from volatility in aluminium prices, which are going up if the US is seen as hardening its stand on tariffs and sanctions and vice-versa. How alumina and aluminium prices behave is a key factor. Novelis seems to be on a steady footing but the main concern there should be if trade wars in some way affect either profitability or volumes.
Hindalco’s shares fell on Friday when it declared its results. It’s perhaps time the company switched to giving quarterly consolidated results. That will give investors a comprehensive picture, instead of stitching together a picture of its domestic aluminium, domestic alumina and overseas flat rolled products business (Novelis) as at present."

Mumbai: Aditya Birla Group flagship Hindalco Industries will seek shareholders’ approval for the issue of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) on private placement basis for aggregating  ₹ 6,000 crore at its forthcoming annual general meeting (AGM) next week.
The company seeks shareholders’ approval for raising around  ₹ 6,000 crore through NCDs on private placement basis in order to augment resources for the ongoing capital expenditure, repayment of existing loans, and for general corporate purposes, according to the company’s annual report.
“To further bolster the balance sheet, the company has prepaid close to  ₹ 8,000 crore of long-term project loans in India. This has led to a significant improvement in the consolidated net debt to EBITDA at below 3x at the end of March 2018,"" Hindalco chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said in shareholders’ note.
The current net debt stands at  ₹ 15,000 crore. Birla pointed out that the ongoing government initiatives such as the creation of 100+ smart cities, thrust on infrastructure, especially rural infra development, along with ‘Make in India’ and ‘Digital India’ will continue to support the demand for aluminium and copper. 
He noted that although India’s GDP growth slowed from 7.1% in FY17 to 6.7% in FY18, the economy recorded a seven-quarter-high GDP growth of 7.7% in the exit quarter of FY18.
“This reflects momentum. Investors seem to be positive on India’s economic prospects. The foreign direct investment (FDI) flows continue to be encouraging,"" he said.
The prevailing sense of optimism accentuates India’s continuing economic growth in the future as well. It is attributable to the country’s solid fundamentals, such as deleveraging by corporates, resulting in much stronger balance sheets, better capacity utilisation with consumption demand becoming stronger and insolvency and bankruptcy process weeding out non-performing assets, among others.
Birla, however, warned that the near-term challenges, including concerns like rising oil prices, hardening inflation, firming bond yields and widening current account deficit, cannot be ignored. He also pointed out the ongoing global trade frictions, particularly between the US and China, are worrisome and can have a spillover negative effect on countries like India.
“The terrain ahead could be a tad bumpy depending on the economic and geopolitical environment,"" Birla added."
28,2018-10-09,Hindalco,"Aluminium makers including Hindalco and Vedanta are boosting sales to Japan as U.S. sanctions against Russia's Rusal and import tariffs shake up traditional supply routes

Tokyo/New Delhi: Indian aluminium makers including Hindalco Industries and Vedanta Ltd are boosting sales to Japan as U.S. sanctions against Russia’s Rusal and import tariffs shake up traditional supply routes. India’s product has generally not been regarded as high enough quality by Japan’s demanding buyers, who have preferred top-tier producers like Rio Tinto , Alcoa and South32 as well as United Company Rusal. However, imports of aluminium ingot from India doubled in the first eight months of 2018 from a year ago, Japanese trade data shows, while imports of alloy - which include higher-value products - surged 11-fold off a tiny base. 
Tokyo/New Delhi: Indian aluminium makers including Hindalco Industries and Vedanta Ltd are boosting sales to Japan as U.S. sanctions against Russia’s Rusal and import tariffs shake up traditional supply routes. India’s product has generally not been regarded as high enough quality by Japan’s demanding buyers, who have preferred top-tier producers like Rio Tinto , Alcoa and South32 as well as United Company Rusal. However, imports of aluminium ingot from India doubled in the first eight months of 2018 from a year ago, Japanese trade data shows, while imports of alloy - which include higher-value products - surged 11-fold off a tiny base.
“Because of the sanctions, consumers would like to ensure some security of supply, so they’d like to prefer multiple suppliers instead of one supplier,"" Samir Cairae, chief executive of Vedanta’s diversified metals business in India, told Reuters.
The increased trade is a blow to Rusal, the world’s second-biggest aluminium maker, which accounted for about 20 percent of Japan’s imports of both aluminium ingot and alloy in 2017, but which has been hit by U.S. sanctions.
Customers globally have had to scramble to find alternative sources of metal even after the United States eased sanctions restrictions for some customers, and they were likely to permanently diversify supply chains, said a source at a Japanese trading house.
“Many of their customers are reluctant to order the same amount of supplies that they have bought in past years for next year even if the U.S. sanctions are lifted,"" the trader said.
Japanese trading houses such as Mitsubishi Corp have been aggressively importing supplies from India as well as other countries to help customers diversify supply, trading sources said. Mitsubishi declined to comment.
Products from India are mainly refined ingots rather than value-added products such as billets and slabs, said a second trading house source. Substitute material for Rusal’s higher quality products has come from the Middle East and Malaysia.
However, Indian metal was winning growing acceptance and was also being sold at a discount to traditional suppliers.
“Japanese buyers are getting Indian metal for cheap,"" the source said.
IMPORTS SWELL
Japan took 59,545 tonnes of aluminium ingot in the eight months to March, double a year ago, while material from Russia fell 21 pct to 175,694 tonnes, Japanese trade data showed.
Imports of aluminium alloy from India jumped to 3,008 tonnes over the same period, while Russian imports fell 10 percent to 185,685 tonnes.
The U.S. trade actions - 10 percent import tariffs on the light metal from March and sanctions against Rusal from April - sent shockwaves through the market, boosting aluminium prices to seven-year highs and pushing up costs to obtain physical metal in the U.S. domestic market.
“Stronger U.S. premiums have become incentives for smelters in Australia, which is exempted from the duties, to ship more products to the United States,"" said a third trader, who saw Indian products filling the supply gap left by Rusal in Asia.
Vedanta, India’s largest producer of aluminium, sees a big opportunity in Asia including Japan and Korea.
Cairae said the company is focusing on ramping up exports of its value-added products such as billets, which can be used in the transport, construction and packaging industries, and wire rods.
Hindalco did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Mumbai: Aditya Birla Group-owned Hindalco Industries Ltd, India’s largest aluminium producer, plans to invest around $180 million to expand its rolling capacity in Brazil by 100 kilo tonne (KT), managing director and chief executive officer Satish Pai said on Friday. 
“We will do a bit of capacity addition in Brazil where we have 80% market share (in the aluminium segment). We will add another 80-100KT for expanding rolling capacity there,"" Pai said.
Hindalco, which announced the acquisition of US-based aluminum sheet maker Aleris Corp. in a $2.58 billion deal earlier this year, hopes to close the transaction by April 2019.
“All is progressing well. Though no clearances have come yet, we don’t have any red flags either. Financial closures will happen when we close regulatory aspects of the deal,"" Pai said.
Hindalco in July announced its $2.58 billion acquisition of Aleris Corp. through its US subsidiary Novelis, agreeing to pay $775 million in cash for Aleris and absorb the company’s debt of $1.8 billion.
Hindalco’s purchase of Aleris will be completely debt-funded. “The $775 million (of cash payment) will be funded through a five-year term loan and the rest will be through a one-year bridge loan. We will refinance the loans and call back the bonds,"" Pai said.
On Friday, Hindalco reported a standalone net profit for the September quarter, which along with profits from Utkal Alumina stood at  ₹ 725 crore, up from  ₹ 470 crore during the same period of the last year.
The company’s total revenue (Utkal Alumina added) rose from  ₹ 10,313 crore to  ₹ 10,833 crore during the reporting period. Novelis also posted an Ebitda of $355 million, its highest ever, up 18% from $302 million. 
It hopes to bag at least two coal mines for captive use during the coal mine auction next month. It aims to bid for two mines in Odisha, including Jamkhani coal mine.
“While, our total coal requirement stands at about 16 MT (annually), we would like to add mines that do 3-4MT a year,"" Pai said.
At present, Hindalco has four coal mines, which have a total of 4MT capacity annually. The company plans to mine at least up to 8MT of its coal requirements from its own mines, with its planned acquisition of new coal mines.
“Last time we got four coal mines (from auctions), which has given us a competitive advantage against others who are importing coal. Also, for smelters, the more captive mines one has, the better it is,"" Pai said, adding that he expects the government to prioritize coal towards the power sector in the coming months. During the coal block auction in September, the firm also won back 3.1MT Krishnashila coal linkage in Uttar Pradesh.
Hindalco is also adding 200KT automotive capacity in Kentucky, US, where the capex incurred is a over $300 million. In China, the capex incurred for expansion of the auto capacity stands at about $180 million for a 100KT brownfield plant expansion.
“The company’s organic capex (for FY 19) stands close to $500 million,"" Pai said. Hindalco’s net debt stands at  ₹ 16,763 crore. In the last 14 months the firm has retired  ₹ 10,000 crore worth of debt. 
Pai said the plan to double Hindalco’s capacity of value added aluminium products from 300MT to 600MT in the next five years will not change. He, however, added that like the US the government in India should also take measures to protect domestic producers. 
The company’s stock closed at Rs240.35 per share, up 4.03% on Friday at the BSE. The benchmark Sensex closed 1.68% up at 35,011.65."
26,2018-11-05,Hindalco,"How Hindalco does from here will depend more on external factors such as China's economic strength and a patch-up on the trade war front

Last week saw news that the US and China may call a truce on their trade war. While that news was played down subsequently, a trade deal can be a crucial turning point for metal companies. A slowdown in China’s economy is one of their main worries, as lower demand could mean weaker prices. That matters for domestic aluminium maker Hindalco Industries Ltd.

A slowdown in China’s economy is one of their main worries, as lower demand could mean weaker prices. That matters for domestic aluminium maker Hindalco Industries Ltd.
Hindalco’s September quarter, or Q2, results show that its overseas operations are doing well while its domestic business is showing a mixed performance. Its overseas subsidiary Novelis Inc.’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) rose by 17.5% to $355 million in Q2 from a year ago, and increased 6.3% over the June quarter. While shipments were up by only 1% over a year ago, an improved product mix and savings from operational efficiencies helped profitability improve. The completion of the Aleris Inc. acquisition is a key event to watch out for.

In Hindalco’s domestic copper business, copper cathode volumes declined by a fourth due to a planned maintenance shutdown. Sequentially, output was down by 11% and will return to normal levels in the second half. Due to lower output, the copper division’s Ebitda was down by 16.9% from a year ago, and also due to lower treatment and refining charges. Sequentially, Ebitda was up by 15.7% indicating an improved situation. The rising output of copper rods, which earn better margins, would also have contributed to better margins.
ALSO READ | A confident Hindalco pays top dollar for Aleris acquisition
The aluminium business had a mixed quarter though. If we take the proforma numbers of the company’s standalone aluminium segment that include Utkal Alumina Ltd’s numbers, then Ebitda rose by 13.3% over a year ago. But it declined by 11% sequentially. Since volume is stable, share of value-added products, realizations and how costs move are what will determine changes to profitability.
A sharp increase in power and fuel costs is visible in its standalone results. Compared to the June quarter, aluminium prices are down by 9%, while domestic premiums are down by 28%. Value-added products’ share has risen but has been restrained by competition from imports. Hindalco has been using cash surpluses to lower debt.
The company’s profit before tax (standalone plus Utkal) rose by a fifth over a year ago but fell by 3.9% sequentially. The key risk to monitor in its domestic aluminium business is whether prices continue to decline or recover. The copper business should do better in the second half, as volumes recover post-shutdown. The international business is a bright spot.
Hindalco’s shares are down by 10.4% from a year ago but are up by a fourth from their July lows. How the company does from here will depend more on external factors such as China’s economic strength and a patch-up on the trade war front. These will likely influence aluminium realizations and its performance in the second half as well."

Mumbai: Hindalco Industries Ltd, the flagship company of the Aditya Birla Group, has moved the Bombay high court against a Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board (MSPCB) order asking it to shut down its bauxite mine at Dhangarwadi in Kolhapur district for alleged violation of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. 
The court on 29 November stayed the pollution control board’s order until 11 December, the next date of the hearing. “We are inclined to grant ad interim relief to the petitioner as the petitioner’s unit at Dhangarwadi is directed to be closed with immediate effect,"" said the division bench of the Bombay high court, comprising chief justice N.H. Patil and justice M.S. Karnik.
On 27 November, the MSPCB had ordered immediate closure of the bauxite unit , besides instructing state departments to disconnect water and electricity supply to the unit. The firm argued that the MSPCB had passed the order without giving the company any chance to present its view and, hence, it was in violation of natural justice. 
The counsel for Hindalco argued that the company had not even received a show cause notice issued by the regulator on 16 November. Also, he added that there is a remedy for appeal to the National Green Tribunal against any order passed under Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. However, such a remedy is not available to challenge such order under the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act of 1981 and hence the company has approached the high court. 
During the course of the arguments, the court also granted time to the pollution control authority’s lawyer to file a reply. 
Typically, Hindalco can file an appeal on the closure order before the National Green Tribunal. However, an order under Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 prevents such appeal, the company told the court. 
Bauxite is used as raw material for manufacturing aluminium. With a consolidated turnover of $18 billion, in addition to Kolhapur mine, Hindalco also operates in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha in India. 
An email query to Hindalco as well as MSPCB remained unanswered till the time of filing the report. Also, when contacted, Ashish Prasad, partner litigation at law firm ELP, who is advising the company in the case, refused to divulge any details since the matter is subjudice."

23,2019-02-13,Hindalco,"For Hindalco, much depends on how China's economy shapes up—as far as aluminium prices are concernedAlso, with Novelis seeing decent growth, Hindalco should deliver a steady Q4 FY19, until global economy turns for the worse

Shares of Hindalco Industries Ltd have done fairly well amid concerns about the global economy and the fall in commodity prices. Compared to an 18% drop in the Nifty Metal index, the company’s shares fell 10% in the past six months. The impact of the fall in aluminium prices and input cost pressures can be seen in the December quarter results (Q3 results). But thanks to better realizations, Hindalco managed to deliver steady earnings.
Revenue of domestic operations including Utkal Alumina, its aluminium refining unit, rose 8% from a year ago. Operating profit is up 4%. Thanks to prepayment and repricing of loans, finance costs dropped 12%. This helped the company report a 10% rise in profit before tax.
The growth figures may not look exciting on absolute basis but seen in the backdrop of a 6% fall in international aluminium prices and elevated input costs, the earnings performance is decent.
The pressure from moderation in aluminium prices can be seen on a sequential basis. Operating profit at the aluminium segment dropped 4.7% from the September quarter. But thanks to better volumes and realizations in the copper business, Hindalco (stand-alone plus Utkal Alumina) managed to maintain the operating profit at the September-quarter level.
With coal availability improving and crude oil-based raw material prices easing, the management expects the input cost base to either remain flat or moderate in the current quarter.
Further, with the US-based subsidiary Novelis Inc. seeing decent growth (operating profit up 5.6%), Hindalco should see another steady quarter (Q4 FY19), unless the global economic situation turns for the worse. “Cost competitiveness in Hindalco’s India operations driven by increased coal security, quick ramp-up of new capacities and high margins at Novelis/Aleris with higher proportion of automotive products in the mix continues to drive an upward earnings trajectory for the consolidated entity,"" analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd said in a 5 February note. Novelis is acquiring Aleris Corp., and the acquisition is expected to be completed in the second half of this year.
The commentary and the performance in the December quarter should help the stock. However, the key for Hindalco and the industry remains aluminium prices. At current prices, production at around half of the global capacities (outside China) is unviable, says the company’s management. While this should reduce the scope for a steep fall in aluminium prices, much depends on how China’s economy shapes up.
The demand slowdown in China is driving cheap imports into India. This is not only weighing on prices but is also impacting the market shares of local producers such as Hindalco. The company expects some of the recent stimulus measures to help improve demand in China, and ease the pressure from imports. But how effective these measures are in supporting demand in China remains a question mark."

New Delhi: Equity markets this week will be guided by global trends, macroeconomic data and quarterly earnings, while investors may also see volatility amid the ongoing election season, say analysts.
Over the last week, markets bore the brunt of escalating trade tensions between the US and China.
""The important question this week would be amongst the trio — US-China tiff, political outcome or quarterly results which one will dominate the markets and swing the bourses accordingly in their favour.
""It's a tough match between trade war and elections while the companies numbers have taken a back seat. Volatility will remain at its peak as the battle intensifies,"" said Jimeet Modi, Founder and CEO, SAMCO Securities and StockNote.
Inflation rate is scheduled to be announced early this week, which would be crucial for the market trend, experts added.
Polling for the ongoing general elections will conclude on May 19 and counting of votes will take place on May 23.
""We are nearing the end of Lok Sabha elections which were already a factor for volatility to resurrect but trade war and global cues added the fuel, categorically,"" said Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research.
Some important results to look out for this week include ITC, HDFC Limited, Lupin, Bajaj Auto and Hindalco.
Markets may on Monday react to industrial production number, announced post market hours Friday.
India's industrial production contracted by 0.1 per cent in March this year, the lowest in 21 months, mainly due to manufacturing sector slowdown, official data showed.
Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said: ""May continues to be an eventful month with just a few phases left of the general elections and the ongoing Q4 FY19 earnings season will keep the market volatile in the short-term.""
Benchmark indices buckled under selling pressure for the eighth straight session Friday -- marking their longest losing streak since mid-February -- as investors remained on the sidelines amid the US-China trade conflict and lacklustre corporate earnings.

Indian markets may rebound on Thursday as Asian shares steadied on news that US President Donald Trump is planning to delay tariffs on auto imports, providing much needed relief to markets hit by a flare-up in trade tensions and on weak US and Chinese economic data.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, with both Australia and South Korea little changed. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.6%, with banks hurt by weak earnings.
On Wednesday, Wall Street shares extended their rebound, with the S&P 500 gaining 0.58% and the MSCI's broadest gauge of world stocks bouncing back from a two-month low hit on Tuesday.
The uptick came after three administration officials told Reuters on Wednesday that Trump is expected to delay a decision on tariffs on imported cars and parts by up to six months.
Also on Wednesday, less than a week after Washington slapped higher tariffs on $250 billion imports from China, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he will likely travel to Beijing soon to continue negotiations with Chinese counterparts.
Back home, companies that will declare their March quarter results today include Hindalco Industries, Bank of India, Bajaj Finserv, Bajaj Finance, JSW Energy and Shree Renuka Sugars.
Tata group stocks may be in focus in trade today. Tata Global Beverages Ltd is acquiring all the branded food businesses from Tata Chemicals Ltd in an all-stock transaction that is aimed at creating a consumer business company with revenues of  ₹9,099 crore.
As part of the deal, shareholders of Tata Chemicals will get 1.14 new shares of Tata Global for every share held, the company said in an exchange filing on Wednesday. The transaction values the consumer business of Tata Chemicals at around  ₹5,800 crore. Post the acquisition, Tata Chemicals will own a 31.5% stake in Tata Global Beverages.
Meanwhile, oil prices edged up on the prospect of mounting tensions in the Middle East hitting global supplies despite an unexpected build in US crude inventories. Brent crude rose 0.7% to $72.25 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fetched $62.45 a barrel, up 0.7%.
The United States pulled staff from its embassy in Baghdad on Wednesday out of apparent concern about perceived threats from Iran.
The sabotage of the tankers, for which no one has claimed responsibility, and Saudi Arabia's announcement on Tuesday that armed drones hit two of its oil pumping stations have raised concerns Washington and Tehran may be inching toward conflict.

New Delhi: Aditya Birla Group flagship firm Hindalco Industries on Thursday reported a 37.4% decline in standalone profit to  ₹235.82 crore for the quarter ended 31 March.
The company had posted a standalone profit of  ₹376.97 crore in the year-ago period, Hindalco Industries said in a filing to BSE.
However, the company's standalone income during January-March quarter increased to  ₹12,733.23 crore, over  ₹11,892.06 crore a year ago.
Hindalco Industries Ltd is a global major in aluminium and copper.
In the statement, the company said, ""PAT (profit after tax) for Q4 FY19 stood at  ₹506 crore ( ₹616 crore in Q4 FY18), primarily due to weaker macros and higher input costs in the last quarter.""
The consolidated profit 2018-19 fell to  ₹5,495.01 crore, over  ₹6,082.87 crore in the year ended 31 March, 2018.
The company's board of directors ""recommended dividend at 120% i.e.  ₹1.20 per equity share of face value of Re 1 each for the financial year ended 31 March, 2019, subject to approval of the shareholders at the ensuing annual general meeting,"" the filing said.
""Our FY19 consolidated profits reached an all-time high in spite of a difficult business environment. This resilient performance reflects the strength of our integrated business model, excellent operational capabilities, stable operations and our enriched product portfolio,"" said Satish Pai, managing director at Hindalco Industries. 
""Novelis' innovative products and customer-centric approach helped it deliver its best-ever performance. In India, our increased focus on downstream is already showing encouraging results with record aluminium value-added product volumes this year. In copper, too, the share of value-added products (copper rods) has risen, helping the business maintain profitability despite lower volumes,"" Pai added.
He said the company expects the impetus provided by India's growth to boost demand for aluminium.
""Rising imports of aluminium and copper, however, pose a threat and we look forward to suitable steps to provide a level-playing field,"" he added.
Shares of the company were trading up by 1.57% at  ₹193.95 apiece on the BSE.

MUMBAI :
Despite the European Commission suspending the deadline to clear Novelis’ takeover of Aleris, Hindalco Industries, the Indian parent of Novelis, is confident that the acquisition will be completed on schedule.
In an interview on Thursday, Satish Pai, managing director, Hindalco, said: “I don’t think we should be too perturbed by the ‘stopping of the clock’ by the EC. It’s a fairly routine procedure, we’re fairly certain they will restart the clock again. We are not deviating from our stance that we will complete the regulatory requirements by Q2. We will respond to the EC’s questions in the next three to four days.""
“Europe is not where we expect anti-trust issues,"" Pai said. “Aleris in Europe is in the aerospace business. It has one auto plant in Duffel which is about 60 kilo tonnes and there are five other suppliers of auto sheet in the European Union (EU). In fact, the EU has excess supply of automotive sheet.""
“It’s in the US where we are working on the anti-trust more closely and the process is ongoing. A decision will have to be made by the Department of Justice by June. We remain confident that we will complete all regulatory approvals by Q2 of this financial year,"" Pai added.
Hindalco announced last July that its US unit Novelis would buy Aleris at an enterprise value of $2.58 billion. A deal would make Hindalco the world’s second-largest aluminium producer.
In March this year, EU anti-trust regulators said they have started a probe into Novelis’ plan to buy Aleris.
On Tuesday, the European Commission “stopped the clock"" on the probe, a process that is set in place when the parties concerned fail to provide timely information to the body.
Pai was speaking to reporters after Hindalco announced earnings for the March quarter. Hindalco (and its subsidiary Utkal Alumina) reported net profit of  ₹506 crore for the March quarter, down 18% from the  ₹616 crore in the same period last year. Revenue from operations rose 7% year-on-year to  ₹12,455 crore.
However, earnings after interest, taxes and depreciation on aluminium ( ₹1043 crore) and copper ( ₹315 crore) fell 18% and 4%, respectively as metal prices suffered a downturn globally.
Consolidated profit for FY19, including Novelis, fell 10% to  ₹5495 crore from  ₹6083 crore in FY18."
16,2019-05-16,Hindalco,"Much of the boost in the operating income came from a spurt in other income, which jumped 79% sequentiallyRevenues at the aluminium unit dropped just 1% despite a notable fall in aluminium prices

On the face of it, the March quarter results of Hindalco Industries Ltd look decent. Revenues at the stand-alone firm, including Utkal Alumina, rose 4.3% sequentially despite a notable drop in product prices.
Even the drop of 10% in operating profit was lower than expected. However, the performance looks weaker if looked at more closely. Much of the boost in the operating income came from a spurt in other income, which jumped 79% sequentially. Exclude this and sequential operating profit will fall 20%, which is not materially better than Street estimates.
Revenues at the aluminium unit dropped just 1% despite a notable fall in aluminium prices. This is because of the benefits of business hedges—a portion of volumes were pre-booked at higher prices. However, this yielded no major benefit. Operating profits dropped 18.9% sequentially. Low realizations and adverse currency movement impacted operating profit, according to the company. However, analysts also blame higher operating costs for the steep fall in operating profits.
The performance in the copper business, on the other hand, was impacted by lower production and treatment and refining charges. As a result, operating profit dropped 26.9% sequentially. The management expects output at the copper division to be impacted because of plant shutdowns in Q1, but it expects production to scale up in the rest of the fiscal year, making up for the loss.
Importantly, the management sees incrementally lower costs at the aluminium business. Coal availability is better than a year ago and prices in the global and domestic spot markets are softer. The global aluminium market is expected to be in deficit (production versus demand) this year, sending inventories to a multi-year low. Global demand for refined copper is estimated to rise 2% in 2019, with demand for copper concentrate outstripping production.
However, uncertainty in the global economy and trade tensions are an overhang over metals producers. Aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange are down 2.3% over the past month.
The company, meanwhile, is strengthening its balance sheet. Consolidated net debt to Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) eased to 2.48 times as it prepaid some loans. The US unit Novelis reported better-than-expected results for the March quarter, tracking demand traction in user industries. However, the performance did not count for much as far as the Hindalco stock goes, as trade tensions between the US and China overshadowed investor sentiments."

I have known BK babu, as Basant Kumar Birla was called adorably, since my childhood. We lived in Kolkata and our families were friends for several generations. He was close to my grandfather and his light-hearted, friendly banter often filled our drawing room with stories from the time he was inducted in business to his days with the Mahatma.
Despite being born in a wealthy, distinguished business family and leading a successful business empire, BK babu led an austere life. He would express displeasure at the kind of expensive gadgets that children were given and would often tell the story of how he used to receive an allowance of  ₹5 during his school days.
A man of varied interests, he could play the violin, authored a few books, was an avid photographer and education occupied a large part of his heart.
His vision in education and philanthropy can be seen in the way the Birla schools and BITS (Birla Institute of Technology and Science) Pilani have become leading institutions in the country. For all the good he has done for people and society, life wasn’t kind to him.
His son Aditya Vikram Birla’s premature death was a huge blow that only a father who lost his child would know.
A true karmayogi, BK babu had the mind of a mathematical genius. He could see through a balance sheet in minutes and point out gaps that qualified chartered accountants took days to prepare. His accounting mind and his execution prowess are testimony to the success of Century, Hindalco, Kesoram and a host of other companies.
He drew a lot of strength from his wife Sarala Birla, an erudite lady who was way ahead of her time, and openly acknowledged her as his friend and guide. Both of them loved visiting Switzerland and Kedarnath together.
As a family, the Birlas did a lot of charity and built many temples across India. He was also a patron of the arts and I have fond memories of my visits to the Birla Academy of Arts in Kolkata during my younger days.
He was always keen to know my impression of the collection and the art events that were held. His collection of art was formidable with works of Bengal masters, such as Tagore, Jamini Roy and Nandlal Bose, holding place of pride. He also loved miniature art and extended support to young artists. As he leaves behind a huge legacy, the baton has passed on to the very capable hands of his grandson, Kumar Mangalam Birla. Dadoji, we will miss you.

14,2019-08-09,Hindalco,"Lower realisations happened because falling global benchmark prices of aluminium and copper affected profitabilityCopper volumes during the quarter fell because of a planned maintenance shutdown, the company said

Mumbai: Hindalco Industries, which houses the metals business of the Aditya Birla Group, reported a net profit of  ₹1,063 crore in the June 2019 quarter, falling nearly 28% from the  ₹1,475 crore reported in the year-ago period.
Lower realisations happened because falling global benchmark prices of aluminium and copper affected profitability.
Revenue for the quarter fell 3.5% in the quarter to  ₹29,972 crore, while EBITDA fell 13% to  ₹3,769 crore. Novelis, Hindalco’s US-based aluminium rolling and beverage can sheet making subsidiary, saw segment results rise 5% to  ₹2,538 crore, while aluminium and copper results fell 41% to  ₹889 crore and 23% to  ₹267 crore respectively. Copper volumes during the quarter fell because of a planned maintenance shutdown, the company said.
“This quarter, we are seeing the benefits of diversifying into upstream and downstream,"" Satish Pai, MD and CEO, Hindalco, told Mint. “Novelis has excellent results and it’s not affected by LME (London Metal Exchange) prices. They’ve had a record quarter. In the Indian aluminium side, we see the impact of prices. But compared to other players we are doing much better. The macroeconomic environment is a little bit of a worry,"" he said.
“We are focused on the fundamentals of the business. The can market is growing and we’ve seen Novelis’ auto shipments rise. Our brownfield expansion is growing. Novelis is going to have a great year. The copper business had a shutdown, but it’ll come back strongly. We will continue operating at these levels till LME prices go up,"" Pai added.

13,2019-08-12,Hindalco,"Hindalco’s domestic business has been weighed down by lower realizationsThe net profit of the India business slumped by 77% in the first quarter ended June

Shares of Hindalco Industries Ltd hit an air pocket soon after the company its lower-than-anticipated first-quarter results. The stock caved in after the results were announced, losing about 2% on Friday.
The domestic business has been weighed down by lower realizations and higher costs. Despite the fact that the company reported stable aluminium production, stand-alone revenue dropped 5.7% in the June quarter.
Aluminium metal sales, however, were up 7% from a year ago. Copper sales were sluggish and remained just about the same as last year, but it was still lower than what analysts pencilled in.
Higher sales of aluminium and value-added products were expected to buoy its performance. But that did not happen. Aluminium and metal realizations were considerably low for its domestic arm. A sharp drop in global metal prices have impacted its business. Higher imports have also hit the domestic business.
As a result, the company’s aluminium division saw a huge fall in Ebitda by 42% due to lower realizations. Ebitda is earnings before, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
In its copper business, sales of value-added products were up 3% from a year ago. But here, too, sluggish volumes and realizations have been weighing down performance. This pulled down its copper division Ebitda by 23%.
Margin improvement was likely to come through cost efficiencies, value-added products and better product mix. This was also not visible. Ebitda margins, in fact, contracted to 12.7% as against 18.3% in a year ago.
To be sure, Hindalco’s overseas unit has seen a decent pickup in business. Shipments at Novelis Inc. rose 4% year-on-year. The 6% revenue fall due to a decrease in base aluminium prices was partially offset by higher shipments and a better product mix. That did perk up its US unit’s Ebitda by 11%.
Nevertheless, it is the local business that has been bogged down by the liquidity crunch and general slowdown. So much so, that Hindalco’s stand-alone business, including Utkal Alumina, saw its net profit drop by a whopping 77%.
Analysts say that incremental growth for the company is not visible, with imports hurting the domestic business. A volume pickup is crucial for the company, going forward. However, given the slowdown in the auto sector, that appears difficult. A pickup in international aluminium prices is also needed, but with worries of a looming global slowdown, by how much prices rise remains to be seen. A sharper focus on cost-control and improving product mix is needed, or Hindalco’s stock price might continue to meander for now."
12,2019-08-30,Hindalco,"Last year, Hindalco had announced its acquisition of Aleris at an enterprise value of $2.58 billion, through its US subsidiary NovelisThe deal is currently awaiting regulatory approvals in the US, the EU and China

Mumbai: Hindalco Industries Ltd has not received any official communication from the European Union (EU), approving its acquisition of aluminium maker Aleris Corp., chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said, amid news report that a clearance from the EU is imminent.
Hindalco is not aware of any clearance yet, Birla said, addressing shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting (AGM) on Friday.
Last year, Hindalco announced its acquisition of Aleris at an enterprise value of $2.58 billion, through its US subsidiary Novelis Inc. The deal is awaiting regulatory approvals in the US, the EU and China. A Reuters report on 29 August said that Hindalco has offered to sell Aleris’s autosheet manufacturing plant in Duffel, Belgium, as a concession to allay the European Commission’s (EC’s) worries that the deal may affect input prices of carmakers in the region.
On the sidelines of the AGM, Satish Pai, managing director and chief executive of Hindalco, declined to confirm these concessions, but said that the terms of the concessions will be announced when EC gives its final decision on the acquisition. He said the company expects to receive final approvals before the commission’s next scheduled meeting in October.
At the AGM, Birla allayed fears of shareholders about the cost of the Aleris acquisition. “The net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at Novelis has reduced from 3.1 times in FY17 to 2.65 times now. This will rise to 3.8 times post-acquisition but this will come down in two years and we believe it will generate enough cash flow to justify the acquisition. We’re very comfortable on debt. The rationale for the Aleris acquisition is to enhance our capacity in the auto market, enter the high-end aerospace market and backward-integrate our Chinese operations,"" he said.
Hindalco has reaffirmed its plans to invest $1-1.2 billion over five-six years in the domestic aluminium business, added Birla. He, however, sounded a note of caution about a looming fall in world metals demand.
The company ramped down its initial capital expenditure plan in its domestic business for FY20 from  ₹2,600 crore to  ₹2,000 crore, the bulk of which will go into subsidiary Utkal Alumina International Ltd."

Novelis Inc., the US-based subsidiary of Aditya Birla group’s Hindalco Industries Ltd, said it was committed to closing its proposed acquisition of Aleris Corp. despite the US Department of Justice (DOJ)’s lawsuit to block the deal.
“Novelis intends to vigorously defend against the DOJ’s challenge, which it believes is without merit,"" the world leader in aluminum rolling and recycling said in a statement. The company is set to go into arbitration with the DOJ and, if that doesn’t work, it will consider offering concessions. Novelis reiterated that it intends to close the transaction by 21 January 2020, the outside date under the original merger agreement.
According to a Reuters report late on Wednesday, the US Justice Department has filed a lawsuit aimed at stopping Novelis Inc.’s proposed $2.6 billion purchase of Aleris Corp. because of concerns over higher prices of aluminum sheet used to make cars.
The DoJ said the deal would combine two of the four major North American producers of aluminum to make automobile bodies. It said Ohio-based Aleris was an “aggressive competitor"" and the deal would give Novelis up to 60% of projected domestic capacity.
Novelis argued that the justice department lawsuit “ignores competition from steel automotive body sheet, even though steel automotive body sheet is currently used for nearly 90% of the market"".
“Our merger with Aleris threatens no one, and to the contrary will strengthen our ability to compete against steel, meet growing customer demand for aluminum, achieve our recycling goals, and bolster our sustainability platform worldwide,"" said Steve Fisher, president and CEO, Novelis.
The DOJ’s contention is that in cases where an automobile manufacturer has already picked aluminium over steel, it constrains procurement for the manufacturer by shrinking the market.
In response, Novelis argued that by focusing on just a small slice of steel-aluminum competition, while ignoring the broader competitive process, “the DOJ’s theory contravenes well-established principles of market definition"".
Novelis also said the DOJ also disregards the extraordinary bargaining power of the automotive manufacturers and their ability to generate bid processes that will ensure competitive pricing for automotive body sheet.
In the statement, Novelis said it has reached an agreement with the DOJ on a timetable and process for resolving this dispute."
10,2019-09-05,Hindalco,"Hindalco shares did not fall even as its US-arm Novelis’s proposed purchase of Aleris hit a hurdleFirm’s assurance that it is committed to closing the deal may have brought some comfort

Hindalco Industries Ltd’s shares did not react negatively on Thursday even as its US-based wholly-owned subsidiary, Novelis Inc.’s proposed acquisition of Aleris Corp. hit a hurdle. The US department of justice (DoJ) has filed a civil antitrust lawsuit seeking to block the acquisition of Aleris. This has been done to preserve competition in the North American market for rolled aluminium sheet for automotive applications. DoJ’s chief concern is that the deal would reduce competition in the US auto sheet market, considering that Novelis and Aleris are two out of the four producers of aluminium auto body sheet.
Hindalco’s investors appear to have taken this in their stride. The stock closed 1.6% higher on the National Stock Exchange on Thursday; but note that the risk of running into antitrust problems has been known for a while now.
Novelis’s assurance that it is committed to closing the Aleris acquisition also soothed some investor anxieties. The company contends that the market definition adopted by DoJ is narrow and does not take into account steel body sheets, which is currently used by almost 90% of the market.
According to Amit Dixit, analyst at Edelweiss Securities Ltd, Novelis has a good case as it is upon DoJ to prove that there is a distinct auto body market for aluminium sheets in the US, where customers will face reduced competition. “Given the current market size, it does not seem to be the fact. However, we will wait to see if any remedies are given,"" he added.
There will be trouble if the company goes ahead with the deal after excluding some divisions to appease authorities such as DoJ. “The acquisition is undoubtedly a strong strategic fit to Novelis as it increases its dominance in auto sheet, gets entry in aerospace and becomes backward integrated in China,"" analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note last month. Leaving out some parts of the Aleris business will make the acquisition far less valuable.
As it is, the increase in leverage due to the acquisition is a bit of a worry. As analysts from Kotak said: “Despite the strategic fit, cancellation of the Aleris deal would imply lower leverage and would be value-accretive in the current environment.""
Meanwhile, Hindalco’s shares have declined by 10% so far in FY20. In general, analysts remained positive on the stock and the recent fall does make valuations relatively cheaper to that extent.
“Cost competitiveness in Hindalco’s India operations driven by increased coal security, quick ramp-up of new capacities and high margins at Novelis/Aleris with higher proportion of automotive products in the mix continues to drive an upward earnings trajectory for the consolidated entity,"" analysts from JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd said in a report on 9 August."

Aluminium rolling and recycling company Novelis Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Hindalco Industries Ltd, said on Tuesday that the European Commission has approved its proposed acquisition of US-based Aleris Corp, a maker of aluminium rolled products, with 13 facilities in North America, Europe and China.
The approval is conditional on the sale of Aleris’s plant in Duffel, Belgium, which produces aluminium for the automotive and specialties markets.
“Novelis is working expeditiously to market the plant to potential buyers and sign a definitive agreement, subject to European Commission approval,"" said the company.
Mint reported on 30 August that the company was hopeful that its offer to sell the auto-sheet manufacturing plant in Duffel will push through European approvals for its $2.58 billion acquisition of Aleris, without local regulators worrying that the deal would affect input prices for carmakers in the region.
The company is also challenging a US department of justice lawsuit to block its acquisition of Aleris.
It is set to go into arbitration with the department. If that does not work, it will consider offering concessions, the Hindalco management said last month. Novelis reiterated that it intends to close the transaction by 21 January 2020, the outside date under the original merger agreement.
Novelis continues to work closely with the Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation to receive its approval, following the conditional approval in the European Union and the clear path forward for approval in the US, it added.
“Today’s announcement is another step forward in bringing Novelis and Aleris together, which will benefit our customers, employees and the aluminum industry as a whole,"" said Steve Fisher, president and chief executive of Novelis.
“Overall, this transaction will strengthen our ability to compete against steel in the automotive market, meet growing customer demand for aluminum, achieve our recycling goals, and bolster our sustainability platform worldwide.

IndusInd Bank: Shares of the private lender extended losses for the fourth straight session on Thursday due to concerns surrounding exposure to stressed sectors. The bank’s clarification that its exposure to a large housing finance company (HFC) was fully/strongly collateralised with no overdue failed to boost investor sentiment. The stock recovered marginally, ending down at 3%.
Piramal Enterprises: Shares of the company ended down 7% on Thursday due to concerns over exposure to stressed sectors, mainly real estate. Piramal Enterprises Ltd’s exposure to real-estate developer Lodha Group, which has been unable to meet its financial requirements amid a slowing economy, also weighed on the stock.
BPCL: The government has announced that it will entirely divest its stake in the company through strategic sale, which has improved investor sentiment. It also proposed selling its stake in Shipping Corp, THDC and North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd (NEEPCO). However, ratings agency Moody’s Investor Service called privatisation of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd “a credit negative"".
Zee Entertainment: Shares recovered from Tuesday’s double-digit fall, ending up nearly 8% on Thursday. The stock has been under pressure amid rising concerns over the company’s viability to meet financial requirements, despite the management’s assurance that the company was firm on its financial position.
Tata Motors: The auto company gained 6% on Thursday after its UK unit Jaguar Land Rover reported a 5% rise in US September sales. The increase in US sales offset a possible fall in share prices following 50% year-on-year decline in September domestic sales at 32,376 units. Tata had sold 64,598 vehicles in the same month last year.
Vedanta: Metal index was among the top losers in Thursday’s trade. According to latest data, growth in India's manufacturing sector remained weak in September and forward-looking indicators in a private business survey showed that the country's slowing economy may not start recovering anytime soon. This along with worries over global growth dragged down sentiment. The stock ended down 5%.
Hindalco: Weakness in domestic demand combined with global economic growth concerns weighed on metal stocks. Shares of the company ended more than 4% lower. A possible delay in revival of industrial and manufacturing activity may continue to put pressure on the sectoral index.
Indiabulls Housing Finance: Shares were under pressure due to worries over its proposed merger with Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) not going through, after Reserve Bank of India (RBI) placed the bank under prompt corrective action list on Saturday. In another setback, the Delhi High Court accepted a public interest litigation against Indiabulls for alleged financial irregularities."

NEW DELHI :
Key macroeconomic numbers are likely to drive stock in a holiday-shortened week ahead as quarterly earnings season is almost coming to an end and the Ayodhya verdict unlikely to have any major impact on overall investor sentiments, according to analysts.
Equity markets will be closed on Tuesday for ""Gurunanak Jayanti"".
Industrial production data on Monday, inflation rate on Tuesday and WPI inflation on Thursday would be keenly watched by market participants amid economic slowdown concerns.
Coal India Ltd, Hindalco Industries and NMDC are among the major companies set to announce their earnings this week.
Santosh Meena, Senior Analyst at TradingBells, said Ayodhya verdict would not have any impact on equity market until any social unrest arise in the country.
""It could have sentimental positive impact for incumbent BJP government. Otherwise, it won't have any major impact on the political front as well.
""Market is in bullish momentum where this momentum will continue,"" Meena added.
In one of the most important and much-awaited judgements in India's history, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi put an end to over a century-old dispute that has torn the social fabric of the nation.
The apex court said the mosque should be built at a ""prominent site"", allotted either by the Centre or the Uttar Pradesh government, and a trust should be set up within three months to build the temple at the site that, many Hindus believe, Lord Ram was born.
""Equity markets which are trading near all-time highs will be facing two important data this week which can act as a catalyst for an upside breakout or further pressure,"" Mustafa Nadeem, CEO of Epic Research said.
Developments related to US-China trade negotiations will also be tracked by investors, analysts said.
Besides, trend in rupee-dollar, crude oil and investment pattern by overseas investors will also be crucial for markets, they added.
Equity benchmark BSE Sensex tumbled 330 points on Friday after Moody's Investors Service cut the country's credit rating outlook to negative.
During the last week, the Sensex advanced 158.58 points or 0.39 per cent.
""While the lowering of rating outlook is negative, we believe that the government has been trying to stimulate growth... Government has taken various measures including one of the boldest reforms in the form of corporate tax cut,"" Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Private Ltd, said.
He noted that these measures would take time to work on the ground and that the near term concern is on the fiscal front, with lower tax incomes and higher spending leading to a ballooning deficit."

Mumbai: Stock markets may continue to keep their momentum intact on Monday following firm global cues. Last week markets consolidated, barring Friday when investors rushed to sell shares due to concerns after rating agency Moody's lowered India's outlook.
Asian shares edged higher on Monday after US President Donald Trump said over the weekend that trade talks with China were moving along ""very nicely"", though uncertainty remained over whether a deal would be signed this year.
Japan's Nikkei was up 0.2% to inch closer to a recent 13-month high. Australian shares rose 0.5% to a two-week high while South Korea's KOSPI was off 0.2%. That left MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan firmer at 534.63, testing a recent six-month peak.
Trump told reporters on Saturday that talks with China had moved more slowly than he would have liked, but added that Beijing wanted a deal more than he did. That was a more upbeat tone than just a few days earlier when Trump stressed that the White House would not agree to a full rollback of existing tariffs, remarks that hit stock prices and the dollar.
By the close of Wall Street on Friday, optimism had returned to the market as investors bet that Washington needs a deal and it is in the interests of China, too. All three major US indices eked out record closing highs. The Dow inched up a tad while the S&P 500 climbed 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.5%. The record closing high by the S&P 500 was the fourth in six sessions as US stocks rallied on hopes of a trade deal.
The US officials said a lot of work remained to be done when Trump announced the outlines of an interim deal last month, and Beijing has since pushed back on US’ demands for big agricultural purchases, among other issues.
Analysts said the outlook for equities was highly dependent on US economic data as a US-China trade agreement would help bolster manufacturing and industrial sectors.
Data on October US industrial production and retail sales, along with the National Federation of Independent Business's monthly small business survey, are scheduled for release this week.
Back home, markets regulator has written to the finance ministry over its recent circular tagging foreign-controlled mutual funds as investment vehicles, two people familiar with the matter said. The regulator’s intervention comes amid fears that the new rules could force several equity asset managers to freeze investment activity and even sell their holdings. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) made its representation after mutual funds made their case to the regulator. The anomaly arising from the circular is that retail domestic money invested in the schemes of foreign-owned mutual funds will be counted as foreign money.
Shares of Britannia Industries, Coal India and Hindalco Industries will be in focus as the companies will announce their September quarter earnings result today.
Reflecting growing economic optimism, the benchmark 10-year US treasury yield moved well off its early September lows, and the yield curve between 3-month bills and 10-year notes steepened.
Safe haven gold was near a three-month low touched on Friday after posting its biggest weekly decline in a year. It was last up a touch at 1460.77 an ounce.

5,2019-11-11,Hindalco,"The company had posted a consolidated net profit of  ₹1,448 crore in the year-ago periodHindalco's US arm Novelis reported 6% increase in Ebitda

Mumbai: Hindalco Industries Ltd, a leading manufacturer of aluminium in India, on Monday said its consolidated net profit for September quarter dropped 33% from a year ago due to fall in revenue and higher.
Consolidated net profit for the quarter stood at  ₹974 crore as against  ₹1,448 crore a year ago.
Revenues fell 9% to  ₹29,657 crore on account of decrease in average base aluminium prices and local market premiums, partially offset by higher total shipments and favorable product price and mix.
Its US arm Novelis reported 6% increase in earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation to  ₹2,629 crore in September quarter from  ₹2,485 crore a year ago. The EBITDA rose on account of higher shipments, favorable price and product mix, partially offset by less favorable recycling benefits due to lower aluminium prices.
Shares of Hindalco Industries on BSE fell 1.8% on Monday to  ₹200.40 while India's benchmark Sensex Index rose 0.05% to 40345.08 points."
4,2019-11-11,Hindalco,"On 1 October, European Commission approved Novelis’ proposed acquisition of AlerisThe approval is conditional on the sale of Aleris’s plant in Belgium that produces aluminium

NEW DELHI :
Aditya Birla Group’s Novelis Inc., which is facing an anti-trust lawsuit in the US over its acquisition of Aleris Corp., expects to close the deal by 21 January—the outside date under the original merger agreement, said a top company official.
Last month, the US justice department filed a lawsuit to stop Novelis Inc.’s proposed $2.58 billion purchase of Aleris because of concerns over higher prices of aluminium sheet used to make cars. In its lawsuit, the justice department described Ohio-based Aleris as an “aggressive competitor"" and said the deal will give Novelis, the US-based unit of Hindalco Industries Ltd, up to 60% of the projected domestic capacity.
“In the US, we have signed a consent decree with the Department of Justice,"" said Satish Pai, managing director, Hindalco. “We will prove then through litigation and, if needed, the arbitration process, that aluminium and steel is one market (for the auto industry) in the US.""
Negotiations between Novelis and the justice department currently hinge on the rolling mill at Lewisport, Kentucky, and its 200 kilotonne (kt) automotive finishing line. Novelis has argued that the justice department’s lawsuit “ignores competition from steel automotive body sheet, even though steel automotive body sheet is currently used for nearly 90% of the market"".
On 1 October, the European Commission approved Novelis’ proposed acquisition of Aleris, a maker of aluminium rolled products, with 13 facilities across North America, Europe and China. The approval is conditional on the sale of Aleris’s plant in Duffel, Belgium, which produces aluminium for the automotive and specialities markets.
Pai said he expects to close the sale of the 180kt Duffel plant by November-end and that the company is in talks with a couple of interested local buyers. Regulatory approvals in China will be sought after the European Commission is satisfied with the plant sale and gives its final approval. Pai said the sale of the Duffel plant, and “the unlikely event that we will have to sell Lewisport"" will bring down the cost of the Aleris acquisition proportionately.
The Lewisport plant has a 200kt auto facility and a 350kt hot strip mill. The Duffel plant, slated for sale, has an auto facility of 80kt and a 100kt capacity in specialities. Hindalco announced in July last year it would acquire Aleris through Novelis for $2.58 billion. Hindalco has arranged for $775 million of equity financing through a 5-year facility and a $1.5 billion of debt through a one-year bridge loan.
On Monday, Hindalco, which houses the metals business of the Aditya Birla group, reported a 33% fall in consolidated net profit in the September quarter. Weak metal prices led to an 8.4% fall in operating revenue to  ₹3,918 crore from  ₹4,276 crore a year earlier. Net profit was also hit by a one-time loss of  ₹256 crore on the shutdown of a plant in Germany and restructuring expenses at Muri alumina refinery.
“We’re seeing the government is seized of the matter and are announcing a range of initiatives,"" Pai said adding “We are hoping to see projects from Power Grid and orders from infrastructure, building and construction to pick up.""
Hindalco has cut its capital expenditure plans for the second time this year, from  ₹2,600 crore to  ₹2,000 crore.
September quarter revenue fell 9% to  ₹29,657 crore on account of lower average base aluminium prices and local market premiums, partially offset by higher total shipments and favourable product price and mix.
Shares of Hindalco Industries fell 1.8% to  ₹200.40 on BSE on Monday underperforming the benchmark index Sensex that remained almost unchanged at 40,345.08 points."
3,2019-11-12,Hindalco,"Hindalco’s stand-alone revenues fell by about 8%, but were in line with consensus estimatesSlowdown in auto, construction and electrical sectors added to the contraction

The market could be relieved that the US aluminium market may have gained from the trade war, though domestically, things are getting seemingly worse.
Hindalco Industries Ltd’s stand-alone domestic revenue fell 8% in Q2 FY20 from a year ago, while net profit declined a whopping 75%. These numbers, though, were just about in line with the stand-alone consensus estimates and so may not ruffle investors too much.
Subdued consumption and investment led to a moderation in growth, which impacted revenue growth. The slowdown in the automotive, building and construction, and electrical sectors has added to the contraction.
Overall, Hindalco’s domestic demand in Q2 registered a decline by about 6% to 967,000 tonnes. Imports, including scrap, declined by about 8% in Q2 FY20 against a growth of 25% in the year-ago quarter. Market watchers see the slowdown continuing, which could further impact operating performance.
Expenses were higher, too. Raw material prices appreciated marginally, leading to a contraction in operating metrics domestically. Power and fuel costs were also higher by about 9% year-on-year in Q2. As a result, Ebitda margins in its stand-alone numbers shrank to 7.8% year- on-year from 10.1% in the year-ago period. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
A saving grace has come in the form of the improved performance of its US-based subsidiary Novelis Inc. In fact, the company reported higher-than-expected Q2 FY20 numbers as growth in the US remained strong. The American business seems to be gaining from the US-China trade war. But there are concerns on whether the higher realizations in the US will sustain.
“Favourable speciality pricing (impact of the anti-dumping duty imposed by the US on China) and surplus scrap in the US led to an increase in profitability. Nevertheless, the management also highlighted that increased prices in the speciality side may not be sustainable,"" said analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd in a note to clients.
Still, the Novelis business has improved the consolidated numbers. While revenue was lower in Q2 by about 9% year-on-year, Ebitda margins stood at 12.2% in Q2, which is similar to last year’s 12.4%. In fact, these numbers are also in line with what analysts have estimated for Q2, which will be seen as a positive.
Analysts have noted that globally there is an increase in demand for cans, which can be attributed to a shift from PET and plastic bottles. New generation energy drinks are also said to be driving the demand for beverage cans. On the domestic front, the government’s initiatives to improve investments in infrastructure and the housing sector, and the decline in interest rates may be supportive of demand going forward. However, the recovery continues to be elusive.
As such, Hindalco Industries may still have a long uphill climb in the domestic market until demand recovers. This could keep a check on the stock."
