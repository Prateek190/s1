New Delhi: Fitch Ratings on Wednesday said it has assigned Power Grid a long-term local currency issuer default rating (IDR) of ‘BBB-’, which is at the same level as its long-term foreign currency IDR. 
New Delhi: Fitch Ratings on Wednesday said it has assigned Power Grid a long-term local currency issuer default rating (IDR) of ‘BBB-’, which is at the same level as its long-term foreign currency IDR.
The outlook is stable. Fitch assesses Power Grid’s standalone profile at ‘BBB’, it said in a statement. Fitch’s credit ratings range from AAA to D, where triple-A indicates high ability to repay debt while D indicates the least. It said that Power Grid’s ratings benefit from its strong market position. 
The company owns and operates around 85% of India’s inter-regional and inter-state electricity transmission network assets. Revenue from existing operational transmission assets is based on a return on equity of 15.5% and full pass- through of all fixed costs within regulatory norms, including interest charges. 
India’s new transmission projects have only been awarded through tariff-based competitive bidding since 2011, except for certain projects of strategic importance, technical upgrades or urgent requirements, which are awarded directly to Power Grid, it said. 
Power Grid has had 11 projects awarded through the bidding scheme and aims to complete 10 of them (one project has been discontinued) by 2020. Returns from tariff-based bidding projects are less protected than from existing operational assets under a cost-plus tariff model, it said. 
However, Fitch does not expect these projects to account for more than 5% of Power Grid’s revenue in the medium term. Power Grid commissioned Rs32,000 crore of projects in FY17, exceeding Fitch’s expectations, and plans total capex of about Rs25,000 crore per year over the next three years, it added."

Mumbai: India Grid Trust (IndiGrid) on Monday reported revenue of Rs126 crore for the quarter ended 31 December.  
Mumbai: India Grid Trust (IndiGrid) on Monday reported revenue of Rs126 crore for the quarter ended 31 December. 
The InvIT, promoted by Sterlite Power Grid Ventures, recorded net distributable cash flow of Rs101.3 crore for the October-December quarter of FY18, the firm said in a statement issued in Mumbai. The board of Sterlite Investment Managers acting as the investment manager of the trust has approved a distribution per unit of Rs2.89 per unit for third quarter of the fiscal. 
IndiGrid is also in the process of completing the acquisition of three assets from Sterlite Power Grid Ventures Limited, RAPP Transmission Company, Purulia and Kharagpur Transmission Company and Maheshwaram Transmission worth Rs1,500 crore. These acquisitions are expected to be consummated in the last quarter of FY18, the company said.

New Delhi: India will need at least $125 billion to fund its ambitious plan to increase the share of renewable power supply in the country’s grid by 2022, a top government official told Reuters, underlining the immense financing challenge ahead. 
New Delhi: India will need at least $125 billion to fund its ambitious plan to increase the share of renewable power supply in the country’s grid by 2022, a top government official told Reuters, underlining the immense financing challenge ahead.
The South Asian nation is one of the world’s most important growth markets for renewable energy. Millions of Indians are not yet linked up to the power grid but as the country of more than a billion people prospers, it is experiencing surging demand.
To put India’s $125 billion requirement in context, global corporate funding for the solar industry—the world’s fastest-growing electricity source—was a tenth of that amount in 2017 at $12.8 billion, research firm Mercom says.
In 2015, India said investment of $100 billion in the seven years to 2022 would be needed to meet its renewable energy goals.
Installed renewable power capacity is currently about 60 gigawats (GW), and India plans to complete the bidding process by the end of 2019/20 to add a further 115 GW of installed renewable energy capacity by 2022.
To do that, Anand Kumar, secretary at the ministry of new and renewable energy, said investment of at least $125 billion would be needed.
India, which receives twice as much sunshine as European countries, wants to make solar central to its renewable expansion. It expects renewable energy to make up 40% of installed power capacity by 2030, compared with 18.2% at the end of 2017.
Kumar said that $125 billion was a “conservative estimate"" and foreign capital would be central to achieving the goal.
Private equity firms, US banks including Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, and European utilities EDF and Engie are already investors or lenders in India’s renewable energy sector.
India will also require support from development banks, like the World Bank, Kumar said.
IREDA , a state-run financier for renewable energy, raised $300 million by selling rupee-denominated bonds, known as masala bonds, in the United Kingdom last year. The bonds were subscribed 1.7 times.
“We are also looking to raise another $500 million through IREDA through masala bonds early next financial year,"" he said.
Not enough
Most of the financing for India’s renewables drive so far has come from domestic banks, industry experts say, raising doubts about the level of support that can be expected from overseas investors.
Market consultant Jasmeet Khurana said Indian banks would have to account for the lion’s share of new renewable investments in the future.
“It is an uphill task, but Indian banks can find the appetite to fund these projects,"" Khurana said.
Another challenge in achieving India’s renewable targets is the government’s “Make in India"" initiative.
To protect itself from cheap solar panel imports, India’s directorate general of safeguards, an arm of the finance ministry, has proposed a 70% duty on imports of solar equipment from some countries including China, which so far provides the vast majority of India’s solar panels.
Kumar said “a duty at this stage could hamper our growth situation,"" and “a realistic view"" will be taken in consultation with other stakeholders.
The government was working on developing energy storage technologies and hydrogen-fuel cells and other batteries, he said.
“Renewables are the future. The only weak link is storage, and the day you crack storage, there is no looking back for renewables."" Reuters"

Berlin: EON SE will shed as many as 5,000 jobs in the deal to take over Innogy SE, a move that marks the biggest shakeup in Germany’s energy business in years. 
Berlin: EON SE will shed as many as 5,000 jobs in the deal to take over Innogy SE, a move that marks the biggest shakeup in Germany’s energy business in years.
The transaction agreed with its rival RWE AG values Innogy at €22 billion ($27.1 billion) and will sharpen the focus of Germany’s leading two electricity and natural gas providers, according to a joint statement on Monday. EON billed itself as the first formerly-integrated utility to focus entirely on meeting needs of 50 million customers across Europe. RWE said it doesn’t expect any net job losses.
EON targets savings of €600 million to €800 million by 2022. It would become a grid manager and power provider focused on meeting Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ambitious targets to cut pollution. For RWE, which is Europe’s biggest generator of electricity, the deal would provide it with renewables as an alternative to its current generation network that now is focused mainly on coal and nuclear power.
“It’s EON’s first real growth step for more than a decade,"" EON chief executive officer (CEO) Johannes Teyssen said at a press conference on Tuesday in Essen, where all three of the utilities are based. “Our renewables businesses will find a promising home within a larger platform that will offer the necessary scale of size.""
RWE CEO Rolf Martin Schmitz said “size is crucial"" to exploit business opportunities as clean energy subsidies disappear and that conventional power assets will become “the beating heart of any future-proofed industrial society."" Markus Krebber, finance director for RWE, said in a Bloomberg Television interview that the deal “will entirely transform our company"" by doubling earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
EON shares surged more than 6%, continuing the biggest two-day increase in more than a year. RWE was up almost 3% after a 14% gain Monday, and Innogy was little changed just below the €40 a share offer price.
Merkel is seeking to phase out coal-fired power generation in Germany and wants to deliver a plan by the end of this year. RWE owns half of the nation’s coal-fired power capacity.
“The new RWE and EON entities provide investors with clearer differentiated opportunities,"" Jonas Rooze, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, wrote in a note to clients. “Investors can take stakes in RWE if they want power generation exposure, and in EON for distribution and retail exposure.""
EON’s voluntary takeover offer for Innogy will probably be completed by the middle of 2019, the companies said. RWE may take control of EON’s renewable energy assets by the end of 2019, when the full transaction is due to close subject to approval from antitrust authorities.
Perella Weinberg Partners and BNP Paribas advised EON, with Linklaters acting as legal council. BofA Merrill Lynch and Citigroup advised RWE, and Rothschild provided a fairness opinion to RWE’s supervisory board and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer acting as legal council.
RWE will end up with EON’s renewables business, minority stakes in two nuclear power plants, Innogy’s gas storage business and a stake in an Austrian energy supplier. Including the asset swaps, the whole transaction has an enterprise value of about €60 billion.
RWE reported an increase in full-year earnings on Tuesday while forecasting a decline in financial performance in 2018. The utility proposes a dividend of €1.5 for 2017, which includes a €1 special dividend. For 2018, the goal is to increase the ordinary dividend to €0.70.
EON also released earnings for 2017 that beat analysts forecasts, bringing forward its announcement by two days. Bloomberg News first reported the deal on 10 March, with confirmation from the companies on Sunday and a full statement with terms of the transaction released on Monday evening. RWE reports earnings on Tuesday.
EON said its adjusted net income was €1.5 billion last year, above the median forecast collected by Bloomberg for of €1.33 billion. Bloomberg"
51,2018-03-22,PowerGrid,"As renewables gain prominence, thermal power plants will have to become flexible in terms of generation to balance grid demand

The law of unintended consequences is taking its toll on the thermal power sector. A report by a government committee on the optimal energy mix in power generation says the thermal power sector may continue to bear the brunt of the thrust on renewable energy. This is especially if the renewables sector has to achieve its targeted capacity additions by 2022. 
The law of unintended consequences is taking its toll on the thermal power sector. A report by a government committee on the optimal energy mix in power generation says the thermal power sector may continue to bear the brunt of the thrust on renewable energy. This is especially if the renewables sector has to achieve its targeted capacity additions by 2022.
Simply put, the report says coal-based power plants will have to be underutilized if the committed renewable capacities have to be added by 2021-22. The utilization levels or the plant load factor is estimated to fall to 56.5% by 2021-22. 
For perspective, with utilization levels at 60% so far this fiscal year, lenders are worried about the bankability of the projects. Depending on the capital cost, fuel mix, offtake agreements and fixed cost recovery clauses, a power plant will have to operate at a minimum utilization level of 50% to meet debt covenants, say experts. As envisaged in the report, if plants operate at about 56% utilization levels, that leaves very little margin of safety and meagre returns for owners.
The utilization level estimate takes into account the coal-based capacity of 47,855 megawatts at various stages of construction, which are likely to be commissioned during 2017-22. Much of the capacity is being built by government-owned entities. So power offtake may not be a major issue for them. But they will restrict the opportunities available for the projects that are currently stalled, which are operating at sub-optimal utilization levels and without enough power offtake agreements.
“Given their must-run status and growing size, renewables will constrain the utilization levels of the thermal power sector,"" says Girishkumar Kadam, sector head and vice president at ratings firm Icra Ltd. What is required is demand growth. A sustained improvement in demand will ease the pressure, he adds. 
The government report also says that in an alternative scenario of higher demand, the overall utilization of coal-based power plants could see a noticeable improvement.
But the current subdued trends provide limited confidence about achieving higher demand. 
Also adding to the uncertainty are the indirect costs of renewable energy integration. As renewables gain prominence, thermal power plants will have to become flexible in terms of generation to balance grid demand. This involves substantial costs and investments.
While the government seems aware of the challenges, if demand does not see noticeable improvement, the pain in the thermal power sector may last for a long while."
50,2018-04-03,PowerGrid,"NASA hopes its Parker Solar Probe mission will help humans improve satellite communications, power grid issues, radiation exposures as well as astronaut safety

Mumbai:Outer space has always held a fascination for earthlings and scientists alike, whether it’s landing on the Moon, aspiring to live on Mars, creating a space nation called Asgardia, or simply having your name emblazoned on the Sun. 
Mumbai:Outer space has always held a fascination for earthlings and scientists alike, whether it’s landing on the Moon, aspiring to live on Mars, creating a space nation called Asgardia, or simply having your name emblazoned on the Sun.
For instance, if you would like to have your name on the Sun, all you need to do is sign up on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) website by 27 April. The space organisation touts this as the “hottest ticket"" on Earth this summer.
Once you sign up, you get a certificate which tells you that this ticket will include your name on a memory card that will fly aboard the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft, which is the size of a small car. Consequently, you will joining the ranks of people like William Shatner—a cultural icon for his portrayal of Capt. James T. Kirk in the original “Star Trek"" TV series—who have signed up.
The aim of this mission, according to NASA, is to “unlock the mysteries of the corona...(and) provide new data on solar activity and make critical contributions to our ability to forecast major space-weather events that impact life on Earth"". The reason: We live in the Sun’s atmosphere but do not understand everything about it such as why the corona is unstable, why do we have solar winds or magnetized material eruptions, or why the corona is hotter than the surface of the Sun itself.
NASA also hopes this mission will help humans improve satellite communications, power grid issues, pipeline erosion, radiation exposure on airline flights and astronaut safety.
To be launched anytime between 31 July and 19 August this year, NASA’s Parker Solar Probe Parker will swoop to within 4 million miles from the sun’s surface.
The Parker Solar Probe will use seven Venus flybys over nearly seven years to gradually shrink its orbit around the sun, “well within the orbit of Mercury and about eight times closer than any spacecraft has come before"", according to the website. At closest approach, the Parker Solar Probe will be hurtling around the sun at approximately 450,000 miles per hour—fast enough to get from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C., in one second.
The spacecraft will come as close as 6.2 million kilometers to the Sun. The spacecraft and instruments will be protected from the Sun’s heat by a 4.5 inch thick carbon-composite shield, which will need to withstand temperatures outside the spacecraft. At its closest approach to the sun, while the front of Parker Solar Probe’s solar shield faces temperatures approaching 1,400 degrees Celsius, the spacecraft’s payload will be near room temperature, according to NASA.
This is the first NASA mission that has been named for a living individual, Eugene Parker—the S. Chandrasekhar Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus, Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Chicago.
Born on 10 June, 1927, in Michigan, Parker has held faculty positions at the University of Chicago and at its Fermi Institute. Other than proposing how stars (including the Sun) emit energy—a phenomenon he called the solar wind, he described an entire complex system of plasmas, magnetic fields, and energetic particles that make up this phenomenon. Parker also theorized an explanation for the superheated solar atmosphere, the corona. More than half a century later, the Parker Solar Probe mission is expected to provide observations on Parker’s groundbreaking theories and ideas.
Elsewhere, a group of scientists and space experts based out of Russia, Romania, Canada and the US now want to make this myth a reality by offering Earthlings an opportunity to be part of a nation they have christened ‘Asgardia’. The are over 11,000 applications from India alone with more than 5,000 from metros like Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad and Kolkata till date. People from China have sent the most applications, followed by the US and Turkey.
Registration on the Asgardia website (asgardia.space), founded by the self-proclaimed Father of Asgardia—Igor Ashurbeyli who is also a businessman, scientist and founder of the Aerospace International Research Center in Vienna, will make you a part of the Asgardia community. However, Asgardia is not offering official citizenship because it is yet to be officially recognized as a nation. Once you are a citizen, you will get a passport like in any country.
Meanwhile, there are those who dare to aspire to fly to, and later even live on, Mars. For instance, the first round of the Mars One Astronaut selection programme, launched in 2013, received interest from 202,586 people from around the world wanting to be among the first human settlers on Mars. About 10% applications were from India. Mars One is currently preparing for Round Three and Four. 
Since Mars One’s launch in 2011, about $1 million has been raised, mainly through donations, sales of merchandise, private investments, astronaut applications, sponsorships & partnerships, and speaking engagements. 
In 2023, one team will make it as the first humans to ever to land on Mars and live there for the rest of their lives. It’s a one-way ticket, at least for now, given that this team can get stuck, or even die, on the red planet. This, even as these humans will face major issues such as space radiation, dust storms, lower gravity pull that can weaken their bones, likely infection from unknown microbes, and the effect of loneliness on the mind.
The human body is not made for Mars, which lacks an atmosphere to begin with. The gases in human cells could heat up and render us apart. That’s if the cosmic rays do not kill us with cancer by then since human beings won’t have much of a magnetic field to shield them from the rays.
To be sure, scientists are also building faster and stronger spacecraft and working on space suits that will be less cumbersome to walk in and can carry enough air pressure (one-third, typically) to prevent human beings from expanding and dying in space. Food, too, is being preserved in labs for years, and it remains edible and tasty. 
The fact is that much can change by 2023; so, one can only watch this space for further developments."

Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd, seen as the best utility stock till some time back, is getting the cold shoulder from investors. After delivering strong returns in fiscal year 2017 (FY17), the stock trailed the benchmark Sensex by a notable margin in FY18. 
Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd, seen as the best utility stock till some time back, is getting the cold shoulder from investors. After delivering strong returns in fiscal year 2017 (FY17), the stock trailed the benchmark Sensex by a notable margin in FY18.
What gives? 
The primary concern is the pace of asset addition, especially in the context of slowing investments in the interstate transmission sector where Power Grid has a strong foothold.
Validating investor concerns is a sharp slowdown in ordering activity by the company. Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd and Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd estimate the contract awards to have declined 67-68% in FY18 to the lowest level in the recent past (see chart). The ordering activity indicates the capex (capital expenditure) movement and likely pace of capacity additions in the future.
To recap, Power Grid earns a regulated return on equity (fixed by the regulator) on its commissioned projects, making asset addition crucial for earnings growth. Over the five years to FY17, the company capitalized Rs1.17 trillion and profits on an average expanded by 18%.
To be sure, Power Grid still has sizeable projects pending execution which should help maintain the earnings growth momentum for at least three years, points out Motilal Oswal Securities. However, the Street is looking beyond them.
With generation capex not happening in a big way (a major driver for transmission capex) and majority of the planned capex for interstate transmission infrastructure already incurred, analysts fear transmission capex may take a back seat, crimping opportunities for Power Grid.
The management tried to allay investor concerns by referring to opportunities in intra-state projects. But conviction among investors remains low. Poor financial discipline and lack of precedence about how states want to go about such investments is not helping.
Still, as studies by Motilal Oswal point out, even matured networks in developed countries need investments. India with increasing energy usage and changing energy mix can be no exception. “Experience from China and the US suggests that the transmission infrastructure continues increasing in tandem with generation (demand) growth. Renewable generation capacities, flexibility and redundancy requirements also aid transmission investment,"" Motilal Oswal Securities said in a note.
But what is uncertain is the timeline. “In our view, the situation (slowdown in transmission orders) is likely to remain the same, at least over the next few years, until demand catches up with the capacity being added,"" added Motilal Oswal Securities. 
Overall, while Power Grid has nothing to worry about in the immediate future, more clarity is required on long-term prospects and how the earnings growth momentum will pan out. This is weighing on the stock."

 New Delhi: All Indian villages now have access to electricity. The last village to be brought on the national power grid was Leisang village in the Senapati district of Manipur at 5.30pm on Saturday.  
 New Delhi: All Indian villages now have access to electricity. The last village to be brought on the national power grid was Leisang village in the Senapati district of Manipur at 5.30pm on Saturday. 
With the electricity now reaching all villages through the marque Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), it is being termed as a game changer moment for readying the country towards achieving universal electricity access. State run Rural Electrification corporation (REC) is the nodal agency appointed for executing the scheme.
According to the government data, all of India’s 597,464 census villages have been electrified. This assumes importance given that at the onset of Rs75,893 crore DDUGJY for village electrification under the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, there were 18,452 un-electrified census villages. During the project work it was found out that an additional 1275 villages also didn’t have electricity access. As of 28 April, all these villages have got electricity access either through the national grid or off grid solutions. Also, 1,236 villages are uninhabited and 35 have been notified as grazing reserves. 
“We are just absolutely thrilled, excited and delighted. We have fulfilled our mandate, our promise and the work allotted to us by the government and the honourable Prime Minister,"" P.V. Ramesh, chairman and managing director, REC told Mint.
This comes in the backdrop of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Independence Day speech on 15 August 2015 promising to electrify all un-electrified villages within 1000 days. The scheme will also help improve India’s per capita power consumption of around 1,200 kWh which is among the lowest in the world.
Aimed at providing round the clock power to rural households and adequate power to agricultural consumers, the DDUGJY involved feeder separation, strengthening of sub-transmission and distribution network, metering at all levels, village electrification, and setting up micro grid and off grid distribution network. 
The last village to be provided off grid electricity access was Pakol village in Churachandpur district of Manipur. 
The feeder separation for rural agricultural and village households will help stem the load shedding practice of distribution utilities and is expected to bring benefits such as improved agriculture yield and socio-economic development of the rural areas.
Given that a village is declared to be electrified if 10% of the households can access power along with public institutions such as schools, the panchayat office, health centres, dispensaries and community centres; household electrification remains the final frontier in providing electricity access.
Given its electoral potential, the next step now is to provide electricity connections to more than 40 million families in rural and urban areas by March 2019 under the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (Saubhagya), wherein all households will be targeted. 
The scheme funds the cost of last-mile connectivity to willing households and will provide the architecture through which the government seeks to reduce import of fossil fuels, boost underutilized power plants and meet its climate change commitments. By providing universal access to electricity under the scheme, the government plans to leverage the same to promote induction cooking, heating and charging electric vehicles, apart from the initial target of providing lighting.

The project is part of the Unified Real Time Dynamic State Measurement initiative. The project has been executed by GE T&D India, the listed entity of GE Power’s grid solutions business in India. 
This first stage will enable PowerGrid to monitor power flow across 110 substations in the northern grid and respond to fluctuations within a fraction of a second. This will be critical in addressing power demand-supply imbalances and ensuring grid stability benefitting from the integration of renewable energy with the grid, it said. 
When fully commissioned, this new Wams solution will be the world’s largest, comprising 1,184 Phasor Measurement Units and 34 control centres across India, 350 substations in the national grid. 
In July 2012, India suffered the world’s biggest power blackout due to a grid failure that affected more than 620 million people across 22 states. A committee of international experts formed by the government to minimise the possibility of grid failure recommended the implementation of a Wams solution across the country to measure the dynamic state of the grid and detect the onset of any unstable oscillation event. 
In January 2014, GE T&D (formerly Alstom T&D) was awarded a $52.2 million contract to install Wams across all five regional grids in north, south, east, west and northeast India."

Back home, according to Mint, the RBI monetary policy committee may raise policy rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday but is expected to maintain its neutral policy stance given the volatility in crude oil and food prices, economists say. Of the 15 economists surveyed by Mint, 12 expect RBI to raise its repo rate, the rate at which it lends to commercial banks, to 6.5%. Only three economists expect RBI to keep rates unchanged at 6.25%.
Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services Ltd, said that as expected, Q1 earnings season has started on a positive note. “On global front, trade tensions seems to be ease and we are seeing some positive momentum in domestic markets. In the near term the momentum will also depend on the outcome of RBI meet, were consensus is showing 25bps rate hike.

The US and its key Pacific allies on Sunday announced plans to build a $1.7 billion electricity grid in Papua New Guinea, in the latest effort to counter China’s growing influence in the region. 
The US and its key Pacific allies on Sunday announced plans to build a $1.7 billion electricity grid in Papua New Guinea, in the latest effort to counter China’s growing influence in the region.
The leaders of Australia, Japan and New Zealand joined US Vice President Mike Pence in signing the partnership accord, which aims to connect 70% of the population to electricity by 2030, up from 13% currently.
The project “is proof that America and our businesses are investing in this region as never before,"" Pence said at the signing ceremony in the capital, Port Moresby, with PNG Prime Minister Peter O’Neill, Australia’s Scott Morrison, Japan’s Shinzo Abe and New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern. “Be assured, to our allies gathered here and friends all across this region, that the United States is going to continue to work in ways"" to create “a brighter future,"" he said.
The investment is part of a wider push by the Trump administration to check China’s economic and diplomatic thrust into the Indo-Pacific region and offer an alternative to President Xi Jinping’s Belt-and-Road Initiative. Still, the sums of money offered by the US and its allies are dwarfed by Xi’s infrastructure lending plan, which Morgan Stanley says may total $1.3 trillion by 2027.
Addressing business leaders at an APEC CEO summit on Saturday, Pence said the US offered countries in the region a “better option"" than China. He warned against taking opaque Chinese loans, saying the US “doesn’t drown our partners in a sea of debt"" nor offer “a constricting belt or a one-way road.""
Xi defended the Belt-and-Road Initiative in his speech at APEC, saying it’s “not a trap as some people have labeled it.""
The US has been increasingly critical of China-backed infrastructure projects, saying many aren’t properly planned, financially sustainable and of questionable use. A new six-lane highway built by China in Port Moresby, for instance, has been dubbed the “road to nowhere"" in media reports.
The language in the electricity agreement signed Sunday is a nod to such criticism. The partnership is “intended to focus on the importance of principles-based, sustainable infrastructure development that is transparent, non-discriminatory, environmentally responsible, promotes fair and open competition, upholds robust standards, meets the genuine needs of the people of Papua New Guinea and avoids unsustainable debt burdens.""
At the leaders’ retreat earlier in the day, Abe said all infrastructure projects must conform with international standards of openness, transparency and economic viability.
O’Neill said the project to connect hundreds of thousands of families to the power grid would also include fiber-optic internet cables and would allow the nation to “participate in the global economy.""
Earlier this month, Australian Prime Minister Morrison unveiled an A$2 billion ($1.5 billion) infrastructure fund for the South Pacific, while New Zealand announced a NZ$10 million ($6.9 million) fund to help foster sporting and cultural engagement with Pacific island nations.
“It’s time to power up PNG, right across the country,"" Morrison said Sunday. “We will always be here to support the people of PNG and support their economic development.""
New Zealand said the estimated cost of the project was $1.7 billion."

Tokyo: ABB Ltd. and Hitachi Ltd. said they are in talks for a deal on power grids after the Swiss engineering giant was reported to be considering putting the division on the block earlier this year. ABB is in discussions with Hitachi to expand and re-define an existing strategic power-grid partnership between the two companies that dates to 2014, it said in a statement Wednesday. Hitachi made a similar statement after trading hours in Tokyo. It’s the first time either has commented on a potential transaction.

Hitachi made a similar statement after trading hours in Tokyo. It’s the first time either has commented on a potential transaction.
Nikkei reported Wednesday that the Japanese conglomerate is preparing to buy the business for as much as 800 billion yen ($7 billion). An agreement could be reached as early as this month after a final assessment, the newspaper said in a later update Thursday, after earlier saying it could be this week.
Hitachi shares declined 0.7 percent Thursday in Tokyo, after jumping as much as 2.4 percent in early trading. ABB rose 4 percent in Zurich trading Wednesday, the most in almost eight months, giving it a market value of about $43 billion.
A move by Hitachi to buy ABB’s power grids business would boost its position in the growing power transmission and distribution sector, and help it diversify away from its nuclear plant business. Chief Executive Officer Toshiaki Higashihara has been restructuring the diversified company by spinning off some assets. The company is vying to become one of the top grid companies in the world, according to a June presentation.
Considering Sale
Hitachi’s atomic reactor sales have dried up as the global nuclear industry is beset by overruns, heightened competition from natural gas and renewables, and stricter rules following the Fukushima disaster.
ABB was considering the sale of the power-grid business and discussing options with advisers, Bloomberg News reported in August. The division’s implied valuation was more than $10 billion following productivity and margin gains, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis the same month. The Financial Times reported last month that the unit was worth about $13 billion, citing analysts.
In Stages
ABB plans to spin off the unit into a separate company, Nikkei said Thursday. Hitachi aims to invest in this entity in stages and eventually make it a wholly owned subsidiary to help mitigate risks from changes in the business environment, it said. In its report late Wednesday, Nikkei had said Hitachi is expected to initially take a stake of about 50 percent before turning it into a subsidiary.
The sale of the business that makes power transformers, long distance electricity-transmission systems and energy storage units would shrink ABB by about a quarter. It would also vindicate activist Cevian Capital AB, which has been pushing for a breakup of the company for years and particularly a separation of that division. After conducting a strategic review, Chief Executive Officer Ulrich Spiesshofer defied the investor in 2016 by deciding to hang on to the laggard unit.
‘Cast in Stone’
The power grids business is worth “much, much more today"" than the $4 billion to $5 billion valuation that it was given in 2016, Spiesshofer told analysts in July, arguing that it was a good decision to have kept it in the portfolio. He simultaneously signaled a willingness to separate from the business, saying ABB’s portfolio isn’t “cast in stone.""
ABB’s most recent quarterly results published in October fell short of expectations as demand for industrial equipment slowed in the Middle East and the U.K. and an overhaul of power grids remained a work in progress.
The profit margin widened at the division to 10 percent, just enough to reach the bottom end of a goal, but significantly below that of the company’s other three businesses."

The Zurich-based company, which said the transaction put the power grids business’s enterprise value at $11 billion, also said on Monday it would be modifying the structure of its remaining businesses.

ABB will initially retain 19.9% of power grids, the company said, with the deal including an exit option at fair market value with a floor price set at 90% of the enterprise value, exercisable by ABB three years after closing.
Reuters previously reported that the two companies were in talks over a transaction. 
The acquisition would allow Hitachi to boost its global presence in the power grid industry, while ABB, which also makes industrial robots, wants to offload its least profitable division to focus on areas such as automation.
“Our four newly shaped businesses, each a global leader, will be well aligned to the way our customers operate and focus stronger on emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence,"" ABB chief executive Ulrich Spiesshofer said in a statement.
ABB’s power grids business employs 36,000 people and had sales of $10.4 billion last year. It had an operating profit margin of 10.0 percent in the third quarter, down 60 basis points from a year earlier.
The decision to sell power grids marks a U-turn for Spiesshofer, who decided to keep the business two years ago despite calls from some shareholders to sell.

39,2018-12-18,PowerGrid,"Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has suggested continuation of the 15.5% regulated return on equity (RoE) for power companies

Shares of NTPC Ltd and Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd gained 1.7% and 3.7% on Monday after the sector regulator proposed continuation of current incentives. In a positive surprise, the draft note from the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) suggests continuation of the 15.5% regulated return on equity (RoE) for generation and transmission companies. 
Shares of NTPC Ltd and Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd gained 1.7% and 3.7% on Monday after the sector regulator proposed continuation of current incentives. In a positive surprise, the draft note from the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) suggests continuation of the 15.5% regulated return on equity (RoE) for generation and transmission companies.
The regulated RoE has been maintained despite a noticeable reduction in interest rates. Tariff regulations are set every five years. When they were announced in early 2014, the benchmark 10-year government bond yield was at 8.8%. It’s now at 7.4%. Tracking this, most analysts were pencilling a cut in RoE. Despite the rise in bond yields in the past year, nobody was expecting continuation of the RoE at the current level.
With more than 90% of Power Grid’s profits driven by the regulated RoE, it benefits the most, said analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. Once commissioned, transmission projects have limited operating risks. So yield and profitability is more intertwined to finance costs and the regulated rate of return. So, while their interest costs have fallen, stable returns means margins will increase.
The scenario is slightly different for NTPC. Apart from the regulated RoE, utilization levels, operating efficiency and scope of cost recovery also influence NTPC’s earnings. Here, the regulator proposed tighter norms for fixed cost recovery on parameters such as fuel inventories and working capital finance cost.
On the other hand, the regulator did propose relief on the loss of the calorific value of coal during storage. Consequently, NTPC’s earnings are estimated to see only an incremental rise. “Our earnings per share estimates could rise 1% for FY20E-21E if this draft is finalized,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note on NTPC.
Even so, continuation of the current RoE and the lack of major earnings dilutive measures bring relief for investors. The last tariff regulation changed the basis for incentive calculation from plant availability to utilization levels, making a significant dent to NTPC’s earnings. From this perspective, the proposals are less detrimental and remove a major overhang for the stocks.
But they alone cannot aid the stocks for long. As earnings lagged estimates, the stocks underperformed the benchmark index Nifty over the past year. The key reasons for the underperformance persist, with NTPC continuing to face fuel constraints. The outlook for Power Grid is weighed down by reducing opportunities in the transmission & distribution segment. The promise of stable RoE notwithstanding, what is crucial is how these companies overcome these challenges."
38,2018-12-20,PowerGrid,"ABB India shares have fallen 6.7% since AAB AG's decision to sell its global power grid business to Japan's Hitachi for $11 billion

ABB India Ltd’s investors are jittery about the parent firm ABB AG’s decision to sell its global power grid business to Japan’s Hitachi for $11 billion. ABB India shares have fallen 6.7% since the news became public. Indian investors’ fears are not unfounded. After all, the power grid segment comprises 40% of the Indian arm’s annual revenue and 30% of Ebit (earnings before interest and taxes). Also, there is still scope for growth in the domestic power segment, where ABB had carved out a strong name for itself. And profit margins have been inching up over the last few quarters, even though they remain lower than some other segments.  
ABB India Ltd’s investors are jittery about the parent firm ABB AG’s decision to sell its global power grid business to Japan’s Hitachi for $11 billion. ABB India shares have fallen 6.7% since the news became public. Indian investors’ fears are not unfounded. After all, the power grid segment comprises 40% of the Indian arm’s annual revenue and 30% of Ebit (earnings before interest and taxes). Also, there is still scope for growth in the domestic power segment, where ABB had carved out a strong name for itself. And profit margins have been inching up over the last few quarters, even though they remain lower than some other segments. 
But then, investors must know that revenue and profits from the India operations are a minuscule part of the global business. At the group level, the Hitachi-ABB deal may be more meaningful.Announcing the deal, ABB spelt out a road map that would chart a new course in industrial automation, electrification, robotics and automation. Analysts said that in mature markets, the power transmission and distribution (T&D) business has limited incremental growth opportunities both in terms of orders and profits. From a technology-driven solutions business earlier, it is now a converter of raw material into finished goods, where there’s hardly any upside in margins.
Besides, shareholders of the parent firm would see near-term gains as it intends to return 100% of the estimated net cash proceeds from the sale to shareholders through a share buyback or another similar mechanism.
Considering the contribution of the India power grid business to the group is small, it is uncertain if such gains would accrue to domestic shareholders. From the perspective of restructuring, the group’s new focus areas are in a nascent growth stage in India. So, it may be a while before revenue and profit reach meaningful scale. But, will these business segments be able to make up for the exit of the power grids segment from revenue and profits? 
Fortunately, the new businesses have delivered better returns on capital employed, between 40-50%, compared to the T&D segment which hovers around 15%. But this does not ease concerns on volatility in profitability in these segments. 
According to Emkay Global Financial Services: “given the sluggish pick up in domestic private sector capex, we should expect near-term volatility in revenues and profitability in ABB India, especially if growth fails to accelerate in the industrial segments in the next 12-18 months"". 
ABB India’s share price of  ₹ 1,336 discounts the FY20 estimated earnings by 35 times. Indeed, the restructuring is well-timed and hopes to take advantage of new growth areas. But, it may take investors a while to have faith in the earnings prospects of the firm, in the absence of a key business segment."

35,2019-03-12,PowerGrid,"Power sector regulator CERC adopts a conciliatory tone on tariffs, removing an overhang for NTPCGovt approves an investment of  ₹31,000 crore in 4 power plants, announces sops for hydropower units

The power sector has benefitted from major policy changes that were announced last week. The policy changes can not only address pending investor concerns, but can also fast-track the recovery of the industry process. However, all of this depends on the policies being implemented well.
The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has adopted a conciliatory tone on tariffs, allowing compensation for the loss of coal heating value during storage and retained the current regulated return on equity. The regulations remove a key overhang for NTPC Ltd, which owns the highest number of regulated power plants.
“The final regulations addressed favourably key concerns on (1) lowering of regulated equity for assets beyond useful life, (2) compensation of gross calorific value loss during storage, (3) compensation for investment on pollution control equipment at 15.5%,"" analysts at Kotak institutional equities research said in a note.
The new regulations triggered a rise in the shares of NTPC and Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd, which hold a large number of regulated assets in the power transmission sector.
The second set of approvals came from the government. They involve sops for hydropower and measures to ease stress in thermal power plants.
The government approved an investment of  ₹31,000 crore in four power plants, which could in turn also improve project flow for capital goods companies. Another significant approval from the government was to allow greater flexibility for thermal power plants. Companies will now be allowed to seek coal linkage for selling power through short-term contracts.
Government entities will facilitate power purchase agreements (PPAs) through demand aggregation. These measures improve operational flexibility and can aid power plants that are facing financial stress.
Similarly, the proposal to term large hydropower projects (above 25 megawatts) as renewable energy and create a separate hydropower purchase obligation can give an impetus to hydro power usage.
The measures were much needed. Despite immense potential, the hydro sector is underdeveloped. Only 35% of the sector’s potential is developed till now, say analysts, pointing out that merely 11% of India’s electricity needs are met by hydropower plants. Even so, investors are not enthused. Shares of NHPC Ltd, the large developer of hydropower projects in India, have gained only around 2% in the last two trading sessions.
The subdued response reflects investors’ scepticism about implementation of the policies as the challenge in the hydropower sector is execution. Several NHPC projects have seen inordinate delays and have exceeded budgeted costs. This has pushed up tariffs and burdened users. As such, unless execution in the sector gathers pace, the latest push from the government will be of little help. 
“While it is a long term positive for the hydro sector, actual execution pace/support from government will determine pace of investments in this space,"" JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd said in a note.
Similarly, flexibility in fuel linkage will mean little for the thermal sector if actual coal production in India does not pick up.
Also, flexibility to renounce PPAs with defaulting power distribution companies can only worsen the generators’ situation, given the scarcity of large electricity contracts. The final tariff regulations remove a key overhang over the power sector. However, for the government’s policy push to yield noticeable benefits, much depends on execution."
34,2019-03-12,PowerGrid,"The new public sector unit will focus on aggregating electricity demand in the country and cater to it It is being set up at a time when the state owned discoms are struggling with their finances on account of losses and borrowings

New Delhi: State run NTPC Ltd and Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd (PGCIL) may shortly set up the National Electricity Distribution Company (NCDC)—a pan-India power distribution firm in an equal joint venture, said government officials aware of the development.
The new public sector unit will focus on aggregating electricity demand in the country and cater to it and may also take over weak electricity distribution utilities. It will comprise of cadre on deputation from other public sector units and is being set up at a time when the state owned distribution companies (discoms) are struggling with their finances on account of losses and borrowings. In such a situation, a national electricity distribution company can procure electricity at competitive rates and help address the issue of stressed assets in power generation.
“The contours of NCDC have been discussed upon and it will be set up by NTPC and PGCIL as a 50:50 JV,"" said a government official cited above requesting anonymity.
The distribution utilities have been beleaguered by issues such as low collection, increase in power purchase cost, inadequate electricity tariff hike, inadequate subsidy disbursement, and increasing government department dues. In turn, the poor payment records of discoms have not only adversely affected power generation companies, but has contributed in causing stress in the banking sector as well.
“Setting up the NCDC doesn’t require a cabinet approval,"" said the first government official cited above.
The plan is to set NCDC up along the lines of Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL), which is under the administrative control of the power ministry. EESL is an energy services company, jointly operated by four state run firms—NTPC Ltd, Power Finance Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation and Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd.
Bloomberg news wire agency on 26 February reported about NTPC and PGCIL being roped in for setting up the National Electricity Distribution Company (NCDC).
The government has also been working on a radical plan to separate the so-called carriage and content operations of existing power distribution companies, which was earlier proposed by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. Carriage refers to the distribution aspect and content to electricity. In industry parlance, these are known as “wire"" and “supply"". The separation will allow people and companies in India buy electricity from a power company of their choice, and have it supplied to them by the distribution network that services the neighbourhood in which they live.
The distribution sector holds the key to the long-term fortunes of the power sector. However, distribution companies have so far been the weakest link in the electricity value chain. Government data showed in the first half of FY19, losses rose to Rs15,080 crore from Rs11,071 crore a year earlier. This despite the discoms’ financial losses narrowing from Rs51,480 crore in FY16 to Rs15,049 crore in FY18. Consequentially discoms have not been making timely payments to generation firms and owe Rs36,134 crore to generation companies as of 31 January.
“The distribution sector is in a mess and hence the need for a National Electricity Distribution Company,"" said a second government official aware of the development cited above who also didn’t want to be named.
Also, rising non-performing assets (NPAs) in the power sector has been a major concern. The NPAs account for around 5.9% of the banking sector’s total outstanding advances of  ₹4.73 trillion, according to the Economic Survey 2016-17 released in August. However, there has been a recent upturn in power demand due to the spread of household electrification, increased supply to agricultural consumers, low hydropower generation and extended summers. Requisitioning of additional power by discoms has also led to a short-term hike in electricity prices.
Queries emailed to spokespersons of NTPC, PGCIL and power ministry on Friday evening remained unanswered.
As on September 2015, the total debt of all state owned discoms was estimated to be around Rs2.45 trillion, with Rs0.8 lakh crore serviced by the states. Also, the annual discom losses in FY16, FY17 and FY18 were funded through borrowings."
33,2019-03-15,PowerGrid,"Tata Power-DDL is working on a pilot project that can be scaled up for isolating such important installations and services In India, only Mumbai and Kolkata have such an ‘islanding’ infrastructure in place

New Delhi: In what may help protect the national capital’s critical and strategic infrastructure from a electricity grid failure, Tata Power Delhi Distribution (Tata Power-DDL) is working on a pilot project that can be scaled up for isolating such important installations and services, said a top company executive.
The European Union funded pilot project in the works by Tata Power-DDL is in collaboration with French utility Enedis, Schneider Electric, data analytics firm Odit-e and Helsinki based VaasaETT for setting up defence mechanisms such as ‘islanding’ by leveraging solar power and battery storage.
Such islands would isolate the fallout of a grid disturbance, restricting it to a particular region and also allow essential service such as water-supplies, telecom infrastructure, hospitals, airports or metro rail network to function.
“There are different levels of islanding. When a grid collapses we want internal generation of Delhi to supply power to a part of Delhi; wherein electricity demand is equivalent to what gets generated by Delhi itself. That right now is not possible because of issues such as availability of technology and systems not been designed for isolating themselves,"" said Sanjay Banga, chief executive officer of Tata Power-DDL in an interview on Thursday.
A grid collapse is the worst-case scenario for any country or a utility with Indian generation and transmission projects being on the terrorist threat list. In India, only Mumbai and Kolkata have such an ‘islanding’ infrastructure in place.
According to Tata Power-DDL, in such a case microgrids allow for intentional islanding, wherein in case of an outage, a microgrid controller disconnects the local circuit from the grid on a dedicated switch and forces the distributed generator to power the entire local load.
“Going forward, what we are trying to in this project is at a small level of a distribution transformer wherein the demand is 400 kWh catering to around 1000 households. We are trying to create an island there, where the batteries would be there along with solar generation. In case of any eventuality, this will be able to sustain the load of that distribution transformer,"" Banga said.
This comes in the backdrop of India’s grid collapse in 2012. India’s worst blackout left nearly 620 million people across 19 states and three Union territories without electricity for hours together when the northern grid collapsed on 31 July 2012, and, in a wider blackout, the northern, eastern and north-eastern grids broke down on 1 August 2012.
“It is a technology that we want to prove that if something goes wrong, can we have alternate source of energy to feed it by using a renewable energy source or microgrids…This is a concept that we want to prove that self-healing can be done. Also, to make some critical consumers as pockets of islanding,"" Banga said and added, “Once this is proven then we will see what is to be done?""
“It has not been tried in India so far. This is an European Union scheme in which they have selected Tata Power-DDL to do it for few distribution transformers,"" Banga added.
An agreement for the €10.7 million ‘Smart Grid Demonstrator’ will be inked on Friday in New Delhi, with it also being aimed towards maximising local consumption of green energy and effective demand side management. It is expected to start in May 2019 and be completed by October 2022.
With around 25,000 such transformers, Delhi has an average power demand of 4000 MW, with its peak electricity demand touching 6500 MW. In comparison, areas under Tata Power-DDL have an average demand of 1250 MW and a peak demand of 1960 MW."

The BSE Capital Goods index has risen 13% from its lows in mid-February, slightly more than the 10.5% gain in the BSE 500 index. This is despite the recent news on weak order flows in the run-up to the general elections and the sluggish capital expenditure (capex) cycle.
The optimism on the Street is riding on the hope of strong execution in the March quarter. Typically, this is the best quarter in any fiscal year for the sector. Besides, companies in the sector are sitting on decent order books of 18-24 months of their current revenue.
Most brokerage firms forecast a 12-15% year-on-year revenue growth for capital goods firms. The larger among them such as Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) could do better. That apart, power transmission and distribution firms that have bagged orders from both Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd and state distribution companies are also expected to report strong revenue growth.
Barring some strain on the working capital front, most firms should also clock decent double-digit growth in profits.
However, this is not to say that capital goods firms are on safe terrain. Order flow momentum, which is of utmost importance to sustain revenue growth, has been woefully low for some firms. According to ICICI Securities Ltd, “The announced order inflow for our coverage universe (ex-L&T) at  ₹12,500 crore had witnessed a reduction compared to  ₹22,400 crore in Q3FY19."" That said, short-cycle orders may trickle in by virtue of energy-efficiency related capex in cement, steel and energy-intensive industries.
The moot question is: Will the rise in capital goods share prices sustain?
It is clear that order flows from government bodies will be low-key until the elections. Recent data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) paint a gloomy picture on private sector capex too. “In 2017-18, net fixed asset investments of non-finance companies grew by 7.9% in nominal terms. At the same time, investments in plant and machinery grew by a significantly lower 6.8%. These were the lowest growth rates since 2004-05 in 13 years,"" said a media release dated 25 March. Decent execution of existing order books means that utilization levels could drop in ome industries, which actually makes the case for capex being weak in the near term. This is especially so, given that demand hasn’t really caught up.
In other words, investors must recognize that revenue growth in Q4 FY19 will be driven by the strong order book of the past. It would be prudent to observe how order flows shape up after the polls, which will give a more realistic picture of the health of the capital goods sector."

After delivering handsome returns in 2016, shares of Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd began trailing the broader markets from mid-2017. Compared to a 15% rise in the Nifty 500 index, the stock lost 8% from July 2017.
The underperformance coincides with the moderation in asset growth. Capitalization, which reflects the project addition, eased from a peak of about  ₹31,000 crore per annum in FY16-17 to  ₹27,928 crore in FY18. The company aims to capitalize projects worth  ₹26,000 crore in FY19.
As India nears universal electricity access, reducing the need for large investments in interstate transmission lines, many fear Power Grid is past its prime asset-addition phase. The company has projects of  ₹77,000 crore, providing a good asset-addition pipeline for two-three years.
Further, the thrust on renewable energy and integration of green energy projects will require investments in the transmission sector, providing business visibility in the near term. However, investment requirement is seen to be much lower than what the industry saw in yesteryears. This is when India added copious amounts of conventional power capacities.
Further, projects are increasingly being awarded through competitive bidding. This generally crimps returns vis-à-vis the contracts received through the government and public sector entities. These concerns are weighing on the stock. Analysts see capital expenditure easing steadily, slowing capitalization and asset addition.

These concerns are weighing on the stock. Analysts see capital expenditure easing steadily, slowing capitalization and asset addition.
Even then, one cannot deny that Power Grid’s earnings will continue to expand. The current project pipeline ensures growth for at least two years, albeit at a slower pace. Importantly, the company works on a regulated business model, where it is assured of fixed return on equity on commissioned projects. The reduced capex intensity means the company will see good cash flows.
Power Grid’s return on equity of 16-17% is among the best in companies that work on a regulated business model, according to analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. At the current valuation of 1.5 times FY20 price-to-book value, the stock offers good dividend yield.
“If we were to assume no growth after FY20, which means profit after tax is available for dividend distribution, the stock is trading at an attractive dividend yield of approximately 11-12% for an assured-return business model, while revenues are backed by state-guarantees (government securities yield is ~7 to 8%),"" said analysts at the brokerage firm.
The catch, of course, is the payout policy. Articulation of the cash-deployment road map in a reduced capital expenditure context will be key. With the company increasingly participating in competitive bidding, returns from new projects will also be key variable to track. Lower returns compared to the existing asset base will dilute the returns and heighten Power Grid investors’ concerns."

Mumbai: India Grid Trust (IndiGrid), an infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) sponsored by Sterlite Power Grid Ventures Ltd, will raise  ₹2,560 crore of primary capital through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) beginning Wednesday, said a person aware of the development.
Of this, private equity investors KKR and GIC will subscribe up to  ₹2,060 crore of the issue, the person said.
InvITs manage income-generating infrastructure assets, offering investors regular yields and a liquid way to invest in infrastructure projects.
KKR chose not to comment about a QIP. An email sent to GIC did not elicit any response.
In December, Mint had reported that IndiGrid had started roadshows to raise  ₹2,500-3,000 crore in fresh capital and had appointed investment banks Citi, Axis Capital and Edelweiss to manage the process.
The proceeds of the QIP will be used to acquire transmission assets. IndiGrid has signed agreements to acquire five more transmission assets from Sterlite Power worth  ₹11,500 crore, subject to the approval of unitholders, the person mentioned above said on condition of anonymity.
IndiGrid owns 10 independent revenue-generating assets, including eight transmission lines of 1,936 circuit km and two substations of 6,000MVA capacity. With these acquisitions, IndiGrid’s portfolio will increase from six projects to 11 over the next two years and assets under management (AUM) will grow from  ₹5,300 crore to  ₹17,000 crore after completion of the entire transaction, the person said. IndiGrid aims to be a leading yield vehicle in Asia and is targeting to reach a target of  ₹30,000 crore in AUM by 2022.
KKR has also expressed intent to be a sponsor of IndiGrid alongside Sterlite Power, after which KKR and Sterlite Power will co-own SIML, the investment manager of IndiGrid.
The deal highlights KKR’s bullishness on the Indian and Asian infrastructure sector.
Mint first reported in November that KKR plans to raise a $1.5-2 billion Asia-dedicated infrastructure fund. So far, it has only raised global infrastructure funds and this will be the first time that a separate fund with a geographical focus will be raised for infrastructure investments. In September, KKR had said it has raised $7.4 billion for its third global infrastructure fund, focused on investments in Organisation for Economic and Co-operation and Development nations. The firm had raised $3.1 billion for its second infrastructure fund.
Last year, the American PE investor had acquired 60% stake in environmental solution provider Ramky Enviro Engineers Ltd (REEL) for $530 million. This is the largest buyout by a private equity firm in India’s environmental services sector. REEL operates the country’s largest waste-to-energy plant in Delhi with a power generating capacity of 24 megawatts (MW) by converting 1,500 tonnes of waste every day.
Foreign investor interest in Indian InvITs is also evidenced by Canadian pension fund Ontario Municipal Employees’ Retirement System (OMERS) investment of $121 million for a 22.4% stake in IndInfravit Trust, an infrastructure investment trust (InvIT), sponsored by L&T Infrastructure Development Projects Ltd, marking its first infrastructure deal in India.
Even Reliance Jio, India’s second largest telecom operator by subscriber base, is looking to pare debt by monetizing its fibre and tower assets through the infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) route. The Economic Times reported on Tuesday that Canadian pension funds CPPIB, OMERS, British Columbia Pension Corporation (BCPC), Middle East sovereign wealth funds such as Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), investment companies such as Mubadala and Singapore’s GIC, and European insurance giant Allianz SE are among investors eyeing stakes in the two InvITs."

Mumbai: The Andhra Pradesh government has received five bids for building India’s largest energy storage project. The bidders include renewable energy firms Greenko and private power transmission company Sterlite Power, a person said, requesting anonymity.
In February, Transmission Corp. of Andhra Pradesh Ltd (APTransco) had invited expressions of interest from companies for long-term supply of a power storage solution that could be connected to the state electricity grid. The requirement was to build an “energy shifting solution"" of 400MW and 8 hours of discharge per day (3,200 MWh) that would be operational from October 2021.
Since peak power generation and consumption happen at different times of the day, grids use “energy shifting solutions"" to regulate the flow of electricity, move power away from the grid during periods of low demand and back to the grid when consumption picks up. APTransco’s tender wants a cost-effective energy shifting solution for grid stability. The discom will pay fixed annual charges to the developer.
According to the person cited above, out of the five bids, two are for pumped storage, a solution that stores and generates energy by moving water between two reservoirs of different elevations, while the other three bids are solutions using batteries.
Both Greenko and APTransco did not respond to emails seeking comment. A spokesperson for Sterlite Power said: “We do not comment on ongoing bids or speculations. (But) the energy storage solutions help by storing energy at times of high RE (renewable energy) generation and returning it to the grid at time of peak demand...It’s high time for India to adopt the same."""

Both the equity benchmark indices ended positive for the third consecutive day.
Sensex closed 0.17% higher at 39749.73 points, while the NSE Nifty 50 index rose 0.03% to 11,928.75 points.
In the broader market also ended the day on a positive note as both the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices advanced by 0.09% and 0.41% respectively.
According to Bloomberg economists, estimate GDP will show growth in the three months through March was the slowest in almost two years.
""Post euphoria on Election outcome, markets to consolidate and shift its focus towards macro data, the onset of monsoon, events like RBI Monetary Policy slated next week (6 June) and also on Union budget. On global front, the US-China trade wars along with rising in oil price will determine the further trend of the market,"" said Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.
""We continue to remain optimistic on equity markets, as the new government is expected to continue with its infrastructure thrust and focus on rural schemes. We prefer Private banking stocks,"" Jani added.
Sector-wise, BSE Information Technology took the pole position rising 1.64% followed by Teck (1.36%), Energy (1.17%), Metal (0.95%) and Oil and Gas (0.55%). However, BSE Telecom was the biggest losing sector falling 1.16%.
Yes Bank, Coal India, Infosys, Power Grid and Vedanta were the most contributing stocks on BSE surging as much as 4.06%.

26,2019-05-30,PowerGrid,"The firm plans to incur capital expenditure of  ₹15,000 crore in FY20, less than  ₹21,800 crore it spent last year﻿The company reported a 52% jump in profit and revenue gained 18% for the March quarter

Steady financial performance notwithstanding, shares of Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd trailed behind broader markets by a big margin. The stock lost about 9% in the past year in contrast to the 5% rise in the Nifty 500 index.
The company reported a 52% jump in profit and revenue gained 18% for the March quarter. But the stock was little changed on Thursday as investors seem to take no cheer from this.
That is because the performance is partly supported by prior period income. Weighing on the Power Grid stock is weakening growth outlook. Project starts or capitalization during the year dropped 29% at the stand-alone level, showed data compiled by Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.
Capitalization is down 17% during the March quarter and a slowing capitalization doesn’t augur well for growth momentum.
The company expects to capitalize projects worth  ₹20,000-24,000 crore in FY20, more than the  ₹19,200 crore worth of projects it capitalized in the year gone by. But outlook beyond the current year is not benign. Power Grid plans to incur capital expenditure, a lead indicator for project additions, of  ₹15,000 crore in FY20 less than  ₹21,800 crore it spent last year. This indicates a noticeable slowdown in project additions in FY21.
The reduced intensity in capital expenditure is driving Power Grid to give more cash to shareholders. Dividend payment in FY19 was 58% higher than FY18 and hence dividend yield now stands at 4.5%.
In a conference call with analysts, the company said it does not plan to add more cash to its books and would rather pare debt or give dividends. “Clearly, the reduction in capex outlay has resulted in increased dividend payout,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note. “Though the near-term slowdown in capex/capitalization will lower profit growth, valuation/yield remain attractive.""
But the Power Grid stock is cutting no ice with investors even though valuations at 1.5 times estimated book value of FY20 are not expensive. That said, for growth-focused investors all is not over. The current work in hand (projects worth  ₹61,000 crore) should hold Power Grid in good stead for at least two years.
Further, the country continues to see sizeable investments in the transmission sector. Renewable energy projects are seen as a major opportunity and Power Grid aims to capture a chunk of the estimated  ₹19,000 crore worth of project awards for the sector. These projects are expected to be awarded over the next three-six months.
“Projects in hand impart healthy two years’ earnings visibility, though new project awards will be a key variable,"" analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a note. Perhaps a healthy order win could fire up the Power Grid stock in the coming months."

India’s largest green energy company, ReNew Power Ltd., is considering raising funds through asset sales, after shelving plans for an initial public offering.
Backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the company has renewable assets of over 7 gigawatts, of which more than 4 gigawatts are operational. It makes sense to sell some assets when “the ability to execute and the opportunity to grow"" exceeds the ability to finance projects and the company could “sell assets outright"" or have co-investors, ReNew Power Chairman Sumant Sinha said, without elaborating on the amount of capacity sale or the funds being targeted.
“They can co-invest along with us or buy our assets while we continue to run those assets,"" he said in an interview in his office in Gurugram near New Delhi. ReNew Power will look at either creating its own infrastructure investment trust, or InVit, to raise funds or use an existing structure.
The company isn’t alone in withdrawing plans for an IPO or considering an infrastructure investment trust. Rival solar power developer Acme Solar Holdings Pvt. last year put on hold a planned public listing and said it will opt instead to raise funds through a private InVit, citing turbulence in the South Asian country’s stock market and uncertainty over renewable energy policies.
“There is no specific plan for the IPO right now,"" Sinha said “Elections are now behind us. We’ll have to see how markets evolve, what the government does, there are these key issues to be addressed about how the sector can be in a healthier position.""
Industry groups have said the viability of Indian wind and solar projects is being tested by tariff caps set during the auction process, the preferred method for attaining Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious goal of installing 175 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2022. While the auctions have enabled distributors to lock in some of the cheapest green power rates in the world, industry groups said it’s leading to unsustainably low electricity prices.
Transmission Foray
The company is now looking to enter the transmission business, with plans to bid for government tenders from June, Sinha said. ReNew Power has qualified for 10 bids and most transmission projects being auctioned are related to the green corridor, a government project for transmitting power from renewable-rich states and connecting clean power capacity, he said.
ReNew has appointed Ajay Bhardwaj, the former head of rival transmission infrastructure builder Sterlite Power Grid Ventures Ltd., as the president of its new business, Sinha said.
Goldman Sachs, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Green Rock, hold 48.62%, 16.22% and 15.92%, respectively, of ReNew Power’s paid-up share capital as of May 2018.
Goldman Sachs, CPPIB and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, are investing $300 million in ReNew Power via a rights issue, the Economic Times reported Friday, citing people with knowledge of the matter it didn’t identify. The proceeds will be used to finance growth and repay existing debt, it said. ReNew Power officials declined to comment.
The company’s unit, Renew Solar Power Pvt., has bonds worth 1 billion rupees maturing in November, and Renew Power has 8.5 billion rupees of securities maturing in March 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Ratings assessor S&P Global Ratings assigned a ‘BB-’ long-term issuer credit rating to ReNew Power in May, saying the action reflects the company’s relatively weaker receivables profile compared with peers and expects leverage to remain high due to debt-funded capital expenditure on capacity additions."

Mumbai: The MP Power Management Company, the Madhya Pradesh government’s holding firm for three power distribution companies (discoms) in the state, has invited expressions of interest from private firms for setting up 500 MW with 8 hours of continuous discharge of grid-scale energy storage service and a storage manufacturing facility in the state.
In its tender document, the MP Power Management Company said “grid-scale energy storage is expected to play a pivotal role in providing ancillary services, balancing real-time demand and supply, integrating renewable energy and improving stability of electricity grids."" The document goes on to add that its energy storage options could be in the form of chemical batteries (lithium ion, advanced lead acid, sodium sulphur, flow batteries), pumped storage hydro, compressed air energy storage, flywheels or other forms of storage.
Out of Madhya Pradesh’s total installed power capacity of 19,796 MW as of January 2019, 3,827 MW (19.3%) are from renewable energy sources.
The tender invites expressions of interest from domestic and global players to discuss the solutions possible, including deployment of microgrids, for grid stabilisation and energy forecasting. The state has given bidders until August 2 to submit their proposals.
After a lull, grid-scale storage projects are starting to pick up again. In May, Mint reported that the Andhra Pradesh government had received five bids for building India’s largest energy storage project so far, of 400 MW and 8 hours of discharge per day, in the state. The bidders include renewable energy firms Greenko and private power transmission company Sterlite Power."
23,2019-06-12,PowerGrid,"A power sector council has been proposed to address issues between the centre and state governmentsThe power ministry plans to set up a pan-India distributor

New Delhi: The Union power ministry has proposed a “power sector council"" to address issues between the Union and state governments as part of the ministry’s 100-day action plan for the second term of the Narendra Modi government.
With power being on the concurrent list of the Constitution, many sectoral issues get stuck due to differences between the Union and the state governments. The council will help the Union and the state governments work on a common agenda and ensure round-the-clock power to all, a government official, who is part of the exercise, said on condition of anonymity.
“The need for coordination between the centre and states in the power sector has never been more critical. And this must be done in line with the GST Council, involving the finance ministers of states and the centre,"" said Debasish Mishra, partner at Deloitte India.
According to information reviewed by Mint, the proposed council will comprise ministers and bureaucrats at various levels and will be a forum for collective decision-making.
Other proposals by the power ministry include separation of the wire and electricity supply business, setting up of a pan-India power distributor and building renewable energy management centres (REMCs) across India.
The power ministry has also proposed limiting Power Finance Corp.’s and REC Ltd’s lending to state electricity distribution companies (discoms) except for capital expenditure projects, setting up public charging stations for electric vehicles and seeking the approval of the cabinet committee on economic affairs for pre-construction activities for the strategically important Dibang hydropower project in Arunachal Pradesh.
India and China have a dispute over the diversion of the Brahmaputra river, which originates in Tibet. Even as India explores a diplomatic option, accelerating hydroelectric projects such as Dibang would give it user rights.
The proposed power council will be headed by the Union power minister and have the Union finance minister and power ministers of all states as members. It will be assisted by a standing committee headed by the Union power secretary, with finance secretaries, principal secretaries (energy) and principal secretaries (finance) of all states as its members.
The Modi administration’s plan to provide uninterrupted power supply to households in its second term was articulated by power minister Raj Kumar Singh after he assumed office. With electricity being on the concurrent list, it is for states to ensure reliable and affordable electricity to consumers.
To be sure, the decision-making of the so-called power sector council would preclude legislative and regulatory domains of the centre and states.
“The separation of carriage and content will be akin to the telecom revolution in India,"" said the government official cited earlier.
The previous National Democratic Alliance government had promoted the separation of the carriage and content operations of existing discoms. Carriage refers to the distribution aspect and content to power. The separation will allow consumers in India to buy electricity from a company of their choice.
The ministry’s 100-day plan also includes setting up a national electricity distribution company, proposed as an equal joint venture (JV) between state-run NTPC Ltd and Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd. The proposed firm may enter into JVs with the state discoms and help bridge market and credit risks at a time when state-owned discoms are struggling with their finances on account of losses and borrowings.
Queries emailed to a power ministry spokesperson on 6 June remained unanswered.
Interestingly, of India’s installed capacity of 349 gigawatts (GW), the peak demand is only 177GW. Peak electricity demand has been low due to precarious finances of some discoms, which prevents them from procuring the required power."
22,2019-07-02,PowerGrid,"The government plans to set up a national electricity distribution company (NEDC) as an equal joint JV between the state-run NTPC Ltd and Power Grid Corp. of India LtdIt will undertake electricity distribution by forming JVs with state-owned discoms and help bridge market and credit risks

1) What are NEDC’s objectives?
The aim of the NTPC-PGCIL joint venture is to act as a model discom, thereby improving efficiency and helping resolve the vexed issue of rising non-performing assets in the power sector. Given that electricity is on the concurrent list, NEDC will not only act as a nodal agency for implementing the Union government’s scheme in the distribution sector, but also serve as an implementation agency for state discoms. It will act as the beachhead for introducing distribution sector reforms and help bring new tech, including smart grids, big data and analytics, into fund-starved discoms.
2) Why is it needed?
The need for a pan-India discom was felt given that distribution will be key to the long-term fortunes of the power sector. Discoms have so far been the weakest link in the electricity value chain. Poor payment records of state-owned discoms have not only adversely affected power generation companies, but have also contributed to stress in the banking sector. In such a situation, a national electricity distribution company can be a precursor to “carriage and content operations"" and be used for asset and network management. It may also procure electricity at competitive rates and help address the issue of stressed assets in power generation.
3) How will it work?
Given that NEDC will have to seek licences from the respective state electricity regulatory commissions, the process will be tedious and unfeasible as this will create an adversarial relationship with the state discoms. The game plan is to form JVs with existing discoms, thus leveraging the experience of state-run firms such as NTPC and PGCIL to improve efficiency in areas such as system and network operations, asset management, and operations and maintenance. The state-run units can leverage their technical expertise, competence and access to cheaper funds to act as a change agent in electricity distribution.
4) What are the benefits?
Better functioning of state discoms will help reduce overall transmission and commercial losses, and help meet the increased power demand due to electricity connections provided to rural and urban households under the Saubhagya scheme. It will help expedite the plan to separate the “carriage and content operations"" of discoms, letting people and companies in India buy electricity from a firm of their choice.
5) What is the trigger for such a joint venture?
The government is trying to step up efforts to supply 24x7 power to all. But this can’t be achieved unless there is a robust electricity distribution space. The poor financial health of discoms has led to delayed payments to generation utilities. Hence, the government has made it mandatory for state discoms to offer letters of credit as part of the payment security mechanisms in power purchase pacts to ensure timely payments by states to generation utilities."

 Union Minster R K Singh on Sunday said the aim of the Centre is to have ""One Nation One Grid"" and pay damages to consumers in case of load sheddings.
The government will soon go ahead with structural reforms to achieve the objective of ""One Nation One Grid"", Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said in her budget speech earlier this month.
""The government will pay damages (to consumers) if load sheddings happen,"" the Union Power Minister said without elaborating.
The ministry would seek the Union Cabinet's nod for the power tariff policy in next few days, which would provide for penalty for unscheduled power cuts except in the case of technical faults or act of God (natural calamities), Singh had said on the day of tabling the Union budget.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced in the budget that a package for the power sector would soon be brought by the government.
The government intends to provide '24X7 Power to All' at affordable rates. Therefore, there would be a provision in the tariff to cap transmission and distribution losses. Once the tariff policy is approved, the distribution companies would not be allowed to pass on these losses beyond 15%.
After inaugurating the Power Grid Vishram Sadan at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) here Sunday, Singh said, ""Before 2014, many people whose houses did not have electricity used to think whether they would ever get it. Now these deprived people have electricity at their homes.""
The Centre is focusing on Vishram Sadans (rest houses) where patients from poor economical background would be treated, he said.
The Power Grid Corporation of India Limited has the authority to construct such Vishram Sadans, he said.
Singh suggested that a 100-bed Vishram Sadan be constructed at the RIMS.
A trauma centre was also inaugurated at the RIMS."

New Delhi: Sterlite Power Grid Ventures Ltd., one of India’s biggest private transmission companies, sees a $35 billion investment opportunity into grid-connected energy storage projects in the country over the next decade to support government renewables targets.
Chief Executive Officer Pratik Agarwal said in an interview in New Delhi that he expects central and state governments to issue battery tenders totaling several gigawatts of capacity by no later than the end of next year.
“We as a transmission company are very keen to enter this space,"" he said. Sterlite submitted bids for two projects in the US this February, he said.

New Delhi: With the scrapping of the Article 370 and Article 35A in Jammu and Kashmir by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, industry captains believe that hydropower is back in play in India’s energy mix. Also, Arunachal Pradesh that had awarded a raft of projects to private companies has now approached state run NHPC Ltd to execute them.
Hydropower projects, often located in remote regions, are crucial to stabilize the grid as India looks to add 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity. However, given the issues regarding resettlement of the affected population and infrastructure development, many projects have been stuck and delayed leading to a decreasing share of hydropower in the country’s energy mix.
“A great activity time for hydropower is foreseen by us,"" said Balraj Joshi, chairman and managing director of state run NHPC Ltd, India’s largest hydropower generation firm and added, “Coal fire projects are on their way out slowly. The government of India has recognized the need for boosting hydro power.""
With nearly 100 GW of electricity potential in India’s rivers lying untapped because of high tariffs, the NDA government has approved a slew of measures under the hydro policy to make it competitive. Apart from J&K, some of the new hydropower projects in India on which the work is expected to start in full swing include; 2,880 MW Dibang and 2,000 MW Lower Subansiri hydropower projects in Arunachal Pradesh and 500 MW Teesta-VI project in Sikkim.
Hydropower projects are ideal to meet peak load compared to thermal power plants. These plants can be swiftly turned on and off, compared to thermal power plants, helping the grid withstand fluctuations caused by intermittent supplies from solar and wind.
At present, India has an installed power-generation capacity of 357,875 megawatts (MW), of which around 13% or 45,399.22 MW is generated through hydroelectric power projects. Executing a hydropower project is time-consuming and tedious and involves a thorough survey and investigation and detailed project reports.
As part of the new hydro policy, large hydropower projects have been declared as renewable energy sources, making them a part of the renewable purchase obligation, which requires power discoms to buy a fixed amount of renewable energy to cut reliance on fossil fuels.
Jammu and Kashmir: a new hydropower playbook
In what may expedite strategically important hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir following the proposed reorganization of the terror-hit state, India plans to fully utilize its share of water under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960. According to the Indus Waters Treaty, whoever builds the project first will have the first rights on the river waters.
Mint reported on 7 August about India looking to speed up NHPC Ltd’s hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir following reorganization of the state that has been hit by an unprecedented cycle of violence in recent years. The task is seen as strategically vital in the context of China developing the controversial China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of its showpiece One Belt One Road (OBOR) infrastructure initiative.
NHPC Ltd is the main supplier of electricity to J&K and the largest investor in the state. It has 2339 MW under operation in the state and plans to develop projects totaling 3,814 MW on its own and through joint ventures (JVs). These projects include the 800MW Bursar project and the 850MW Ratle project. NHPC is also implementing the Pakal Dul (1,000MW), Kiru (624MW) and Kwar (540MW) hydropower projects in a joint venture in the state. Apart from raising objections on the 330MW project on the river Kishanganga, a tributary of Jhelum, Pakistan had also raised objections on the 1,000 MW Pakal Dul and 48 MW Lower Kalnai hydroelectric projects on River Chenab.
Some of the projects were also delayed due to issues raised by the J&K state government. A case in point being the 624 MW Kiru hydro project. While the union government has approved investment sanction of Rs4,287.59 crore for construction of the project ; the earlier state government had been asking for the Government of India to front its share of equity in the project. In addition, it was asking the union government to finance subordinate loans for the project.
“With the changed political situation, let’s see how the central government goes about it,"" said NHPC’s Joshi.
The reorganization of the state into two Union territories will give the government direct control over J&K’s affairs, which in turn is expected to speed up the process of granting approvals for infrastructure projects.
In a televised address on Thursday, Prime Minister Modi said that the scrapping of Article 370 and Article 35A and the integration with the rest of the country had created an enabling system to make a big push for development, providing good governance and a step-up in Union government spending.
Arunachal Pradesh: back to the state run firms' fold
The other promised front for hydropower is states such as Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh. The total hydropower generation potential of India’s North-Eastern states, and Bhutan, is about 58,000MW. Of this Arunachal Pradesh alone accounts for 50,328MW, the highest in India.
“Doors are open for projects in India’s North East, particularly in states such as Arunachal Pradesh that have a hydropower potential of around 50,000 MW. Hydropower is slated to play a very important role in the development and integration of the North Eastern states with the mainland India,"" said NHPC’s Joshi.
This comes against the backdrop of China’s ambitious $62 billion south-north water diversion scheme of the rivers that feed downstream into the Brahmaputra, known in China as the Yarlung Tsangpo. Of the 2,880km of the Brahmaputra’s length, 1,625km is in Tibet, 918km in India, and 337km in Bangladesh. Of the eight river basins in Arunachal Pradesh, Subansiri, Lohit and Siang are of strategic importance, as they are closer to the border with China.
“With the projects given to private firms not getting constructed, the state government of Arunachal Pradesh wants NHPC to take up these projects. We are interested if there are no legacy burdens,"" added Joshi.
Mint had earlier reported about construction work on a number of hydropower projects awarded to private companies by the Arunachal Pradesh government yet to start, according to the Central Electricity Authority, India’s apex power sector planning body. Also, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) in its earlier report, Performance Audit on Capacity Expansion in Hydro Power Sector by CPSEs (central public sector enterprises), tabled in Parliament, said the power ministry needs to instruct state governments that the allocation of such projects above 100 MW needs to be “fair, transparent and competitive"".
""There is no other way to put it. The private sector has terribly failed in constructing hydropower projects in India and particularly Arunachal Pradesh. Everyone jumped in, thinking that it was a gold rush,"" said a former chief executive of a private hydropower firm requesting anonymity.
Making hydropower affordable
The NDA government has also approved a slew of measures under the hydro policy including providing renewable energy status for large hydel projects and new funding provisions. Earlier, hydro projects up to 25 MW capacity were considered as renewables and were eligible for various incentives like financial assistance and cheaper credit. With the government's decision, hydro projects above 25 MW can also avail the benefits.
“Hydropower has been reclassified as renewable power. This will help in green financing,"" said NHPC’s Joshi.
The government’s plan is to add hydro capacities of about 45 GW to the renewable energy basket of existing 80 GW which includes solar, wind and small hydro. India is aiming 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022. With addition of large hydro to clean energy segment, India is poised to have 225 GW of renewable energy by 2022.
At present, hydro power tariff is expensive than other sources. Discoms are reluctant to sign Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for hydro power due to higher tariff, particularly, in the initial years. With the new measures, large hydro projects (LHPs) would be allowed back loading (reducing) of tariff after increasing project life to 40 years, increasing debt repayment period to 18 years and introducing escalating tariff of 2%. These measure would help rationalise the tariff by hydro power projects.
The average tariff from NHPC’s hydropower projects in Rs3.34 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). In comparison, wind and solar power tariffs plunged to record lows of Rs2.64 per unit and Rs2.44 per unit respectively. However, given the new uncertainties hitting the green energy economy, these tariffs have now firmed up.
“So hydropower is not costly at all. It is very much comparable with solar despite giving 12% free power to the state where the project is located and 1% free power towards local area development fund,"" said Joshi.
This comes at a time when India has brought 26.4 million new electricity consumers to its old which according to Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) is the largest expansion of electricity access in the mankind’s history. In an indication of growing appetite for electricity in India, the country’s per capita electricity consumption has reached 1189 kilowatt-hour (kWh) as compared to a global average of 3600 kWh. According to the government, the electricity demand in the country grew by 6.9% in the last quarter."

London: A power cut lasting up to an hour hit parts of Britain including areas of London on Friday evening, snarling rail services, knocking out traffic lights and disrupting an airport during the rush hour.
Passengers were shut out of some of the country’s busiest train stations because of overcrowding and hundreds of thousands of people were left without power.
National Grid, which owns the electricity transmission system in England and Wales, said there had been ""issues"" with two power generators and the problems had now been resolved.
However the disruption caused was expected to last for the rest of the day because the outage occurred during one of the busiest periods of the week, with many people heading home for the weekend.
""Being evacuated off a train after 2 hours stranded in the dark in a tunnel. Like a bad movie,"" said Anna Stansfeld, a trainee medic, on Twitter.
Britain's transport police, which described the power cut as unprecedented, said officers were asked to help as rail services were suspended and customers on some train lines were being advised not to travel.
London’s Euston and Kings Cross stations, which are two of the busiest stations in the city and serve the north of England as well as some suburban lines, were closed because of overcrowding caused by the cancellations and delays.
Members of the public posted images on social media, which showed the tube network in the darkness and people having to use their mobile phones as torches.
Train services in and out of London, including Thameslink, Southern and Gatwick Express were facing delays and cancellations. National Rail said a large number of train services had been affected.
Transport for London said the Victoria line on the city's underground system had been suspended and warned people to take extra care when using the roads because some traffic lights were not working.
A hospital in the town of Ipswich said its back-up generator had failed.
Western Power Distribution which serves the Midlands, South West and Wales said about 500,000 customers were affected. Northern Powergrid, which serves the North East, said 110,000 of its customers lost power, affecting the airport and metro system of the region's biggest city, Newcastle.
Those impacted lost power for up to an hour, according to local electricity distributors.
The power cut added a moment of darkness to months of political drama over the country's exit from the European Union.
""Was that #powercut someone attempting to fix Britain by turning it off and on again?"" joked Twitter-user Emma Clarke.
""Country having a practice for no deal Brexit #powercut,"" joked another Twitter user, referring to the potential economic disruption if the country leaves the bloc at the end of October without a withdrawal deal.
The power cut occurred hours after Sajid Javid, the new finance minister in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government, visited a National Grid training centre on Friday.

India plans to help set up a global electricity grid that may initially aim to link countries such as Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam with the sub-continent as part of an evolving energy security architecture.
The proposals will be presented at the second general assembly of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) to be held in New Delhi from 30 October to 2 November, said power and new and renewable energy minister Raj Kumar Singh.
“What we are talking about is a grid connection running east to west or west to east as you have it. If you have that, then you don’t need any storage because the Sun is always shining somewhere,"" Singh said in an interview on Friday.
India has been playing a key role in creating a new energy security architecture with some of its neighbours to counter China’s Belt and Road initiative that is aimed at connecting countries across Asia, Africa, and Europe. India has been supplying power to Bangladesh and Nepal and has been championing a South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) electricity grid to meet electricity demand in the region.
ISA, the first treaty-based international government organization headquartered in India, has become the country’s calling card on climate change and is increasingly being viewed as a foreign policy tool, especially with India and France front-ending efforts to set up the ISA.
“In fact, the Saarc grid can be a part of it. We have to connect Myanmar (with the grid) now because it needs power. We have to connect Sri Lanka (with the grid) because Sri Lanka needs power….Saarc minus Pakistan interconnectivity is going to be a reality. It will take time. We already have electricity grid connectivity with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh,"" Singh said.
“We are looking at furthering these grid connections to the east. I have had this discussion in the ministry. We will be extending it east. After Myanmar, we will go to Thailand. Maybe then you can cross into Cambodia, Laos, and go to Vietnam. So, the possibility is there,"" the minister said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had pitched for a global electricity grid while inaugurating the first general assembly of the International Solar Alliance in October 2018.
The International Solar Alliance initially envisaged a group of 121 sunshine countries situated between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn as its members. However, Modi had announced the “universalization"" of membership with all United Nations members eligible for ISA membership.
“The Prime Minister gave us a vision when he inaugurated the last ISA. The vision is ‘one-world, one-sun, one-grid.’ That vision is so forward looking....So, we can use that solar energy here. It’s only a question of transmission,"" said Singh.
India has pitched International Solar Alliance as a counterweight to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or Opec, with the crude oil importers calling for a global consensus on “responsible pricing"" amid rising global prices.
“What I intend to do is to present this possibility before the countries to our east when we meet in the second assembly of ISA. This is a possibility that is a win-win for everybody,"" Singh said.
The plans come against the backdrop of India pushing for cross-border energy trade. Energy diplomacy is a key part of Modi’s South Asia-focused neighbourhood-first policy.
Mint reported on 27 June 2018 about China and Pakistan showing interest in becoming members of the alliance.
“As far as Pakistan is concerned, the hard reality is that their support of terrorism continues. So, I don’t see any actual possibility of us getting into any such tie-ups with Pakistan and as a practical possibility happening in the near future. So, that’s why I am looking east,"" Singh said and added, “And if I have to look west, then for a short distance I will have to look at an under-sea link that maybe viable till Oman.""
Mint reported on 13 August on how International Solar Alliance may see the number of inducted countries who have signed its framework agreement touch 100 nations at its second general assembly, from the 76 countries who are signatories to the landmark pact."
14,2019-08-29,PowerGrid,"The order limits the liability of discoms to the extent of their usage of the green energy corridorOn the positive side, power discoms will not be unfairly charged for the capacities they are not utilizing

Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd’s investors shrugged off the adverse tariff ruling on the renewable energy transmission corridor resulting in a gain of 1.8% in the stock from 9 August when the order was issued by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission. The order limits the liability of power distribution companies (discoms) to the extent of their usage of the green energy corridor, according to JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd.
Theoretically, the latest order crimps Power Grid’s realizations as it will have to bear the complete project cost from the date of commissioning, irrespective of the utilization levels. The tariff order pertains to the 8,900 megawatts transmission system with an estimated cost of  ₹7,041 crore. Of this, around  ₹2,520 crore has been approved under the regulated tariff mechanism to Power Grid.
To evacuate renewable energy from power plants that are being built in different states, the Centre approved a plan to construct a suitable transmission system, termed as green energy corridor.
On the positive side, power discoms will not be unfairly charged for the capacities they are not utilizing. This is important against the backdrop of the general slowdown in renewable energy capacity additions.
The regulator balanced the order by allowing Power Grid to delay new transmission capacities to match the renewable energy installations, said analysts at JM Financial. “Hence, we do not find any material impact on Power Grid. The approved capital expenditure will take another 18-24 months to come up and Power Grid will plan capex to match generation and thus ensure no impact to its financials,"" they said in a note.
Despite this, the episode is a cautionary tale for investors tracking the company’s growth trajectory.
As capital expenditure moderated from recent highs stoking growth concerns, Power Grid cited green energy corridors as a growth avenue. Given the government’s renewable energy capacity addition targets, the opportunity still exits but is not shaping up as expected, as the latest order illustrates.
Similar to NTPC Ltd, Power Grid is allowed to earn a fixed return on equity invested for the projects built under the regulated tariff mechanism. Hence, the capacity additions are crucial for growth momentum.
The firm expects to capitalize projects worth  ₹20,000-25,000 crore in FY20. This is notably lower than the additions in FY16-FY18. According to Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd, the projects in hand provide enough visibility for  ₹18,000-20,000 crore annual capitalization for the next two-three years. Beyond that, Power Grid will be “hit by private sector aggression in a stable to declining transmission projects’ market pie"", warn analysts at Jefferies India.
Power Grid is trying to explore intra-state transmission capex and railways electrification, but has had limited success till now. Perhaps the undemanding valuations and healthy dividend pay-outs are limiting the downside for the stock, which trades at 1.5% FY21 estimated book value and offers a 5% dividend yield."
13,2019-09-11,PowerGrid,"The issue has assumed greater importance as the country now has an integrated national power gridIn July 2012, massive power transmission failures had left around 700 million people without electricity

NEW DELHI :
India’s power sector is facing cyberattacks, with at least 30 events reported daily, said people aware of the development on condition of anonymity.
A majority of the attacks originate from China, Singapore, Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries. As such, there are growing concerns that the country’s power infrastructure could be the next target of terrorists looking to cripple India’s economy.
Some high- profile cyberattacks include the November 2017 malware attack on THDC Ltd’s Tehri dam in Uttarakhand, the May 2017 ransomware attack on West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd (WBSEDCL), the February 2018 attack on a Rajasthan discom website, and the March 2018 attack on Haryana discoms in which the commercial billing software of the highest paying industrial customers was hacked, according to information reviewed by Mint. The National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre also reported several vulnerabilities in the power utilities of states in May 2018.
Ransomware typically logs users out of their own systems and asks them to pay a ransom if they want to access the encrypted data.
India faced massive power transmission failures in July 2012, which left around 700 million people without electricity.
“Tehri’s computer was attached to the power grid’s computer. The threat was eliminated as there was an air gap. If the attack was successful it could have even opened the doors of the dam,"" said a senior government official.
The issue has assumed greater importance as the country now has an integrated national power grid, with south India joining the national electricity grid in January 2014.
“The hackers even demanded ransom from WBSEDCL, but it was refused. Both West Bengal and Haryana discarded the old systems and put in place a new system. Beyond these, there has been no reported incident of cyberattack on the Indian power sector. There are attacks everyday, but people don’t report. The maximum number of attacks happen on the energy utility sector,"" said the official quoted above.
There are five regional grids in India—northern, southern, eastern, north-eastern, and western. A grid collapse is the worst-case scenario for any transmission utility. When this happens, states that draw power from a particular network go without electricity.
“The grid at the 132 kv (kilovolts) level that is managed by the states is pretty insecure. Grids between 220 kv and 765 kv are safe,"" the official said.
“The attacks come from everywhere. A majority of the attacks come from China, Singapore, Russia, and the CIS countries,"" he said.
The Intelligence Bureau had warned the government in 2009 that substations and regional load despatch centres, both key components of power network, could be targeted.
Substations play a critical role in the generation, transmission, and distribution of power. The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) coordinates efforts on cybersecurity issues and is tasked with responding to cyberattacks, the National Technical Research Organisation is the elite technical intelligence agency.
“These types of problems keep on happening and CERT-In keeps on issuing advisories. Application of safeguards is a 24x7 affair. It is an evolving technology. As and when new problem areas surface, new remedial measures are taken in the affected sectors,"" said a spokesperson of the ministry of electronics and information technology.
Queries emailed to the spokespersons of ministries of home affairs and power, besides THDC, WBSEDCL, Haryana discom, and PGCIL remained unanswered till press time.

12,2019-09-12,PowerGrid,"These massive green parks will cost around $2 billion eachMega renewable energy power parks will be set up in states such as Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh

New Delhi: As part of India’s energy security efforts, state-run companies present in the conventional power space such as NTPC Ltd, NLC India Ltd (earlier known as Neyveli Lignite Corp. Ltd) ,and Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd (PGCIL) are being roped in to build massive green energy parks.
Setting up such parks will provide heft to India at the world stage specifically in the view of a rapidly evolving global energy landscape and a fundamental change in the global investment culture. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be attending the UN Climate Action Summit on 23 September in New York.
These proposed ultra mega renewable energy power parks (UMREPP) of 2,000 megawatts (MW) involving a cost of around $2 billion each, are to be set up in wind and solar resource rich states such as Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, according to a government note reviewed by Mint.
The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s push may also see participation from other hydropower public sector units (PSUs) such as North Eastern Electric Power Corp. Ltd (Neepco), NHPC Ltd, Tehri Hydro Development Corp. Ltd (THDC), SJVN Ltd (SJVNL), and Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC).
Mint reported on Thursday about the central government plan of making state-run companies build massive clean energy parks to help developers achieve economies of scale and further bring down solar and wind power tariffs.
With built-in incentives to ensure states and operators are invested in the success of the parks, India’s largest power sector lenders such as Power Finance Corp. Ltd (PFC) and REC Ltd may also participate in the push to cut India’s dependence on fossil fuels.
“The effort is to make land and decimated transmission available to renewable energy developers aiming for catalysing the growth of renewable energy in the country,"" Anand Kumar, secretary in the ministry of new and renewable energy told Mint.
To ensure that these plans don’t meet the fate of ultra-mega power project programme, attempted to create large power generation capacities at a single location, the preliminary meetings for setting up such large clean energy parks under the existing Solar Park scheme, has also been attended by the principal energy secretaries and principal revenue secretary of the above mentioned states. Also, the chairman and managing directors of the CPSUs have also been made a part of the initial discussions.
This assumes importance given the standoff between the centre and the Andhra Pradesh government over reworking power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed by the previous TDP government for wind and solar power.
Given the delays in land allocation, the centre also made the district commissioners of solar radiation rich districts such as Barmer, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and Kutch attend the preparatory meetings for such large clean energy parks.
To get states on board and facilitate the requisite clearances, state governments will be paid Rs0.02 per unit of electricity generated from the projects over their lifetime. Also, the SPVs will be paid park development and operations and maintenance (O&M) charges by the developers, and Rs0.02 per unit on the electricity generated over their lifetime. The operators that will set up renewable energy projects such as wind or solar inside the clean energy park will be selected through tariff-based competitive bids.
Even as the US withdrew from the Paris climate deal, clean energy projects now account for more than a fifth of India’s installed power generation capacity."

Mumbai: Global consumer goods firm Unilever on Monday said it has achieved 100% renewable electricity usage at its offices, factories and other facilities across five continents in line with its target to become a carbon neutral company by 2030.
The company said 38% of grid electricity was supplied through corporate Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and green electricity tariffs. “Where it has not been feasible to do this, Unilever has purchased Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) – openly-traded certificates linked to renewable electricity generation,"" Unilever said in a statement.
The British-Dutch firm, which makes items ranging from soaps to other home care products, said the achievement was a significant step towards its target to become a carbon neutral company before 2030. “Unilever has worked with partners around the world to generate renewable electricity at its own sites, with solar power in use at Unilever facilities in 18 countries,"" it added.
According to Marc Engel, chief supply chain officer, Unilever, climate emergency is one of the most urgent challenges and the company has worked hard to accelerate the delivery of 100% renewable energy targets. “There is more work to do, but we hope that today’s announcement will inspire further action elsewhere and help to prove that it is possible to combat the climate crisis and hold global warming at 1.5 Degrees Celsius. Renewable is doable,"" Engel said in the statement."

A surprise corporate tax cut will lay groundwork for “second order benefits"" for India’s economy over the next several months or even years, while providing a favorable backdrop for broader stock selection, according to BNP Paribas Securities India Pvt.
The brokerage has re-balanced its “quality list"" of stocks again after having made adjustments a day before the Indian government reduced corporate tax rates on Sept. 20. This time around it added companies ranging from large-cap stocks such as Britannia Industries Ltd. to smaller names including Manappuram Finance Ltd., Abhiram Eleswarapu, head of equity research at BNP Paribas Securities, wrote in a note published on Sept. 24.
“The rally in stocks after the tax reduction has provided immediate money in the hands of investors,"" he said by phone. “It provides confidence that the government is willing to do whatever it takes and will provide equity investors a chance to broaden the basket of stocks.""
India’s surprise tax cut came after economic growth in the April-June quarter slumped to its lowest level in six years, hitting the nation’s smaller stocks the hardest. While the implied valuations of 10-15 Nifty stocks are still at a premium to historical averages, the medium and smallcap indexes are still below their means, according to the BNP report.
Since the tax cut, mid cap stocks have jumped 9% while small cap names gained 7%. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has climbed 8.3% in the last three sessions.
The gains show that the “first round impact"" of the tax cut on company earnings has been factored in, according to Eleswarapu.
Here are the key insights from the report
-Overweight India; retain Sensex target of 40,500 by December which is 3.6% above Tuesday’s close
-Tax cut to widen fiscal deficit by about 0.75% of GDP though it could be partly recovered through higher collections, divestment

New Delhi: In an attempt to facilitate its overseas foray, state run Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) plans to change its article of association to do business in solar rich countries.
The public sector unit (PSU) hopes to land overseas business under the aegis of International Solar Alliance (ISA). ISA, the first treaty-based international government organization headquartered in India will see the number of inducted countries that have signed its framework agreement reach 100 nations at its second general assembly to be held from 30 October—2 November.
“There was a plan earlier to float SECI Videsh on the lines of ONGC Videsh. However, it lost traction. Lets see, how does the plan unfolds this time,"" said a senior Indian government official requesting anonymity.
SECI has been leading the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’ efforts rejig its energy mix in favour of green energy sources by conducting the bid process. This has helped India emerge as a clean energy champion. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also recently gifted $1 million ‘Gandhi Solar Park’ to the United Nations when he attended the Climate Action Summit 2019 in New York.
“The plan to facilitate SECI’s overseas foray is at a preliminary stage,"" said a second Indian government official who also did not want to be named.
The International Solar Alliance initially envisaged a group of 121 sunshine countries situated between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn as its members. However, later all United Nations members were made eligible for ISA membership. With 76 countries currently signatories to the landmark agreement, ISA has become India’s calling card on climate change and is increasingly being viewed as a foreign policy tool, especially with India and France front-ending efforts to set up the ISA.
At present, India has an installed power generation capacity of 357,875MW, of which around 22%, or 80.47 GW, is generated through clean energy projects. Of this solar and wind comprises 29.55 GW and 36.37 GW respectively. With addition of large hydro projects to clean energy segment, India is poised to have 225 GW of renewable energy by 2022.
Queries emailed to Jatindra Nath Swain, managing director, SECI and a spokesperson for India’s ministry of new and renewable energy on Sunday evening remained unanswered.
India also plans to help set up a global electricity grid that may initially aim to link countries such as Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam with the sub-continent as part of an evolving energy security architecture. The proposals for the same will be presented at the second general assembly of the ISA.
There are also new plans in the works. Mint reported on 12 September about the central government’ plan of making state-run companies build massive clean energy parks to help developers achieve economies of scale and further bring down solar and wind power tariffs.

New Delhi: As part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government's playbook of creating a new energy security architecture for its neighbours, India has installed smart LED (light-emitting diode) streetlights in Maldives and Bangladesh; under the aegis of India’s ministry of external affairs (MEA).
These strategic projects undertaken by state-owned Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) will help Maldives and Bangladesh illuminate their streets, reduce their peak electricity demand, help in energy savings and reduce carbon dioxide emission. The South Asia-focused neighbourhood-first policy is an initiative of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a cornerstone of his government’s foreign policy.
“We have just completed the entire Male street lights. Recently we did a joint investment in Maldives for around 2500 street lights. We are doing this with MEA,"" Saurabh Kumar, managing director of EESL told Mint.
India has been trying to draw the strategically situated archipelago deeper into its orbit, away from the embrace of strategic rival China. Ties between India and the Maldives have altered dramatically especially after the election of Ibrahim Mohammed Solih as president in September. This came after tensions between India and the Maldives over the latter’s close ties with India’s strategic rival China during the tenure of Solih’s predecessor Abdullah Yameen.
India has been playing a key role in creating a new energy ecosystem with some of its neighbours to counter China’s Belt and Road initiative that is aimed at connecting countries across Asia, Africa, and Europe. India has been supplying power to Bangladesh and Nepal and has also been championing a global electricity grid that may initially aim to link countries such as Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam with the sub-continent.
“So we have done a bit of work under a MEA grant in Bangladesh. It was a small project involving 500 street lights. Now we are trying to push in South East Asia—Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia,"" Kumar added.
This comes in the backdrop of Bangladesh’ prime minister Sheikh Hasina’ ongoing visit to India. Ties between the two countries have shown remarkable warmth and growth since India’s parliament ratified the 1974 land boundary pact in 2015 and the two countries signed a fresh agreement. Bangladesh is the recipient of $ 8 billion in lines of credit from India in the past seven years — the largest amount in lines of credit extended to any country by India.
India’ energy diplomacy initiatives range from cross-border electricity trade to supplying petroleum products and setting up liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals. Apart from building power projects in Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh, India already has power grid links with Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar and Bangladesh, and plans to develop power transmission links with Sri Lanka.
EESL is leading India’s ambitious energy efficiency programme that seeks to reduce carbon emissions as part of the country’s climate change goals.
As part of India’s strategy to combat climate change, EESL commissioned one crore smart LED streetlights across the country under the world’s largest streetlight replacement programme, thereby helping avoid 1,119.40 megawatt (MW) of peak electricity demand. These streetlights are illuminating 2.7 lakh km of roads, resulting in annual energy savings of 6.71 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) and helping reduce 4.63 million tons of carbon dioxide emission."

NEW DELHI :
The Union government is exploring the option of an overhead electricity link with Sri Lanka as part of India’s strategy to create a new-energy ecosystem for the neighbourhood against the backdrop of China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative.
The overhead line is being considered after the earlier proposal to set up an undersea power transmission link to supply power to the island nation turned out to be prohibitively expensive.
The earlier plan involved state-run Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd setting up a link for 1,000MW between India and Sri Lanka, of which 30km would be under the sea. The transmission link was to run from Madurai in Tamil Nadu to Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka’s north-central province.
“We have to connect Sri Lanka because Sri Lanka needs power. The undersea link will be expensive. They are talking about an overhead transmission link,"" said a senior official of the Union government, requesting anonymity.
Cross-border energy trade is a key part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s South Asia-focused neighbourhood-first policy. The electricity link is part of India’s strategy to negate the growing influence of strategic rival China in the Indian Ocean region and South Asia. In recent years, China has tried to co-opt Sri Lanka into its ambitious One Belt One Road initiative, a programme to invest billions of dollars in infrastructure projects, including railways, ports and power grids, across Asia, Africa and Europe.
Mint reported in November 2009 about the Sri Lankan government questioning the long-term feasibility of the project, which is meant to enhance economic and political ties between the neighbours. The earlier proposal also faced opposition from the Tamil Nadu government.
State-run Ceylon Electricity Board has an installed power generation capacity of 35.8 gigawatts (GW). India has an installed power generation capacity of 360.45 GW, with the national grid capable of transferring 99,000 MW of electricity from any corner of the country.
Experts have welcomed the move of exploring the possibility of establishing an overhead electricity link with Sri Lanka.
“Over the last few years, India has become a well-coordinated and cohesive national market, which has helped tide over the disparity in demand and supply among states and regions in the country. The benefit of this transition that we have witnessed in our nation can be offered to our neighbours as well with the integration of Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka,"" said Prabhajit Sarkar, managing director and chief executive officer, Power Exchange India Ltd.
India has been supplying power to Bangladesh and Nepal, and has also been championing a global electricity grid that may initially aim to link countries, such as Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, with the sub-continent.
India’s energy diplomacy initiatives range from cross-border electricity trade to supplying petroleum products and setting up liquefied natural gas terminals.
“Participation in a common power market will lead to better utilization of generation assets, wider benefit of efficient price discovery, and reduced counter-party search and transaction efforts for all participants.

3,2019-11-28,PowerGrid,"The company won seven of the 13 project bids it has participated in, implying a win rate of more than 50%Power Grid did not reveal the project values

Shares of Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd have underperformed over the last two years, as the moderation in investments in the transmission sector resulted in a slowing down in order flow for the company.
Compared to a 5.9% gain in the Nifty 500 index, the Power Grid stock lost 7% in the last two years. As a result, price-earnings valuations have fallen below 10 times, and the stock has a dividend yield of 5%.
But things are gradually picking up. Last week, the company said it won two intra-state transmission system projects under tariff-based competitive bidding.
Power Grid did not reveal the project values. But an earlier communication with investors pegs the project wins so far in FY20 at  ₹10,030 crore, with the value of total projects in hand adding up to  ₹66,000 crore.
Encouragingly, the company won seven of the 13 project bids it has participated in, implying a win rate of more than 50%.
This should assuage investor concerns about Power Grid’s ability to win in competitive project bidding.
According to the company, the aggregate annual levelized tariff stands at  ₹666 crore for the  ₹6,599 crore worth of projects it won under the competitive bidding route.
In FY19, Power Grid derived superior returns from the operating projects it won under competitive bidding compared to the returns it would otherwise have made under the regulated business model, shows an analysis by SBICAP Securities Ltd.
This was made possible by low funding costs and Power Grid’s execution capabilities.
Expertise in transmission projects is helping the company execute projects at lower capex (vis-à-vis the stipulated levels), helping it optimize returns.
Of course, there are projects which have seen cost overruns. But there are more hits than misses till now. The company’s capex target for FY20 is lower than the previous two fiscal years, which analysts say point to prospects of better returns on projects.
“For these projects, to earn the threshold returns, it is imperative that they are executed at 45-60% of the original estimated cost. Power Grid has, in the past, been able to implement projects at a fraction of the estimated capex,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities said in a note."
2,2019-12-22,PowerGrid,"Adani Transmission continues to see a strong project pipelineTransmission projects, evacuating green energy, and interstate and intra-state lines are seen as big opportunities

The divergence in performance could not be starker. While shares of Adani Transmission Ltd have galloped 65% in the last two years, those of industry leader Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd languished, losing 8%.
As investments in the transmission sector slowed, investors shied away from Power Grid fearing a project and capacity addition slowdown. But that was not the case with Adani Transmission. The firm continues to see robust expansion in asset base.
In the last three fiscal years, on an average, Adani Transmission has added about  ₹5,500 crore worth of projects every year to its asset base, clocking an average annual growth of 36%.
It currently operates 16 transmission projects and eight more are under construction. Besides, on 14 December, the company said it received a letter of intent to build and operate a transmission project in Maharashtra.
Adani Transmission continues to see a strong project pipeline. Transmission projects, evacuating green energy, and interstate and intra-state lines are seen as big opportunities. “There is a very healthy pipeline for at least next four to five years,"" the management said at a recent analysts meet.
According to Rohit Natarajan, analyst at Antique Stock Broking Ltd, the company sees opportunities worth  ₹2 trillion in the transmission sector. With around 40% market share among private sector participants, and significant amount of capacities already operational, Adani Transmission is well placed to keep up the growth momentum.
The question, however, is how can the company boost the value of its projects. This can be done by tactically raising the debt component at cheaper rates after commissioning a project. With this, Adani Transmission is not only freeing up its funds, but is also optimizing project return on equity (RoE).
To be sure, this strategy has served the company well and it continues to adopt it. But in a business like power transmission, where project returns are fixed at the contract awarding stage and owners do not have much to do with the asset after commissioning, another way to reward shareholders is by improving the asset value.
Adani Transmission did so when it sold a 25.1% stake in the Mumbai power distribution business this month at an enterprise value (EV) of  ₹16,800 crore (excludes a transmission line associated with the business). According to Antique Stock Broking, Adani Transmission had bought the business at an EV of  ₹12,300 crore in FY18. Apart from value appreciation, the stake sale also takes care of the near-term capital investment needs of the business.
But this is a one-of-its-kind sale the company did till now. More such sales will give fillip to valuations. “They are doing it, but it is not happening in a big way. Progress is slow,"" said an analyst, requesting anonymity."
1,2019-12-24,PowerGrid,"ABB India will now focus on new-age products and services, with only a 7-8% exposure to projectsFor September quarter, revenues excluding PG segment, rose 17% year-on-year to  ₹1,746 crore

ABB India Ltd’s shares fell 6.7% since 19 December. From 23 December, the stock valuation mirrors all businesses except the power grid (PG) segment, which has been spun off into a separate entity—ABB Power Products and Systems India Ltd (APPSIL).
ABB India will now focus on new-age products and services, with only a 7-8% exposure to projects. It is in line with the Swiss-Swedish parent’s global restructuring to exit the PG business and make it a pure play on automation and digitalization.
Investors have already seen the gains. For September quarter, revenues excluding PG segment, rose 17% year-on-year to  ₹1,746 crore. This was helped by the motion and electrification segments that together comprise 75% of the business.
Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd estimates the return on invested capital of the residual business to grow from 21.3% in calendar year 2018 to 30% in 2021.
That said, while order flows grew 5% year-on-year during the September quarter, there may be volatility in the near term due to the economic slowdown. After all, the restructured ABB India will now have to tap opportunities from smart cities’ projects and private sector enterprises such as automobiles, which could be weighed down by the slowdown.
Meanwhile, ABB India investors get one share of APPSIL for every five held. The PG business revenue was marginally down in the September quarter and profit fell by 23% year-on-year. The PG segment’s 41% jump in order flows may play out favourably when the entity lists in the near future."
0,2019-12-29,PowerGrid,"DoT has made it clear that the AGR order will apply to all licencees, including companies such as GAIL, RailTel, and Power GridThe DoT has sought  ₹1.72 trillion in past statutory dues from state-owned gas utility GAIL India following the Supreme Court's AGR ruling

NEW DELHI :
After sending out notices to firms such as gas utility GAIL for crores of rupees in past dues, the Department of Telecommunications has said that any relief to non-telecom companies from payment of enhanced levies can come only from the Supreme Court.
The Telecom Department is current ""examining"" the replies given by the state-owned non-telecom corporations on the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues, a senior official said.
""They have sent their replies, which we are examining. We believe that they will have to go to Supreme Court to seek notification or clarification on whether they are included or not included in this (Supreme Court order). That is for them to seek,"" the Telecom Department official told PTI.
There are certain cases where players were parties in the court and in those cases the companies are bound by the court order. Some parties have also filed review petition, the official noted.
""Then there were others who were not parties, they will have to take a call because our assessment is that it will be applicable...we are examining the issue but in our assessment they will probably have to go to SC to seek a clarification,"" the official added.
As it is, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other telecom companies owe the government nearly  ₹1.47 trillion in past statutory dues. These AGR liabilities arose after the Supreme Court in October this year upheld the government's position on including revenue from non-telecommunication businesses for calculating the annual AGR of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fees to the exchequer.
The apex court allowed three months to the affected companies to cough up the amounts due to the government.
The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has meanwhile made it clear that the AGR order will apply to all licencees, including companies such as GAIL, RailTel, and Power Grid.
As things stand today, such players, despite a smaller telecom exposure, may have to pay liabilities computed on their entire revenue.
Non-telcos, such as internet service providers (ISPs), had argued that DoT has unnecessarily imposed the order on internet service providers, many of which are run by entrepreneurs in smaller cities and towns. It had also sought intervention of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to resolve this issue.
The DoT has sought  ₹1.72 trillion in past statutory dues from state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd following the Supreme Court's AGR ruling.
DoT sent a letter to GAIL last month seeking  ₹1,72,655 crore in dues on IP-1 and IP-2 licences as well as Internet Service Provider (ISP) licence. In response, GAIL has told DoT that it owes nothing more than what it has already paid to the government.
Besides GAIL, DoT is also seeking  ₹1.25 trillion from PowerGrid which had both a national long-distance as well as an internet licence. PowerGrid says it has an AGR of  ₹3,566 crore since 2006-07 and after adding penalty it comes to  ₹22,168 crore."
